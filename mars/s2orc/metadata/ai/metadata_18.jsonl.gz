Traditional IPC based on port numbers and payload pattern recognition are no longer effective because current applications can dynamically change port numbers and cipher their contents.

We find that the most effective model, in accuracy and efficiency, is one where the sentential context is computed once and the results of that computation are combined with the computation of each token in sequence to compute the verbalization. This model allows for a great deal of flexibility in terms of representing the context, and also allows us to integrate tagging and segmentation into the process.These models perform very well overall, but occasionally they will predict wildly inappropriate verbalizations, such as reading 3 cm as three kilometers. Although rare, such verbalizations are a major issue for TTS applications.

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms are often employed for inference in such models.

However, highlighting of image parts (e.g., an eye) cannot capture the relevance of a specific feature value for a class (e.g., that the eye is wide open). Furthermore, highlighting cannot convey whether the classification depends on the mere presence of parts or on a specific spatial relation between them. Consequently, we present an approach that is capable of explaining a classifier's decision in terms of logic rules obtained by the Inductive Logic Programming system Aleph.

Spectral anisotropy features are extracted from the patches and used to train a non-linear Support Vector Machine.

Proxy models are routinely developed to generate spatially-varying output such as field pressures and saturations, or well responses such as production rates and bottom-hole pressures. In this study, a machine learning approach is adopted to predict reservoir responses based on injector well locations. The proxy developed in this work is trained to reproduce reservoir-wide objective functions, i.e., total profit, cumulative oil/gas produced, or net CO2 stored. Because of the geological complexity of most reservoirs, slight adjustments in injector well locations could yield dramatic changes in the objective function responses. Hence, most proxies do not include well locations as inputs in their formulation. This complex relationship between well locations and reservoir-wide responses makes non-parametric, machine learning-based methods an attractive option. We introduce a machine learning approach in which the primary predictors are physical well locations, and the primary response is a defined objective function such as NPV. The complexity of the response surface with respect to well locations necessitates that we augment the predictor variables with well-to-well pairwise connectivities, injector block permeabilities and porosities, and initial injector block saturations. Introducing well-to-well connectivities yields significant improvements in prediction accuracy. Connectivities are represented by \u2018diffusive times of flight\u2019 of the pressure front, which is computed using the Fast Marching Method. A handful of training observations are obtained from numerical reservoir simulations. The Extreme Gradient Boosting method is then used to build an intelligent model for making predictions given any set of observations. The proposed approach is demonstrated using five synthetic case studies: i) a homogeneous reservoir waterflood, ii) a channelized reservoir waterflood, iii) a 20-model ensemble waterflood, iv) a CO2 flood in a heterogeneous reservoir, v) a CO2 flood in a heterogeneous reservoir with complex topography.

Even though revolutionizing image analysis in current biology, some routine and many advanced tasks are either not supported or require programming skills of the researcher. This represents a significant obstacle in many biology laboratories. We have developed a tool, Enhanced CellClassifier, which circumvents this obstacle. Enhanced CellClassifier starts from images analyzed by CellProfiler, and allows multi-class classification using a Support Vector Machine algorithm. Training of objects can be done by clicking directly \"on the microscopy image\" in several intuitive training modes. Many routine tasks like out-of focus exclusion and well summary are also supported. Classification results can be integrated with other object measurements including inter-object relationships. This makes a detailed interpretation of the image possible, allowing the differentiation of many complex phenotypes. For the generation of the output, image, well and plate data are dynamically extracted and summarized. The output can be generated as graphs, Excel-files, images with projections of the final analysis and exported as variables.

In this paper, we introduce a biologically inspired and fully unsupervised neurocomputational approach that incorporates key neurophysiological and anatomical cortical properties, including columnar organization, spontaneous micro-columnar formation, adaptation to contextual activations and Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) produced by means of partial N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) depolarization. Its feature abstraction capabilities show promising phonetic invariance and generalization attributes. Our model improves the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for monosyllabic, disyllabic and trisyllabic word classification tasks in the presence of environmental disturbances such as white noise, reverberation, and pitch and voice variations. Furthermore, our approach emphasizes potential self-organizing cortical principles achieving improvement without any kind of optimization guidance which could minimize hypothetical loss functions by means of\u2013for example\u2013backpropagation. Thus, our computational model outperforms multiresolution spectro-temporal auditory feature representations using only the statistical sequential structure immerse in the phonotactic rules of the input stream.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6555517", "pubmed_id": "31173613", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0217966", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2948250022", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["38376601", "2044703", "26114540", "16595947", "24093935", "8017", "24342102", "22663997", "16468902", "7514994", "26145972", "7578366", "183684003", "11783024", "16658868", "2439102", "4430702", "17055992", "7136759", "14739367", "19849396", "215050138", "209575762", "13422510", "13561175", "215582949", "4828576", "20625155", "8473175", "17966998", "6844431", "18417341", "519998", "2206095", "17148146", "7721227", "206775459", "198168767", "22356789", "32544899", "24259950", "4894952", "25945581", "3937908", "6644892", "961425", "12219023", "26926156", "16185790", "6166088", "11138234", "3634811", "10050777", "18826087"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:182947180"}

The process of video generation should be divided according to these intrinsic difficulties. In this study, we focus on the motion and appearance information as two important orthogonal components of a video, and propose Flow-and-Texture-Generative Adversarial Networks (FTGAN) consisting of FlowGAN and TextureGAN. In order to avoid a huge annotation cost, we have to explore a way to learn from unlabeled data. Thus, we employ optical flow as motion information to generate videos. FlowGAN generates optical flow, which contains only the edge and motion of the videos to be begerated. On the other hand, TextureGAN specializes in giving a texture to optical flow generated by FlowGAN. This hierarchical approach brings more realistic videos with plausible motion and appearance consistency. Our experiments show that our model generates more plausible motion videos and also achieves significantly improved performance for unsupervised action classification in comparison to previous GAN works.

Alternative splicing allows creation of many distinct mature mRNA transcripts from a single gene by utilizing different splice sites. In plants like Arabidopsis thaliana, the most common type of alternative splicing is intron retention. Many studies in the past focus on positional distribution of retained introns (RIs) among different genic regions and their expression regulations, while little systematic classification of RIs from constitutively spliced introns (CSIs) has been conducted using machine learning approaches. We used random forest and support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis kernel function (RBF) to differentiate these two types of introns in Arabidopsis. By comparing coordinates of introns of all annotated mRNAs from TAIR10, we obtained our high-quality experimental data. To distinguish RIs from CSIs, We investigated the unique characteristics of RIs in comparison with CSIs and finally extracted 37 quantitative features: local and global nucleotide sequence features of introns, frequent motifs, the signal strength of splice sites, and the similarity between sequences of introns and their flanking regions. We demonstrated that our proposed feature extraction approach was more accurate in effectively classifying RIs from CSIs in comparison with other four approaches. The optimal penalty parameter C and the RBF kernel parameter in SVM were set based on particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSOSVM).

Several lines of evidence support a role for neuroendocrine system involvement in autoimmunity which may, in part, be genetically determined. Here, we comprehensively investigated variation within eight candidate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis genes and susceptibility to MS. A total of 326 SNPs were investigated in a discovery dataset of 1343 MS cases and 1379 healthy controls of European ancestry using a multi-analytical strategy. Random Forests, a supervised machine-learning algorithm, identified eight intronic SNPs within the corticotrophin-releasing hormone receptor 1 or CRHR1 locus on 17q21.31 as important predictors of MS. On the basis of univariate analyses, six CRHR1 variants were associated with decreased risk for disease following a conservative correction for multiple tests. Independent replication was observed for CRHR1 in a large meta-analysis comprising 2624 MS cases and 7220 healthy controls of European ancestry. Results from a combined meta-analysis of all 3967 MS cases and 8599 controls provide strong evidence for the involvement of CRHR1 in MS.

Popular defensive approaches can be formulated as a (distributionally) robust optimization problem, which minimizes a point estimate'' of worst-case loss derived from either per-datum perturbation or adversary data-generating distribution within certain pre-defined constraints. This point estimate ignores potential test adversaries that are beyond the pre-defined constraints. The model robustness might deteriorate sharply in the scenario of stronger test adversarial data. In this work, a novel robust training framework is proposed to alleviate this issue, Bayesian Robust Learning, in which a distribution is put on the adversarial data-generating distribution to account for the uncertainty of the adversarial data-generating process. The uncertainty directly helps to consider the potential adversaries that are stronger than the point estimate in the cases of distributionally robust optimization. The uncertainty of model parameters is also incorporated to accommodate the full Bayesian framework. We design a scalable Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling strategy to obtain the posterior distribution over model parameters.

However, it is still challenging to identify different land cover classes with polarimetric data. Most of the classification algorithms presented earlier have used a fixed value of polarimetric indexes for segregation of a particular land cover type from other classes. However, the value of these polarimetric indexes may change accordingly with change in observation site, temporal acquisition, environmental conditions, and calibration differences among various systems. Thus, the value of polarimetric indexes for segregation of each land cover type has to be tuned in order to cope with these changes. Therefore, in this paper, a decision-tree-based adaptive land cover classification technique has been proposed for labeling of different clusters to their own classes. The proposed method uses spatial-statistics-based expressions (i.e., median \u201c M\u201d and standard deviation \u201c S\u201d) of best-selected polarimetric indexes on the basis of a separability index criterion for creating the decision boundary among various classes. In order to make the system adaptive in nature, unknown terms have been included in the expressions. Due to the dependence of a developed nonlinear relationship of overall classification accuracy (OA) on large number of unknowns, a genetic algorithm (GA) approach has been used, which provides optimum values of considered polarimetric indexes for automatic segregation of different classes.

Later, their performances are evaluated based on performance measures, viz., true positive, false positive, false negative, true negative, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and RMSE, and finally, a comparison is performed to identify the most efficient model and data set combination. The comparison demonstrated that Random Forest model outperformed others yielding 100% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and zero RMSE on voice and gait training data sets both; Cubist Committees model outperformed others yielding 74.00% accuracy, 69.39% sensitivity, 78.43% specificity, and 0.4582 RMSE on voice testing data set; Random Forest model once again outperformed others yielding 81.66% accuracy, 92.39% sensitivity, 66.67% specificity, and 0.4283 RMSE on gait testing data set.

The data pair deleted is determined by the absolute value of lagrange multiplier from last sampling period.

In our previous research, the 2-D univariate time series based imaging model was derived mathematically to extract the features for further terrain segmentations. The effectiveness of the model was demonstrated in region segmentation of a multispectral image of the Lake Mulargias region in Italy. Due to the nature of remote sensing images such as SAR (synthetic aperture radar) and TM (Thermal Mapper) which are mostly in multi-spectral image stack format, a 2-D Multivariate Vector AR (ARV) time series model with pixel vectors of multiple elements (i.e. 15 elements in the case of TM+SAR remote sensing) are examined. The 2-D system parameter matrix and white noise error covariance matrix are estimated for further classifications. To compute the time series ARV system parameter matrix and estimate the error covariance matrix efficiently, a new method based on modern numerical analysis is developed by introducing the Schur complement matrix, the QR (orthogonal, upper triangular) matrix and the Cholesky factorizations in the ARV model formulation.

In reality, most data is scattered across different organizations and cannot be easily integrated under many legal and practical constraints. Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) was introduced in [1] to improve statistical models under a data federation that allow knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy, and enable complementary knowledge to be transferred in the network. As a result, a target-domain party can build more flexible and powerful models by leveraging rich labels from a source-domain party. However, the excessive computational overhead of the security protocol involved in this model rendered it impractical. In this work, we aim towards enhancing the efficiency and security of existing models for practical collaborative training under a data federation by incorporating Secret Sharing (SS). In literature, only the semi-honest model for Federated Transfer Learning has been considered. In this paper, we improve upon the previous solution, and also allow malicious players who can arbitrarily deviate from the protocol in our FTL model. This is much stronger than the semi-honest model where we assume that parties follow the protocol precisely. We do so using the one of the practical MPC protocol called SPDZ, thus our model can be efficiently extended to any number of parties even in the case of a dishonest majority. In addition, the models evaluated in our setting significantly outperform the previous work, in terms of both runtime and communication cost.

The spectral reflectance and the GST had a stronger contribution to crop classification than the VIs and GLCM textures. A subset of 60 features was selected using the RF-based feature selection (FS) method, and in this subset, the near-infrared reflectance and the image acquired in August (jointing and heading stages) were found to be the best for crop classifica...", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/10106049.2017.1333533", "venue": null, "journal": "Geocarto International", "mag_id": "2621161029", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["4331653", "3325217"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134482656"}

{"paper_id": "25754246", "title": "On Intelligence Science and Recent Progresses", "authors": [{"first": "Zhongzhi", "middle": [], "last": "Shi", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Summary form only given. Intelligence science is a cross-discipline that dedicates to joint research on basic theory and technology of intelligence by brain science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and others. Brain science explores the essence of brain, research on the principle and model of natural intelligence in molecular, cell and behavior level. Cognitive science studies human mental activity, such as perception, learning, memory, thinking, consciousness etc. In order to implement machine intelligence, Artificial intelligence attempts simulation, extension and expansion of human intelligence using artificial methodology and technology. The above three disciplines work together to explore new concept, new theory, new methodology. It will be successful and create a brilliant future in the 21 century. Brain science points out that perceptive lobes have special function separately, the occipital lobe processes the visual information, the temporal lobe processes auditory information, the parietal lobe processes the information from the somatic sensors. All of three lobes deal with information perceived from the physical world. Each lobe is covered with cortex where the bodies of neurons are located. Cortex consists of primary, intermediate and advanced areas at least. Information is processed in the primary area first, then is passed to intermediate and advanced areas. Comparing with computer system, the brain is the same as hardware and the mind looks like software. Most work in cognitive science assumes that the mind has mental representations analogous to computer data structures, and computational procedures similar to computational algorithms. Connectionists have proposed novel ideas to use neurons and their connections as inspirations for data structures, and neuron firing and spreading activation as inspirations for algorithms. Cognitive science then works with a complex 3-way analogy among the mind, the brain, and computers. Mind, brain, and computation can each be used to suggest new ideas about the others. There is no single computational model of mind, since different kinds of computers and programming approaches suggest different ways in which the mind might work. The mind contains perception, rational, consciousness and emotion. The long-term scientific goal of artificial intelligence is human-level intelligence. In this lecture, we will discuss basic research topics related to intelligence science, such as learning, memory, thought, language, consciousness etc. We also report the recent progresses containing: visual perception; introspective learning; linguistic cognition; consciousness model; and platform of agent-grid intelligence", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/COGINF.2006.365669", "venue": "2006 5th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics", "journal": "2006 5th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2004170886", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["14274438"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25754246"}

The phenomenon of concept drift, which causes terms and signals associated with a topic to change over time, renders static machine learning ineffective. Towards this end, we present an application for physical event detection on social sensors that improves traditional physical event detection with concept drift adaptation.

It integrates data from heterogeneous sources and is designed to handle weak-signal events (landslides, wildfires) with around ten posts per event in addition to large-signal events (hurricanes, earthquakes) with hundreds of thousands of posts per event. We demonstrate a landslide detector on our application that detects almost 350% more land-slides compared to static approaches.

Methods: Twenty-nine adults age 76 to 96 yr wore wrist accelerometers for approximately 24 h per day and waist accelerometers during waking for approximately 7 d of free living. Wear and nonwear times were classified by existing algorithms (Alg[ActiLife], Alg[Troiano], and Alg[Choi]) and compared with wear and nonwear times identified by data plots and diary records. With the use of bias and probability of correct classification, the performance of the algorithms, two time windows (60 and 90 min), and vector magnitude (VM) versus vertical axis (V) counts from a triaxial accelerometer were compared. Results: Automated algorithms (Alg[Choi] and Alg[Troiano]) classified wear/nonwear time intervals more accurately from VM than V counts. The use of the 90-min time window improved wear/nonwear classification accuracy when compared with the 60-min window. The Alg[Choi] and Alg[Troiano] performed better than the manufacturer-provided algorithm (Alg[ActiLife]), and the Alg[Choi] performed better than the Alg[Troiano] for wear/nonwear time classification using the data collected by both accelerometers. Conclusions: Triaxial wrist-worn accelerometer can be used for an accurate wear/nonwear time classification in free-living older adults. The use of the 90-min window and the VM counts improves the performance of commonly used algorithms for wear/nonwear classification for both uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers.

Our experimental results show that: 1) the model produces highly robust performance in encoding and recalling events and episodes even with incomplete and noisy cues; 2) the model provides enhanced performance in a noisy environment due to the process of forgetting; and 3) compared with prior models of spatio-temporal memory, our model shows a higher tolerance toward noise and errors in the retrieval cues.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24808003", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2208477", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1988242323", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["142856816", "16569263", "18146853", "7897551", "1577163", "8512011", "15022802", "12742047", "15590584", "5765444", "7319679", "11968529", "17999168", "11720133", "144990703", "6290770", "17617389", "45489251", "2928242", "13618539", "1685963", "10891636", "18767265", "7252729", "12903216"], "inbound_citations": ["28143246", "49190810", "10737822", "36643535", "7011891", "717081", "17626440", "39699450", "8994926", "206681714", "211207842", "10067351", "4535830", "4618228", "67865999", "1209990", "14673049", "59553829", "49557403", "38026355", "209405434", "13954254", "51613420", "54479300", "13665071", "12768875", "21725987", "22554945", "51913689", "58675422", "15602832", "52147194", "198328464", "4979699", "13080938", "21728499", "12357510", "70292705", "52308058", "15420620", "34414543", "9387323", "114515396", "56596218", "11639698", "7536253", "57755209"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1337309"}

In this research, we address the problem of predicting the runoff time between two farms. We propose Runoff time model which accepts irrigation depth, soil moisture and crop stage (CN) and time of concentration as input parameters and estimate runoff time. Machine learning algorithms i.e., Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Network-Levenberg Marquardt (LMA-ANN), Decision Trees/Regression Tree (DT/RT) and Least Square Support Vector Regression (LS-SVR) have been used for learning and predication purposes. A comparison has been made among these algorithms to choose best algorithm for irrigation runoff time prediction. Experimental results show that regression tree aces the results in terms of highest R-square value, lowest Mean square error. While MLR shows the worse result in terms of least R-square value, highest means square error. The algorithms Regression tree is ranked first-outstanding, ANN-LMA is ranked second-good, LS-SVR is ranked third-fair and MLR is ranked last-poor on the basis of the regression error metrics/ performance evaluation parameters.

To separate faults preliminarily, traditional K-means clustering as transition layer is applied to the principal component scores.

In the first step, a single face image was selected as an input. In the second step, this face image was converted into HSV color space and median filtering was used to remove the noise. Two methods namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) have been used for feature extraction and representation in the third step. During the fourth step, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) have been used to classify the given face over two different datasets. Finally, the experiments were performed by combining two feature vectors to recognize the face and the proposed system is able to recognize six basic emotions viz. happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise and fear.

In this paper, according to the statistical data of the silk reeling production line of Yunyan (Ruanzhen brand) of Qujing cigarette factory from June 2013 to May 2014, it is feasible to apply the random forest regression model to study the problem of moisture control theoretically. In the perfuming stage of silk reeling, a random forest regression model is established to describe the change of moisture content of finished cut tobacco in the export link of perfuming stage, aroused by several factors including incoming water content and different environment. According to the model, good moisture control in the export link of perfuming stage (accordance with the technological standards) can be realized by adjusting the regulating reference value of incoming moisture under specific workshop environments. In the drying stage of silk reeling, the most effective method of moisture control is to adjust the cylinder wall temperature by means of analyzing the correlation coefficients among variables which influence the moisture content of cut tobacco in the export link of drying stage and then establishing another random forest regression model.

Computing power has risen exponentially over relatively brief periods of time as Moore\u2019s law projected a salient trend for the growth in memory-chip performance, estimating the capacity of the integrated circuit to double every 18 months. Although these developments were essential in solving computationally intensive problems, faster devices were not the sole contributing factor to high performance computing. Since electronic processing speeds began to approach limitations imposed by the laws of physics, it became evident that the performance of uniprocessor computers was limited. This has led to the prominent rise of parallel and distributed computing. Such systems could be homogeneous or heterogeneous. In the past decade homogeneous computing has solved large computationally intensive problem by harnessing a multitude of computers via a high-speed network. However, as the amount of homogeneous parallelism in applications decreases, the homogeneous system cannot offer the desired speedups. Therefore, heterogeneous architectures to exploit the heterogeneity in computations came to be a critical research issue. In heterogeneous computing (HC) systems consisting of a multitude of autonomous computers, a mechanism that can harness these computing resources efficiently is essential to maximize system performance. This is especially true in mapping tasks to heterogeneous computers according to the task computation type, so as to maximize the benefits from the heterogeneous architecture.

Slices along the x-t dimension of a patio-temporal sequence are extracted to construct a gait double helical signature (gait DHS). A DHS pattern is a compact description that encodes the parameters of human gait and shows inherent symmetry in natural walking (without encumbered limb movement). The symmetry takes the form of Frieze groups, and differences in DHS symmetry can classify different activities. This thesis presents a method for extracting gait DHS, and how the DHS can be separable by activity. Then, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) n-class classifier is constructed using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, and the performance is measured on a set of data. The SVM is a classification tool based on learning from a training set, and fitting decision boundaries based on an output function.

Recent official figures show that PTWs are estimated to represent only 2% of the total traffic but represent 30% of total deaths on French roads. However, as these estimated figures are obtained by simply counting the number plates registered, they do not give a true picture of the PTWs on the road at any given moment. This dissertation comes under the project METRAMOTO and is a technical applied research work and deals with two problems: detection of PTWsand the use of a laser scanner to count PTWs in the traffic. Traffic generally contains random vehicles of unknown nature and behaviour such as speed,vehicle interaction with other users on the road etc. Even though there are several technologies that can measure traffic, for example radars, cameras, magnetometers etc, as the PTWs are small-sized vehicles, they often move in between lanes and at quite a high speed compared to the vehicles moving in the adjacent lanes. This makes them difficult to detect. the proposed solution in this research work is composed of the following parts: a configuration to install the laser scanner on the road is chosen and a data coherence method is introduced so that the system is able to detect the road verges and its own height above the road surface. This is validated by simulator. Then the rawd ata obtained is pre-processed and is transform into the spatial temporal domain. Following this, an extraction algorithm called the Last Line Check (LLC) method is proposed. Once extracted, the objectis classified using one of the two classifiers either the Support Vector Machine (SVM) or the k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). At the end, the results given by each of the two classifiers are compared and presented in this research work.

View variability is always a challenging problem seriously degrading person re-identification performance. Most of the existing methods either focus on how to learn view invariant feature or how to combine view-wise features. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to learn view-invariant features by getting rid of view specific information through a view confusion learning mechanism. Specifically, we propose an end-toend trainable framework, called View Confusion Feature Learning (VCFL), for person Re-ID across cameras. To the best of our knowledge, VCFL is originally proposed to learn view-invariant identity-wise features, and it is a kind of combination of view-generic and view-specific methods.

On internal validation the accuracy of the GB algorithm for predicting recurrent bleeding, therapeutic intervention and severe bleeding were (88%, 88% and 78% respectively) and superior to the BLEED classification (64%, 68% and 63%), Strate prediction rule (78%, 78%, 67%) and conventional MLR (74%, 74% 62%). On external validation the accuracy was similar to conventional MLR for recurrent bleeding (88% vs. 83%) and therapeutic intervention (91% vs. 87%) but superior for severe bleeding (83% vs. 71%). ::: Conclusion ::: The gradient boosting algorithm accurately predicts outcome in patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding and outperforms multiple logistic regression based models. These may be useful for risk stratification of patients on presentation to the emergency department.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4501707", "pubmed_id": "26172121", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0132485", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "916660775", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["32368402", "28823765", "36647801", "25521579", "20197770", "23830212", "35408433", "38708475", "20881020", "46419865", "7955044", "56869047", "10301092", "19837591", "60993494", "8836657", "25116881", "60512258", "6160280", "14211286", "24179129", "62729017", "28545711", "25703641", "23840133", "89141", "4626887", "6809347", "9950757", "13269719"], "inbound_citations": ["20756012", "145022174", "213185857", "51811218", "52936291", "211046421", "87744343", "4604792"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17134700"}

The big popularity and accessibility of the services proposed by these networks have made the mobile industry a field with high standard and competition where service quality is key. Actually, such a quality is strongly bound to the design quality of the networks themselves, where optimisation issues exist at each step. Thus, any process that cannot cope with these problems may alter the design phase and ultimately the service provided. The Antenna Positioning Problem (APP) is one of the most determinant optimisation issues that engineers face during network life cycle. This paper proposes a new variant of the Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm (QIGA) based on a novel quantum gate for solving the APP. In order to assess the scalability, efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, the experiments have been carried out on realistic, synthetic and random benchmarks with different dimensions. Several statistical analysis tests have been carried out as well. State-of-the-art algorithms designed to solve the APP, the Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), are taken as a comparison basis. Performance evaluation of the proposed approach proves that it is efficient, robust and scalable; it could outperform both PBIL and GA in many benchmark instances.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.swevo.2016.06.003", "venue": "Swarm Evol.

However, when using RNA-Seq datasets with many experimental conditions from diverse sources, only a subset of the experimental conditions is expected to be relevant for finding genes related to a particular Gene Ontology (GO) term. Therefore, we hypothesize that when the purpose is to find similarly functioning genes, the co-expression of genes should not be determined on all samples but only on those samples informative for the GO term of interest. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: To address this, we developed MLC (Metric Learning for Co-expression), a fast algorithm that assigns a GO-term-specific weight to each expression sample. The goal is to obtain a weighted co-expression measure that is more suitable than the unweighted Pearson correlation for applying Guilt-By-Association-based function predictions. More specifically, if two genes are annotated with a given GO term, MLC tries to maximize their weighted co-expression, and, in addition, if one of them is not annotated with that term, the weighted co-expression is minimized. Our experiments on publicly available Arabidopsis thaliana RNA-Seq data demonstrate that MLC outperforms standard Pearson correlation in term-centric performance. Moreover, our method is particularly good at more specific terms, which are the most interesting. Finally, by observing the sample weights for a particular GO term, one can identify which experiments are important for learning that term and potentially identify novel conditions that are relevant, as demonstrated by experiments in both A. thaliana and Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. ::: ::: ::: AVAILABILITY ::: MLC is available as a Python package at www.github.com/stamakro/MLC. ::: ::: ::: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ::: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31562759", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btz731", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "mag_id": "2976757387", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203581474"}

Copyright # 2008John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Compared with the large literature on the consequences of attitudes, especially for behavior and interpersonal relations,the antecedents of attitudes have receivedsurprisingly little attention. In particular, rather fewstudies have considered howattitudes are shaped by learning experiences derived from direct interaction with objects in the environment. In simpleterms, we assume that, as individuals explore their environment, they will learn, among other things, which objects aregood and which are bad, and this feedback will lead them to form positive and negative attitudes toward these objects. Atthe same time, however, the attitudes that individuals have formed will guide their exploration. In other words, they will bemore likely to choose to approach and engage with objects (or persons or activities) to which they have formed morepositiveattitudes. Thus, we may have a positiveattitude toward holidaying in a givencountry as a consequence of previousgood holidays there. Because of this positive attitude, we will also be keener to go there, and hence gain even moreexperience on which to base our attitudes. Hence, the relationship between experience and attitude formation is essentiallydynamic: attitudes are formed on the basis of feedback experiences, while at the same time such feedback experiencesdepend on behaviors that are guided by attitudes.One consequence of this dynamic relationship is an asymmetry in the learning of good and bad objects. If learnersbelievethat agivenobject is goodandattractive,theywillbemoreliketoseekoutexperiences with it,andhence obtainyetmore information about it. If they believeit to be bad and unattractive,they will be more likely to avoid it, butdoing sowilllimit the information they gain about the object\u2019s true valence, and hence fail to learn whether their initial negativeevaluations were correct or incorrect. The implication is that learners are more likely to misclassify good objects as badthan bad objects as good.European Journal of Social PsychologyEur. J. Soc.

Nuclear abnormality is a hallmark of progeria in human. Analysis of age-dependent nuclear morphological changes in Caenorhabditis elegans is of great value to aging research, and this calls for an automatic image processing method that is suitable for both normal and abnormal structures. Our image processing method consists of nuclear segmentation, feature extraction and classification. First, taking up the challenges of defining individual nuclei with fuzzy boundaries or in a clump, we developed an accurate nuclear segmentation method using fused two-channel images with seed-based cluster splitting and k-means algorithm, and achieved a high precision against the manual segmentation results. Next, we extracted three groups of nuclear features, among which five features were selected by minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) for classifiers. After comparing the classification performances of several popular techniques, we identified that Random Forest, which achieved a mean class accuracy (MCA) of 98.69%, was the best classifier for our data set.

Selecting knot values that yield good approximations is a challenging task, based largely on heuristics and user experience. More advanced approaches range from parametric averaging to genetic algorithms. In this paper, we propose to use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to determine suitable knot vectors for B-spline curve approximation. The SVMs are trained to identify locations in a sequential point cloud where knot placement will improve the approximation error. After the training phase, the SVM can assign, to each point set location, a so-called score. This score is based on geometric and differential geometric features of points. It measures the quality of each location to be used as knots in the subsequent approximation. From these scores, the final knot vector can be constructed exploring the topography of the score-vector without the need for iteration or optimization in the approximation process.

They are based on the idea that if input points are mapped to a high dimensional feature space then, a separating hyperplane can be easily found. SVM and kernel methods have been applied to a wide class of problems including approximation and classification and they have proven a remarkable performance on real world problems. An important step in their design is the setting of the kernels parameters which defines the structure of the high dimensional feature space where a maximal margin hyperplane will be found. Too rich feature space, e.g. small kernel parameters, will over-fit the data and hence result in a poor generalisation error, whereas if the kernel parameter is too big, the model will not be able to separate the data. In this paper we firstly propose a heuristic that permits the individual control of the growth in each kernel, which results in more sparse models with higher prediction accuracy. Secondly, a heuristic resulting from the combination of SVM trained by linear programming (LP) and EC for the optimisation of the kernels width is proposed.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-45240-9_34", "venue": "Applications and Science in Soft Computing", "journal": "Applications and Science in Soft Computing", "mag_id": "2107973353", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123547117"}

Bertenthal (bbertent@indiana.edu) Cognitive Science Program and Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, Indiana University Bloomington, IN 47405 USA Abstract The tendency to imitate others is a fundamental social skill which could develop via associative learning or some more specialized mechanism, such as observation-execution matching. In this paper, we employ a stimulus-response compatibility paradigm to evaluate whether ideomotor compatibility conforms to the same processes as other S-R responses. The findings reveal a dissociation between spatial and ideomotor compatibility. A set of connectionist models are developed, which show that the differences between spatial and ideomotor compatibility are attributable to structural differences and in part to the relative strengths of an inhibitory node mediating the involuntary S-R response. Keywords: action perception; ideomotor compatibility; spatial compatibility; connectionist modeling Introduction The tendency of people to spontaneously imitate observed actions has long been noted. This automatic tendency contributes to the \u2018social glue\u2019 by which humans coordinate behaviors, cooperate, and develop affiliative tendencies toward each other (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999; Lakin, Jefferis, Cheng, & Chartrand, 2003). In spite of its importance for such social interactions, there is little consensus on how this mimicry occurs. One prominent approach suggests that the perception of actions activates motor programs in an observer because each shares a common representational code (e.g., Prinz, 1990). This common coding framework descends from the ideomotor theory of James (1890) and Greenwald (1970), and has received considerable attention following the discovery of mirror neurons in the monkey brain (Rizzolatti, Fadiga, Gallese, & Fogassi, 1996). A straightforward prediction from this theory is that the ease with which a stimulus might be transformed into an action depends on the similarity or ideomotor compatibility between the observed and executed action (Brass, Bekkering, Wohlschlager, & Prinz, 2000). Imitated responses, which involve replication of observed actions, are highly ideomotor compatible. Given this formulation, it is conceivable that ideomotor compatibility is simply a special case of stimulus-response (S-R) compatibility, determined by the degree to which a stimulus and a response are perceptually, structurally, or conceptually similar (Kornblum, Hasbroucq, & Osman, 1990). Indeed, some theories explicitly propose that the same associative learning and motor control processes that underlie other S-R mapping processes also underlie imitation (Brass & Heyes, 2005; Gewirtz & Stingle, 1968). If, however, ideomotor compatibility is mediated by a neural network specialized for the direct matching of observed and executed actions (e.g., Iacoboni et al., 1999; Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004), then it is more likely that ideomotor compatibility is dissociable from other forms of S-R compatibility. The Simon effect (Simon, 1969), a processing advantage for spatially compatible stimuli and responses, is a prime example of S-R compatibility. If ideomotor and spatial compatibility are both mediated by associative learning, then the patterns of responses on tasks that test either form of compatibility should be similar. Until recently, ideomotor and spatial compatibility have been confounded in most experiments. Bertenthal, Longo, and Kosobud (2006), however, devised a paradigm for testing both types of compatibility independently in the same experiment by manipulating the instructions. In this paradigm participants observe a tapping index or middle finger of a stimulus hand presented as if belonging to a person facing them. They respond to the tapping finger by pressing a key with the index or middle finger of their right hand. In one condition, they are instructed to imitate the cue by pressing a key with their anatomically matching finger (imitative cue). In the other condition, they are instructed to press a key with their spatially corresponding finger (spatial cue). As such, either the imitative or spatial cue is the imperative stimulus, but the other stimulus cue, although irrelevant, is also present. If the stimulus hand is the left hand (i.e., a mirror image of the participant\u2019s right hand), then the irrelevant dimension of the response is both spatially and ideomotor compatible (e.g., leftward index finger stimulus corresponds to a leftward index finger response). By contrast, if the stimulus is a right hand, then the irrelevant dimension is incompatible. Reaction times (RTs) are faster when the irrelevant dimension is compatible (i.e., left stimulus hand) than when the irrelevant dimension is incompatible (i.e., right stimulus hand). Although these studies provide evidence for both spatial and ideomotor compatibility, they also suggest that the underlying processes responsible for these two forms of compatibility are not identical. Bertenthal et al. (2006) reported that the effects of ideomotor compatibility were attenuated across a block of trials, but the effects of spatial compatibility persisted. Longo et al.

This research is focused on developing a model to control a system using gestures, while simultaneously implementing continuous facial recognition to avoid unauthorized access. An effective face recognition system is developed and applied in conjunction with a gesture recognition system to control a wireless robot in real-time. The facial recognition system extracts the face using the Viola-Jones algorithm which utilizes Haar like features along with Adaboost training. This is followed by a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based feature extractor and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to recognize the face. The gesture recognition is facilitated by using color segmentation, which involves extracting the skin tone of the detected face and using this to detect the position of hand. The gesture is obtained by tracking the hand using the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) algorithm. In this research, we additionally utilize a background subtraction model so as to extract the foreground and reduce the misclassifications. Such a technique highly improves the performance of the facial and gesture detector in complex and cluttered environments. The performance of the face detector was tested on different databases including the ORL, Caltech and Faces96 database.

We report a case study done with a set of 390 measurements of 144 animals taken from 2 to 222days in advance of the slaughter. We used animals of the breed Asturiana de los Valles, a specialized beef breed from the North of Spain. The results obtained show that it is possible to predict carcass weights 150days before the slaughter day with an average absolute error of 4.27% of the true value. The prediction function is a polynomial of degree 3 that uses five lengths and the estimation of the round profile of the animals.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compag.2012.08.009", "venue": null, "journal": "Computers and Electronics in Agriculture", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2015263929", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["17553935", "15336970", "961425", "14630728", "7296841", "23783042", "109072795", "7818880", "111201496", "110203576", "31578907", "28637672"], "inbound_citations": ["29948399", "52010796", "4622338", "164252346", "81983540"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49237202"}

Accurate classification of MI-EEG signals while essential for effective operation of BCI systems, is challenging due to the significant noise inherent in the signals and the lack of informative correlation between the signals and brain activities. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network based learning framework that affords perceptive insights into the relationship between the MI-EEG data and brain activities.

Diagnostic pathology has traditionally relied on macro and microscopic histology and tumor morphology as the basis for tumor classification.

In recent years, there has been a move towards the use of cDNA microarrays for tumor classification. These high-throughput assays provide relative mRNA expression measurements simultaneously for thousands of genes. A key statistical task is to perform classification via different expression patterns. Gene expression profiles may offer more information than classical morphology and may potentially provide an alternative to classical tumor diagnosis schemes.

Numerous tasks are formulated on feature learning by the features of big data such as volume, variety as well as velocity those are related to huge amount of information, several types of information as well as the streaming speed of data, accordingly. Concentrations on these issues, a model of deep computations are implemented for big data feature learning. At the start, for the purpose of learning the features of heterogeneous data a basic deep computation model is outlined by modifying the deep learning model for the space of vector with the space of tensor . Next, for real time feature learning of big data, an incremental deep computation method having two incremental tensor auto-encoders is designed. At last, for maximizing the efficiency to train the parameters of deep computation model by using the cloud servers the privacy preserving technique is developed. In given system a privacy preserving high order back- propagation algorithm is developed by consolidating with the full homomorphic encryption, BVG for protection of the information which may b private while doing the deep computation model on cloud.

The difficulties mainly come from the feature representation, i.e., how to find a good representation for images. Instead of improving over hand-crafted features such as SIFT or HoG, we focus on learning image representations by generative and discriminative methods.In this thesis, we explore three areas: (1) generative models, (2) graphical models, and (3) deep neural networks for learning image representations. In particular, we propose a dictionary of epitomes, a compact generative representation for explicitly modeling object co-relation within edge patches, and for explicitly modeling photometric and position variability of image patches. Subsequently, we exploit Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to take into account the dependencies between outputs. Finally, we employ Deep Convolutional Neural Networks trained with large-scale datasets to learn feature representations. We further combine CRFs with deep networks to estimate complex representations.

Through picking out these characteristic parts of the signing signals, and balancing their effects in kernel matrix according to the degree of their stableness, the negative influences on signature verification of the other parts with low stableness can be reduced to the smallest.

If the Lipschitz regression function is sparse and only depends on a small, unknown subset of $S$ out of $d$ features, we show that, given access to $n$ observations, this random forest model outputs a predictor that has a mean-squared prediction error $O((n(\\sqrt{\\log n})^{S-1})^{-\\frac{1}{S\\log2+1}})$.

All scientific fields and data of all kinds and size are touched by this problem. There is a number of ad-hoc solutions which unfortunately lead to a loss of power, biased inference, underestimation of variability and distorted relationships between variables. A more promising approach of rising popularity is multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) also known as imputation by full conditional specification (FCS). Alternatives to imputation are given by methods with built-in procedures. These include recursive partitioning by classification and regression trees as well as corresponding Random Forests. However there is only few literature comparing the two approaches. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability due to restrictions on data structure and simulation schemes. The application of both methods to several kinds of data and different simulation settings is meant to improve and extend the comparative analyses. Classification and regression studies are examined. Recursive partitioning is executed by two popular tree and one Random Forest implementation. Findings show that multiple imputation produces ambiguous performance results for both, simulated and real life data.

Circuits must be controlled to reduce parametric yield loss, and the resulting circuits tested to guarantee that they meet specifications. In this paper, a hybrid approach that integrates the Self-Organizing Map and Support Vector Machine for wafer bin map classification is proposed. The log odds ratio test is employed as a spatial clustering measurement preprocessor to distinguish between the systematic and random wafer bin map distribution. After the smoothing step is performed on the wafer bin map, features such as co-occurrence matrix and moment invariants are extracted. The wafer bin maps are then clustered with the Self-Organizing Map using the aforementioned features. The Support Vector Machine is then applied to classify the wafer bin maps to identify the manufacturing defects. The proposed method can transform a large number of wafer bin maps into a small group of specific failure patterns and thus shorten the time and scope for troubleshooting to yield improvement.

Using deeply recurrent neural networks to account for temporal dependence in electroencephalograph (EEG)-based workload estimation is shown to considerably improve day-to-day feature stationarity resulting in significantly higher accuracy (p < .0001) than classifiers which do not consider the temporal dependence encoded within the EEG time-series signal. This improvement is demonstrated by training several deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures, a feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models on data from six participants who each perform several Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) sessions on five separate days spread out over a month-long period.

In this work we introduce a novel approach to transfer learning, which addresses two shortcomings of traditional methods: The (partial) inheritance of the original models structure and the restriction to other neural network models as an input source. To this end we identify the parts in the input that have been relevant for the decision of the model we want to transfer knowledge from, and directly encode those relevant regions in the data on which we train our new model.

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose an approach named as Foreground Generative Adversarial Network (FgGAN) with the recent concepts of generative adversarial network (GAN) and unpaired training for background estimation and foreground segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper with the concept of GAN-based unpaired learning for MOS. Initially, video-wise background is estimated using GAN-based unpaired learning network (network-I). Then, to extract the motion information related to foreground, motion saliency is estimated using estimated background and current video frame. Further, estimated motion saliency is given as input to the GANbased unpaired learning network (network-II) for foreground segmentation. To examine the effectiveness of proposed FgGAN (cascaded networks I and II), the challenging video categories like dynamic background, bad weather, intermittent object motion and shadow are collected from ChangeDetection.net-2014 [26] database. The segmentation accuracy is observed qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of F-measure and percentage of wrong classification (PWC) and compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods.

Two critical issues were investigated, the nature of the semantic associations learned by the model, and the ability of an adapted version of the model to simulate human priming data. Analysis of the correspondence between the semantic associations developed in the network and those expected from human data indicated two sources of concern. First, the semantic associations learned were susceptible to small changes in the training set. Second, surprising semantic relations were found (e.g. \u2018animal\u2019 was more similar to the plants in the model). Priming was studied by adding a cascade mechanism to the basic model. Certain aspects of the training data and model architecture made direct simulation of standard human semantic priming difficult, since primes and targets necessarily consisted of a concept and a relation term, e.g. prime \u2018oak is\u2019 \u2014 target \u2018tree is\u2019. Responses consisted of activation of appropriate features for the target term. Two interesting findings emerged. First, dissimilar primes slowed performance compared to unprimed processing. Second, the major causal factor in the priming effects obtained was due to the correspondence between relation terms rather than similarity of concepts. In light of these findings, we discuss the value, for connectionist modelling, of training data that encodes distribution information derived from the study of human semantic memory.", "year": 1999, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4471-0813-9_14", "venue": "Perspectives in Neural Computing", "journal": "Perspectives in Neural Computing", "mag_id": "147091167", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59879440"}

Firstly, we pre-train a source long short-term memory (LSTM) network and a nonlinear regression model by using the labeled source cutting tool examples. Secondly, we perform adversarial domain adaption by learning a target LSTM model that minimize the distance between the source domain and target domain under their respective mapping, thus making it impossible for the discriminator to distinguish between the target and source cutting tools.

Fire tests were carried out on 4 beams for 60, 90, 120, and 150 min, respectively. During and after the fire tests, structural modal information were recorded.

The residual bearing capacities of the beams after fire were calculated according to the predicted fire exposure time, which were close to experimental results. It indicated that the equivalent fire exposure time as the output parameter for damage identification was reliable. Finally, on the basis of damage identification method for simply supported beams, a new three-step positioning method was established for identifing the degree of damage in continuous beams.

Computational approaches provide an alternative way to predicting F. graminearum protein subcellular localizations due to the expensive and time-consuming biological experiments in lab.ResultsIn this paper, we developed a novel predictor, namely FGsub, to predict F. graminearum protein subcellular localizations from the primary structures. First, a non-redundant fungi data set with subcellular localization annotation is collected from UniProtKB database and used as training set, where the subcellular locations are classified into 10 groups. Subsequently, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained on the training set and used to predict F. graminearum protein subcellular localizations for those proteins that do not have significant sequence similarity to those in training set. The performance of SVMs on training set with 10-fold cross-validation demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, for F. graminearum proteins that have significant sequence similarity to those in training set, BLAST is utilized to transfer annotations of homologous proteins to uncharacterized F. graminearum proteins so that the F. graminearum proteins are annotated more comprehensively.ConclusionsIn this work, we present FGsub to predict F. graminearum protein subcellular localizations in a comprehensive manner. We make four fold contributions to this filed. First, we present a new algorithm to cope with imbalance problem that arises in protein subcellular localization prediction, which can solve imbalance problem and avoid false positive results. Second, we design an ensemble classifier which employs feature selection to further improve prediction accuracy. Third, we use BLAST to complement machine learning based methods, which enlarges our prediction coverage. Last and most important, we predict the subcellular localizations of 12786 F. graminearum proteins, which provide insights into protein functions and pathogenic mechanisms of this destructive pathogen fungus.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2982686", "pubmed_id": "20840726", "doi": "10.1186/1752-0509-4-S2-S12", "venue": "BMC Systems Biology", "journal": "BMC Systems Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2029478210", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11548015", "11080216", "29619096", "15510796", "242686", "3142627", "17386627", "30441491", "4339432", "1813368", "36863385", "155451", "1896481", "7943197", "9839650", "2373727", "43032785", "22584251", "9915169", "7814139", "86407307", "7129998", "11923127", "961425", "16521419", "17000833", "1508674", "206340350", "9675334"], "inbound_citations": ["15633588", "9675334", "2919656", "11979864"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9675334"}

Firstly, the significant bitplane image is extracted from original host, and DWT is performed on the significant bitplane image. Then, the corresponding low-pass subband is divided into small blocks. Finally, the digital watermark is embedded into host image by adaptively modulating the selected wavelet coefficients in small blocks. The main steps of digital watermark detecting procedure include: (1) the significant bitplane image is extracted from test image, and some low-order pseudo-Zernike moments of the significant bitplane image are computed, which are regarded as the effective feature vectors; (2) the appropriate kernel function is selected for training, and a SVM training model can be obtained; (3) the test image is corrected with the well trained SVM model; (4) the digital watermark is extracted from the corrected test image.

We present a fully automatic multimodal 2D + 3D feature-based facial expression recognition approach and demonstrate its performance on the BU-3DFE database. Our approach combines multi-order gradient-based local texture and shape descriptors in order to achieve efficiency and robustness. First, a large set of fiducial facial landmarks of 2D face images along with their 3D face scans are localized using a novel algorithm namely incremental Parallel Cascade of Linear Regression (iPar-CLR). Then, a novel Histogram of Second Order Gradients (HSOG) based local image descriptor in conjunction with the widely used first-order gradient based SIFT descriptor are used to describe the local texture around each 2D landmark. Similarly, the local geometry around each 3D landmark is described by two novel local shape descriptors constructed using the first-order and the second-order surface differential geometry quantities, i.e., Histogram of mesh Gradients (meshHOG) and Histogram of mesh Shape index (curvature quantization, meshHOS). Finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based recognition results of all 2D and 3D descriptors are fused at both feature-level and score-level to further improve the accuracy. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that there exist impressive complementary characteristics between the 2D and 3D descriptors. We use the BU-3DFE benchmark to compare our approach to the state-of-the-art ones. Our multimodal feature-based approach outperforms the others by achieving an average recognition accuracy of 86.32%.

The training phase creates several models related to the number of clustered postures by means of a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM), trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO). The classification phase adopts the X-means algorithm to find the optimal number of clusters dynamically. The contribution of the paper is twofold. The first aim is to perform activity recognition employing features based on a small number of informative postures, extracted independently from each activity instance; secondly, it aims to assess the minimum number of frames needed for an adequate classification. The system is evaluated on two publicly available datasets, the Cornell Activity Dataset (CAD-60) and the Telecommunication Systems Team (TST) Fall detection dataset. The number of clusters needed to model each instance ranges from two to four elements.

The scientific challenge tackled by our investigation is to assess the feasibility of exploiting the richness of the temporal signals gathered by the balance board for inferring the complete BBS score based on data from a single BBS exercise.The relation between the data collected by the balance board and the BBS score is inferred by neural networks for temporal data, modeled in particular as Echo State Networks within the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm, as a result of a comprehensive comparison among different learning models. The proposed system results to be able to estimate the complete BBS score directly from temporal data on exercise #10 of the BBS test, with 10s of duration. Experimental results on real-world data show an absolute error below 4 BBS score points (i.e. below the 7% of the whole BBS range), resulting in a favorable trade-off between predictive performance and users required time with respect to previous works in literature.

Also, ultrasonographical evaluations of fetuses enhance detecting and defining these abnormalities. About 60\u201370% of the anomalies can be diagnosed via ultrasonography, while the remaining 30\u201340% can be diagnosed after childbirth. Medical diagnosis and prediction is a topic that is closely related with e-Health and machine learning. e-Health applications are critically important especially for the patients unable to see a doctor or any health professional. Our objective is to help clinicians and families to better predict fetal congenital anomalies besides the traditional pregnancy tests using machine learning techniques and e-Health applications. Methods In this work, we developed a prediction system with assistive e-Health applications which both the pregnant women and practitioners can make use of. A performance comparison (considering Accuracy, F1-Score, AUC measures) was made between 9 binary classification models (Averaged Perceptron, Boosted Decision Tree, Bayes Point Machine, Decision Forest, Decision Jungle, Locally-Deep Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine) which were trained with the clinical dataset of 96 pregnant women and used to process data to predict fetal anomaly status based on the maternal and clinical data. The dataset was obtained through maternal questionnaire and detailed evaluations of 3 clinicians from RadyoEmar radiodiagnostics center in Istanbul, Turkey. Our e-Health applications are used to get pregnant women\u2019s health status and clinical history parameters as inputs, recommend them physical activities to perform during pregnancy, and inform the practitioners and finally the patients about possible risks of fetal anomalies as the output. Results In this paper, the highest accuracy of prediction was displayed as 89.5% during the development tests with Decision Forest model. In real life testing with 16 users, the performance was 87.5%. This estimate is sufficient to give an idea of fetal health before the patient visits the physician. Conclusions The proposed work aims to provide assistive services to pregnant women and clinicians via an online system consisting of a mobile side for the patients, a web application side for their clinicians and a prediction system.

This computation requires in principle solving a set of differential equations, the internal structure equations, for some boundary conditions (pressure, temperature in the protoplanetary disk where a planet forms, core mass and accretion rate of solids by the planet). Solving these equations in turn proves being time consuming and sometimes numerically unstable. We developed a method to approximate the result of integrating the internal structure equations for a variety of boundary conditions. We compute a set of planet internal structures for a very large number (millions) of boundary conditions, considering two opacities,(ISM and reduced). This database is then used to train Deep Neural Networks in order to predict the critical core mass as well as the mass of planetary envelopes as a function of the boundary conditions. We show that our neural networks provide a very good approximation (at the level of percents) of the result obtained by solving interior structure equations, but with a much smaller required computer time. The difference with the real solution is much smaller than the one obtained using some analytical formulas available in the literature which at best only provide the correct order of magnitude. We compare the results of the DNN with other popular machine learning methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Support Vector Regression) and show that the DNN outperforms these methods by a factor of at least two.

It is well-known that machine learning models could fail in simulating streamflows from only meteorological variables in the absence of antecedent streamflow values. The main reason for this could be low and lagged relationships between streamflow and meteorological variables. To overcome this inefficiency, for the first time, we developed a simulation framework by coupling a base flow separation method to three machine learning methods. It was demonstrated that separating streamflow into different components such as base flow and surface flow can be useful for improving simulation and forecasting capabilities of machine learning models. We simulated streamflow in four rivers in the United States with Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Random Forest (RF) as a function of precipitation (P), temperature (T) and potential evapotranspiration (PET). We concluded that the base flow separation method improved the simulation performances of the machine learning models to a certain degree.

To improve RFID tracking performance in industrial sites, a RFID tracking method that integrates Multidimensional Support Vector Regression (MSVR) and Kalman filter is developed in this paper. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facility site with long range active RFID system to evaluate the performance of this approach.

The paper proposes a heuristic classifier ensemble to improve the performance of learning in the classification. It specially deals with multiclass problems which their aim is to learn the boundaries of each class among many classes. Based on the concept of multiclass problems, the classifiers are divided into two different categories: pairwise classifiers and multiclass classifiers. The aim of a pairwise classifier is to separate one class from another one. Because the pairwise classifiers are just trained to discriminate between two classes, the decision boundaries learned by them are simpler and more effective than those learned by the multiclass classifiers. The two proposed methods are similar to Random Forest method in employing many decision trees and neural networks as base classifiers. For evaluating the proposed weighting methods, both cases of decision tree and neural network classifiers are applied in experimental results.

Here we wish to define the most appropriate data processing workflow.MethodsWe assess the influence of normalisation, missing value imputation, transformation and scaling methods on univariate and multivariate analysis of UHPLC-MS datasets acquired for different mammalian samples.ResultsOur studies have shown that once data are filtered, missing values are not correlated with m/z, retention time or response. Following an exhaustive evaluation, we recommend PQN normalisation with no missing value imputation and no transformation or scaling for univariate analysis. For PCA we recommend applying PQN normalisation with Random Forest missing value imputation, glog transformation and no scaling method. For PLS-DA we recommend PQN normalisation, KNN as the missing value imputation method, generalised logarithm transformation and no scaling. These recommendations are based on searching for the biologically important metabolite features independent of their measured abundance.ConclusionThe appropriate choice of normalisation, missing value imputation, transformation and scaling methods differs depending on the data analysis method and the choice of method is essential to maximise the biological derivations from UHPLC-MS datasets.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4831991", "pubmed_id": "27123000", "doi": "10.1007/s11306-016-1030-9", "venue": "Metabolomics", "journal": "Metabolomics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2338241819", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["45174121", "17539114", "40457222", "89141", "6661746", "18354329", "7809837", "37442665", "26044820", "8152136", "6812484", "14926649", "3008609", "201137171", "2057382", "207265915", "16003492", "95259911", "2858665", "205201373", "13623063", "33415324", "10226699", "1137530", "12162263", "16785159", "21152053", "2812336", "123227007", "28136201", "23470814", "24929967", "28887025", "16656979", "23151483", "52873354", "12605912", "98529175", "6753812", "6274117", "41398796"], "inbound_citations": ["3727144", "204028366", "11156272", "146807567", "2006500"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9197764"}

Person identity should also be well preserved in the synthesized face. In this article, we present a novel U-Net Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for FES. U-Net helps retain the property of the input face, including the identity information and facial details. Category condition is added to the U-Net model so that one-to-many expression synthesis can be achieved simultaneously. We also design constraints for identity preservation during FES to further guarantee that the identity of the input face can be well preserved in the generated face image.

A low speed test rig was developed to simulate various defects with shaft speeds as low as 10 rpm under several loading conditions. In this study, component analysis was also performed to extract the feature and reduce the dimensionality of original data feature. Moreover, the classification for fault diagnosis was also conducted using original data feature without feature extraction. The result shows that extracted feature from AE sensor gave better performance in faults classification. Keywords : Fault diagnosis; Low speed bearing; Component analysis; Support vector machines. 1. Introduction There are industries that equipped by low speed rotating machinery such as rolling machine in paper mill, steel pipe and mining industries. Also, low speed rotating machine can be found in wind turbine power plant. As rotating machinery, bearing is critical component and sometimes it must carry heavy loads and operate at high efficiency and reliability. Therefore, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of low speed bearing is very useful to guarantee the effectiveness and reliability of this machine. Establishing intelligent system for faults detection of low speed rotating machine is a solution. To face this issue, the research area in machine learning has been applied to perform condition monitoring, faults detection and classification. Furthermore, machine fault diagnosis based on classification technique such as SVM will perform well if the data input consists of useful features which represent each condition or class. In the present study, we employ component analysis that is aimed to support the data preparation process. Using component analysis, the useful features can be extracted from the original data and high-dimensional of original data can be reduced by removing irrelative features, so that the classifier will reach high accuracy.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2262048494", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "122725444", "6674407", "109508407", "108585550", "107630392", "15874442", "2443126"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2488620"}

The demand for CD4 count measurement is increasing as ART programs expand over the last decade. This study aimed to predict CD4 count changes and to identify the predictors of CD4 count changes among patients on ART. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar Hospital from 3,104 adult patients on ART with CD4 counts measured at least twice (baseline and most recent). Data were retrieved from the HIV care clinic electronic database and patients` charts. Descriptive data were analyzed by SPSS version 20. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology was followed to undertake the study. WEKA version 3.8 was used to conduct a predictive data mining. Before building the predictive data mining models, information gain values and correlation-based Feature Selection methods were used for attribute selection. Variables were ranked according to their relevance based on their information gain values. J48, Neural Network, and Random Forest algorithms were experimented to assess model accuracies. ::: ::: ::: RESULT ::: The median duration of ART was 191.5 weeks. The mean CD4 count change was 243 (SD 191.14) cells per microliter. Overall, 2427 (78.2%) patients had their CD4 counts increased by at least 100 cells per microliter, while 4% had a decline from the baseline CD4 value. Baseline variables including age, educational status, CD8 count, ART regimen, and hemoglobin levels predicted CD4 count changes with predictive accuracies of J48, Neural Network, and Random Forest being 87.1%, 83.5%, and 99.8%, respectively. Random Forest algorithm had a superior performance accuracy level than both J48 and Artificial Neural Network.

Although considerable progress has been made, there remain several significant challenges in traditional methods for fusing multi-modality data. First, the fusion of multi-modality data is usually independent of the training of diagnostic models, leading to sub-optimal performance. Second, it is challenging to effectively exploit the complementary information among multiple modalities based on low-level imaging features (e.g., image intensity or tissue volume). To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Latent Multi-modality Dementia Diagnosis (DLMD\\(^2\\)) framework based on a deep non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model.

Hence, there is a requirement for prediction of significant parameters from incomplete data set. In this work, Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) based prediction of significant parameters which include forced expiratory volumes at first second and sixth seconds are employed. ELM with radial basis function and sine activation functions is used to train and test the prediction process. The performance of the regression model is validated with prediction accuracy and root mean squared error. Results demonstrate that ELM with Radial Basis Function (RBF) achieves higher prediction accuracy (98%) for FEV1 prediction with 20 hidden neurons. Prediction accuracy of 95% is obtained for FEV6 with sine activation function. Further, it is observed that less prediction error and high correlation are obtained in FEV1 prediction.

The spectra data used is characterized by a large number of descriptors and very few data points. The strengths of SVR for shaft misalignment prediction include its ability to represent data in high-dimensional space through kernel functions. We reduce the dimension of the data using a multivariate AIC criterion in order to guarantee that the selected spectra are response dependent. We compare the performance of SVR with two of the most popular techniques used in condition monitoring, partial least squares, and principal components regression. Our results show that we can improve the performance of shaft misalignment prediction using SVR and the approach compares very favorably with partial least squares and principal components regression approaches.

This problem interferes with continual learning required for autonomous robots, which learn many tasks incrementally from daily activities. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting, it is important for especially reservoir computing to clarify which neurons should be fired corresponding to each task, since only readout weights are updated according to the degree of firing of neurons. We therefore propose the way to design reservoir computing such that the firing neurons are clearly distinguished from others according to the task to be performed. As a key design feature, we employ fractal network, which has modularity and scalability, to be reservoir layer. In particular, its modularity is fully utilized by designing input layer. As a result, simulations of control tasks using reinforcement learning show that our design mitigates the catastrophic forgetting even when random actions from reinforcement learning prompt parameters to be overwritten.

We exploit this finding in an iterative procedure where a generative model and a classifier are jointly trained: in turn, the generator allows to sample cleaner data from the target distribution, and the classifier allows to associate better labels to target samples, progressively refining target pseudo-labels.

Deep BLSTM architecture is chosen due to its ability to access long range context, learn sequence alignment and work without the need of segmented data.

It showed that the training objective can approach its optimum value even if the generated distribution has very low support. In other words, the training objective is unable to prevent mode collapse. The current paper makes two contributions. (1) It proposes a novel test for estimating support size using the birthday paradox of discrete probability. Using this evidence is presented that well-known GANs approaches do learn distributions of fairly low support. (2) It theoretically studies encoder-decoder GANs architectures (e.g., BiGAN/ALI), which were proposed to learn more meaningful features via GANs, and consequently to also solve the mode-collapse issue. Our result shows that such encoder-decoder training objectives also cannot guarantee learning of the full distribution because they cannot prevent serious mode collapse.

Instead, we employ \u201dsparsity-aware\u201d arguments to model and estimate the outliers, adopting a greedy approach. In particular, the proposed robust scheme, i.e., Kernel Greedy Algorithm for Robust Denoising (KGARD), is a modification of the classical Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. In a nutshell, the proposed scheme alternates between a KRR task and an OMP-like selection step. Convergence properties as well as theoretical results concerning the recovery of the support are provided. Moreover, KGARD is compared against other cutting edge methods (using toy examples) to demonstrate its performance and verify the aforementioned theoretical results.

Three hundred seven patients (199 without any fractures of the spine, and 108 patients with at least one fracture of the L1, L2, L3, or L4 vertebral bodies) who had DEXA studies were evaluated. Ancillary data from DEXA output was analyzed. The dataset was split into training (80%) and test (20%) datasets. Support vector machines (SVMs) with 10-fold cross-validation and different kernels were used to identify the best kernel based on the greatest area under the curve (AUC) and the best training vectors in the training dataset. The SVM with the best kernel was then applied to the test dataset to assess the accuracy of the SVM. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the SVMs using different kernels in the test dataset were compared using DeLong\u2019s test. The SVM classifier with the linear kernel had the greatest AUC in the training dataset (AUC = 0.9258). The AUC of the SVM classifier with the linear kernel in the test dataset was 0.8963.

Namely, we take a theoretical view on classical classifiers, provide an approach to interpret the classifier together with the preprocessing, and integrate both into one framework which enables a semiautomatic optimization of the processing chain and which interfaces numerous algorithms.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1801.04929", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "PhD Thesis, University of Bremen, Bremen, 1-236, 2015", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2136605444", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["2489884", "7309897", "23637208", "23400723", "39597757", "11282447"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1809212"}

One major issue with these methods is that there is no clear way to distinguish between probable true hits and noise variables based on the importance metric calculated. To this end, we are developing a method called the Relative Recurrency Variable Importance Metric (r2VIM), a RF-based variable selection method. Here, we apply r2VIM to the unrelated Genetic Analysis Workshop 19 data with simulated systolic blood pressure as the phenotype. We compare the number of \"true\" functional variants identified by r2VIM with those identified by linear regression analyses that use a Bonferroni correction to calculate a significance threshold. Our results show that r2VIM performed comparably to linear regression. Our findings are proof-of-concept for r2VIM, as it identifies a similar number of functional and nonfunctional variants as a more commonly used technique when the optimal importance score threshold is used.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5133476", "pubmed_id": "27980627", "doi": "10.1186/s12919-016-0021-1", "venue": "BMC Proceedings", "journal": "BMC Proceedings", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2550123383", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["215529634", "205218517", "39165726", "18600099", "10883500", "2232165", "214941026"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18812851"}

To overcome the bad feature extraction ability of the shallow architecture of ELM, the hierarchical ELM has been extensively studied as a deep architecture with multilayer neural network. However, the commonly used mean square error (MSE) criterion is very sensitive to outliers and impulsive noises, generally existing in real world data. In this paper, we investigate the correntropy to improve the robustness of the multilayer ELM and provide sparser representation. The correntropy, as a nonlinear measure of similarity, is robust to outliers and can approximate different norms (from l0 to l2). A new full correntropy based multilayer extreme learning machine (FC-MELM) algorithm is proposed to handle the classification of datasets which are corrupted by impulsive noises or outliers. The contributions of this paper are three-folds: (1) The MSE based reconstruction loss is replaced by the correntropy based loss function; In this way, the robustness of the ELM based multilayer algorithms is enhanced. (2) The traditional l1-based sparsity penalty term is also replaced by a correntropy-based sparsity penalty term, which can further improve the performance of the proposed algorithm with a sparser representation of the data. The combination of (1) and (2) provides the correntropy-based ELM autoencoder. (3) The FC-MELM is proposed by using the correntropy-based ELM autoencoder as a building block. It is notable that the FC-MELM is trained in a forward manner, which means fine-tuning procedure is not required. Thus, the FC-MELM has great advantage in learning efficiently when compared with traditional deep learning algorithms. The good property of the proposed algorithm is confirmed by the experiments on well-known benchmark datasets, including the MNIST datasets, the NYU Object Recognition Benchmark dataset, and the Moore network traffic dataset. Finally, the proposed FC-MELM algorithm is applied to address Computer Aided Cancer Diagnosis. Experiments conducted on the well-known Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data (Diagnostic) dataset are presented and show that the proposed FC-MELM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in solving computer aided cancer diagnosis problems.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2018.07.011", "venue": null, "journal": "Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2833840129", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["116858", "45873946", "207321848", "13686589", "20442151", "35396033", "724728", "19002875", "35613787", "10293023", "2489541", "15037168", "6118036", "16272269", "207103177", "1713804", "2309950", "1883779", "206757279", "7496788", "18209224", "8519058", "2720379", "7087081", "6850502", "14074189", "17546624", "6855854", "15222519", "237132", "1734230", "2678735", "10875300", "21662345", "3767412", "7649238", "5560810", "110359062", "16841801", "1852628", "122757563", "14542261", "712708", "6499324", "3072879"], "inbound_citations": ["67866999", "209460949"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126237113"}

To do so, mathematical models that are known to be ::: capable of predicting series with acceptable accuracy using the limited number of samples ::: available, such as Linear Regression Model (LR), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), ::: Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN) are employed. ::: First, different attributes of each market have been studied and the most informative ones, those ::: that can better address future behavior patterns of the price, have been identified. Then, different ::: input parameters designs for each model within each market have been examined. For example, ::: the effect of previous month\u2019s price, month indicator, Ontario demand, temperature and gas price ::: is studied. For each market, different models\u2019 forecasting results are compared and the most ::: accurate ones are ranked for each market. Following this approach, 12 months ahead electricity ::: prices in both markets have been forecasted. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for ::: each model in each market is calculated by dividing the difference between forecasted and actual ::: price of a month, by its actual price. In the case of Nord Pool different models have ended up to ::: relatively similar results, with the WNN being the best with MAPE of 11.95% and LR the worst ::: with MAPE of 17.23%. Due to more volatility characteristics of Ontario market, there is greater ::: difference between different models results. Hence identification of appropriate model to predict ::: the price in this market is of greater importance. In this market, the SVM with MAPE of 13.17% ::: and WNN of 32.95% turn out to be the most and least accurate models, respectively. ::: It can be concluded from the study that, in contrary to STPF, models that are only based on price ::: data are incapable of capturing the price trends in medium horizon. The study results also show ::: that different features on each model's performance in each market (e.g., inclusion of temperature ::: data to predict the price of market of Nord Pool using the SVM) play roles with different degrees ::: of significance in the results of the models. Ontario demand, for instance, is recognized as an ::: important factor to be included in models to achieve acceptable results, whereas inclusion of ::: temperature data into input features set of the LR model, deteriorates this model\u2019s accuracy.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "348838561", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211546540"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:153044506"}

Hence, studies of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte populations (TILs) are key to the success of advanced treatments.

Initially, outliers were detected based on the consistency of gene profiling clustering results and the original cell phenotype notation. Subsequently, we filtered out genes that are expressed in non-hematopoietic normal tissues and cancer cells. For every pair of immune cell types, we ran t-tests for each gene, and defined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from this comparison. Equal numbers of DEGs were then collected as candidate lists and numbers of conditions and minimal values for building signature matrixes were calculated. Finally, we used v -Support Vector Regression to construct a deconvolution model. The performance of our system was finally evaluated using blood biopsies from 20 adults, in which 9 immune cell types were identified using flow cytometry.

HyLogger3\u00ae (CSIRO), PS-300 Apogee and ASD Field Spec hyperspectral systems were used to characterize each sample. Using those measurements, a spectral library was generated by processing, filtering and sorting the spectral data gathered, determining distinctive spectral bands for digital classification. By using this spectral library, a digital classification method was implemented over World-View 3 imagery, covering the three beaches selected as test sites. Distinct classification methods and geospatial analyses were applied to determine land cover composition, aimed for the detection of Styrofoam and the rest of anthropogenic marine debris. Four field campaigns were carried out to validate the AMD classification and mass retrievals, performed on >300 ground based points. The AMD hyperspectral library was successfully applied for an AMD digital classification in satellite imagery.

In this paper, we propose a new automated matching method based on the extracted features of polyps by using principal component analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Our dataset comes from the 104 CT scans of 52 patients with supine and prone positions collected from three medical centers.

Data were explored using two data mining techniques, Random Forests and Bayesian Networks, and modeled using hierarchical linear regression models. In all, 664 (88.5% of sample) nurses answered the questionnaire. The authors found that different work schedules had a differential impact on work-family conflict. In addition, effective risk communication between workers and people in charge of safety and health, and participation in preventative activities, quantitative workload, performing tasks not belonging to the nursing profession, and the number of weekends/month spent at work were all strongly associated with work-family conflict. The variable \"time schedules\" also acted as an effect modifier in the relationship between effective communication and participation in preventative activities and work-family conflict. In addition, quantitative demands played a role as a mediator (30% of total effect) in the relationship between effective communication and participation in preventative activities and work-family conflict. Work-family conflict was significantly associated with burnout, sleep, and presenteeism; its association with burnout was higher than other precursors. Shift schedules that involved night work implied different workload demands, less effective communication, and participation in preventative activities than the other work schedules considered. The presence of a preventative culture directly reduced work-family conflict and indirectly via reduction of work demands. The authors conclude that the development of a preventative culture among irregular and night shiftworkers can be effective in reducing work-family conflict, while positively increasing well-being and job performance.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "20636219", "doi": "10.3109/07420528.2010.490072", "venue": "Chronobiology international", "journal": "Chronobiology international", "mag_id": "2055982810", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199410053", "151927656", "56939770", "33394510", "28640565", "195740722", "3527992", "18049046", "149839433", "4650511", "16660596", "23969334", "869495", "53905848", "9445208", "146874202", "1395836", "26796840", "27491345", "8940974", "20417544", "31310075", "46753532", "28605354"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32728174"}

Turkey, located in the Mediterranean climate zone, experiences hundreds of forest fires every year. Over the past two decades, these fires have destroyed approximately 308000 ha of forest area, threatening the sustainability of its ecosystem. This study analyzes the forest fire that occurred in the Menderes region of Izmir on July 1, 2017, by using pre- and post-fire Sentinel 2 (10 m and 20 m) and Landsat 8 (30 m) satellite images, MODIS and VIIRS fire radiative power (FRP) data (1000 m and 375 m, respectively), and reference data obtained from a field study. Hence, image processing techniques integrated with the Geographic Information System (GIS) database were applied to a satellite image data set to monitor, analyze, and map the effects of the forest fire. The results show that the land surface temperature (LST) of the burned forest area increased from 1 to 11\u00b0C. A high correlation (R = 0.81) between LST and burn severity was also determined. The burned areas were calculated using two different classification methods, and their accuracy was compared with the reference data. According to the accuracy assessment, the Sentinel (10 m) image classification gave the best result (96.43% for Maximum Likelihood, and 99.56% for Support Vector Machine). The relationship between topographical/forest parameters, burn severity and disturbance index was evaluated for spatial pattern distribution. According to the results, the areas having canopy closure between 71%\u2013100% and slope above 35% had the highest burn incidence. As a final step, a spatial correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of MODIS and VIIRS FRP data in the post-fire analysis. A high correlation was found between FRP-slope, and FRP-burn severity (0.96 and 0.88, respectively).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11707-019-0786-4", "venue": "Frontiers of Earth Science", "journal": "Frontiers of Earth Science", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2994598017", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["19460353", "26038914", "122244503", "129329094", "20900474", "17852822", "3968497", "132429783", "55613347", "130107021", "14393277", "129855902", "29228720", "14912691", "205305335", "97291425", "140668255", "128619277", "51965555", "135298248", "8560937", "16178398"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208622241"}

The main challenges for accurate CT pancreas segmentation lie in two aspects: (1) large shape variation across different patients, and (2) low contrast and blurring around the pancreas boundary. In this paper, we propose a two-stage, ensemble-based fully convolutional neural network (FCN) to solve the challenging pancreas segmentation problem in CT images. First, candidate region generation is performed by classifying patches generated by superpixels. Second, five FCNs based on the U-Net architecture are trained with different objective functions. For each network, 2.5D slices are used as the input to provide 3D image information complementarily without the need for computationally expensive 3D convolutions. Then, an ensemble model is utilized to combine the five output segmentation maps and achieve the final segmentation. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on a publicly available dataset of 82 manually segmented CT volumes via 4-fold cross-validation.

We obtained projection data from 40 low-dose chest CT scans, simulating acquisitions at 10%, 25% and 50% dose and reconstructing the scans at 1.0mm and 2.0mm slice thickness. A 3D generative adversarial network (GAN) was used to simultaneously normalize reduced dose, thick slice (2.0mm) images to normal dose (100%), thinner slice (1.0mm) images.

However, in real-world applications, such as anomaly detection and credit card fraud detection, the cost may be more important than the accuracy. Moreover, the cost usually changes in these online data, which challenges state-of-art-methods. Therefore, this paper introduces the cost of misclassification into transfer-learning of classifier, and proposes a novel online transfer learning algorithm with adaptive cost (OLAC). Firstly, we introduce the label distribution into traditional Hinge Loss Function to compute the cost of classification adaptively.

Its challenges not only lie in appearance changes of individuals which have been well-investigated in general person re-identification (ReID), but also derive from group layout and membership changes. So the key task of G-ReID is to learn representations robust to such changes. To address this issue, we propose a Transferred Single and Couple Representation Learning Network (TSCN). Its merits are two aspects: 1) Due to the lack of labelled training samples, existing G-ReID methods mainly rely on unsatisfactory hand-crafted features. To gain the superiority of deep learning models, we treat a group as multiple persons and transfer the domain of a labeled ReID dataset to a G-ReID target dataset style to learn single representations. 2) Taking into account the neighborhood relationship in a group, we further propose learning a novel couple representation between two group members, that achieves more discriminative power in G-ReID tasks. In addition, an unsupervised weight learning method is exploited to adaptively fuse the results of different views together according to result patterns.

Most of the existing metric learning methods input the features extracted directly from the original data in the preprocess phase.

In this paper, we integrate both feature extraction and metric learning into one joint optimization framework and propose a new bilevel distance metric learning model.

As rainfall forecasting involves rather complex dynamic parameters, an increasing demand for novel approaches to improve the forecasting accuracy has heightened. Recently, Rough Set Theory (RST) has attracted a wide variety of scientific applications and is extensively adopted in decision support systems. Although there are several weather prediction techniques in the existing literature, identifying significant input for modelling effective rainfall prediction is not addressed in the present mechanisms. Therefore, this investigation has examined the feasibility of using rough set based feature selection and data mining methods, namely Naive Bayes (NB), Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), J48, Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to forecast rainfall. Feature selection or reduction process is a process of identifying a significant feature subset, in which the generated subset must characterize the information system as a complete feature set. This paper introduces a novel rough set based Maximum Frequency Weighted (MFW) feature reduction technique for finding an effective feature subset for modelling an efficient rainfall forecast system. The experimental analysis and the results indicate substantial improvements of prediction models when trained using the selected feature subset. CART and J48 classifiers have achieved an improved accuracy of 83.42% and 89.72%, respectively. From the experimental study, relative humidity2 (a4) and solar radiation (a6) have been identified as the effective parameters for modelling rainfall prediction.

The wavelet decomposition output is then used as input for a forecasting model based on the LS-SVM to predict the solar PV power of each plant.

By applying only a simple training mechanism many physical systems have become exploitable unconventional computers. However, at present, many of these systems require careful selection and tuning by hand to produce usable or optimal reservoir computers. In this thesis we show the first steps to applying the reservoir model as a simple computational layer to extract exploitable information from complex material substrates. We argue that many physical substrates, even systems that in their natural state might not form usable or \"good\" reservoirs, can be configured into working reservoirs given some stimulation. To achieve this we apply techniques from evolution in materio whereby configuration is through evolved input-output signal mappings and targeted stimuli. ::: ::: In preliminary experiments the combined model and configuration method is applied to carbon nanotube/polymer composites. The results show substrates can be configured and trained as reservoir computers of varying quality. It is shown that applying the reservoir model adds greater functionality and programmability to physical substrates, without sacrificing performance. Next, the weaknesses of the technique are addressed, with the creation of new high input-output hardware system and an alternative multi-substrate framework. Lastly, a substantial effort is put into characterising the quality of a substrate for reservoir computing, i.e its ability to realise many reservoirs. From this, a methodological framework is devised. Using the framework, radically different computing substrates are compared and assessed, something previously not possible. As a result, a new understanding of the relationships between substrate, tasks and properties is possible, outlining the way for future exploration and optimisation of new computing substrates.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2921151349", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85519202"}

In many cases, prediction of family membership and even substrate specificity is possible from enzyme sequence alone, using a nearest neighbour classification rule. However, the combination of structural information and sequence information can improve the interpretability and accuracy of predictive models. The method presented here, Active Site Classification (ASC), automatically extracts the residues lining the active site from one representative three-dimensional structure and the corresponding residues from sequences of other members of the family. From a set of representatives with known substrate specificity, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) can then learn a model of substrate specificity. Applied to a sequence of unknown specificity, the SVM can then predict the most likely substrate.

Therefore, motor imagery EEG of stroke patients lacks of specific discriminant features as appearances of healthy people, which significantly blocks CSP to seek the optimal projection subspace.

A fundamental problem that has largely been oversighted in the current research is the way of dealing with the unknown class which collectively includes all the objects that are of no interest to the application developer. In the training stage, these objects are either completely removed or labeled as unknown, resulting in a trained model which is not fully and fairly exposed to the actual sample space. In the test stage, the unknown objects are naturally present and provided to the classifier, causing a significant drop of the classification accuracy\u2014 usually 20%\u223c30%. Simply improving the features or the classifier will not address the root cause problem. In this paper, we propose a labeling framework combining both Conditional Random Field (CRF) and P I -SVM to specifically solve the problem caused by the unknown class. First, we use a CRF to model the contextual relations in the 3D space, for which the parameters for both node potential and edge potential are learned from training data. Then, we make use of the rejection strategy of the P I -SVM, which estimates an unnormalized probability for each class. Finally, we reinforce the result of CRF with the belief provided by the P I -SVM, and the labeling result is based on the agreement of the two classifiers. The proposed method takes advantage of the global optimization of CRF and the advantage of unknown rejection of P I -SVM.

The context model and ALEX are also compared. It applies ALEX to several previously published data sets that have been fitted accurately by the context model. The main goal is to provide some quantitative tests of ALEX and demonstrate that it performs well in situations in which the context model has performed well. It also discusses the advantages that are yielded by elaborating the context model as an exemplar-based network. The chapter demonstrates a variety of phenomena that are characterized well by ALEX but not by the context model.

While short-term memory (STM) capacity for spoken language spans up to 7 \u00b1 2 items, the verbal working memory capacity for sign languages appears to be lower at 5 \u00b1 2. The assumption that both auditory and visual communication (sign language) rely on the same memory buffers led to the claims of impairment of STM buffers in sign language users. Yet, no common model deals with both the sensory and linguistic nature of spoken and sign languages. The authors present a generalized neural model (GNM) of short-term memory use across modalities, which accounts for experimental results in both sign and spoken languages. GNM postulates that during hierarchically organized processing phases in language comprehension, spoken language users rely on neural resources for spatial representation in sequential rehearsal strategy, i.e., the phonological loop. The spatial nature of sign language precludes signers from utilizing a similar \u2018overflow\u2019 strategy, which speakers rely on to extend their STM capacity.

Consequently, there is a high demand for automatic analytical routine procedures using computer vision techniques to overcome this issue.

This paper presents a framework for global estimation of depth to bedrock (DTB). Observations were extracted from a global compilation of soil profile data (ca. 1,30,000 locations) and borehole data (ca. 1.6 million locations). Additional pseudo-observations generated by expert knowledge were added to fill in large sampling gaps. The model training points were then overlaid on a stack of 155 covariates including DEM-based hydrological and morphological derivatives, lithologic units, MODIS surface reflectance bands and vegetation indices derived from the MODIS land products. Global spatial prediction models were developed using random forest and Gradient Boosting Tree algorithms. The final predictions were generated at the spatial resolution of 250 m as an ensemble prediction of the two independently fitted models. The 10\u2013fold cross-validation shows that the models explain 59% for absolute DTB and 34% for censored DTB (depths deep than 200 cm are predicted as 200 cm). The model for occurrence of R horizon (bedrock) within 200 cm does a good job. Visual comparisons of predictions in the study areas where more detailed maps of depth to bedrock exist show that there is a general match with spatial patterns from similar local studies. Limitation of the data set and extrapolation in data spare areas should not be ignored in applications. To improve accuracy of spatial prediction, more borehole drilling logs will need to be added to supplement the existing training points in under-represented areas.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1002/2016MS000686", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems", "mag_id": "2795761225,2564901692", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["145922738", "135247344", "215540625", "209436398", "52858428", "207916902", "134801385", "182284555", "214948811", "69701460", "44215641", "4722508", "132274745", "181447261", "53604985", "90164968", "134690883", "189927461", "215516555", "214969280", "210894470", "209542272", "14728657", "52294951"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125503496"}

As the proposed representation learning problem is essentially a neighbor reconstruction problem, domain knowledge can be easily incorporated in the form of an appropriate definition of similarity between objects. Based on that observation, our framework can leverage any off-the-shelf similarity search algorithms or side information to find the neighbor of an input object. Applications of other algorithms (e.g., association rule mining) in our framework are also possible, given that the appropriate definition of neighbor can vary in different contexts. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework in many diverse domains, including images, text, and time series, and for various data mining tasks including classification, clustering, and visualization.

Feature selection can improve the accuracy of classification algorithms and reduce their computation complexity by removing the irrelevant and redundant features. SVM is a classification algorithm that has been used in many areas, such as bioinformatics and pattern recognition. However, the classification accuracy of SVM depends mainly on tuning its hyperparameters (i.e., SVM model selection). This paper presents a framework that is comprised of the following two major components. First, Self-Adaptive Cohort Intelligence (SACI) algorithm is proposed, which is a new variation of the emerging metaheuristic algorithm, Cohort Intelligence (CI). Second, SACI is integrated with SVM resulting in a new hybrid approach referred to as SVM\u2013SACI for simultaneous feature selection and SVM model selection. SACI differs from CI by employing tournament-based mutation and self-adaptive scheme for sampling interval and mutation rate. Furthermore, SACI is both real-coded and binary-coded, which makes it directly applicable to both binary and continuous domains. The performance of SACI for feature selection and SVM model selection was examined using ten benchmark datasets from the literature and compared with those of CI and five well-known metaheuristics, namely, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). The comparative results demonstrate that SACI outperformed CI and comparable to or better than the other compared metaheuristics in terms of the SVM classification accuracy and dimensionality reduction. In addition, SACI requires less tuning efforts as the number of its control parameters is less than those of the other compared metaheuristics due to adopting the self-adaptive scheme in SACI. Finally, this research suggests employing more efficient methods for high-dimensional or large datasets due to the relatively high training time required by search strategies based on metaheuristics when applied to such datasets.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2017.06.030", "venue": "Expert Syst.

Our approach is based on the framework of landmark detection via Random Forest (RF) regression and shape regularization via hierarchical sparse shape composition. We propose a visual feature FL-HoG (Flexible-Level Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and a feature selection algorithm based on trace radio optimization to improve the robustness and the efficacy of RF-based landmark detection. The landmark detection result is then used in a hierarchical sparse shape composition framework for shape regularization. Finally, the extracted shape contour is fine-tuned by a post-processing step based on low level image features. The experimental results demonstrate that our feature selection algorithm reduces the feature dimension in a factor of 40 and improves both training and test efficiency.

ILP systems have successful applications in the learning of structure-activity rules for drug design, semantic grammars rules, finite element mesh design rules and rules for prediction of protein structure and mutagenic molecules. The strong applications in ILP can be contrasted with relatively weak PAC-learning results (even highly-restricted forms of logic programs are known to be prediction-hard). It has been recently argued that the mismatch is due to distributional assumptions made in application domains. These assumptions can be modelled as a Bayesian prior probability representing subjective degrees of belief. Other authors have argued for the use of Bayesian prior distributions for reasons different to those here, though this has not lead to a new model of polynomial-time learnability. Incorporation of Bayesian prior distributions over time-bounded hypotheses in PAC leads to a new model called U-learnability. It is argued that U-learnability is more appropriate than PAC for Universal (Turing computable) languages. Time-bounded logic programs have been shown to be polynomially U-learnable under certain distributions. The use of time-bounded hypotheses enforces decidability and allows a unified characterisation of speed-up learning and inductive learning.

LiDAR remote sensing is a rapidly evolving technology for quantifying aboveground biomass and thereby carbon pools; however, little work has evaluated the efficacy of repeat LiDAR measures for spatially monitoring aboveground carbon pools through time. Our study objective was therefore to evaluate the use of discrete return airborne LiDAR for quantifying biomass change and carbon flux from repeat field and LiDAR surveys. We collected LiDAR data in 2003 and 2009 across ~ 20,000 ha of an actively managed, mixed conifer forest landscape in northern Idaho. The Random Forest machine learning algorithm was used to impute aboveground biomass pools of trees, saplings, shrubs, herbaceous plants, coarse and fine woody debris, litter, and duff using field-based forest inventory data and metrics derived from the LiDAR collections. Separate predictive tree aboveground biomass models were developed from the 2003 and 2009 field and LiDAR data, and biomass change was estimated at the plot, pixel, and landscape levels by subtracting 2003 predictions from 2009 predictions. Traditional stand exam data were used to independently validate 2003 and 2009 tree aboveground biomass predictions and tree aboveground biomass change estimates at the stand level. Over this 6-year period, we found a mean increase in tree aboveground biomass due to forest growth across the non-harvested portions of 4.1 Mg/ha/yr. We found that 26.3% of the landscape had been harvested during this time period which outweighed growth at the landscape level, resulting in a net tree aboveground biomass change of \u2212 5.7 Mg/ha/yr, and \u2212 2.3 Mg/ha/yr in total aboveground carbon, summed across all the aboveground biomass pools. Change in aboveground biomass was related to forest successional status; younger stands gained two- to three-fold less biomass than did more mature stands. This result suggests that even the most mature forest stands are valuable carbon sinks, and implies that forest management decisions that include longer harvest rotation cycles are likely to favor higher levels of aboveground carbon storage in this system. A 30-fold difference in LiDAR sampling density between the 2003 and 2009 collections did not affect plot-scale biomass estimation. These results suggest that repeat LiDAR surveys are useful for accurately quantifying high resolution, spatially explicit biomass and carbon dynamics in conifer forests.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2012.02.023", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2045626198", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["86196783", "921489", "127063068", "55708219", "107364223", "133694127", "9030856", "39771744", "33667864", "12007122", "36784164", "200062551", "24596318", "7530704", "126767942", "130374375", "16888352", "130817245", "14554231", "38477000", "155070571", "40077807", "140554529", "129105480", "129617953", "5140933", "4794260", "8945793", "130778621", "39692953", "129695559", "86134888", "7191780", "55188432", "85674550", "13370660", "10399155", "64607829", "126575034", "39361255", "131027032", "128744351", "42458151", "129305766", "128909759", "20454819", "6164799", "85776011", "99140956", "14101907", "131456341", "86286399", "59578775", "84700117", "85089652", "126814483", "129450900", "129522230", "140565544"], "inbound_citations": ["29000373", "20425095", "51784246", "21749512", "135003173", "55716593", "7239782", "197473373", "15449286", "1127913", "16094812", "54555008", "54944526", "51695048", "44547474", "23745666", "2552906", "18022056", "209393021", "125947287", "43151461", "45771574", "55487384", "131564757", "2963728", "13826115", "2780402", "14105138", "201635900", "32564148", "15102426", "51965762", "115150743", "134672724", "59068738", "134015136", "56481877", "132074984", "17034292", "128108267", "204959911", "70141", "19092611", "26725165", "92979232", "73552635", "960027", "14338221", "41265506", "198402318", "55251493", "12710393", "206001932", "52096054", "53100313", "52076157", "4178672", "26259127", "25561130", "121755169", "17793954", "39913386", "53954841", "53383068", "144207287", "135035558", "215009674", "210866676", "214872887"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14625636"}

They provide georeferenced, irregularly distributed 3D point clouds of high altimetric accuracy. Moreover, these systems can provide for a single laser pulse, multiple returns or echoes, which correspond to different illuminated objects. In addition to multi-echo laser scanners, full-waveform systems are able to record 1D signals representing a train of echoes caused by reflections at different targets. These systems provide more information about the structure and the physical characteristics of the targets. Many approaches have been developed, for urban mapping, based on aerial lidar solely or combined with multispectral image data. However, they have not assessed the importance of input features. In this paper, we focus on a multi-source framework using aerial lidar (multi-echo and full waveform) and aerial multispectral image data. We aim to study the feature relevance for dense urban scenes. The Random Forests algorithm is chosen as a classifier: it runs efficiently on large datasets, and provides measures of feature importance for each class.

Recent years have seen a large body of work on detecting changes and building prediction models from stream data, with a vague understanding on the types of the concept drifting and the impact of different types of concept drifting on the mining algorithms. In this paper, we first categorize concept drifting into two scenarios: Loose Concept Drifting (LCD) and Rigorous Concept Drifting (RCD), and then propose solutions to handle each of them separately. For LCD data streams, because concepts in adjacent data chunks are sufficiently close to each other, we apply kernel mean matching (KMM) method to minimize the discrepancy of the data chunks in the kernel space. Such a minimization process will produce weighted instances to build classifier ensemble and handle concept drifting data streams. For RCD data streams, because genuine concepts in adjacent data chunks may randomly and rapidly change, we propose a new Optimal Weights Adjustment (OWA) method to determine the optimum weight values for classifiers trained from the most recent (up-to-date) data chunk, such that those classifiers can form an accurate classifier ensemble to predict instances in the yet-to-come data chunk. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets will show that weighted instance approach is preferable when the concept drifting is mainly caused by the changing of the class prior probability; whereas the weighted classifier approach is preferable when the concept drifting is mainly triggered by the changing of the conditional probability.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1401890.1401987", "venue": "KDD", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2043738837", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2071130", "1891593", "2274179", "2122679", "7062460", "11868540", "5364873", "6401357", "5874117", "583706", "8153773", "9238949", "6669989", "15781767", "7517175", "5643143", "70831", "140109802"], "inbound_citations": ["9311721", "29891596", "18986073", "17267096", "17267096", "18697406", "3404108", "46520224", "53245141", "5865705", "55896293", "23951160", "16685268", "32167274", "4697309", "15192294", "15119353", "15885581", "15308287", "1079016", "7930328", "17897226", "207757814", "14200475", "2491298", "902407", "37022576", "16000505", "17030468", "15206179", "18846303", "32219273", "8564910", "14035901", "16833771", "7491486", "27914615", "20433447", "69449458", "2804213", "207208264", "14827822", "207680538", "67100478", "452100", "189927488", "124943914", "9125423", "16732688", "24562045", "6225732", "16748409", "16366007", "32389281", "209322653", "1369821", "7042527", "201087802", "18328795", "58764803"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3779768"}

Many computer scientists have been working on the methods to develop a machine learning based algorithm using statistical learning methods to tackle this problem.

It is known that different types of X-ray images represent different object characteristics (e.g., material or density). Thus, effectively using different types of X-ray images as multiple modalities is promising to achieve more reliable recognition performance. In this paper, we explore different stage of ensemble approaches for X-ray object-recognition and propose an approach that exploits a classifier ensemble by using the multimodality information of X-ray images on a single-view object. We use a deep neural network to learn a good representation for each modality, which is used to train the base classifiers.

Unlike the hybrid approach described in the previous chapter, CTC models all aspects of the sequence with a single neural network, and does not require the network to be combined with a hidden Markov model. It also does not require presegmented training data, or external postprocessing to extract the label sequence from the network outputs.

This study explores a new technique that uses blood and biochemical measurements to recognize the overweight condition. A new machine learning technique, an extreme learning machine, was developed to accurately detect the overweight status from a pool of 225 overweight and 251 healthy subjects. The group included 179 males and 297 females. The detection method was rigorously evaluated against the real-life dataset for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) criterion. Additionally, the feature selection was investigated to identify correlating factors for the overweight status. The results demonstrate that there are significant differences in blood and biochemical indexes between healthy and overweight people (p-value < 0.01). According to the feature selection, the most important correlated indexes are creatinine, hemoglobin, hematokrit, uric Acid, red blood cells, high density lipoprotein, alanine transaminase, triglyceride, and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase.

Most importantly, the design of our benchmark experiment is inspired from clinical trial methodology, thus avoiding common pitfalls and major sources of biases.ConclusionRF performed better than LR according to the considered accuracy measured in approximately 69% of the datasets. The mean difference between RF and LR was 0.029 (95%-CI =[0.022,0.038]) for the accuracy, 0.041 (95%-CI =[0.031,0.053]) for the Area Under the Curve, and \u2212 0.027 (95%-CI =[\u22120.034,\u22120.021]) for the Brier score, all measures thus suggesting a significantly better performance of RF. As a side-result of our benchmarking experiment, we observed that the results were noticeably dependent on the inclusion criteria used to select the example datasets, thus emphasizing the importance of clear statements regarding this dataset selection process. We also stress that neutral studies similar to ours, based on a high number of datasets and carefully designed, will be necessary in the future to evaluate further variants, implementations or parameters of random forests which may yield improved accuracy compared to the original version with default values.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6050737", "pubmed_id": "30016950", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-018-2264-5", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2737706773", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["85543229", "54443545", "189763506", "213773838", "210333009", "125287703", "212634023", "174802834", "215484630", "1941293", "209356329", "210835918", "195742276", "198953301", "73456607", "119103287", "211832189", "71146184"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28702815"}

A three bladed wind turbine was chosen and the faults like blade bend, blade cracks, blade erosion, hub-blade loose connection and pitch angle twist were considered in the study. This problem is formulated as a machine learning problem which consists of three phases, namely feature extraction, feature selection and feature classification. Histogram features were extracted from vibration signals and feature selection was carried out using J48 decision tree algorithm. Feature classification was performed using lazy classifiers like nearest neighbour, k-nearest neighbours, locally weighted learning and K-star classifier.

The first one is extracting the motion and texture features from RGBD sequences by proposing a feature extracting method to extract feature vector values based on the Gray-Level Co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) of the dense optical flow pattern and the well-known Haralick features from these matrices by measuring meaningful properties such as energy, contrast, homogeneity, entropy, sum average, and correlation to capture local spatial and temporal characteristics of the motion through the neighboring optical flow fields (orientation and magnitude). Secondly, we present a performance comparison of five different classifiers such as Artificial Neural Networks, Naive Bayes classifier, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine. Various numerical experiments results are carried on four well-known public datasets (Gaming Datasets, Cornell Activity Datasets, MSR Daily Activity 3D and Online RGBD Datasets) to verify the effectiveness of these classification algorithms.

Most previous stereoscopic image quality assessment (SIQA) methods have been based only on the luminance component of the images; in addition, the basis of human visual perception is critical to image quality assessment and lies on the low-dimensional manifold. Inspired by this, a new perceptual SIQA method is proposed, which includes two stages: training stage and quality prediction stage. In the training stage, the authors apply Tucker decomposition to RGB images to reduce dimensions along colour channels to produce training sets, and the projection matrix is obtained through manifold learning. In the quality prediction stage, considering the binocular visual characteristics of visual perception, the overall stereoscopic estimate depends on the monocular image quality via a local energy ratio based pooling strategy and cyclopean based binocular quality.

We test the performance of the proposed architecture on a conversational telephone dataset which illustrate that the computation time can be significantly reduced without a significant decrease in the spotting accuracy.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900073", "venue": "2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)", "journal": "2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2608183891", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207058706", "36073970", "53468867", "1712720", "26279416", "12834250", "17576149", "1816414", "16916751", "17471730", "1166498", "206741496", "11298362", "2654186", "9901844", "206514100", "7360763", "1774023"], "inbound_citations": ["54437265"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5192878"}

Given such enhancement of Internet of knowledge on SNS, the probability of spreading spammers on it is also increasing day by day. Several traditional machine-learning methods, such as support vector machines and naive Bayes, have been proposed to detect spammers on SNS. Note, however, that these methods are not efficient due to some issues, such as lower generalization performance and higher training time. An Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is an efficient classification method that can provide good generalization performance at higher training speed. Nonetheless, it suffers from overfitting and ill-posed problem that can degrade its generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a Bagging ELM-based spammer detection framework that identifies spammers in SNSs with the help of multiple ELMs that we combined using the bagging method. We constructed a labeled dataset of the two most prominent SNSs -- Twitter and Facebook -- to evaluate the performance of our framework.

The Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), which were derived from public knee OA studies, were used to train the model. The performance of the XGBoost model is superior to four well-known machine learning algorithms and identifies the risk features from the biomedical literature.

We propose a feature extraction method using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and superpixel based Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Both middle and high level spatial features are learned using the CNN. Local texture features from superpixel-based LBP are extracted, and are also used as input to Support Vector Machines (SVM) for weed classification. Experimental results on the hyperspectral and remote sensing datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show that it outperforms several feature extraction approaches.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs11141692", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2957122950", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["34303167", "35223449", "49545311", "53037796", "15299985", "16086858", "111050803", "110993175", "45688629", "59235190", "35660004", "16451924", "18768929", "7599191", "18803818", "21210615", "8587614", "11863722", "177653", "1806278", "9855973", "13759473", "25948104", "18811180", "8324343", "30584561", "13344564", "206439613", "3680337", "133331293", "55655522", "33038943", "22220747", "3273477", "3960646", "40865014", "206592191", "40896056", "18338127", "60633363", "2357415"], "inbound_citations": ["211057499"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199093339"}

Predicting and mapping understory is a critical need for forest management and conservation planning, but it has proved difficult. LiDAR has the potential to generate remotely sensed forest understory structure data, yet this potential has to be fully validated. Our objective was to examine the capacity of LiDAR point cloud data to predict forest understory cover. We modeled ground-based observations of understory structure in three vertical strata (0.5 m to < 1.5 m, 1.5 m to < 2.5 m, 2.5 m to < 3.5 m) as a function of a variety of LiDAR metrics using both mixed-effects and Random Forest models. We compared four understory LiDAR metrics designed to control for the spatial heterogeneity of sampling density. The four metrics were highly correlated and they all produced high values of variance explained in mixed-effects models. The top-ranked model used a voxel-based understory metric along with vertical stratum (Akaike weight = 1, explained variance = 87%, SMAPE=15.6%). We found evidence of occlusion of LiDAR pulses in the lowest stratum but no evidence that the occlusion influenced the predictability of understory structure. The Random Forest model results were consistent with those of the mixed-effects models, in that all four understory LiDAR metrics were identified as important, along with vertical stratum. The Random Forest model explained 74.4% of the variance, but had a lower cross-validation error of 12.9%. Based on these results, we conclude that the best approach to predict understory structure is using the mixed-effects model with the voxel-based understory LiDAR metric along with vertical stratum, but that other understory LiDAR metrics (fractional cover, normalized cover and leaf area density) would still be effective in mixed-effects and Random Forest modelling approaches.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/698399", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2960272772", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["85081647", "83843748", "86456071", "52083444", "54932163", "59395723", "54017578", "92489937", "33832665", "797940", "129048928", "84306555", "15763020", "73685665", "87057897", "134293982", "131328838", "129306281", "140563727", "62229412", "122266405", "3093707", "17820750", "21196012", "14460926", "82206879", "85089652", "4599193", "54801038", "55973514", "128542144", "128494151", "17793954"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203895168"}

For example, effects of disturbances on individual trees are often contingent on the size, configuration, and other properties of neighboring trees. Wildfires can modify postfire properties of individual trees as well as of entire forest stands, both of which can affect subsequent ecological processes, including subsequent disturbances. In recent years, much has been learned about how disturbances interact, but numerous questions concerning underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. For example, the relative importance of forest properties at different spatial scales in determining how fires affect forest susceptibility to subsequent disturbances is not well understood. This study explicitly compares the relative importance of tree vs. fine-scale neighborhood effects (e.g., stand properties at <7 m radii), on susceptibility to a 1940s' spruce beetle outbreak. Attributes of individual trees and of stand structure were spatially reconstructed at five 250-m2 sites that were partly burned in the late 19th century and then affected by spruce beetle outbreak in the 1940s. Random Forest models and classification trees were used to compare the relative importance of variables for susceptibility to spruce beetle attack. Individual tree properties (diameter at breast height and age) were the most important predictors of susceptibility to the outbreak across all sites combined and at each of the sites individually. In contrast, neighborhood effects were poor predictors of susceptibility. This study suggests wildfires reduce susceptibility to outbreaks primarily by reducing the size of postfire live trees and only secondarily by modifying stand structure. One implication of this is that management strategies that aim to modify stand structure over large areas in order to reduce susceptibility to spruce beetle outbreaks may be unnecessarily intensive.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1002/ecs2.1485", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecosphere", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2532086695", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["127733946", "73723412", "1632906", "846498", "86131489", "10754848", "16036351", "59496921", "56390785", "28240770", "8777608", "55620902", "85677871", "14736987", "86013000", "31621719", "80917600", "42013294", "86310142", "56051886", "53378910", "83971442", "83646038", "16681310", "36137745", "127050722", "83909756", "84468904", "13401446", "6278080", "85938235", "83585175", "83216418", "129193843", "83700452", "86195692", "127609580", "54914233", "86782517"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:89561669"}

However, with the growing number of known tertiary (3D) protein structures, researchers have discovered that some proteins can alter their structures in response to a change in their surroundings or with the help of other proteins or ligands. Such structural shifts play a crucial role with respect to the protein function. To this end, we propose a machine learning method for the prediction of the flexible/rigid regions of proteins (referred to as FlexRP); the method is based on a novel sequence representation and feature selection. Knowledge of the flexible/rigid regions may provide insights into the protein folding process and the 3D structure prediction. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The flexible/rigid regions were defined based on a dataset, which includes protein sequences that have multiple experimental structures, and which was previously used to study the structural conservation of proteins. Sequences drawn from this dataset were represented based on feature sets that were proposed in prior research, such as PSI-BLAST profiles, composition vector and binary sequence encoding, and a newly proposed representation based on frequencies of k-spaced amino acid pairs. These representations were processed by feature selection to reduce the dimensionality. Several machine learning methods for the prediction of flexible/rigid regions and two recently proposed methods for the prediction of conformational changes and unstructured regions were compared with the proposed method. The FlexRP method, which applies Logistic Regression and collocation-based representation with 95 features, obtained 79.5% accuracy. The two runner-up methods, which apply the same sequence representation and Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers, obtained 79.2% and 78.4% accuracy, respectively. The remaining considered methods are characterized by accuracies below 70%. Finally, the Na\u00efve Bayes method is shown to provide the highest sensitivity for the prediction of flexible regions, while FlexRP and SVM give the highest sensitivity for rigid regions. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: A new sequence representation that uses k-spaced amino acid pairs is shown to be the most efficient in the prediction of the flexible/rigid regions of protein sequences. The proposed FlexRP method provides the highest prediction accuracy of about 80%. The experimental tests show that the FlexRP and SVM methods achieved high overall accuracy and the highest sensitivity for rigid regions, while the best quality of the predictions for flexible regions is achieved by the Na\u00efve Bayes method.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC1863424", "pubmed_id": "17437643", "doi": "10.1186/1472-6807-7-25", "venue": "BMC Structural Biology", "journal": "BMC Structural Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1996768014", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["615397", "205016620", "6706724", "19627742", "8094736", "12203794", "37578277", "36086002", "9646738", "25057740", "37616998", "37105106", "36739221", "13061890", "37069742", "19165293", "31060651", "34429770", "15303493", "10151090", "6087823", "4366158", "26707269", "4355553", "12386390", "1476821", "2070891", "1682811", "9338011", "667586", "1536643", "15203398", "39158533", "9681605", "3135378", "4068670", "16908872", "7252883", "1853805", "16415485", "123582503", "26492304", "17605327", "22770892", "4473069", "1340978", "5322427", "140109802", "44971656"], "inbound_citations": ["24748500", "199437284", "1054248", "88559983", "26421355", "22490092", "20505577", "27777198", "10693631", "16765884", "21775270", "3714250", "6798852", "202557088", "5181175", "208632698", "3658125", "48363240", "6218704", "10888592", "12985469", "1181102", "83961326", "10555603", "18478554", "2190841", "59603830", "17815381", "215205964", "16393146", "67013816", "590014", "1578191", "7522629", "5342963"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9179886"}

Nowadays, companies are spending more effort in machine learning to predict the sport outcomes. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful techniques that handle classification problems effectively and efficiently. However, SVM models lack in rule generation. So, this examination leads towards the development of Hybrid Fuzzy-SVM model (HFSVM) by integrating fuzzy approach and SVM technique for prediction of the basketball game outcomes that help the coaches, teams and players to enhance their performance. The HFSVM model combines the advantage of both SVM technique and fuzzy approach, which is a unique strength of SVM and rule generation ability of fuzzy approach using fuzzy membership functions. The HFSVM model is compared with SVM model and the empirical results showed that the HFSVM model not only provides better results than SVM model but also provides relatively satisfactory prediction accuracy.

In this paper, we present a LF image compression framework driven by a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based sub-aperture image (SAI) generation and a cascaded hierarchical coding structure. Specifically, we sparsely sample the SAIs in LF and propose the GAN of LF (LF-GAN) to generate the unsampled SAIs by analogy with adversarial learning conditioned on its surrounding contexts. In particular, the LF-GAN learns to interpret both the angular and spatial context of the LF structure and, meanwhile, generates intermediate hypothesis for the unsampled SAIs in a certain position. Subsequently, the sampled SAIs and the residues of the generated-unsampled SAIs are re-organized as pseudo-sequences and compressed by standard video codecs. Finally, the hierarchical coding structure is adopted for the sampled SAI to effectively remove the inter-view redundancies. During the training process of LF-GAN, the pixel-wise Euclidean loss and the adversarial loss are chosen as the optimization objective, such that sharp textures with less blurring in details can be produced.

In order to make full use of the spatial contextual information, object-oriented classification and pairwise conditional random fields (CRFs) are widely used. However, the segmentation scale choice is a challenging problem in object-oriented classification, and the classification result of pairwise CRF always has an oversmooth appearance. In this paper, a hybrid object-oriented CRF classification framework for HSR imagery, namely, CRF $+$ OO, is proposed to address these problems by integrating object-oriented classification and CRF classification. In CRF $+$ OO, a probabilistic pixel classification is first performed, and then, the classification results of two CRF models with different potential functions are used to obtain the segmentation map by a connected-component labeling algorithm. As a result, an object-level classification fusion scheme can be used, which integrates the object-oriented classifications using a majority voting strategy at the object level to obtain the final classification result.

The method is based on the neurofuzzy modeling presented in Chaps. 3 and 4, which combines the definition of fuzzy dynamical systems with the recurrent high-order neural networks. When the neurofuzzy model matches the unknown plant, we provide a comprehensive and rigorous analysis based on Lyapunov stability of the closed-loop system. Convergence of the states to zero or to a residual set or to a reference signal, plus boundedness of all other signals in the closed-loop is guaranteed without the need of parameter (weights) convergence, which is ensured only if a sufficiency-of-excitation condition is satisfied. The existence of the control signal and the boundedness of the weight convergence is always ensured by introducing the method of parameter modified hopping which is incorporated in the weight updating laws. Furthermore, we present direct adaptive regulation results of unknown nonlinear dynamical systems, paying special attention to the analysis of modeling errors and the model order problem. In these results, the model error is expressed by adding in the NF model a new disturbance term. The disturbance depends both on input and system states and on a nonzero term that is not necessarily known. A robustifying analysis of the developed method is also presented for the several disturbance cases. Moreover, the proposed approximation method is analyzed for its robustness when a smaller number of states is assumed. The omission of states, referred to as model order problem, is modeled by introducing in the approximation equations a disturbance term, which depends on the unknown (omitted) states. The applicability of the method is also tested on a well-known simulated nonlinear system where it is shown that by following the proposed procedure one can obtain asymptotic regulation or trajectory tracking.

Our method first combines holistic and local distance-based features so that facial expressions could be characterized in more detail. The combined distance-based features are subsequently quantized to form mid-level features using the bag of words approach. The synergistic effect of these steps leads to much improved class separability and thus we can use a typical method, e.g., Support Vector Machine (SVM), to perform classification.

However, the calculation of similarity depends on the adopted measure and the available features, which may lead that the similarity scores vary dramatically from one to another, and it will not work when facing the incomplete data. Besides, supervised learning based methods usually need both positive and negative samples to train the prediction models, whereas in drug-disease pairs data there are only some verified interactions (positive samples) and a lot of unlabeled pairs. To train the models, many methods simply treat the unlabeled samples as negative ones, which may introduce artificial noises. Herein, we propose a method to predict drug-disease associations without the need of similarity information, and select more likely negative samples.ResultsIn the proposed EMP-SVD (Ensemble Meta Paths and Singular Value Decomposition), we introduce five meta paths corresponding to different kinds of interaction data, and for each meta path we generate a commuting matrix. Every matrix is factorized into two low rank matrices by SVD which are used for the latent features of drugs and diseases respectively. The features are combined to represent drug-disease pairs. We build a base classifier via Random Forest for each meta path and five base classifiers are combined as the final ensemble classifier. In order to train out a more reliable prediction model, we select more likely negative ones from unlabeled samples under the assumption that non-associated drug and disease pair have no common interacted proteins. The experiments have shown that the proposed EMP-SVD method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches. Case studies by literature investigation have found that the proposed EMP-SVD can mine out many drug-disease associations, which implies the practicality of EMP-SVD.ConclusionsThe proposed EMP-SVD can integrate the interaction data among drugs, proteins and diseases, and predict the drug-disease associations without the need of similarity information.

We present a novel machine learning (ML) method of processing automated performance metrics (APMs) to evaluate surgical performance and predict clinical outcomes after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). ::: ::: ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS ::: We trained three ML algorithms utilizing APMs directly from robot system data (training material) and hospital length of stay (LOS; training label) (\u22642 days and >2 days) from 78 RARP cases, and selected the algorithm with the best performance. The selected algorithm categorized the cases as \"Predicted as expected LOS (pExp-LOS)\" and \"Predicted as extended LOS (pExt-LOS).\" We compared postoperative outcomes of the two groups (Kruskal-Wallis/Fisher's exact tests). The algorithm then predicted individual clinical outcomes, which we compared with actual outcomes (Spearman's correlation/Fisher's exact tests). Finally, we identified five most relevant APMs adopted by the algorithm during predicting. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The \"Random Forest-50\" (RF-50) algorithm had the best performance, reaching 87.2% accuracy in predicting LOS (73 cases as \"pExp-LOS\" and 5 cases as \"pExt-LOS\"). The \"pExp-LOS\" cases outperformed the \"pExt-LOS\" cases in surgery time (3.7 hours vs 4.6 hours, p = 0.007), LOS (2 days vs 4 days, p = 0.02), and Foley duration (9 days vs 14 days, p = 0.02). Patient outcomes predicted by the algorithm had significant association with the \"ground truth\" in surgery time (p < 0.001, r = 0.73), LOS (p = 0.05, r = 0.52), and Foley duration (p < 0.001, r = 0.45). The five most relevant APMs, adopted by the RF-50 algorithm in predicting, were largely related to camera manipulation. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: To our knowledge, ours is the first study to show that APMs and ML algorithms may help assess surgical RARP performance and predict clinical outcomes. With further accrual of clinical data (oncologic and functional data), this process will become increasingly relevant and valuable in surgical assessment and training.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29448809", "doi": "10.1089/end.2018.0035", "venue": "Journal of endourology", "journal": "Journal of endourology", "mag_id": "2788941211", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["195744120", "44135603", "67074723", "211063539", "53031967", "195773923", "208301823", "207894750", "148574224", "57617562", "204779788", "44147390"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46789488"}

Malwares have become a significant threat to computer systems and recently, a massive growth has been observed by experts in the number and sophistication of new malwares.

However, the task of classifying malwares has become more challenging since the introduction of code obfuscation and metamorphism techniques. These techniques easily alter the malwares' code signatures and make the static techniques of malware detection ineffective. Dynamic analysis is effective but time-consuming. Recently, image processing techniques along with machine learning techniques have been explored by researchers for visualization and classification of malwares. In this paper, we introduce a new approach ULBP-RF that uses Uniform local binary pattern with circular neighborhood strategy to extract features from the malware images dataset.

The full rank covariance matrix, which lies on a Riemannian manifold, is projected on the tangent Euclidean space and concatenated to the mean vector for representing a given image. In this paper, we test the following features for describing the original image: scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), histogram of gradients (HOG), and weber's law descriptor (WLD). To improve the baseline version of GOLD, we describe the covariance matrix using a set of visual features that are fed into a set of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The SVMs are combined by sum rule. The scores obtained by an SVM trained using the original GOLD approach and the SVMs trained with visual features are then combined by sum rule. Experiments show that our proposed variant outperforms the original GOLD approach. The superior performance of the proposed system is validated across a large set of datasets. Particularly interesting is the performance obtained in two widely used person re-identification datasets, CAVIAR4REID and IAS, where the proposed GOLD variant is coupled with a state-of-the-art ensemble to obtain an improvement of performance on these two datasets. Moreover, we performed further tests that combine GOLD with non-binary features (local ternary/quinary patterns) and deep transfer learning. The fusion among SVMs trained with deep features and the SVMs trained using the ternary/quinary coding ensemble is demonstrated to obtain a very high performance across datasets.

In particular, a clustering solution is firstly achieved by a clustering ensembles method, then the population based incremental learning algorithm is adopted to find the feature subset that best fits the obtained clustering solution.

To attest its capacity, the technique is compared with other consolidated solar forecasting strategies such as Multilayer Perceptron, Radial Base Function and Support Vector Regression. Additionally, integration of AI methods in a new adaptive topology based on the Portfolio Theory (PT) is proposed hereby to improve solar forecasts. PT takes advantage of diversified forecast assets: when one of the assets shows prediction errors, these are offset by another asset. After testing with data from Spain and Brazil, results show that the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for predictions using DL is 6.89% and for the proposed integration (called PrevPT) is 5.36% concerning data from Spain. For the data from Brazil, MAPE for predictions using DL is 6.08% and 4.52% for PrevPT.

In this paper, RIPPER for Multiclass Classification (RipMC) is presented, which extends several aspects of RIPPER. In RipMC, all classes are initially given an equal opportunity with a Parallel Rule Learning (PRL) to generate their best rules in a global search, causing the rules in the decision list to be reordered, which improves performance in classifying new instances. Next, the most complex and costly class, which will be set as the default class in the subsequent execution of the algorithm, is identified according to a new measure called MaxDL. Finally, a new rule evaluation measure, namely LogLaplace, is presented for better pruning of the rules. The performance of the proposed algorithm and RIPPER is compared using 18 data sets.

However, existing dynamic analysis methods cannot effectively vet the applications, as a limited number of dynamic features have been explored from apps that have become increasingly sophisticated. In this work, we propose an effective dynamic analysis method called DroidWard in the aim to extract most relevant and effective features to characterize malicious behavior and to improve the detection accuracy of malicious apps. In addition to using the existing 9 features, DroidWard extracts 6 novel types of effective features from apps through dynamic analysis. DroidWard runs apps, extracts features and identifies benign and malicious apps with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DTree) and Random Forest. 666 Android apps are used in the experiments and the evaluation results show that DroidWard correctly classifies 98.54% of malicious apps with 1.55% of false positives.

However, it is not guaranteed that varying faces of a single person could still be close in the lower dimensional space. Dimensionality reduction technique such as Extended Locality Preserving Projection (ELPP) not only reduces the dimension of the input data remarkably but also preserves the locality using neighbourhood information in the projected space. This paper deals with a face recognition system where ELPP is used to reduce the dimension of face images and hence uses ELPP coefficients as features to the classifier for recognition. In specific, two classifiers namely Naive Bayes classifier and Support Vector Machine are used. Results of face recognition of different data sets are highly impressive and at the same time results of facial expressions are encouraging.

The prediction of spatial distributions of tree species by means of survey data has recently been used for conservation planning. Numerous methods have been developed for building species habitat suitability models. The present study was carried out to find the possible proper relationships between tree species diversity indices and SPOT-HRG reflectance values in Hyrcanian forests, North of Iran. Two different modeling techniques, Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Random Forest (RF), were fitted to the data in order to find the most successfully model. Simpson, Shannon diversity and the reciprocal of Simpson indices were used for estimating tree diversity. After collecting terrestrial information on trees in the 100 samples, the tree diversity indices were calculated in each plot. RF with determinate coefficient and RMSE from 56.3 to 63.9 and RMSE from 0.15 to 0.84 has better results than CART algorithms with determinate coefficient 42.3 to 63.3 and RMSE from 0.188 to 0.88.

Most malware detection techniques such as signature-based, specification-based and static-based are faced with high false positive, low accuracy and inability to detect both zero day and polymorphic malware. In this research work, an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy System for Malware Detection (ANFSMD) was proposed to address these problems. ANFSMD utilizes both the Application Programming Interface (API) calls and operation codes to study the behaviour of Portable Executable (PE) files. The PE files were disassembled into low-level codes and the identified features were grouped for efficient detection. Five features, selected using weighted average, were used for the fuzzification. Using a bell membership function, 243 rules were generated for predicting the behaviours of the PE files. A normalization technique was used to combine the various fuzzy sets into one. Back propagation algorithm was used for the training and the resulting errors from outputs were used to dynamically modify inputs for improved outcomes. The implementation of ANFSMD was carried out using Java Programming Language, Interactive Disassembler and Matlab because of their supports for implementation of micro-programs. A total of 20,750 malware programs from VX Heaven public dataset and 15,000 clean files from Filehippo were used for the evaluation.

The insight is that we aim to learn a projection function to not only minimize the distance between the distributions of user identities in two social networks, but also incorporate the available annotations as the learning guidance. We propose three models SNNAu, SNNAb and SNNAo to learn the projection function under the weakly-supervised adversarial learning framework. Empirically, we evaluate the proposed models over multiple datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposals.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1609/aaai.v33i01.3301996", "venue": "AAAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2904205492", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199668700", "211298281", "207756617", "207870179", "212725672"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58966891"}

These approaches commonly employ supervised learning models that predict various time-frequency representations, by minimizing element-wise losses such as the cross entropy function. However, applying the loss in this manner assumes conditional independence of each label given the input, and thus cannot accurately express inter-label dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce an adversarial training scheme that operates directly on the time-frequency representations and makes the output distribution closer to the ground-truth. Through adversarial learning, we achieve a consistent improvement in both frame-level and note-level metrics over Onsets and Frames, a state-of-the-art music transcription model. Our results show that adversarial learning can significantly reduce the error rate while increasing the confidence of the model estimations.

One of the widely employed method is to use accelerometer to detect a crash. In this method, acceleration (g) value measured from the accelerometer is calibrated to detect an accident. This method, however is limited by the accuracy of the accelerometer. To make an efficient accident detection system, convolutional neural network (CNN) methodology can be incorporated in the system. CNN is the state-of-the-art method for image classification. In the recent work, image classification has been used to detect accident. However, CNN takes large time, data and computing power to be trained. To mitigate these issues, transfer learning technique has been innovatively incorporated for the accident detection application, which involves retraining the already trained network. Inception-v3 is an image classifier developed by google, which is incorporated for this purpose. In this work, accident detection system is designed using advanced and efficient Transfer Learning algorithm, which gives 84.5% of accuracy.

The study suggests two methods to overcome these difficulties and to improve the algorithm: (1) the method of relatively good features and (2) the method of sequential covering.

Thirdly, to minimize the confusion between burned areas and low reflectance objects (e.g., water and shadows) before next step, by adopting a looser criterion, the above mentioned indices were used to mask out as much as possible water and unburned vegetated pixels. Finally, images of four widely and successfully used vegetation indices specially designed for burnt area mapping, including BAI, VI3, NBR, and GEMI, together with SAVI and MNDWI, were gathered and stacked as input, and the SVM was applied to extract burnt scars. The resultant image was evaluated and a sound performance was achieved, with an overall accuracy of 90.1% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.8034.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2012.6311662", "venue": "2012 First International Conference on Agro- Geoinformatics (Agro-Geoinformatics)", "journal": "2012 First International Conference on Agro- Geoinformatics (Agro-Geoinformatics)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2134683290", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["128842789", "10702089", "2357415", "128905445", "129034276", "129830460", "14911714", "128779602", "37550405", "129369215", "32216977", "7138354", "22519235", "62638056", "54598435"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10325773"}

We first present the ELM based MTL problem in the centralized setting, which is solved by the proposed MTL-ELM algorithm. Due to the fact that many data sets of different tasks are geo-distributed, decentralized machine learning is studied. We formulate the decentralized MTL problem based on ELM as majorized multi-block optimization with coupled bi-convex objective functions. To solve the problem, we propose the DMTL-ELM algorithm, which is a hybrid Jacobian and Gauss-Seidel Proximal multi-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Further, to reduce the computation load of DMTL-ELM, DMTL-ELM with first-order approximation (FO-DMTL-ELM) is presented. Theoretical analysis shows that the convergence to the stationary point of DMTL-ELM and FO-DMTL-ELM can be guaranteed conditionally. Through simulations, we demonstrate the convergence of proposed MTL-ELM, DMTL-ELM, and FO-DMTL-ELM algorithms, and also show that they can outperform existing MTL methods.

In this work, we find the classification efficiencies for both original and the reconstructed vibrational signals. The reconstructed signals are obtained using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), by splitting the original signal into three intrinsic mode functional components and framing them accordingly. Feature extraction, feature selection and feature classification are the three phases in obtaining the classification efficiencies. All the statistical features from the original signals and reconstructed signals are found out in feature extraction process individually. A few statistical parameters are selected in feature selection process and are classified using the SVM classifier.

Thus, in order to eradicate the above pitfalls, a new learning algorithm was proposed known as Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). This algorithm tries to compute Hidden-layer-output matrix that is made of randomly assigned input layer and hidden layer weights and randomly assigned biases. Unlike the other feedforward networks, ELM has the access of the whole training dataset before going into the computation part. Here, we have devised a new two-layer-feedforward network (TFFN) for ELM in a new manner with randomly assigning the weights and biases in both the hidden layers, which then calculates the output-hidden layer weights using the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse. TFFN doesn't restricts the algorithm to fix the number of hidden neurons that the algorithm should have. Rather it searches the space which gives an optimized result in the neurons combination in both the hidden layers.

Both data mining method and MFD-based methods can divide the traffic state of road network, but each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The data mining method is oriented to traffic data with high efficiency, but it can only discriminate traffic status from microlevel, while the MFD of road network can discriminate traffic status from macrolevel, but there are still some problems, such as the fact that the discriminant method of equivalence points based on MFD lacks theoretical support or that traffic status could not be subdivided. If data mining methods and road network\u2019s MFD are combined, the accuracy of road network traffic state identification will be greatly improved. In addition, the research shows that the combination of unsupervised learning clustering analysis method (such as spectral clustering algorithm) and supervised learning machine algorithm (such as support vector machine algorithm (SVM)) is more accurate in traffic state identification. Therefore, a traffic state identification method based on MFD and spectral clustering and SVM is proposed, combining the advantages of spectral clustering algorithm and SVM algorithm. Firstly, spectral clustering algorithm is used to classify the traffic state of road network\u2019s MFD. Secondly, SVM multiclassifier is trained with the partitioned road network\u2019s MFD parameters, and the accuracy evaluation method of classification results based on obfuscation matrix is given. Finally, the connected-vehicle network simulation platform is built for empirical analysis. The results show that the classification results of spectral clustering algorithm are closer to the theoretical values, compared with K-means algorithm, and the accuracy of SVM multiclassifier is 96.3%.

Our purpose was to test nearest neighbor imputation by the k -Most Similar Neighbor ( k -MSN) and the Random Forest (RF) methods for the simultaneous estimation of species, DBH, height and stem volume using ALS data. The predictors included computational alpha shape metrics and variables based on the height and intensity distributions in the ALS data. Separate data sets covering 1898 and 1249 dominant to intermediate trees in a typical Scandinavian stand structure were used for training and validation, respectively. RF proved to be a flexible method with an ability to handle 1846 predictors with no need for their reduction. Classification of Scots pine, Norway spruce and deciduous trees showed an accuracy of 78%, and the estimates of DBH, height and volume had root mean square errors of 13%, 3%, and 31%, respectively, when evaluated against the validation data. The two selection strategies implemented here reduced the number of candidate variables effectively without any substantial effect on the accuracy relative to the use of all predictors.

The spotting and recognition of micro-expressions has vital applications in many fields including criminal investigation, psychotherapy, and education. However, due to their short-lived, rapid nature, spotting, recognizing and classifying micro-expressions is a major challenge. In this paper, a highly effective hybrid approach is proposed, which utilizes both Eulerian Video Magnification for motion magnification and Spatiotemporal Texture Map for feature extraction. The experiments are carried out on CASME II, the only spontaneous micro-expression dataset currently available. The proposed approach uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier with kernels, and achieves an accuracy of 80%, viz. an increase by 5% comparing with the best existing method using SVM on CASME II.

Most efforts in the field of semiautonomous mobile-robotic navigation involve using Artificial Intelligence search algorithms on a structured environment to achieve either good or optimal paths.

By implementing a hybrid system using the parallel- processing features of connectionist networks and simple localized search techniques, good paths can be generated using only low-level environmental sensory data. This system can negotiate structured two- and three-dimensional grid environments, from a start position to a goal, while avoiding all obstacles. Major advantages of this method are that solution paths are good in a global sense and path planning can be accomplished in real time if the system is implemented in customized parallel-processing hardware.

Wet chemical methods and handheld leaf Chl meters such as the Minolta SPAD-502 Chl meter(Markwell,1995) have traditionally been used for this purpose. Recently, the availability of small and affordable radiometers , which uses Near infra-red and Red edge(CIred edge)( Mark R. Steel, 2008b), for Chl estimation in grapevine leaves, has provided means to estimate Chl from reflectance measurements. The two methods were equally accurate measuring pigments at low to moderate Chl levels. But, when Chl exceeded 300 mg/m2, SPAD sensitivity to Chl declined noticeably and the accuracy of Chl estimation by the CIred edge was much higher than that of the SPAD meter, the chlorophyll index was found to be capable of accurately estimating pigment contents across a much greater Chl range than the SPAD meter. However, in this paper an artificial-intelligence technique, the Support Vector Machine (SVMLightV6.01) model was introduced to establish the relationship between the Chlorophylls content and reflectance of 400-750 nm spectrum, variation of species and growth stages, which can much more perfectly compensated the reflectance that was absorpted by anthocyanin and carotenoids and scatterd because of different leaf thickness, density, or surface properties. As a result that we have solved the problems such as saturation and/or asymptote in high/or lower content of chlorophyll, and SVM model was found to be capable of more accurately estimating pigment contents across a greater range than the SPAD and CIred edge, thus it can be used for quantitative assessment of early stages of pant stress.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.239-242.2376", "venue": null, "journal": "Advanced Materials Research", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2073673643", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": ["129395317", "140723176", "47880643", "83068146", "129258456", "140612299", "29447617", "84313716", "8103095", "85224130", "16511438", "83874331", "207605508", "128619925", "53246581", "2274179", "22528472", "100341504", "96732761", "19004731", "133358670", "28637672", "15097211", "118677895", "5024179", "564746", "17671150"], "inbound_citations": ["46945139", "215142025", "43893045"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:137194564"}

Because of the scarcity of orthologous protein sequences in the past, the existing prediction algorithms all include sequences of protein paralogs in the alignment, which can dilute the conservation signal and affect prediction accuracy.

In greater detail, we present: i) a Progressive Semisupervised SVM (PS 3 VM) developed in the dual formulation of the optimization problem related to the learning of the classifier; ii) a Low Density Separation algorithm devel- oped in the primal formulation of the optimization problem. Ex- perimental results carried out on real hyperspectral data confirm the effectiveness and the reliability of both the proposed ap- proaches. I. INTRODUCTION One of the major challenging problems in remote sensing data classification consists in the analysis of hyperspectral im- ages. Given the complexity of such classification process, usu- ally supervised techniques are preferred to unsupervised tech- niques. Nevertheless, a critical issue in supervised classifica- tion of hyperspectral images is the definition of a proper train- ing set for the learning of the classification algorithm. In this context, two main problems should be addressed relating to: i) the quantity of the available training patterns; ii) the quality of the available training samples. As regards the first issue, in most applications the number of available training samples is not sufficient for a proper learning of the classifier, since gath- ering reliable prior information is often too expensive both in terms of economic costs and time. Moreover, if the number of training samples is relatively small compared to the number of features, the problem of the curse of dimensionality arises. Concerning the quality of training data, there are two important issues to consider in relation to hyperspectral images, which affect the accuracy of the classification process: i) training samples are usually taken from the same area and hence violate the required assumption of independence; ii) physical factors related to both ground and atmospheric conditions affect the stationarity of the spectral signature in the spatial domain of the", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IGARSS.2006.997", "venue": "2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2106341347", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8714672", "60486887", "12601634", "14283441"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31312720"}

The fMRI time series data not only contains specific numerical information, but also involves contextual information and global fluctuation information. Here, we propose a novel time-series model based on Jensen-Shannon divergence for identifying the brain disease via fMRI data. First of all, we extract the discrete probability distribution of co-activity in multi-scale time series data.

Then, we design a time-series model to measure the similarity of brain functional connectivity. Finally, we adopt Support Vector Machine (SVM) on our proposed time-series features, which can be applied to do the brain disease classification and even deal with all time-series data.

It causes abortion in gravid animals and high mortality in young animals, characterized by massive hepatic necrosis and pantropic haemorrhage. Rift Valley fever-like disease in livestock was first reported in Kenya in 1912. Numerous studies have shown close relationship between climatic conditions and outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever. Aedes and other mosquito species such as Culex are the vectors responsible for the disease transmission in both animals and humans. ::: Various studies carried out to map RVF distribution using a variety of approaches including the use of disease occurrence maps, statistical models which uses presence and absence data e.g. the logistic regression method. However, acquiring correct absence data is not easy and hence maps generated from standard statistical models might not be a true representation of the disease distribution. In this study ecological niche modeling (ENM) was used to model the supporting niche of RVF and determine the distribution of RVF in Kenya using Genetic Algorithm for Rule set Production (GARP) and Random Forest (RFs) which are programs that use presence-only data. The data were collected at two levels; primary and secondary data collection. For primary data it was acquired by using Global Positioning System (GPS) for georeferencing and also through questionnaire administration to specific farmer affected by RVF in the RVF hotspot areas as per the records obtained from the Director of Veterinary Services (DVS). Secondary data collection included environmental variables which were used as the input data. They included: land use, soil type, elevation, vegetation index (obtained after downloading from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite spanning from October 2006 to March 2007), rainfall and temperature for the same period of time as the satellite imagery. Of the sampled data ENM was done using Bioclim, GARP and RFs mainly for comparison purposes. In GARP, 70% was used to train the model and 30% to test the model. A parallel analysis that used logistic regression model was done to identify statistical relationships between predictors used in the ENM model and the outcome. This is because ENM are good for prediction but not for analyzing mathematical relationships between variables. The results showed factors that were significant at 95% confidence interval for the outbreak of RVF were; open to closed forests having a crude OR of 1.93, Solonetz soil type having OR of 1.6 and NDVI having OR of 4.66. A one unit increase in temperature decreases the risk of RVF by 10%, and a change in altitude from <500 to 500 - <1000 is associated with 94% decrease in outbreak of RVF. Analysis of the questionnaire data showed that 27.38% of the areas visited had human cases of RVF. The key livelihood activities were: crop farming (contributing 30%) and livestock keeping (35%). The result from ENM mapped the expected distribution of RVF in Kenya. The model was evaluated using the Area Under Cover (AUC) statistic and partial Receiver Operating Characteristic (pROC). The estimates generated from GARP were 0.82 for AUC and 1.77 for pROC respectively indicating that the model predicted the RVF distribution satisfactorily. The results will be used to improve the already existing maps and for better planning of mitigation measures.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2565046337", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132934990"}

Towards overcoming that, we propose a network design inspired by deep residual networks that allows the efficient computation of this more expressive pairwise similarity objective. Further, we argue that regularization is key in learning with small amounts of data, and propose an additional generator network based on the Generative Adversarial Networks where the discriminator is our residual pairwise network.

To remedy poor transfer performance due to mismatch in morphologies, we contribute two key ideas. First, we show that incentivizing a complex agent's low-level to imitate a simpler agent's low-level significantly improves zero-shot high-level transfer. Second, we show that KL-regularized training of the high level stabilizes learning and prevents mode-collapse. Finally, on a suite of publicly released navigation and manipulation environments, we demonstrate the applicability of hierarchical transfer on long-range tasks across morphologies.

On the contrary, since data communication accounts for 34.7% of the total execution time in the sequential case, the total speedup is upper-bounded to 2.9. Using a double-buffer methodology, a total speedup of 2.84 has been achieved on a single cluster.

In this systematic yet comprehensive experimental survey, we benchmark several popular network representation learning methods operating on two key tasks: link prediction and node classification. We examine the performance of 12 unsupervised embedding methods on 15 datasets. To the best of our knowledge, the scale of our study -- both in terms of the number of methods and number of datasets -- is the largest to date. ::: Our results reveal several key insights about work-to-date in this space. First, we find that certain baseline methods (task-specific heuristics, as well as classic manifold methods) that have often been dismissed or are not considered by previous efforts can compete on certain types of datasets if they are tuned appropriately. Second, we find that recent methods based on matrix factorization offer a small but relatively consistent advantage over alternative methods (e.g., random-walk based methods) from a qualitative standpoint. Specifically, we find that MNMF, a community preserving embedding method, is the most competitive method for the link prediction task. While NetMF is the most competitive baseline for node classification. Third, no single method completely outperforms other embedding methods on both node classification and link prediction tasks.

Alongside this huge rise, the number of users has also amplified considerably in the past two decades. Most responsible institutions such as banks and governments follow specific rules and regulations regarding conducts and security. But, most websites are designed and developed using little restrictions on these issues. That is why it is important to protect users from harmful webpages. Previous research has looked at to detect harmful webpages, by running the machine learning models on a remote website. The problem with this approach is that the detection rate is slow, because of the need to handle large number of webpages. There is a gap in knowledge to research into which machine learning algorithms are capable of detecting harmful web applications in real time on a local machine. ::: ::: The conventional method of detecting malicious webpages is going through the black list and checking whether the webpages are listed. Black list is a list of webpages which are classified as malicious from a user's point of view. These black lists are created by trusted organisations and volunteers. They are then used by modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. However, black list is ineffective because of the frequent-changing nature of webpages, growing numbers of webpages that pose scalability issues and the crawlers' inability to visit intranet webpages that require computer operators to login as authenticated users. ::: ::: The thesis proposes to use various machine learning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised to categorise webpages based on parsing their features such as content (which played the most important role in this thesis), URL information, URL links and screenshots of webpages. The features were then converted to a format understandable by machine learning algorithms which analysed these features to make one important decision: whether a given webpage is malicious or not, using commonly available software and hardware. Prototype tools were developed to compare and analyse the efficiency of these machine learning techniques. These techniques include supervised algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quantitative Discriminant Analysis and Decision Tree. The unsupervised techniques are Self-Organising Map, Affinity Propagation and K-Means. Self-Organising Map was used instead of Neural Networks and the research suggests that the new version of Neural Network i.e. Deep Learning would be great for this research. ::: ::: The supervised algorithms performed better than the unsupervised algorithms and the best out of all these techniques is SVM that achieves 98% accuracy. The result was validated by the Chrome extension which used the classifier in real time. Unsupervised algorithms came close to supervised algorithms.

Vehicular networks have the potential to become one of the important carriers of future mobile networks. The performance of current vehicular networks has been widely evaluated through simulation experiments due to the high cost and impracticality of other experimental approaches. The most paramount factors of vehicle networks are the authenticity of simulative evaluation, where the mobility of the vehicles is the first significant feature (i.e., the nodes of the vehicular network) that must be properly considered. However, generating the corresponding real mobility datasets has always been a big challenge although it is vital to the simulations of vehicular networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a learning-based generation method that can be used to build the vehicle-trajectory data for variety of vehicle densities. Firstly, with analyzing the road bayonet data, we obtain the hidden pattern between road traffic and time. Secondly, we deploy Vissim (a well-known traffic simulator) to generate the experimental data by considering the urban functional areas for the origins of vehicles. The generated experimental data are learned by Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and the weight matrix of the parameters is obtained, which presents the impact of the experimental parameters on the simulation results.

Multi-wavelength database is composed of the face images captured at five different SWIR wavelengths ranging from 1150 nm to 1550 nm in increments of 100 nm. For classification based on CNN networks, there are no pre-trained multi-wavelength models available for our challenging SWIR datasets. To deal with this issue, we trained the models on our database and empirically optimized the model parameters (e.g. epoch and momentum) such that classification is performed more accurately. After classification, a set of face matching experiments is performed where a proposed face matching fusion approach is used indicating that, when fusion is supported by our classification framework, the rank-1 identification rate is significantly improved, namely when no classification is used.

Computational methods for predicting TM sequences have been developed. These methods achieve high prediction accuracy for many TM proteins but some of these methods are less effective for specific class of TM proteins. Moreover, their performance has been tested by using a relatively small set of TM and non-membrane (NM) proteins. Thus it is useful to evaluate TM protein prediction methods by using a more diverse set of proteins and by testing their performance on specific classes of TM proteins. This work extensively evaluated the capability of support vector machine (SVM) classification systems for the prediction of TM proteins and those of several TM classes. These SVM systems were trained and tested by using 14962 TM and 12168 NM proteins from Pfam protein families. An independent set of 3389 TM and 6063 NM proteins from curated Pfam families were used to further evaluate the performance of these SVM systems. 90.1% and 86.7% of TM and NM proteins were correctly predicted respectively, which are comparable to those from other studies. The prediction accuracies for proteins of specific TM classes are 95.6%, 90.0%, 92.7% and 73.9% for G-protein coupled receptors, envelope proteins, outer membrane proteins, and transporters/channels respectively; and 98.1%, 99.5%, 86.4%, and 98.6% for non-G-protein coupled receptors, non-envelope proteins, non-outer membrane proteins, and non-transporters/non-channels respectively.

Comparing the same methodology on different devices is crucial in order to have information on the portability of the developed algorithm and the possible extrapolation to ITER. Therefore, we use data from two very different tokamaks, DIII-D and Alcator C-Mod. We focus on a subset of disruption predictors, most of which are dimensionless and/or machine-independent parameters, coming from both plasma diagnostics and equilibrium reconstructions, such as the normalized plasma internal inductance l i and the n = 1 mode amplitude normalized to the toroidal magnetic field. Using such dimensionless indicators facilitates a more direct comparison between DIII-D and C-Mod. We then choose a shallow Machine Learning technique, called Random Forests, to explore the databases available for the two devices. We show results from the classification task, where we introduce a time dependency through the definition of class labels on the basis of the elapsed time before the disruption (i.e. 'far from a disruption' and 'close to a disruption'). The performances of the different Random Forest classifiers are discussed in terms of several metrics, by showing the number of successfully detected samples, as well as the misclassifications. The overall model accuracies are above 97% when identifying a 'far from disruption' and a 'disruptive' phase for disrupted discharges. Nevertheless, the Forests are intrinsically different in their capability of predicting a disruptive behavior, with C-Mod predictions comparable to random guesses. Indeed, we show that C-Mod recall index, i.e. the sensitivity to a disruptive behavior, is as low as 0.47, while DIII-D recall is ~0.72.

We will continue developing this system by adding more sophisticated LSTM blocks and by cross-training between different datasets.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1807.02131", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.18178/joig.6.1.21-26", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2963209838,2847278683,2953103455", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["363733", "6743296", "18112361", "1334940", "14481032", "2697895", "1732632", "945851", "17938825", "13939392", "413488", "12699455", "12354538", "8040013", "11060863", "2316457", "42675908", "2654595", "11310266", "6933411", "9566119", "19922351"], "inbound_citations": ["208632587", "211532714"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49652689"}

As the action requested may not fall within the robots capabilities, a Support Vector Machine(SVM) is used to determine whether it is or not. For the input of the neural networks, several word embedding algorithms were compared. Finally, to implement the system in a robot, a ROS package is created using a SMACH state machine.

For extraction of road pixels from combined image and elevation data, Wegner et al. (2015) proposed classification of superpixels into road and non-road, after which a refinement of the classification results using minimum cost paths and non-local optimization methods took place. We believed that the variable set used for classification was to a certain extent suboptimal, because many variables were redundant while several features known as useful in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing are missed. This motivated us to implement a variable selection approach which builds a model for classification using portions of training data and subsets of features, evaluates this model, updates the feature set, and terminates when a stopping criterion is satisfied. The choice of classifier is flexible; however, we tested the approach with Logistic Regression and Random Forests, and taylored the evaluation module to the chosen classifier. To guarantee a fair comparison, we kept the segment-based approach and most of the variables from the related work, but we extended them by additional, mostly higher-level features. Applying these superior features, removing the redundant ones, as well as using more accurately acquired 3D data allowed to keep stable or even to reduce the misclassification error in a challenging dataset.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-1-W1-297-2017", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2621071414", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["27881905", "2430892", "17166335", "89141", "121951476", "17567182", "202590023", "5552568", "123160139", "14864905", "8845468", "43251700", "15943670", "121503994", "5165390", "46353978", "35244027", "9034878", "3350496", "1774087", "2313314", "10939961", "63208399", "118125710", "5893207"], "inbound_citations": ["56248029", "212936523"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3672748"}

Physicochemical properties namely total surface area, euclidean distance (ED), total empirical energy, secondary structure penalty (SS), sequence length (SL), and pair number (PN) are used.
