It is the process of determining the opinion or the feeling of a piece of text and assigning a label to it (positive, negative or neutral). One of the issues in sentiment classification is the need for labeled data \u2013 that is often carried out manually - in order to train the classifiers which is a time consuming task. In this paper we consider the lexicon-based classification as labeling technique instead of the manual labeling. In addition, for an effective sentiment classification we investigate the using of multiple ensemble learning methods - where multiple classifiers are combined - in order to improve the performance of the classification. Experiments have been run on datasets of reviews written in Modern Standard Arabic. Results show that the labeling technique is effective and promising and the use of ensemble learning has clearly improved the accuracy for the sentiment classification compared to the traditional methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-36365-9_17", "venue": "Advances in Data Science, Cyber Security and IT Applications", "journal": "Advances in Data Science, Cyber Security and IT Applications", "mag_id": "2995791142", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213344370"}

Firstly, in C-RANs, the decision making process of resource allocation is time-consuming and computational-expensive, motivating us to use an approximation method, i.e. the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) to approximate the solutions of second order cone programming (SOCP) problem. Moreover, considering the innumerable states in real-time C-RAN systems, we employ a deep reinforcement learning framework, i.e., deep Q-network (DQN) to generate a robust policy that controls the status of remote radio heads (RRHs). We propose a GBDT-based DQN framework for the DRA problem, where the heavy computation to solve SOCP problems is cut down and great power consumption is saved in the whole C-RAN system. We demonstrate that the generated policy is error-tolerant even the gradient boosting regression may not be strictly subject to the constraints of the original problem.

In this work, we aim at improving on the WGAN by first generalizing its discriminator loss to a margin-based one, which leads to a better discriminator, and in turn a better generator, and then carrying out a progressive training paradigm involving multiple GANs to contribute to the maximum margin ranking loss so that the GAN at later stages will improve upon early stages. We call this method Gang of GANs (GoGAN). We have shown theoretically that the proposed GoGAN can reduce the gap between the true data distribution and the generated data distribution by at least half in an optimally trained WGAN.

Symbolic connectionist models suggest single artificial neurons corresponding to linguistic units (language sounds, words, etc.), and distributed connectionist models represent such linguistic entities by activity vectors involving numerous neuronal elements. A recent debate raises the question whether rules of language and their exceptions can be modeled by a single distributed network of two or three layers of artificial neurons.

This paper took the Gedong basin in the loess region of western Shanxi as the research area, analyzing the underlying surface and floods characteristics. The underlying surface change was divided into three periods (HSP1, HSP2, HSP3), and the floods were divided into three grades (great, moderate, small). The paper applied K Nearest Neighbor method and Fireworks Algorithm to improve the Extreme Learning Machine model (KNN-FWA-ELM) and proposed KNN-FWA-ELM hybrid flood forecasting model, which was further applied to flood forecasting of different underlying surface conditions and flood grades. Results demonstrated that KNN-FWA-ELM model had better simulation performance and higher simulation accuracy than the ELM model for flood forecasting, and the qualified rate was 17.39% higher than the ELM model.

Instead, we propose to view popularity in the perspective of a competitive situation where the popular articles are those which were the most appealing on that particular day. This leads to the notion of an \"appeal\" function, to model which we use a linear function in the bag of words representation. The parameters of this linear function are learnt from a training set formed by pairs of documents, one of which was popular and the other which appeared on the same page and date, without becoming popular. To learn the appeal function we use Ranking Support Vector Machines, using data collected from six different outlets over a period of 1 year. We show that our method can predict which articles will become popular, as well as extracting those keywords that mostly affect the appeal function. This also enables us to compare different outlets from the point of view of their readers' preference patterns.

Our objective was to identify the most sensitive soil physical property and process indicators related to crop yield using a Random Forest algorithm (RFA). This machine-learning, decision-making tool was used with field-scale data from five soil management treatments designed to ameliorate compaction in no-tillage (NT) fields. The treatments were: T1, NT for 10 yr (control); T2, NT with surface application of 3.6 Mg ha-1 of agricultural gypsum; T3, NT with subsoiling plus 1.44 Mg ha-1 of highly reactive limestone applied to a depth of 0.60 m; T4, NT planting following chisel plowing at a depth of 0.26 m; and T5, NT with subsoiling to a depth of 0.60 m plus 1.44 Mg ha-1 of surface-applied, highly reactive limestone. Fifteen soil physical properties and processes related to growth and yield of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] were measured. Mechanical intervention, specifically subsoiling, improved soil physical properties and increased soybean yield cultivated following occasional tillage. The RFA ranked penetration resistance (PR), air capacity, macroporosity, relative field capacity, and the Dexter-S index as the most sensitive soil physical indicators affecting soybean yield.

Buildup factors are key parameters for the point kernel method. Therefore, a great effort has been made in the past to find compact mathematical expressions producing accurate buildup factor estimates for embedding into point kernel codes. The expressions for single material buildup factor are generally well defined and understood, while for the stratified, multi-layer shields, which are mostly used in nuclear facilities, existing solutions are few, and are certainly not that compact, and are of limited applicability, usually only for certain material combinations. The problem of determination of buildup factors for multi-layer shields has been approached by introducing semi-empirical formulas, having a number of parameters, which are fitted to the results of detailed Monte Carlo calculations. This \u201c traditional\u201d approach requires an ad-hoc definition of the structure of the fitting function. Instead of developing a new formula for multi-layer shields we investigate the applicability of a machine learning approach to this problem. We employed a rather recently introduced machine learning technique, Support Vector Regression (SVR), which has a strong theoretical background in statistical learning theory, developed by Vapnik (1). Superior empirical performance of the method has been reported on difficult regression problems in different fields of science and technology. SVR is a data driven, kernel based nonlinear modeling paradigm in which model parameters are automatically determined by solving a quadratic optimization problem. The main objective of the work reported in this paper was to evaluate the possibility of applying the Support Vector Regression method for modeling and calculating buildup factors for double layer shields. The starting set of experimental data, for training and testing of the machine learning algorithm, was obtained by Monte Carlo calculations performed by SAS3 sequence of the SCALE code package.

This problem, known as concept drift, complicates the task of learning a model from data and requires special approaches, different from commonly used techniques, which treat arriving instances as equally important contributors to the target concept. Among the most popular and effective approaches to handle concept drift is ensemble learning, where a set of models built over different time periods is maintained and the best model is selected or the predictions of models are combined. In this paper we consider the use of an ensemble integration technique that helps to better handle concept drift at the instance level.

Tagging animals during mark and recapture studies is the most common method for reliable animal re-ID however camera traps are a desirable alternative, requiring less labour, much less intrusion, and prolonged and continuous monitoring into an environment. Despite these advantages, the analyses of camera traps and video for re-ID by humans are criticized for their biases related to human judgment and inconsistencies between analyses. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of deep learning systems which re-ID humans based on image and video data with near perfect accuracy. Despite this success, there are limited examples of this approach for animal re-ID. Here, we demonstrate the viability of novel deep similarity learning methods on five species: humans, chimpanzees, humpback whales, octopus and fruit flies. Our implementation demonstrates the generality of this framework as the same process provides accurate results beyond the capabilities of a human observer. In combination with a species object detection model, this methodology will allow ecologists with camera/video trap data to re-identify individuals that exit and re-enter the camera frame.

In this work, we are interested in the human pose estimation problem with a focus on learning reliable high-resolution representations. Most existing methods recover high-resolution representations from low-resolution representations produced by a high-to-low resolution network. Instead, our proposed network maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process. We start from a high-resolution subnetwork as the first stage, gradually add high-to-low resolution subnetworks one by one to form more stages, and connect the mutli-resolution subnetworks in parallel. We conduct repeated multi-scale fusions such that each of the high-to-low resolution representations receives information from other parallel representations over and over, leading to rich high-resolution representations. As a result, the predicted keypoint heatmap is potentially more accurate and spatially more precise. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our network through the superior pose estimation results over two benchmark datasets: the COCO keypoint detection dataset and the MPII Human Pose dataset.

However, existing microstructure characterization and reconstruction (MCR) techniques have limitations to be applied for materials design. Model-based MCR approaches do not have parameters that can serve as design variables, while MCR techniques that rely on dimension reduction tend to lose important microstructural information. In this work, we present a deep adversarial learning methodology that overcomes the limitations of existing MCR techniques. In the proposed methodology, generative adversarial networks (GAN) are trained to learn the mapping between latent variables and microstructures. Thereafter, the low-dimensional latent variables serve as design variables, and a Bayesian optimization framework is applied to obtain microstructures with desired material property. Due to the special design of the network architecture, the proposed methodology is able to identify the latent (design) variables with desired dimensionality, as well as minimize the information loss even for complex material microstructures. The validity of the proposed methodology is tested numerically on a synthetic microstructure dataset and its effectiveness for materials design is evaluated through a case study of optimizing optical performance for energy absorption. In addition, the scalability and transferability of proposed methodology are also demonstrated in this work. Specifically, the proposed methodology is scalable to generate arbitrary sized microstructures, and it can serve as a pre-trained model to improve the performance of a structure-property predictive model via transfer learning.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1805.02791", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/1.4041371", "venue": "J.

The success of these approaches slowly led to the belief that image retrieval and classification are just slightly different variations of the same problem. However, recent evidence suggests that learning highly discriminative representation for a (limited) set of training classes removes valuable information from the representation, potentially harming both the in-domain, as well as the out-of-domain retrieval precision. In this paper, we propose a regularized discriminative deep metric learning method that aims to not only learn a representation that allows for discriminating between different classes, but it is also capable of encoding the latent generative factors separately for each class, overcoming this limitation. This allows for modeling the in-class variance and, as a result, maintaining the ability to represent both sub-classes of the in-domain data, as well as objects that belong to classes outside the training domain. The effectiveness of the proposed method, over existing supervised and unsupervised representation/metric learning approaches, is demonstrated under different in-domain and out-of-domain setups and three challenging image datasets.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patrec.2019.11.041", "venue": null, "journal": "Pattern Recognition Letters", "mag_id": "2992706980", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213850046"}

Both tasks are closely related and can be regarded as parsing on top of a given sequence. In the data-driven approach context, these tasks are typically addressed sequentially by a pipeline of classifiers. A syntactic parser is run in the first stage, and then given the predicates, the semantic roles are identified and classified (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). ::: An appealing and largely unexplored idea is to jointly process syntactic dependencies and semantic roles. A joint process could capture some interactions that pipeline systems are unable to model. We expect joint models to improve on syntax based on semantic cues and also the reverse. Despite this potential advantage and the interest in joint processing stimulated by the CoNLL-2008 and 2009 Shared Tasks (Surdeanu et al., 2008; Hajic et al., 2009), very few joint models have been proposed to date, few have achieved attention and fewer have obtained competitive results. ::: This thesis presents three contributions on this topic. The first contribution is to frame semantic role labeling as a linear assignment task. Under this framework we avoid assigning repeated roles to the arguments of a predicate. Our proposal follows previous work on enforcing constraints on the SRL analysis (Punyakanok et al., 2004; Surdeanu et al., 2007). But in our case, we enforce only a relevant subset of these constraints. We solve this problem with the efficient O(n^3) Hungarian algorithm. Our next contributions will rely on this assignment framework. ::: The second contribution of this thesis is a joint model that combines syntactic parsing and SRL (Lluis et al., 2013). We solve it by using dual-decomposition techniques. A strong point of our model is that it generates a joint solution relying on largely unmodified syntactic and SRL parsers. We train each component independently and the dual-decomposition method finds the optimal joint solution at decoding time. Our model has some optimality and efficiency guarantees. We show experiments comparing the pipeline and joint approaches on different test sets extracted from the CoNLL-2009 Shared Task. We observe some improvements both in syntax and semantics when our syntactic component is a first-order parser. Our results for the English language are competitive with respect to other state-of-the-art joint proposals such as Henderson et al., (2013). ::: The third contribution of this thesis is a model that finds semantic roles together with syntactic paths linking predicates and arguments (Lluis et al., 2014). We frame SRL as a shortest-path problem. Our method instead of conditioning over complete syntactic paths is based on the assumption that paths can be factorized. We rely on this factorization to efficiently solve our problem. The approach represents a novel way of exploiting syntactic variability in SRL. In experiments we observe improvements in the robustness of classifiers.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2220884336", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61783198"}

However, due to the restriction in the spatial resolution of most airborne or satellite hyperspectral sensors, the targets often appear as subpixels in the hyperspectral image (HSI). The observed spectral feature of the desired target pixel (positive sample) is therefore a mixed signature of the reference target spectrum and the background pixels spectra (negative samples), which belong to various land cover classes. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised metric learning (SML) algorithm, which can effectively learn a distance metric for hyperspectral target detection, by which target pixels are easily detected in positive space while the background pixels are pushed into negative space as far as possible. The proposed SML algorithm first maximizes the distance between the positive and negative samples by an objective function of the supervised distance maximization. Then, by considering the variety of the background spectral features, we put a similarity propagation constraint into the SML to simultaneously link the target pixels with positive samples, as well as the background pixels with negative samples, which helps to reject false alarms in the target detection. Finally, a manifold smoothness regularization is imposed on the positive samples to preserve their local geometry in the obtained metric. Based on the public data sets of mineral detection in an Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer image and fabric and vehicle detection in a Hyperspectral Mapper image, quantitative comparisons of several HSI target detection methods, as well as some state-of-the-art metric learning algorithms, were performed. All the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SML algorithm for hyperspectral target detection.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2013.2286195", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2059497048", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["20845360", "205907253", "44805134", "10285950", "16288386", "1080166", "128777730", "137888315", "11112426", "25086589", "43627459", "989063", "51664535", "17501018", "122950497", "38434861", "11787721", "17493800", "4641994", "18338127", "14173829", "206690008", "26985497", "8714672", "4630551", "12037749", "9996241", "451328", "2073227", "2643381", "8616518", "47325215", "1845522", "37034831", "42792444", "62194350", "195681114", "8960049", "15514193", "8891673", "14879317", "2324548", "508435", "7634850", "122694523", "11113049", "8795072", "5415861", "9084336", "15228729"], "inbound_citations": ["85496712", "199119484", "31965968", "7420230", "206668929", "26129396", "14835717", "49416213", "13909673", "2211835", "1285556", "11898365", "19750852", "23958054", "3672051", "3690413", "14261554", "208033930", "67867767", "211060993", "115200400", "49412283", "53092917", "12127638", "204701409", "44136968", "28252557", "3212989", "53234049", "13479233", "32736169", "152282365", "21793562", "45615413", "21222617", "207997407", "10077463", "28055818", "23178476", "60442885", "3015203", "1332794", "13247273", "25811633", "51965227", "54455900", "191178301", "52927586", "374911", "199541071", "30385339", "1424412", "9123143", "35382151", "1653473", "8271094", "49412754", "53093622", "44081403", "4270863"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4644484"}

Moreover, when analytical standards, mass spectral and retention index databases are not available, compound annotation is cumbersome. Hence, there is a need for the development of retention time prediction models in order to explore new annotation approaches. In this work, we evaluated the use of several in silico methods for retention time prediction in multidimensional gas chromatography. We use three classical machine learning (CML) algorithms (Partial Least Squares (PLS), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR)) and two deep learning approaches (dense neural network (DNN) and three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN)). Whereas molecular descriptors were utilized for the CLM and DNN algorithms, three-dimensional molecular representation based on the electrostatic potential (ESP) was studied as input data as is for the CNN. All the developed models showed similar performances with Q2 values over 0.9. However, among all CNN showed the best performance, resulting in average retention time prediction errors of 2% and 6% for the first and second separation dimension, respectively. Additionally, only the three-dimensional ESP representation coupled with CNN was able to extract the stereochemical information crucial for the separation of diastereomers.

Two key parameters are linked to these vibrations: the depth of cut achievable without vibrations and the chatter frequency. Both parameters are linked to the dynamics of machine component excitation and the milling operation parameters. Their identification in any cutting direction in milling machine operations requires complex analytical models and mechatronic simulations, usually only applied to identify the worst cutting conditions in operating machines. This work proposes the use of machine learning techniques with no need to calculate the two above-mentioned parameters by means of a 3-step strategy. The strategy combines: 1) experimental frequency responses collected at the tool center point; 2) analytical calculations of both parameters; and, 3) different machine learning techniques. The results of these calculations can then be used to predict chatter under different combinations of milling directions and machine positions. This strategy is validated with real experiments on a bridge milling machine performing concordance roughing operations on AISI 1045 steel with a 125 mm diameter mill fitted with nine cutters at 45\u00b0, the results of which have confirmed the high variability of both parameters along the working volume. The following regression techniques are tested: artificial neural networks, regression trees and Random Forest. The results show that Random Forest ensembles provided the highest accuracy with a statistical advantage over the other machine learning models; they achieved a final accuracy of 0.95 mm for the critical depth and 7.3 Hz for the chatter frequency (RMSE) in the whole working volume and in all feed directions, applying a 10 \u00d7 10 cross validation scheme. These RMSE values are acceptable from the industrial point of view, taking into account that the critical depth of this range varies between 0.68 mm and 19.20 mm and the chatter frequency between 1.14 Hz and 65.25 Hz. Besides, Random Forest ensembles are more easily optimized than artificial neural networks (1 parameter configuration versus 210 MLPs). Additionally, tools that incorporate regression trees are interesting and highly accurate, providing immediately accessible and useful information in visual formats on critical machine performance for the design engineer.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2018.06.028", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "mag_id": "2809421710", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211092155", "71148982"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115596824"}

It is very difficult for the parents to know that the child is suffering from cancer until the cancer has reached to Stage 4. The duration it takes the cancer to reach Stage 4 can depend on many factors but the fact about childhood cancer is that it is curable to some extent.

In this paper we describe the comparative study of different Data Mining techniques to implement a Missing Value Estimator System (MVES) and also describe the techniques and methods for data selection, finding missing values and modeling to sort the useful information which could be used in other application in different ways.

Numerous efforts have been made to define the job of a data scientist in a qualitative manner by, for example, listing the job functions and required skill sets of data scientists. However, to the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to define the term data scientist in a scientific manner. In this paper, we address this issue by using a data-driven approach to answer three questions: 1) What is a proper definition of the term data scientist from a market-demand perspective? 2) Do self-described data scientists meet the market demand? and 3) Finally, how can companies efficiently recruit data scientists that match their openings? To answer these questions, we crawl two data sets for the supply and demand sides. For the former, we collect a set of data scientist user profiles from LinkedIn; for the latter, we collect a set of data scientist job descriptions from Monster. We first parse the set of data scientist job descriptions via natural language processing techniques and derive a scientific definition of the job of a data scientist via a clustering algorithm. Second, we use the same approach to determine that, under the aforementioned definition, self-claimed data scientists on the market would meet the market demand with a high probability. Finally, we introduce a distance-metric learning approach that can be used by companies to find data scientist candidates that match their openings. We achieve an average precision of 12.31%; i.e., one in ten candidates with matching qualifications would accept a given offer.

Online transfer learning deals with the situation where the data of target domain arrive in an online manner. Existing research on online transfer learning only deals with binary classification tasks, which appears to be important insufficiency. In this paper, the problem of online transfer learning for multi-class classification is studied, and an algorithm called Online Transfer Learning Algorithm for Multi-class Classification (OTLAMC) is proposed. OTLAMC learns a multi-class classifier in an online manner based on the knowledge from two sources, the obtained feedback of each datum in the target domain upon its arrival and the knowledge transferred from the source domain. A new loss function and a new updating method are proposed and adopted in OTLAMC, which improved the performance of OTLAMC on multi-class classification task. The mistake bound of OTLAMC is derived.

In order to deal with huge amounts of futures data, our strategy consists of two main parts: I. Raw Data Treatment and Features Extraction, and II. DT-SVM Hybrid Model Training. In this paper, we employ real-world transaction data of stock futures contracts for our study. The data are first stored in a distributed database. Afterwards, the data are distributed to a group of computing nodes to extract statistical features. Finally, a hybrid method combing DT (Decision Tree) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithms is applied. The method can filter most noisy data with the DT algorithm in the first phase, and then using the SVM algorithm to process the big training data in the second phase. As prediction models are trained for each stock futures contract, it is necessary to employ high performance algorithms.

Numerous clinical scales were devel- oped in the past to assess levels of impairment and functional limitation in individuals after stroke. The Functional Ability Scale is one of these clinical scales. It is a 75-point scale used to evaluate the functional ability of subjects by grading movement quality during performance of 15 motor tasks. Performance of these motor tasks requires subjects to reach for objects (e.g., a pencil on a table) and manipulate them (e.g., lift the pencil). In this paper, we show that accelerometer data recorded during performance of a subset of the motor tasks pertaining to the Functional Ability Scale can be relied upon to derive accurate estimates of the scores provided by a clinician using this scale. Accelerometer-based estimates of clinical scores were obtained by segmenting the recordings into movement components (reaching, manipulation, release/ return), extracting data features, selecting features that max- imized the separation among classes associated with different clinical scores, feeding these features to Random Forests to estimate scores for individual motor tasks, and using a linear equation to estimate the total Functional Ability Scale score based on the sum of the clinical scores for individual motor tasks derived from the accelerometer data.

With the correlation analysis of heavy metal content and pretreatment spectral band, the models are constructed to predict the content of heavy metal in soil.

However, the response of radar is more a function of geometry and structure than a surface reflection occurs in optical images. In addition, the backscatter of objects in the microwave range depends on the frequency of the band used, and the grey values in SAR images are different from the usual assumption of the spectral reflectance of the Earth\u2019s surface. Consequently, SAR imaging is often used as a complementary technique to traditional optical remote sensing. This study presents different ensemble systems for multisensor fusion of SAR, multispectral and LiDAR data. First, in decision ensemble system, after extraction and selection of proper features from each data, crisp SVM (Support Vector Machine) and Fuzzy KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) are utilized on each feature space. Finally Bayesian Theory is applied to fuse SVMs when Decision Template (DT) and Dempster Shafer (DS) are applied as fuzzy decision fusion methods on KNNs. Second, in feature ensemble system, features from all data are applied on a cube. Then classifications were performed by SVM and FKNN as crisp and fuzzy decision making system respectively.

The key component of RILOD is a novel incremental learning algorithm that trains end-to-end for one-stage deep object detection models only using training data of new object classes. Specifically to avoid catastrophic forgetting, the algorithm distills three types of knowledge from the old model to mimic the old model's behavior on object classification, bounding box regression and feature extraction. In addition, since the training data for the new classes may not be available, a real-time dataset construction pipeline is designed to collect training images on-the-fly and automatically label the images with both category and bounding box annotations. We have implemented RILOD under both edge-cloud and edge-only setups.

Support Vector Machines are applied to identify Chinese dependency structure. We compare the performance of two sorts of classifiers -- Support Vector Machines and Preference Learning in root node finding. Experiments using the Harbin University of Technology Corpus show that the method outperforms previous system by 6.46% accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised technique to remove occlusion from facial images and complete the occluded parts simultaneously with optimized Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) in an iterative way. Generally, GANs, as generative models, can estimate the distribution of images using a generator and a discriminator. DCGANs, as its variant, are proposed to conquer its instability during training. Existing facial image in-painting methods manually define a block of pixels as the missing part and the potential content of this block is semantically generated using generative models, such as GANs or AEs.

In silico (computational) models are developed to support toxicity assessment within the MoA/AOP framework. This paper focuses on the evaluation of potential binding to the Liver X Receptor (LXR), as this has been identified among the MIEs leading to liver steatosis within an AOP framework addressing repeated dose and target-organ toxicity. The objective of this study was the development of a priority setting strategy, by means of in silico approaches and chemometric tools, to allow for the screening and ranking of chemicals according to their toxicity potential. As a case study, the present paper outlines the methodologies and procedures that have been developed in the context of the COSMOS/cosmetics safety assessment project [4], which developed computational methods in view of supporting cosmetics safety assessment, to rank chemicals based on their potential binding to LXR. Chemicals are ranked based on molecular and QSAR modelling outcomes. The contribution in this paper is threefold: the QSAR model for LXR dataset, an application of molecular modelling approaches, which have been developed and optimized for drug discovery, in the context of toxicology, and finally ranking chemicals based on diverse modelling outcomes. The novelty in this paper consists of the employment of linear (logistic regression) and non-linear (Random Forest) models in the context of ranking chemicals. The results show that these methods can be successfully applied for prioritization of compounds of major concern for potential liver toxicity, and that they perform better than the ranking methods reported in the literature to date (such as total ordering or data fusion).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.comtox.2019.01.004", "venue": null, "journal": "Computational Toxicology", "mag_id": "2909674575", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:81726952"}

Generally speaking, although current cross-domain learning methods have obtained great successes for cross-single-domain learning problems, they will encounter overwhelming troubles in the sense of classification accuracy and running speed when carrying out them on large cross-multisource datasets. In this paper, based on the logistic regression model and the proposed consensus measure,a multi-source cross-domain classification(MSCC) algorithm is proposed to realize effective cross-domain classification for the target domain. In order to enable the MSCC to work well for large datasets, based on the algorithm CDdual(Dual coordinate descent method) as the recent advance about large-scale logistic regression, an MSCC s fast version MSCC-CDdual for large datasets is derived and theoretically analysed. The experimental results on artificial data, text data and image data indicate that the proposed algorithm MSCC-CDdual has a fast speed, high classification accuracy and good domain adaption for large cross-multisource datasets. The contributions of the work here contain three aspects:1) A novel consensus measure is proposed, which is suitable for boosting multi-classifiers and convenient for us to develop MSCC s fast version for large datasets; 2) The proposed algorithm MSCC-CDdual is demonstrated to be suitable for cross-multisource learning for both small and large datasets; 3) MSCC-CDdual exhibits its additional advantage, i.e., the applicability for high dimensional datasets from another \"large\" perspective.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Acta Automatica Sinica", "mag_id": "2362123503", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["4559717"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63654337"}

The 9DOF sensor boards are built up from a tri-axial accelerometer, a tri-axial gyroscope, and a tri-axial magnetometer. Measurement data for classification were collected from multiple subjects.

The weight of narrative field was calculated using text mining techniques.

While most studies have focused on brain connectivity during resting state episodes and regions of interest approaches (ROI), a wealth of task-based fMRI datasets have been acquired in these populations in the last decade. This calls for techniques that can leverage information not only from a single dataset, but from several existing datasets that might share some common features and biomarkers. We propose a fully data-driven (voxel-based) approach that we apply to two different fMRI experiments with social stimuli (faces and bodies). The method, based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), is first trained for each experiment independently and each output is then combined to obtain a final classification output. Second, this RFE output is used to determine which voxels are most often selected for classification to generate maps of significant discriminative activity. Finally, to further explore the clinical validity of the approach, we correlate phenotypic information with obtained classifier scores. The results reveal good classification accuracy (range between 69% and 92.3%). Moreover, we were able to identify discriminative activity patterns pertaining to the social brain without relying on a priori ROI definitions. Finally, social motivation was the only dimension which correlated with classifier scores, suggesting that it is the main dimension captured by the classifiers. Altogether, we believe that the present RFE method proves to be efficient and may help identifying relevant biomarkers by taking advantage of acquired task-based fMRI datasets in psychiatric populations.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4683429", "pubmed_id": "26793434", "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2015.11.010", "venue": "NeuroImage: Clinical", "journal": "NeuroImage: Clinical", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2174740345", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["11942671", "11252019", "24451473", "14648613", "22294793", "381459", "46144395", "2963745", "16409719", "1628654", "5001073", "13249955", "141167817", "23991830", "29213996", "246960", "1370535", "20399974", "2199922", "207720429", "6403660", "6794418", "43314807", "86163", "10144664", "24908225", "36789555", "12999010", "14336304", "30869000", "18986350", "35887920", "126843", "5696878", "9092372", "17576205", "9431428", "9617974", "24726013", "12296142", "15491260", "2379240", "14530320", "37089375", "2433590", "1616633", "10200246", "9818818", "19913893", "17078137", "17694782", "14633960", "2585131", "23387808"], "inbound_citations": ["56476002", "23486735", "44140616", "6799341", "215321908", "203979690", "79663951", "207819897", "69175888", "208332043", "54460974", "199517703", "49299295", "215477849", "92324730", "211685713"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16069802"}

For exemplification of the measurement system in dynamic environments, the novel measurement system is experimented and verified on a fuel tank of a running vehicle. The effects of slosh and temperature variations on the acoustic sensor based measurement system are reduced using the novel approach. The novel approach is based on \u03bd-SVM classification method with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) to compensate for the measurement error induced by the sloshing effects in the tank due to the motion of the moving vehicle. In this approach, raw sensor signals are differentiated after smoothing with some selected pre-processing filters, namely, Moving Mean, Moving Median, and Wavelet filter. The derivative signal is then transformed into Frequency Domain to reduce the size of input features before performing the signal classification with SVM. Field trials were performed on actual vehicle under normal driving conditions at various fuel volumes ranging from 5 L to 50 L to acquire sample data from the ultrasonic sensor for the training of SVM model. Further drive trials were conducted to obtain data to verify the SVM results. A comparison of the accuracy of the predicted fluid level obtained using SVM and the pre-processing filters is provided.

It is a highly challenging task, since the fundamentally different typesof possibly occurring drift undermine classical assumptions such asi.i.d. data or stationary distributions. Available algorithms are either struggling with certain forms of drift or require a priori knowledge in terms of a task specific setting. We propose the Self Adjusting Memory (SAM) model for the k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm since kNN constitutes a proven classifier within the streaming setting. SAM-kNN can deal with heterogeneous concept drift, i.e different drift types and rates, using biologically inspiredmemory models and their coordination. It can be easilyapplied in practice since an optimization of the meta parameters is not necessary. The basic idea is to construct dedicated models for thecurrent and former concepts and apply them according tothe demands of the given situation.

Hence, we propose a novel o nline b atch-based a ctive l earning algorithm (OBAL) to perform the labeling. OBAL is developed for crisis management applications where data streams are generated by the social media community. OBAL is applied to discriminate relevant from irrelevant social media items. An emergency management user will be interactively queried to label chosen items. OBAL exploits the boundary items for which it is highly uncertain about their class and makes use of two classifiers: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). OBAL is equipped with a labeling budget and a set of uncertainty strategies to identify the items for labeling. An extensive analysis is carried out to show OBAL\u2019s performance, the sensitivity of its parameters, and the contribution of the individual uncertainty strategies.

F L a p \u2212 T W S V M is faster than existing Laplacian twin support vector machine as it solves a smaller size Quadratic Programming Problem (QPP) along with an Unconstrained Minimization Problem (UMP) to obtain decision hyperplanes which can also handle heteroscedastic noise present in the training data. Traditional semi-supervised classifiers generally have no explicit control over the choice of labeled data available for training, hence to overcome this limitation, we propose a pool-based active learning framework which identifies most informative examples to train the learning model. Moreover, the aforementioned framework has been extended to deal with multi-category classification scenarios. Several experiments have been performed on machine learning benchmark datasets which proves the utility of the proposed classifier over traditional Laplacian Twin Support Vector Machine ( L a p \u2212 T W S V M ) and active learning based Support Vector Machine ( S V M A L ).

In this work, we propose a combined random forests (RFs) and active contour model (ACM) approach for fully automatic segmentation of the LA from cardiac volumetric MRI. Specifically, we employ the RFs within an autocontext scheme to effectively integrate contextual and appearance information from multisource images together for LA shape inferring.

By utilizing a credit default swap dataset exclusively for estimation and out-of-sample prediction, our study also serves as a comparison between the basic forms of credit risk models. Finally, it contrasts the results with the performance of a new supervised learning forecasting technique, the Support Vector Machines Regression. We show that although the Merton and the constant intensity models handle default timing and interest rates differently, the prediction performance in cross-sectional and time series analyses is, on average, similar.

The famous CNN model, AlexNet, has been utilized to be the classifier and ACGAN to be the generator, which will enlarge our data set. In order to alleviate the common issues in the traditional generative adversarial nets training, such as discriminator overfitting, generator disconverge, and mode collapse, we apply several training tricks in our training. With the result on original data set as our baseline, we will evaluate our result on enlarged data set to validate the ACGAN\u2019s performance. The result shows that we can gain 0.1~6% increase in the classification accuracy in the ACGAN-based data set.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2815741", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2790452209", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9056128", "3464743", "15310505", "13317832", "11707706", "22530592", "3480987", "22661410", "39429038", "24390528", "910182", "3492695", "24005817", "10804187", "14924561", "11179905", "6200260", "1099052", "3113284", "11758569", "2309950", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["214761446", "96431961", "56596142", "204818299", "54450989", "208093583", "207888294", "70236084", "53431982", "86485018", "212646129", "174820216", "212647697", "208857431", "54463733", "198929356", "210693412", "199013089", "196199064", "160010621", "209382680", "54212601", "210473356", "96431326", "209459135", "54035931", "57940582", "53432553", "202747593", "57755550", "155108205", "211545832", "202540999", "212733774", "209523087", "199018727", "127986226", "56288822", "53562660", "56225472", "201621203", "210993553", "212704014"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4710186"}

Essentially,the process of eutrophication assessment could be considered as a multi-index classification problem. However,the relationship between the eco-environmental factors and the eutrophication status is complex,nonlinear and uncertain. In recent years,a variety of artificial intelligent methods have been used for eutrophication assessment,such as fuzzy synthetic evaluation,fuzzy mathematics,grey cluster,grey situation decision,evolutionary algorithm and artificial neural network( ANN). These methods have been playing important roles in eutrophication assessment,but there are still uncertainty and inconsistency in the results. The fuzzy and grey methods have great subjectivity in determining the structures of evaluation functions and the weights of evaluation indexes,the evolutionary algorithm is mainly used for parameter optimization of existing evaluation models; and the ANN has inherent problems such as uncertainty of network structure, potential of local optimum and no guarantee of model generality.As a relatively new machine-learning algorithm,Support Vector Machine( SVM) has shown promising advantages in solving classification problems. The fundamental idea is to use certain kind of kernel functions to map the vectors in lower dimensional space to a higher dimensional space so that these vectors could be linearly classified into two parts,and then conducting a hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest vector of any class to make the separation. Although sharing some similarities to ANN in process of model building,SVM has entirely different theoretical basis. Despite its broad applications,the method has been merely used in lake eutrophication assessment. In this study,an eutrophication assessment model has been built by using the classification algorithm of LIBSVM( a simple,easy-to-use,and efficient software for SVM classification and regression),based on the learning data randomly generated from the existing eutrophication assessment standard for lakes and reservoirs. The model was then applied to the Taihu Lake,where data were collected from 33 monitoring sites during July to September in 2012. The results showed that there are 3 types of trophic status in the Taihu Lake with respect to space. The mesotrophic areas were mainly in the east part of the lake,and light eutrophication areas were mostly located in the central and eastern regions,and the moderate eutrophication areas were largely in the northwestern region. The eutrophication status of the entire lake is about light to moderate eutrophication. By comparing to the results from the well-accepted Linear Interpolation Scoring Method,the consistency is about 78.8%,indicating good effectiveness and applicability of the SVM method,owing to its addition feature of high convergence and generalization.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5846/stxb201302270314", "venue": null, "journal": "Acta Ecologica Sinica", "mag_id": "2330218687", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88015143"}

In order to study the ecology of animals in natural habitats, such behaviour classification models need to be transferred to wild individuals. However, at present the development of those models usually requires direct observation of the target animals. The goal of this study was to infer behaviour of wild, free roaming animals from acceleration data by training behaviour classification models on captive individuals, without the necessity to observe their wild conspecifics. We further sought to develop methods to validate the credibility of the resulting behaviour extrapolations. We trained two machine learning algorithms proposed by the literature, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), on data from captive red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and later applied them to data from wild foxes. We also tested a new advance for behaviour classification, by applying a moving window to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Finally, we investigated four strategies to validate our classification output. While all three machine learning algorithms performed well under training conditions, the established methods, RF and SVM, failed in classifying distinct behaviours when transferred from captive to wild foxes. Behaviour classification with the ANN and a moving window, in contrast, inferred distinct behaviours and showed consistent results for most individuals. Our approach is a substantial improvement over the methods previously proposed in the literature as it generated plausible results for wild fox behaviour. We were able to infer the behaviour of wild animals that have never been observed in the wild and to further illustrate the outputs credibility.

It integrates advantages of NRS in handling uncertain and incomplete information and RVM\u2019s capability in dealing with high-dimensional data. Based on data provided by Yunnan Kunming Power Supply Company in fault diagnosis of transformers, case study has shown that the testing diagnosis rate of four classifiers in this model are 92.55%, 93.87%, 93.44% and 92.28% respectively, higher than the diagnosis precision of RVM, which indicates this model enjoys better diagnostic capability.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2185894135", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["203978674", "114142818", "14209424", "7596571", "7138354", "7330769", "6530745", "124625958", "64229911"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15591516"}

In the proposed system, real-time diagnosis is a significant factor, and improvement of the detection speed is our main concern. EEG signals generate a large amount of spatially oriented data over a relatively short duration; hence, their dimension needs to be reduced effectively before being analysed. We proposes a feature reduction method, based on a novel weighted principal component analysis (WPCA) algorithm for EEG signals. First, the EEG features are extracted by an autoregressive (AR) model. Second, we calculate the influence of different features on the classified performance of fatigue state. The accuracy reduction values of different features are normalised as the weights of the features. Finally, these weights are assigned to the WPCA to reduce the EEG features. To verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, we carried out a simulated driving experiment involving eight participants. For comparison, power spectral density and differential entropy models were also introduced to extract EEG features. Support Vector Machine was adopted as a classifier to establish a fatigue driving classification experiment. The experimental results show that the WPCA method can effectively reduce the feature dimension of different EEG feature extraction methods, speed up calculations, and achieve a much higher classification accuracy of fatigue driving.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2937914", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2970088547", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62879388", "86419919", "44143277", "58551240", "49735317", "3405734", "4932403", "33099396", "117545824", "116715135", "57762919", "116055691", "169039576", "127431122", "133590162", "24851404", "2675362", "30820210", "54445403", "3216303", "54757860", "13698740", "3479239", "54215849", "19553264", "36835333", "986845", "24025915", "35258254", "15608139", "143731528", "3327565", "215130994", "7491153", "10506026", "59085099", "214898427", "85528157", "215271405", "113408094", "132697375", "88495409", "111198384"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202560479"}

In this situation, some of current machine learning algorithms, e.g., support vector machine, will obtain weak classification performance, especially on minority class. To solve this problem, a new hybrid sampling online extreme learning machine (ELM) on sequential imbalanced data is proposed in this paper. The key idea is keeping the majority and minority classes balanced with similar sequential distribution characteristic of the original data. This method includes two stages. At the offline stage, we introduce the principal curve to build confidence regions of minority and majority classes respectively. Based on these two confidence zones, over-sampling of minority class and under-sampling of majority class are both conducted to generate new synthetic samples, and then, the initial ELM model is established. At the online stage, we first choose the most valuable ones from the synthetic samples of majority class in terms of sample importance. Afterwards, a new online fast leave-one-out cross validation (LOO CV) algorithm utilizing Cholesky decomposition is proposed to determine whether to update the ELM network weight at online stage or not. We also prove theoretically that the proposed method has upper bound of information loss. Experimental results on seven UCI datasets and one real-world air pollutant forecasting dataset show that, compared with ELM, OS-ELM, meta-cognitive OS-ELM, and OSELM with SMOTE strategy, the proposed method can simultaneously improve the classification performance of minority and majority classes in terms of accuracy, G-mean value, and ROC curve.

In this paper, we report a new anomaly detection method, called Skewness & Constant False Alarm Rate Anomaly Detection (SCFAR-AD). This method can utilize limited anomalous information to find a refined decision boundary between normal and anomalous class data by following three steps. First, a kewness-based process generates skewed data from the normal dataset. Second, an improved one-class Support Vector Machines (1-SVMs) method is utilized to find an initial decision boundary surrounding the normal class data, and the built 1-SVMs classifier is applied to all the generated skewed data to find true outliers that are classified as anomalies. These true outliers, together with limited anomalous data, are used to form an expanded anomalous dataset. Third, we refine the initial decision boundary by a 2-class SVMs (2-SVMs) method to separate the expanded anomalous data from the normal data. In addition, with a constant false alarm rate concept, i.e., the false alarm rate (ratio of normal data that are classified as anomalous) being controlled, the decision boundary can be pushed away from the anomalies, resulting in an increased detection rate of anomalies.

For example, the semantic relation, is a large holds between the words in the word pair (lion, cat) and (ostrich, bird), because lion is a large cat, and ostrich is the largest living bird on earth. Consequently, the two word pairs, (lion, cat) and (ostrich, bird), are considered to be relationally similar. A high degree of relational similarity can be observed between analogous pairs of words. Measuring the relational similarity between word pairs is important in numerous natural language processing tasks such as solving word analogy questions, classifying noun-modifier relations and disambiguating word senses. We propose a supervised ranking-based method to detect relationally similar word pairs to a given word pair using information retrieved from a Web search engine. First, each pair of words is represented by a vector of automatically extracted lexical patterns. Then a ranking Support Vector Machine is trained to recognize word pairs with similar semantic relations to a given word pair.

The authors present the basic ideas of SVMs together with the latest developments and current research questions in a unified style. They identify three reasons for the success of SVMs: their ability to learn well with only a very small number of free parameters, their robustness against several types of model violations and outliers, and their computational efficiency compared to several other methods. Since their appearance in the early nineties, support vector machines and related kernel-based methods have been successfully applied in diverse fields of application such as bioinformatics, fraud detection, construction of insurance tariffs, direct marketing, and data and text mining. As a consequence, SVMs now play an important role in statistical machine learning and are used not only by statisticians, mathematicians, and computer scientists, but also by engineers and data analysts. The book provides a unique in-depth treatment of both fundamental and recent material on SVMs that so far has been scattered in the literature. The book can thus serve as both a basis for graduate courses and an introduction for statisticians, mathematicians, and computer scientists. It further provides a valuable reference for researchers working in the field. The book covers all important topics concerning support vector machines such as: loss functions and their role in the learning process; reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and their properties; a thorough statistical analysis that uses both traditional uniform bounds and more advanced localized techniques based on Rademacher averages and Talagrand's inequality; a detailed treatment of classification and regression; a detailed robustness analysis; and a description of some of the most recent implementation techniques.

This principle encourages high resemblance to the \"ground-truth\" captions while suppressing other reasonable descriptions. Conventional evaluation metrics, e.g. BLEU and METEOR, also favor such restrictive methods. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach, with the aim to improve the naturalness and diversity -- two essential properties of human expression. Specifically, we propose a new framework based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN), which jointly learns a generator to produce descriptions conditioned on images and an evaluator to assess how well a description fits the visual content. It is noteworthy that training a sequence generator is nontrivial.

The model was built using NO 2 concentrations from routine monitoring stations available in the Airbase database as dependent variable. Predictor variables included land use, road traffic proxies, population density, climatic and topographical variables, and distance to sea. In order to capture international and inter regional disparities not accounted for with the mentioned predictor variables, additional proxies of NO 2 concentrations, like levels of activity intensity and NO x emissions for specific sectors, were also included. The model was built using Random Forest techniques. Model performance was relatively good given the EU-wide scale (R 2 = 0.53). Output predictions of annual average concentrations of NO 2 were in line with other existing models in terms of spatial distribution and values of concentration. The model was validated for year 2015, comparing model predictions derived from updated values of independent variables, with concentrations in monitoring stations for that year. The algorithm was then used to model future concentrations up to the year 2030, considering different emission scenarios as well as changes in land use, population distribution and economic factors assuming the most likely socio-economic trends. Levels of exposure were derived from maps of concentration.

To overcome these problems, this study proposes a new dynamic financial distress forecasting (DFDF) approach, the Adaptive Neighbor SMOTE-Recursive Ensemble Approach (ANS-REA), that allows for multiple forecast results from unbalanced data streams. An empirical experiment was conducted on 373 financially distressed samples and 1119 matching normal Chinese listed companies from 2007 to 2017. With an overall average AUC, it was found that the Random Forest (RF) classifier outperformed other commonly used classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), baggingDT, oblique random forests (obRF), Kernel ridge regression (KRR) and Bayes in the classification of DFDF data. In addition, the proposed ANS-REA algorithm had better performance than SMOTE, ANS, Random Walk Over-Sampling Approach (RWO), Rapidly Converging Gibbs sampling Technique (racog), SMOTEboost, RUSboost, SMOTEbagging, wRACOG and Majority Weighted Minority Oversampling Technique (MWMOTE) methods in dealing with imbalanced data sets classification.

Hence, a system that effectively combines the two different approaches can be superior to either one in isolation. This paper describes a hybrid system\u2014SYMCON (SYMbolic and CONnectionist) which integrates symbolic and connectionist techniques in an attempt to solve the problem of word sense disambiguation (WSD), which is arguably one of the most fundamental and difficult issues in NLP. It consists of three sub-systems: first, a distributed simple recurrent network (SRN) is trained by using the standard back-propagation algorithm to learn the semantic relationships among concepts, thereby generating categorical constraints that are supplied to the other two sub-systems as the initial results of pre-processing. The second sub-system of SYMCON is a knowledge-based symbolic component consisting of a knowledge base containing general inferencing rules in a certain application domain. Third, a localist network is used to select the best interpretation among multiple alternatives and potentially ambiguous inference paths by spreading activation throughout the network. The structure, initial states, and connection weights of the network are determined by the processing outcome in the other two sub-systems. This localist network can be viewed as a medium between the distributed network and the symbolic sub-system.

An innovative approach was developed for cultivar classification of Anthurium flowers based on image processing, B-spline curves, mathematical operations and machine learning classifiers. The algorithm was implemented and tested on a database of Anthurium flower images, which included the images of 15 cultivars of the flower with various sizes and shape categories. The boundary of the flowers was detected and reconstructed using a suitable B-spline curve. The signed curvature of the curve was calculated via mathematical operations. Then, several classifiers were implemented using the machine learning methods, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors, Discriminant Analysis, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes, to detect and classify the cultivars of the flower. The experiments were carried out using a different number of training samples of the database images. The effect of various classification methods and variations in the angle of rotation of placing the flowers under the camera on classification accuracy were evaluated and the computation time of the classification process was measured.

We give a relatively complete categorization of the computational complexity of such problems. We first show that the problem is NP-hard, even in the case of one additive inequality. Thus we turn to approximating the query. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for approximating, with arbitrarily small relative error, many natural aggregation queries with one additive inequality. We give examples of natural queries that can be efficiently solved using this algorithm. In contrast we show that the situation with two additive inequalities is quite different, by showing that it is NP-hard to evaluate simple aggregation queries, with two additive inequalities, with any bounded relative error. We end by considering the problem of computing the gradient of the objective function in the Support Vector Machines (SVM) problem, a canonical machine learning problem. While computing the gradient for SVM can be reduced to the problem of computing an aggregation query with one additive inequality, our algorithm is not applicable due to what we call the ``subtraction problem''.

However, since it is based only on local information (Support Vectors), it is sensitive to directions with large data spread. On the other hand, Nonparametric Discriminant Analysis (NDA) is an improvement over the more general Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) where, the normality assumption from LDA is relaxed. Furthermore, NDA incorporates the partially global information to detect the dominant normal directions to the decision surface, which represent the true data spread. However, NDA relies on the choice of the \u03ba-nearest neighbors (\u03ba-NN\u2019s) on the decision boundary. This paper introduces a novel Combined SVM and NDA (CSVMNDA) model which controls the spread of the data, while maximizing a relative margin separating the data classes. This model is considered as an improvement to SVM by incorporating the data spread information represented by the dominant normal directions to the decision boundary. This can also be viewed as an extension to the NDA where the support vectors improve the choice of \u03ba-nearest neighbors (\u03ba-NN\u2019s) on the decision boundary by incorporating local information. Since our model is an extension to both SVM and NDA, it can deal with heteroscedastic and non-normal data. It also avoids the small sample size problem. Interestingly, the proposed improvements only require a rigorous and simple combination of NDA and SVM objective functions, and preserve the computational efficiency of SVM. Through the optimization of the CSVMNDA objective function, surprising performance gains were achieved on real-world problems.

We propose to use a discriminative classifier for outlier detection in large-scale point clouds of cities generated via multi-view stereo (MVS) from densely acquired images. What makes outlier removal hard are varying distributions of inliers and outliers across a scene. Heuristic outlier removal using a specific feature that encodes point distribution often delivers unsatisfying results. Although most outliers can be identified correctly (high recall), many inliers are erroneously removed (low precision), too. This aggravates object 3D reconstruction due to missing data. We thus propose to discriminatively learn class-specific distributions directly from the data to achieve high precision. We apply a standard Random Forest classifier that infers a binary label (inlier or outlier) for each 3D point in the raw, unfiltered point cloud and test two approaches for training. In the first, non-semantic approach, features are extracted without considering the semantic interpretation of the 3D points. The trained model approximates the average distribution of inliers and outliers across all semantic classes. Second, semantic interpretation is incorporated into the learning process, i.e. we train separate inlieroutlier classifiers per semantic class (building facades, roof, ground, vegetation, fields, and water). Performance of learned filtering is evaluated on several large SfM point clouds of cities. We find that results confirm our underlying assumption that discriminatively learning inlier-outlier distributions does improve precision over global heuristics by up to \u2248 12 percent points. Moreover, semantically informed filtering that models class-specific distributions further improves precision by up to \u2248 10 percent points, being able to remove very isolated building, roof, and water points while preserving inliers on building facades and vegetation.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-annals-IV-2-263-2018", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2807376643", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10611065", "41515630", "126092111", "12190705", "12626584", "6163234", "89141", "6787631", "2725767", "207172599", "292287", "14310184", "8348890", "14922497", "38939287", "3404510", "2845053", "1327696", "18609676", "6835625", "6868780", "6007133", "15209254", "3072058", "18921356", "119494631", "53245213", "16774390", "7572998", "214801172", "14588615", "2431538", "16849549", "206849822", "8171765", "18131775", "28113329", "62132969", "62605205", "206374096", "6734421", "18660902", "15553875"], "inbound_citations": ["199495949"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62879627"}

The basic idea behind these methods is to decompose training samples of one class into several parts and learn each part by one modular classifier independently. To implement these methods, a \u2018part-against-others\u2019 training strategy and a max modular combination principle are proposed. Also, a down-sampling technique is employed to improve the training without losing any information of positive sample.

We focused on the fastest moving sand dunes called barchans, which are threatening the settlements in the region of Laayoune, Morocco. We developed a process with three stages: In the first stage, we used an image processing approach with cascading Haar features for the detection of dunes location. In the second stage, we used a support vector machine for the segmentation of contours, and in the third stage we used an algorithm to measure the allometric features of barchans dunes. We explored the collected data, and found relevant correlations between dunes length, and width, and horns sizes, which could be used as key indicators for dunes growth and progression. This study is therefore of high interest for urban planners and geologists who study sand dunes and require technical methods, based on machine learning and computer vision to allow them to collect large amount of data from satellite images to understand sand dunes progression and counter desertification problems.

Despite the worldwide improvement of health care practices and facilities raising the survival rates of neonatal premature infants, there has not been any improvement in treatment options or mortality rates for NEC. There has been an extensive volume of research into NEC, though to date there has not been any evidence to directly associate a causal agent to this devastating disease, nor have there been any conclusive observations of NEC prior to birth. The only key prognostic signal for NEC is that onset and severity of the disease are significantly associated with the prematurity of the neonatal infant. During the process of birth, the infant transitions from the near sterile conditions of the womb to the outside environment teeming with bacteria. Only then does the infant develop a symbiotic relationship as a host to beneficial bacteria. Upon this transition the community of gut microbes develops and aids in a range of host functions, namely digestion and absorption of nutrients, as well as the immune response. It is also at this time that NEC can begin to develop in the lower gastrointestinal tract. This coinciding of factors implicates the colonisation of the gut with bacteria in the development of NEC, however studies to date have failed to provide consistent reports of a causative pathogen or a characteristic gut microbiome structure associated with NEC. The purpose of this study was to characterise the structure of the bacterial community in the gastrointestinal tract of infants with and without NEC in order to identify a community distinctive to infants with NEC. This was addressed using non-invasive faecal sampling of premature infants in a large, prospectively enrolled cohort from across England, sampled over a twenty-day window spanning ten days prior to and ten days following the onset of NEC. Using established V4 16S rRNA protocols, bacterial taxa within environmental samples could be characterised without relying on classic culture dependent methods. With this amplification technique it was possible to utilise small amounts of bacterial DNA isolated from infant faecal samples while at the same time mitigating the selection bias associated with culture-based techniques. Short read sequencing (illumina MiSeq) was performed on a total of 656 faecal samples from 132 infants spanning eight neonatal intensive care units across England. All infants had gestational durations of less than 35 weeks. 44 infants had NEC (225 samples) and 88 were assigned as controls (431 samples) according to key risk factors defined by medical practitioners. Taxonomic abundances assigned with the QIIME informatics pipeline were normalised using non-reductive negative binomial normalisation. Local contributions to beta-diversity (LCBD) scores were used to quantify taxonomic changes in the community structure through subset regression. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to establish risk factors that best described NEC and control samples. The Random Forest machine learning algorithm was used to establish taxa that best discriminated between NEC and control infants, as well as to identify any conserved pathogens. Subset regression identified feeding regime, mode of delivery and age at sampling as significant discriminating factors for the NEC status of infants based on sample LCBD values. However, NMDS plots of sample LCBD values showed no clear clustering of samples according to NEC status. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) indicated that this variability was due to inter-individual differences. Of the risk factors that could be accounted for, feeding regime was the most effective in differentiating community structures of NEC and control infant samples. There was also evidence that initial communities were influenced by delivery method. Three subgroups of infants based on these influential risk factors and with sufficient sampling depth were established and analysed separately in addition to collective, population-scale analysis. Random Forest analysis demonstrated that reduced abundance of the genus Bifidobacterium was significantly associated with NEC across all sub-groups of infants. Additionally, this method of analysis indicated no clear pathogenic taxa that consistently spanned the population. For infants with NEC that were delivered by caesarean section and fed both formula and breast milk, there was increased abundance of the genus Dialister when sampled shortly after birth. Infants that did not develop NEC, who were delivered vaginally and fed both formula and breast milk were seen to have a significantly greater abundance of the genus Veillonella over time, relative to NEC subjects. There were no additional taxonomic differences that could be ascertained in the sub-group of infants who were vaginally delivered and fed breast milk exclusively. Overall, the unique nature of the microbiome and the high degree of inter-individual variation within the community made direct comparisons between NEC and non-NEC subjects difficult. However, by accounting for factors that were significantly associated with NEC status it was possible to observe consistent association of increased bifidobacterial abundance in infants that did not develop NEC. This highlights the importance of large scale studies and case-control assignment when analysing complex community structures such as that of the human gastrointestinal tract, as well as the powerful, deep analytical analysis provided by machine learning algorithms. Further work should look to establish the impact and role of Bifidobacteria in the human gut community to inform early interventions in healthcare settings for infants at risk of NEC, focussing specifically on encouraging the development of a community structure reflective of that observed in premature infants that do not develop NEC.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2918305259", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91945648"}

Phase 1 classification, a 10-class four-tier hierarchical scheme, is the most widely used scheme in the UK. Currently, no automatic approaches have been developed and its classification is carried out exclusively by ecologists. This manual approach using surveyors is laborious, expensive and subjective. To this date, no automatic approach has been developed. ::: This thesis presents the first automatic system for Phase 1 classification. Our main contribution is an Automatic Image Annotation (AIA) framework for the automatic classification of Phase 1 habitats. This framework combines five elements to annotate unseen photographs: ground-taken geo-referenced photography, low-level visual features, medium-level semantic information, random projections forests and location-based weighted predictions. ::: Our second contribution are two fully-annotated ground-taken photograph datasets, the first publicly available databases specifically designed for the development of multimedia analysis techniques for ecological applications. Habitat 1K has over 1,000 photographs and 4,000 annotated habitats and Habitat 3K has over 3,000 images and 11,000 annotated habitats. This is the first time ground-taken photographs have been used with such ecological purposes. ::: ::: Our third contribution is a novel Random Forest-based classifier: Random Projection Forests (RPF). RPFs use Random Projections as a dimensionality reduction mechanism in their split nodes. This new design makes their training and testing phase more efficient than those of the traditional implementation of Random Forests. ::: Our fourth contribution arises from the limitations that low-level features have when classifying similarly visual classes. Low-level features have been proven to be inadequate for discriminating high-level semantic concepts, such as habitat classes. Currently, only humans posses such high-level knowledge. In order to obtain this knowledge, we create a new type of feature, called medium-level features, which use a Human-In-The-Loop approach to extract crucial semantic information. ::: Our final contribution is a location-based voting system for RPFs. We benefit from the geographical properties of habitats to weight the predictions from the RPFs according to the geographical distance between unseen test photographs and photographs in the training set. ::: Results will show that ground-taken photographs are a promising source of information that can be successfully applied to Phase 1 classification. Experiments will demonstrate that our AIA approach outperforms traditional Random Forests in terms of recall and precision. Moreover, both our modifications, the inclusion of medium-level knowledge and a location-based voting system, greatly improve the recall and precision of even the most complex habitats.

Hence, road extraction method that is significantly more automated has become a research hotspot in remote sensing information processing. This paper proposes a semi-automatic approach to extract different road types from high-resolution remote sensing images. The approach is based on edge detection and SVM and mathematical morphology method. First the outline of the road is detected based on Canny operator. Then, Full Lambda Schedule merging method combines adjacent segments. Then the entire image was classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and various spatial, spectral, and texture attributes to form a road image. Finally, the quality of detected roads is improved using morphological operators. The algorithm was systematically evaluated on a variety of satellite images from Worldview, QuickBird and UltraCam airborne Images.

In this paper, Tetrolet Transform (TT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier have been utilized for recognition of tumour from brain MRI images. Findings: The brain MRI image is transformed into a set of features that best describes the information content of the image. So as to use the Tetrolet transform for recognition of tumour, MRI brain tumour image is decomposed by utilizing the Tetrolet transform at a predefined level. Statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, and variance of each tetromino sub bands are computed and extracted.

In this paper,the widely used method of least squares support vector machines was applied in forecasting two-year tourist arrivals in Huangshan scenic areas using monthly data(from January 1987 to December 2010).The analysis results showed that forecast performance indexes using least squares support vector machine algorithms are better than with the BP neural network,ARIMA forecasting model,and combined forecasting using empirical mode decomposition and least squares support vector machines.Moreover,least squares support vector machine algorithms are superior in both prediction accuracy and computing speed.The ability of least squares support vector machines to forecast tourist arrivals has high practical value and can provide a scientific basis for planning and strategy management of scenic areas. In addition,nine forecasting models were assessed: the time-series regression prediction model,the Holt-Winters addition and multiplication model,the TRAMO/SEATS model,a combination of the wavelet and ARIMA forecasting models,the wavelet neural network prediction method,and the four methods cited in the previous paragraph.We investigated the forecasting ability of these nine models in predicting tourist arrivals over one-and two-year time scales in Huangshan scenic areas.Owing to restrictions of space,however,we are unable to detail all the analysis procedures in this paper.The results showed that least squares support vector machines was superior in performance.It was better than the other single forecasting methods and also exceeded the combination of the wavelet and ARIMA forecasting models,the wavelet neural network,and the combined empirical mode decomposition and least squares support vector machines over the two-year time scale;however,these advantages were not evident over the one-year time scale.The effectiveness of least squares support vector machines in forecasting other tourist arrival data requires further examination. The main difficulties in forecasting monthly tourist arrival data lie in the large fluctuations in the numbers of tourists and the lack of data relating to tourist arrivals.These data include such economic figures as GDP,quarterly unit statistics,tourist arrival data other than annual statistics of inbound tourists,the vulnerability to external shocks,and diversity in the data from different regions.In all,the diversity,complexity,and fluctuation in different types of tourist arrivals make it difficult to find a satisfactory tourist arrival forecasting method that is universally accurate.Thus,greater efforts need to be made to develop better methods for accurately forecasting tourist arrival data for different scenic areas.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Tourism Tribune", "mag_id": "645005145", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:166362212"}

Many studies have used acceleration as the main input to discriminate between falls and activities of daily living (ADL). In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using smartphones for fall detection. The most promising results have been obtained by supervised Machine Learning algorithms. However, a drawback of these approaches is that they rely on falls simulated by young or mature people, which might not represent every possible fall situation and might be different from older people's falls. Thus, we propose to tackle the problem of fall detection by applying a kind of novelty detection methods which rely only on true ADL. In this way, a fall is any abnormal movement with respect to ADL. A system based on these methods could easily adapt itself to new situations since new ADL could be recorded continuously and the system could be re-trained on the fly. The goal of this work is to explore the use of such novelty detectors by selecting one of them and by comparing it with a state-of-the-art traditional supervised method under different conditions. The data sets we have collected were recorded with smartphones. Ten volunteers simulated eight type of falls, whereas ADL were recorded while they carried the phone in their real life. Even though we have not collected data from the elderly, the data sets were suitable to check the adaptability of novelty detectors. They have been made publicly available to improve the reproducibility of our results. We have studied several novelty detection methods, selecting the nearest neighbour-based technique (NN) as the most suitable. Then, we have compared NN with the Support Vector Machine (SVM).

However, in many practical applications, only a small amount of training samples are available in the beginning and many more would come sequentially during online recognition. Because the image data characteristics could change over time, it is important for the classifier to adapt to the new data incrementally. In this paper, we present an online metric learning method to address the online scene recognition problem via adaptive similarity measurement. Given a number of labeled data followed by a sequential input of unseen testing samples, the similarity metric is learned to maximize the margin of the distance among different classes of samples. By considering the low rank constraint, our online metric learning model not only can provide competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, but also guarantees convergence.

Females report higher levels of depression and not much difference in anxiety levels has been observed with regard to male counterparts. Males have higher energy levels and slightly more positive well-being(PWB) values compared to females. Males experience more anxiety, more energy and more PWB values with respect to weight. We have developed two prototype models MLP and SVR to assess the psychosocial parameter wellbeing in diabetes when biological and biographical variables were given as inputs to the networks.

Classical vaccines (live-attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, conjugate vaccines, and toxoid vaccines) are often less effective for many viral diseases. Hence, short peptide (10\u201320 amino acid residues) vaccine components exploiting T-cell mediated immunity have been recognized as alternative solutions. This involves the specific binding of short antigen peptides to allele (gene variant) specific host human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Allele-specific HLA typing among different ethnic groups has gained momentum in recent years through advances in sequencing (Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)), High Performance Computing (HPC), machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. More than 20,000 HLA alleles have been typed, defined, named, and made available at the IMGT\u00ae/HLA database (Immuno Polymorphism Database \u2013 ImMunoGeneTics Database/Human Leukocyte Antigen) for public access. Identification of short peptide antigens capable of binding specifically to the human host HLA alleles is now possible using computer-aided HLA-peptide binding prediction methods. This is achieved using three dimensional HLA structure based molecular modeling, and known HLA-peptide binding data enabled machine learning techniques like ANN and SVM. The former provides broad coverage across HLA alleles and the later offers high accuracy with high specificity for limited HLA alleles. Thus, the combined use of structural features, molecular modeling, machine learning techniques, and other applied mathematical models including Quantitative matrices (QM), Bayesian Networks (BN), and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) help in the effective design of short peptide vaccine components and immune therapeutics for the prevention and control of diseases caused by viruses.

The marine fishes are drifted from their conventional ocean zone into different places because of the absence of favorable environment.

Therefore, the compensation device must be adopted to keep the vertical relative motion between the drill string system and the drilling platform to zero during the operation.

At this point, studies on acquiring new customers by analyzing the customer data have gained importance recently. As a result, data analysis units have been established in the banks. In addition to the banks, these units have also been established for data analysis in customer focused industries such as insurance and telecommunication. In this study, models are established by using classification algorithms to estimate potential bank customers on the bank dataset obtained by telemarketing method in UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the results are compared. Using this comparison result, it is aimed to perform a more detailed and effective data analysis. Various models have been established with various classification algorithms for the estimation of customer acquisition. The classification algorithms used in this study include the C4.5 Decision Tree, Navie Bayes (NB) algorithm, K nearest neighbors algorithm (k-nn), Logistic Regression algorithm (LogReg), Random Forest algorithm (RanFor), and Adaptive Boosting algorithm (AdaBoostM1-Ada). While establishing the classification models, it is aimed to achieve consistency in the performance of the classification models by dividing the test and training data set by two different methods. K-fold Cross Validation and Holdout methods are used for this purpose. In the K-fold cross validation, training and test da-ta sets are separated with 5- and 10-fold cross validation. In the holdout method, the dataset was divided into training and test datasets with the 60\u201340%, 75\u201325% and 80\u201320% training and test separation ratios, respectively. These separations are evaluated for Accuracy (ACC), Precision (PPV), Sensitivity (TPR), and F-measure (F) performance. The performance results are similar in both separation results. According to the Accuracy and F-measure criteria, the classification model established by Random Forest algorithm highest results the other models, whereas the Naive Bayes algorithm gave highest results according to the precision criterion, and the AdaBoostM1 classification algorithm yielded better according to the sensitivity criterion.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-36178-5_9", "venue": "Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies", "journal": "Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies", "mag_id": "2998137906", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213825102"}

We address the problem by proposing a Dynamic Bayesian Metric Learning model, abbreviated as DBML, which can collaboratively track the evolutions of latent semantic representations of different categories of entities (i.e., users, products and words) over time in a joint metric space. In particular, unlike previous work using inner-product metric to model the affinities between entities, our DBML is a novel probabilistic metric learning approach that is able to avoid the contradicts, keep the triangle inequality in the latent space, and correctly utilize implicit feedbacks. For inferring dynamic embeddings of the entities, we propose a scalable online inference algorithm, which can jointly learn the latent representations of entities and smooth their changes across time, based on amortized inference. The inferred dynamic semantic representations of entities collaboratively inferred in a unified form by our DBML can benefit not only for improving personalized product search, but also for capturing the affinities between users, products and words.

We determined if the accuracy of species distribution models differed between 17 native and 17 introduced riparian plant species in the western United States. We also assessed if model accuracy was associated with both environmental and biological factors that can influence dispersal. We used Random Forests to model species distributions and linear regression to determine if model accuracy was associated with dispersal-related traits. Model accuracy for introduced species was higher than that for native species. Dispersal-related traits did not affect model accuracy or improvement, though two other traits, family affiliation and rarity on the landscape, did have an effect. Distance-based measures of dispersal potential improved model fit equally for both native and introduced species and for species with a variety of dispersal traits, suggesting that the importance of regional propagule pressure is relatively constant across species with different dispersal opportunities.

Snow depth data were collected using a terrestrial laser scanner during 11 periods of snow accumulation and melting, over three snow seasons on a Pyrenean hillslope characterized by a large elevational gradient, steep slopes, and avalanche occurrence. The maximum and mean absolute snow depth error found was 0.5-0.6 and 0.2-0.3 m respectively, which may result problematic for areas with a shallow snowpack, but it is sufficiently accurate to determine snow distribution patterns in areas characterized by a thick snowpack. The results indicated that in most cases there was temporal consistency in the spatial distribution of the snowpack, even in different years. The spatial patterns were particularly similar amongst the surveys conducted during the period dominated by snow accumulation (generally until end of April), or amongst those conducted during the period dominated by melting processes (generally after mid of April or early May). Simple linear correlation analyses for the 11 survey dates, and the application of Random Forests analysis to two days representative of snow accumulation and melting periods indicated the importance of topography to the snow distribution. The results also highlight that elevation and the Topographic Position index (TPI) were the main variables explaining the snow distribution, especially during periods dominated by melting. The intra- and inter-annual spatial consistency of the snowpack distribution suggests that the geomorphological processes linked to presence/absence of snow cover act in a similar way in the long term, and that these spatial patterns can be easily identified through several years of adequate monitoring.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11629-016-4086-0", "venue": "Journal of Mountain Science", "journal": "Journal of Mountain Science", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2610761597", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["128839056", "129846900", "120830443", "4374104", "131451937", "128676170", "129027917", "56212494", "128694626", "129799650", "32819746", "129898616", "128679111", "59358841", "15058232", "129435913", "129523783", "37386684", "8283049", "54860191", "129037518", "15321291", "55809426", "39426511", "14607298", "93932974", "51781057", "52266365", "130754431", "111385843", "129594487", "120450249", "153934413", "49572504", "7181210", "129127260", "129417031", "140155613", "55717017", "128583566", "66066077", "73598143", "35364689", "55780031", "32437627", "54893831", "53575049", "43509443", "121078137", "55232995", "124465691", "140588964", "140163155", "134229117", "129963117", "53337338", "53605601", "29039288", "54647802", "27563321", "119935984", "128790373", "54766850", "129853776", "14088182", "130956269", "131349144", "129599540", "134383064", "153555097", "55050311"], "inbound_citations": ["12865406", "199586198", "212713207", "85498644", "3617782"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134368669"}

In real-world emails datasets, data are predominately composed of ham samples with only a small percentage of phishing ones. Standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) could produce suboptimal results in filtering phishing emails, and it often requires much time to perform the classification for large data sets. In this paper, an online version of imbalanced SVM (OISVM) is proposed. First an email is converted into 20 features which are well selected based on its content and link characters. Second, OISVM is developed to optimize the classification accuracy and reduce computation time, which is used a novel method to adjust the separation hyperplane of imbalanced date sets and an online algorithm to make the retaining process much fast. Compared to the existing methods, the experimental results show that OISVM can achieve significantly using a proposed expressive evaluation method.

The main methods to detect botnets are traffic classifiers and sinkhole servers, which are special servers designed as a trap for botnets. However, sinkholes also receive non-malicious automatic online traffic and therefore they also need to use traffic classifiers. For these reasons, we have created two new datasets to evaluate classifiers: the TCP-Int dataset, built from publicly available TCP Internet traces of normal traffic and of three botnets, Kelihos, Miuref and Sality; and the TCP-Sink dataset based on traffic from a private sinkhole server with traces of the Conficker botnet and of automatic normal traffic. We used the two datasets to test four well-known Machine Learning classifiers: Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes. On the TCP-Int dataset, we used the F1 score to measure the capability to identify the type of traffic, i.e., if the trace is normal or from one of the three considered botnets, while on the TCP-Sink we used ROC curves and the corresponding AUC score since it only presents two classes: non-malicious or botnet traffic.

Of particular importance is the increasing amounts of available hyperspectral data originating from airborne and satellite sensors such as AVIRIS, HyMap, and Hyperion with very high spectral resolution (i.e., high number of spectral channels) containing rich information for a wide range of applications. A relevant example is the separation of different types of land-cover classes using the data in order to understand, e.g., impacts of natural disasters or changing of city buildings over time. More recently, such increases in the data volume, velocity, and variety of data contributed to the term big data that stand for challenges shared with many other scientific disciplines. On one hand, the amount of available data is increasing in a way that raises the demand for automatic data analysis elements since many of the available data collections are massively underutilized lacking experts for manual investigation. On the other hand, proven statistical methods (e.g., dimensionality reduction) driven by manual approaches have a significant impact in reducing the amount of big data toward smaller smart data contributing to the more recently used terms data value and veracity (i.e., less noise, lower dimensions that capture the most important information). This paper aims to take stock of which proven statistical data mining methods in remote sensing are used to contribute to smart data analysis processes in the light of possible automation as well as scalable and parallel processing techniques.

This is primarily due to its reliability, low-cost installation, easy maintenance, and little constraints regarding ground-related laws and policies. We propose a methodology to extract the theoretical vSGP (installed in the uppermost 10 m of the ground, and mostly at depths of 1\u20132 m) at the national scale for Switzerland, based on a combination of Geographic Information Systems, traditional modelling, and machine learning (ML). The theoretical vSGP is based on the estimation of three thermal characteristics of the ground that impact significantly the geothermal potential, namely the monthly temperature at various depths in the surface layer, the thermal conductivity, and the thermal diffusivity. Each of the three variables is estimated separately, to a depth of 1 m below the surface, using the following general strategy: (1) collect significant data related to the variable, (2) if not existing, extract values for the variable at available locations with the help of traditional models and part of the data as input for these models, (3) train a ML model (with the Random Forests algorithm) using the extracted variable values as examples (training output labels) and related information contained in the data as features (training input samples), (4) use the trained ML model to estimate the variable in unknown locations, (5) estimate the uncertainty attached to the estimations. The methodology estimates values for (200 \u00d7 200) (m2) pixels forming a grid over Switzerland.

A typical GWA study reports a few highly suspected signals, e.g. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which usually account for a tiny portion of overall genetic risks for the disease of interest. This study proposes a computational learning approach in addition to parametric statistical methods along with a filtering mechanism, to build glaucoma genetic risk assessment model. Our data set was obtained from Singapore Malay Eye Study (SiMES), genotyped on Illumina 610quad arrays. We constructed case-control data set with 233 glaucoma and 458 healthy samples. A standard case-control association test was conducted on post-QC dataset with more than 500k SNPs.

In this study, a set of cytotoxicity experimental data corresponding to 19 data points for silica nanomaterials were investigated, to compare the widely employed CORAL and Random Forest approaches in terms of their usefulness for developing so-called 'nano-QSAR' models. 'External' leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) analysis was performed, to validate the two different approaches.

With regard to the physicochemical properties of the nanomaterials, the aspect ratio and zeta potential were found to be the two most important variables for Random Forest, and the average feature contributions calculated for the corresponding descriptors were consistent with the clear trends observed in the data set: less negative zeta potential values and lower aspect ratio values were associated with higher cytotoxicity.

To choose these variables, this research proposed two classification models using two different feature selection methods namely: Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) and Improved Grey Relational Analysis (IGRA).

A few available frameworks(e.g., Recurrent Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory), represent temporal dependency as the dependency of output on position input series, which however may bring about spatial redundancy in some cases. We argue that temporal dependency should be represented as the dependency of output on velocity input series. Besides, due to the weak temporal dependency between shape change and wrinkle change, we put forward Fuzzy Embedding to convert velocity into fuzzy velocity. The shape-wrinkle synthesis demonstrates that, in determining the temporal dependency between wrinkle change and shape change, fuzzy velocity provides more valuable information than velocity and thus enhances the degree of the realism effectively.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/11801603_60", "venue": "PRICAI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2623441802", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10109116", "61936515", "208007337", "1915014", "8658", "61970974", "14913595", "28637672", "10034299"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14941889"}

These methods generally use multiple hand-crafted features. However, in recent days, features extracted through transfer leaning procedures have been proved to be robust than the hand-crafted features in myriad applications, such as object classification and recognition. The transfer learning is a highly appreciated strategy in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) due to its multifaceted benefits. It heartens us to explore the effect of fusing multiple transfer learning features of different DCNN architectures. Thus, in this work, we extract features of image statistics by exploiting three different pre-trained DCNNs through transfer learning. Then, we transform the features into a generalized subspace through a recently introduced Autoencoder network and fuse them to form intra-class invariant feature vector that is used to train a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM).

In this paper we argue that the use of XSLT presents an opportunity rather than a challenge to web document classification. We show that it is possible to combine the advantages of both HTML and XML into classification of documents at the XSLT transformation stage, named XSLT classification, to attain higher classification rates using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach using categorical information to tackle the SISR problem; we present an encoder architecture able to extract and use semantic information to super-resolve a given image by using multitask learning, simultaneously for image super-resolution and semantic segmentation. To explore categorical information during training, the proposed decoder only employs one shared deep network for two task-specific output layers. At run-time only layers resulting HR image are used and no segmentation label is required.

First, the intra saliency map for each image is generated by the single image saliency model, while the inter saliency map is calculated based on the multi-constraint feature matching, which represents the constraint relationship among multiple images. Then, the optimization scheme, namely cross label propagation, is used to refine the intra and inter saliency maps in a cross way. Finally, all the original and optimized saliency maps are integrated to generate the final co-saliency result. The proposed method introduces the depth information and multi-constraint feature matching to improve the performance of co-saliency detection. Moreover, the proposed method can effectively exploit any existing single image saliency model to work well in co-saliency scenarios. Experiments on two RGBD co-saliency datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1710.05172", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2017.2763819", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2766912043", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3108956", "18420304", "2329405", "12867776", "1732096", "1335365", "5984332", "13416181", "16779596", "13342577", "21756290", "2592606", "2876053", "14246018", "5948204", "1264280", "579650", "1651267", "14115381", "4920699", "7286956", "9817897", "191961", "5767170", "13751591", "46559555", "3125082", "12815069", "15587207", "24070582", "3115238", "409780", "15229758", "5423459", "13259596", "1819223", "15592109", "1014698", "11417966", "1505586", "7194540", "7396425", "12393310", "9647606", "8986540", "15204039", "6116678", "1597550", "1806278", "1782131", "11664336", "14124313", "63581535", "2329405", "47434345", "15527396"], "inbound_citations": ["199438400", "52967654", "52363789", "204891953", "4052774", "204081143", "51613735", "3876725", "196831465", "44161258", "126180710", "4956999", "148572138", "32548783", "85501587", "211025404", "195758250", "53670059", "195218702", "146809071", "3854677", "116774333", "58630384", "201751571", "58646017", "202712499", "21727227", "51872564", "155367761", "132356253", "215548774"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11567426"}

These optimal parameters help algorithms avoid both over- and under- segmentation of image data and provide high-quality inputs for further processing.Recently, the super-pixels method has been introduced as a powerful tool to over-segment the images and replace the pixels with higher-level inputs. Automatic aggregation of super-pixels with image segments is a challenge in the remote sensing and computer programming community. In this paper, a new automated segmentation method, namely density-based super-pixel aggregation (DBSPA), is proposed. This method is based on the spatial clustering algorithm for integrating the obtained super-pixels from the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC). The DBSPA algorithm uses a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) to form core segments and defines the primary structure of geographic features in an image scene. Then, the box-whisker plot was used to analyze the statistical similarity of super-pixels to each core-segment, and spatially cluster all super-pixels. In our experiments, two ultra-high-resolution datasets selected from ISPRS semantic labelling challenge were used.

We propose a novel technique that avoids the procedure of deducing each example to evaluate each constructed clause. The technique takes advantage of the two stage procedure of Mode Directed Inverse Entailment (MDIE) systems. In the first stage of a MDIE system, where the bottom clause is constructed, we store not only the bottom clause but also valuable additional information. The information stored is sufficient to evaluate the clauses constructed in the second stage without the need for a theorem prover. We used a data structure called Trie to efficiently store all bottom clauses produced using all examples (positive and negative) as seeds.

Copy-move forgery is amongst the commonly used forgery, which is performed by copying a part of an image and then pasting it on the same or different image. This results in the concealing of image content. Most of the existing copy-move forgery detection techniques are subjected to degradation in results, under the effect of geometric transformations. In this paper, a Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based technique is proposed to detect the copy-move image forgery. DCT is used to transform the image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain and SVD is used to reduce the feature vector dimension. Combination of DCT and SVD makes the proposed scheme robust against compression, geometric transformations, and noise. For classification of images as forged or authentic, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used on the feature set. Once the image is detected as forged, then for the localization of forged region, K-means clustering is used on the feature vector. According to the distance threshold, similar blocks are identified and marked. The application of SVD provides stability and invariance from geometric transformations. Evaluation of the proposed scheme is done with and without post-processing operations on the images, both at the pixel level and image level.

Hence, the aim of this study is to develop a simple, objective, highly accurate self-check system for screening of psychiatric disorders based on heart rate variability (HRV) measured from single- lead electrocardiography (ECG) or photoplethysmogram (PPG) for home healthcare monitoring. HRV is widely used as objective biomarker for assessment of autonomic nerve system. The low frequency (LF) of HRV originates from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The high frequency (HF) originates from the parasympathetic nerves. In our previous clinical trial, we confirmed that HRV of MDD patients is less reactive than healthy subjects during a mental task (generate random numbers) condition. However, mental task alone is difficult to assess HRV accurately owing to influence of measurement condition and individual differences. In this study, we implemented a single-lead ECG system based on reactivity of HRV, and combined mental task and paced deep breathing thereby improving the screening accuracy. Moreover, support vector machine (SVM) model was applied for classification of HRV indices. We tested the system on 16 healthy subjects and 7 psychiatric patients with depression or somatoform disorder.

Of the three classical IR models (Boolean, Support Vector Machine, and Probabilistic), the Support Vector Machine (SVM) IR model is most widely used. But this model does not convey enough relevancies between a query and documents to produce effective results reflecting knowledge. To augment the IR process with knowledge, several techniques are proposed including query expansion by using a thesaurus, a term relationship measurement like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), and a probabilistic inference engine using Bayesian Networks. Our research aims to create an information retrieval model that incorporates domain specific knowledge to provide knowledgeable answers to users. We use a knowledgebased model to represent domain specific knowledge. Unlike other knowledge-based IR models, our model converts domain-specific knowledge to a relationship of terms represented as quantitative values, which gives improved efficiency.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "FLAIRS Conference", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "162692396", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9928591", "8218893", "59891173", "17607555", "2146137", "5991216", "14957779"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14097691"}

Classification applying supervised learning methods to omics data as one of the molecular classification approaches has enjoyed its growing role in clinical application. However, the utility of a molecular classifier will not be fully appreciated unless its quality is carefully validated. A clinical omics data is usually noisy with the number of independent variables far more than the number of subjects and, possibly, with a skewed subject distribution. Given that, the consensus approach holds an advantage over a single classifier. Thus, the focus of this review is mainly placed on how validating a molecular classifier using Decision Forest (DF), a robust consensus approach. We recommended that a molecular classifier has to be assessed with respect to overall prediction accuracy, prediction confidence and chance correlation, which can be readily achieved in DF. The commonalities and differences between external validation and cross-validation are also discussed for perspective use of these methods to validate a DF classifier. In addition, the advantages of using consensus approaches for identification of potential biomarkers are also rationalized.

Performance of the algorithms was further compared to a detection strategy implemented in an existing closed loop neurostimulation device for the treatment of epilepsy.

More precisely, our goal is to design and develop novel algorithms to learn compact, discriminative, domain invariant or de-identifying representations of faces. ::: Searching and indexing faces open the door to many interesting applications. However, this is made day after day more challenging due to the rapid growth of the volume of faces to analyse. Representing faces by compact and discriminative features is consequently essential to deal with such very large datasets. Moreover, this volume is increasing without any apparent limits; this is why it is also relevant to propose solutions to organise faces in meaningful ways, in order to reduce the search space and improve efficiency of the retrieval. ::: Although the volume of faces available on the internet is increasing, it is still difficult to find annotated examples to train models for each possible use cases e.g. for different races, sexes, etc. for every specific task. Learning a model with training examples from a group of people can fail to predict well in another group due to the uneven rate of changes of biometric dimensions e.g., ageing, among them. Similarly, a model learned from a type of feature can fail to make good predictions when tested with another type of feature. It would be ideal to have models producing face representations that would be invariant to these discrepancies. Learning common representations ultimately helps to reduce the domain specific parameters and, more importantly, allows to use training examples from domains well represented to other domains. Hence, there is a need for designing algorithms to map the features from different domains to a common subspace \u2013 bringing faces bearing same properties closer. ::: On the other hand, as automatic face matching tools are getting smarter and smarter, there is an increasing threat on privacy. The popularity in photo sharing on the social networks has exacerbated this risk. In such a context, altering the representations of faces so that the faces cannot be identified by automatic face matchers -- while the faces look as similar as before -- has become an interesting perspective toward privacy protection. It allows users to limit the risk of sharing their photos in social networks. ::: In all these scenarios, we explored how the use of Metric Learning methods as well as those of Deep Learning can help us to learn compact and discriminative representations of faces. We build on these tools, proposing compact, discriminative, domain invariant representations and de-identifying representations of faces. ::: We applied the proposed methods on a wide range of facial analysing applications. These applications include: large-scale face retrieval, age estimation, attribute predictions and identity de-identification.

Hypothetically, training on a coarser resolution dataset and testing the model on a finer resolution should help the algorithm to better generalize ambiguous examples of landslide classes and yield fewer over/underestimations in the model. This case study considers the City of Belgrade area for training and its south-eastern suburb for testing. The dataset is exceptionally rich with detailed geological, morphological and environmental data, so 24 landslide predictors were used for multi-class mapping: Class 0 \u2013 stable ground, Class 1 - dormant landslides, and Class 2 \u2013 active landslides. Two state-of-the-art algorithms were implemented: Support Vector Machines and Random Forest. Additionally, our modelling included variants with an implemented feature selection by using the Information Gain and Correlation Feature Selection. All these variants were modelled across four resolutions - 25, 50, 100 and 200 m, whereby Cross-Scaling was implemented as follows: training on 50 and testing on 25, training on 100 and testing on 25, training on 100 and testing on 50, training on 200 and testing on 25, training on 200 and testing on 50, and finally, training on 200 and testing on 100 m resolution datasets. The results clearly show that Cross-Scaling improves the performance of the model, especially for Class 2, when compared to the performance of their non-Cross-Scaled counterparts; this thereby proves the initial hypothesis. Random Forest models tend to be less sensitive to scale and feature selection effects than the SVM. Class 1 remains the most difficult to discern, leaving some room for even further customization and adjustments.

Thanks to the excellent results on classification/regression and the open sourced libraries such as XGBoost, GBDTs have become very popular in recent years and won many awards in machine learning and data mining competitions. Although GPUs have demonstrated their success in accelerating many machine learning applications, it is challenging to develop an efficient GPU-based GBDT algorithm. The key challenges include irregular memory accesses, many sorting operations with small inputs and varying data parallel granularities in tree construction. To tackle these challenges on GPUs, we propose various novel techniques including (i) Run-length Encoding compression and thread/block workload dynamic allocation, (ii) data partitioning based on stable sort, and fast and memory efficient attribute ID lookup in node splitting, (iii) finding approximate split points using two-stage histogram building, (iv) building histograms with the aware of sparsity and exploiting histogram subtraction to reduce histogram building workload, (v) reusing intermediate training results for efficient gradient computation, and (vi) exploiting multiple GPUs to handle larger data sets efficiently. Our experimental results show that our algorithm named ThunderGBM can be 10x times faster than the state-of-the-art libraries (i.e., XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost) running on a relatively high-end workstation of 20 CPU cores. In comparison with the libraries on GPUs, ThunderGBM can handle higher dimensional problems which the libraries become extremely slow or simply fail. For the data sets the existing libraries on GPUs can handle, ThunderGBM achieves up to 10 times speedup on the same hardware, which demonstrates the significance of our GPU optimizations.

This study aimed to validate the Random Forest computer model (RFM) as means of better triaging trauma patients to level 1 trauma centers. Methods Adult trauma patients with \u201cmedium activation\u201d presenting via helicopter to a level 1 trauma center from May 2007 to May 2009 were included. The \u201cmedium activation\u201d trauma patient is alert and hemodynamically stable on scene but has either subnormal vital signs or accumulation of risk factors that may indicate a potentially serious injury. Variables included in the RFM analysis were demographics, mechanism of injury, prehospital fluid, medications, vitals, and disposition. Statistical analysis was performed via the Random Forest algorithm to compare our institutional triage rate to rates determined by the RFM. Results A total of 1653 patients were included in this study, of which 496 were used in the testing set of the RFM. In our testing set, 33.8% of patients brought to our level 1 trauma center could have been managed at a level 3 trauma center, and 88% of patients who required a level 1 trauma center were identified correctly. In the testing set, there was an overtriage rate of 66%, whereas using the RFM, we decreased the overtriage rate to 42% ( P The RFM predicted patient disposition with a sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 42%, negative predictive value of 92%, and positive predictive value of 34%.

Erosion occurs in a variety of fittings, and one common fitting which is one of the most vulnerable to erosion is the elbow. Repair and/or replacement of pipe fittings in the appropriate period can avoid catastrophic disasters such as hydrocarbon release events. Therefore, accurate prediction of erosion is a subject of interest for the oil and gas industry. Both experimental and modeling approaches have been conducted in the past under different flow conditions and materials. The goal of this study is to use relevant experimental parameters as predictor variables and utilize a machine learning algorithm to predict erosion rate and validate the prediction under different conditions with test data. It is assumed that important parameters in erosion magnitude are material characteristics, pipe diameter, particles properties and size and carrier fluid properties. 201 experimental data points with a broad range of conditions were selected for the analysis. Predicted erosion rates through different machine learning techniques were compared, and Random Forest regression model was selected as an effective and alternative approach for erosion prediction.

Although cross-situational learning is usually modeled through stochastic guessing games in which the input data vary erratically with time (or rounds of the game), here we investigate the possibility of applying the deterministic Neural Modeling Fields (NMF) categorization mechanism to infer the correct object-word mapping. Two different representations of the input data were considered. The first is termed object-word representation because it takes as inputs all possible object-word pairs and weighs them by their frequencies of occurrence in the stochastic guessing game. A re-interpretation of the problem within the perspective of learning with noise indicates that the cross-situational scenario produces a too low signal-tonoise ratio, explaining thus the failure of NMF to infer the correct object-word mapping. The second representation, termed context-word, takes as inputs all the objects that are in the pupil's visual field (context) when a word is uttered by the teacher.

Structural mutations and dysregulations of these proteins would contribute to the development of complex disease. Free radicals are unstable molecules that they look for electrons from surrounding atoms for stability, Once a free radical binds to an atom in the body, a chain reaction occurs, which causes damage to cells and DNA. Antioxidant protein is a substance that protects cells from free radical damage. Accurate identification of antioxidant proteins is important for understanding their role in delaying aging and preventing and treating related diseases.Therefore, computational methods to identify pantioxidant proteins have become an effective prior-pinpointing approach to the experimental verification. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: In this study, we use support vector machines to identify antioxidant proteins, using amino acid compositions and 9-gap dipeptide compositions as feature extraction, and feature reduction by Principal Component Analysis. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The prediction accuracy Acc of this experiment reached 98.38%, the recall rate Sn of the positive sample obtained 99.27%, the recall rate Sp of the negative sample reached 97.54%, and the MCC value was 0.9678. To evaluate our proposed method, we studied the predictive performance of 20 antioxidant proteins from National Center for Biotechnology Information(NCBI) . As a result, 20 antioxidant proteins were correctly predicted by our method. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our method is better than the state-of-the-art methods for identi\ufb01cation antioxidant proteins. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: We collected experimental protein data from Uniport, including 253 antioxidant proteins and 1552 non-antioxidant proteins. The optimal feature extraction used in this paper is composed of amino acid composition and 9-gap dipeptide. The protein is identified by support vector machine, and the model evaluation index is obtained based on 5-fold cross-validation.

Unlike existing hand-crafted face descriptors such as local binary pattern (LBP) and Gabor features which usually require strong prior knowledge, our SLBFLE is an unsupervised feature learning approach which automatically learns face representation from raw pixels. Unlike existing binary face descriptors such as the LBP, discriminant face descriptor (DFD), and compact binary face descriptor (CBFD) which use a two-stage feature extraction procedure, our SLBFLE jointly learns binary codes and the codebook for local face patches so that discriminative information from raw pixels from face images of different identities can be obtained by using a one-stage feature learning and encoding procedure. Moreover, we propose a coupled simultaneous local binary feature learning and encoding (C-SLBFLE) method to make the proposed approach suitable for heterogenous face matching. Unlike most existing coupled feature learning methods which learn a pair of transformation matrices for each modality, we exploit both the common and specific information from heterogeneous face samples to characterize their underlying correlations.

Existing simple graph-based transductive learning methods only model the pairwise relationship of images, however, and they are sensitive to the radius parameter used in similarity calculation. Hypergraph learning has been investigated to solve both difficulties. It models the high-order relationship of samples by using a hyperedge to link multiple samples. Nevertheless, the existing hypergraph learning methods face two problems, i.e., how to generate hyperedges and how to handle a large set of hyperedges. This paper proposes an adaptive hypergraph learning method for transductive image classification. In our method, we generate hyperedges by linking images and their nearest neighbors. By varying the size of the neighborhood, we are able to generate a set of hyperedges for each image and its visual neighbors. Our method simultaneously learns the labels of unlabeled images and the weights of hyperedges. In this way, we can automatically modulate the effects of different hyperedges.

ASC is a state distinguished from ordinary waking consciousness, which is a common phenomenon in the Emergency Department (ED). Thirty (30) distinctive attributes or features are commonly used to recognize ASC. The study accordingly applied these features to model the prediction of mortality in ASC patients. Supervised learning techniques are found to be suitable for such classification problems. Consequently, the study compared five supervised learning techniques that are commonly applied to evaluate the risk of mortality using health-related datasets, namely Decision Tree, Neural Network, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. The labeled dataset comprised patient records captured by the Universiti Sains Malaysia hospital\u2019s Emergency Medicine department from June to November 2008. The cleaned dataset was divided into two parts. The larger part was used for training and the smaller part, for evaluation. Since the ratio between training and testing samples varies between individual supervised learning techniques, we studied the performance of the modeled techniques by also varying the proportion of the training data to the dataset. We applied four percentage splits; 66%, 75%, 80%, and 90% to allow for 3-, 4-, 5- and 10-fold cross-validation experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the analyzed techniques. The variation helped to lessen the chance of over fitting, and averaged the effects of various conditions on accuracy. The experiments were conducted in the WEKA environment. The results indicated that Random Forest is the most reliable technique to model for predicting the mortality in ASC patients with acceptable accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 70.9%, 76.3%, and 65.5%, respectively. The results are further confirmed by SROC analysis.

Many of these sequences can be characterized as \u201csparse\u201d, that is only a fraction of the elements of the sequence have meaningful value. This is the case in many practical applications, such as the analysis of DNA sequences, where it is postulated that only about 1\u20133% of the sequence has any biological significance. Similarly, in intrusion detection, typically the evidence that an audit stream from a system contains an attack is often buried in a vast amount of irrelevant information. Modeling sparse sequences often requires allowing \u201csofter\u201d matches between a sequence and a canonical model such as allowing for mismatches. For example, the classical DNA signal \u201cTATAAT\u201d can often occur with several mismatches in any position such as occurrences \u201cTATCAT\u201d or \u201cTAAAAT\u201d. Computationally, this is problematic because there is an exponential number of models which can match a given sequence. Thus naive approaches to sparse sequence modeling are computationally complex in both time and space. ::: We present a new efficient framework for approaching sparse sequence modeling problems. We present techniques using this framework to address three computational problems: classification or transduction, outlier detection, and signal finding. Specifically, we demonstrate this framework with three applications, classification of amino acid sequences into protein families, outlier detection over sequences of system calls for intrusion detection, and signal finding for discovering transcription factor binding sites in gene promoter regions. This framework employs efficient data structures which index the sequences to allow iterating over all possible sparse models of the sequence. We modify several learning algorithms including Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and a new set of outlier detection algorithms to take advantage of these data structures.

We analyze the benefit of combining hyperspectral images information with 3D geometry information for the detection of Cercospora leaf spot disease symptoms on sugar beet plants. Besides commonly used one-class Support Vector Machines, we utilize an unsupervised sparse representation-based approach with group sparsity prior. Geometry information is incorporated by representing each sample of interest with an inclination-sorted dictionary, which can be seen as an 1D topographic dictionary. We compare this approach with a sparse representation based approach without geometry information and One-Class Support Vector Machines. One-Class Support Vector Machines are applied to hyperspectral data without geometry information as well as to hyperspectral images with additional pixelwise inclination information.

Different classification techniques for identifying various real time network attacks have been proposed in the literature. But most of the algorithms fail to classify the new type of attacks due to lack of collaborative filtering technique and robust classifiers. In this project we propose a new collaborating filtering technique for preprocessing the probe type of attacks and implement a hybrid classifiers based on binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) and random forests (RF) algorithm for the classification of PROBE attacks in a network.

The first experiment used information from the individual Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) as inputs to the SVMs, and compared the results with a technique called a polygenic score, a linear combination of the risk contributions of the SNPs that provides a single risk score for each individual. When more SNPs were entered into the models, one of the non-linear kernels provided better results than the linear SVMs. The second experiment attempted to explain this behaviour by using simulated phenotypes made from different contributions of main effects and interactions. The results strongly suggested that interactions were making a contribution. The final experiment looked at using risk scores made from gene sets. The models identified a set involved in synaptic development that has been previously implicated in schizophrenia, and when the scores from the individual genes were entered, the non-linear kernels again showed improvement, suggesting that there are interactions occurring between these genes. ::: ::: The conclusion was that using SVMs is an effective way to assess for the possible presence of interactions, before searching for them explicitly.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2618649922", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:80488327"}

First, we design four types of convolutional and transposed convolutional layers that consider the characteristics of HSIs to help with extracting discriminative features from limited numbers of labeled HSI samples. Second, we construct semi-supervised GANs to alleviate the shortage of training samples by adding labels to them and implicitly reconstructing real HSI data distribution through adversarial training.

However, such manual QC by human experts cannot be performed in some contries. In addition, it is difficult to regularize the quality of the ocean observation data of all over the world because the manual QC depends on human experts' heuristics. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for error detection in Argo observation data using Conditional Random Field (CRF) to realize an automatic QC with high accuracy equal to human experts. This paper also proposes a feature function design method using decision tree learning. Using decision tree allows coping with various types of observation errors without manual work, whereas previous work had to focus on certain error types due to manual labor for feature function design.

To effectively discover knowledge from social images that are often associated with multimodal contents (including visual images and textual tags), we propose a novel Unified Distance Metric Learning (UDML) scheme, which not only exploits both visual and textual contents of social images, but also effectively unifies both inductive and transductive metric learning techniques in a systematic learning framework.

The main reasonsfor using neurofuzzy networks here are that they can approximate nonlinear functions with arbitrary accuracy, and can be readily trained online. In the proposed scheme, the fault is approximated by the output of a neurofuzzy network, which is to be trained online, and the fault is isolated from the fuzzy rules extracted from the neurofuzzy network. However, as the number of fuzzy rules generated by neurofuzzy networks can be quite large, it is necessary to reduce these rules, which can be a difficult process. A simple approach proposed here is to delete fuzzy rules that have too small a confidence level. It is shown in the simulation example involving a non linear single-link robot arm that the proposed procedure can detect and isolate the fault.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S1474-6670(17)32918-X", "venue": null, "journal": "IFAC Proceedings Volumes", "mag_id": "2325638683", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["6169989", "5576880", "34584257"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111426875"}

Therefore, remote sensing (Multispectral UAV- Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) technology were used to detect the effect of frost on in-filed Maize crop. Two set of multispectral data (before frost and after frost) with four advanced machine learning techniques viz.

A UAV flight was conducted every two months from January to July 2015, and vegetation was measured during image acquisition phases. Vegetation cover was mapped for each image acquisition date (four UAV orthomosaics) using a nonlinear regression model (Support Vector Regression algorithm). Then, the maps of vegetation cover were compared to evaluate the colonization process. RESULTS: Vegetation cover was predicted from UAV with high accuracy (mean correlation coefficient: 0.90). Analysis of the maps revealed that colonization of the alluvial deposits by vegetation was rapid in spring.

In addition to reducing costs and increasing efficiencies for monitoring systems, Wireless Sensor Networking (WSN) is expected to bring consumers a new generation of conveniences. However, there are issues when treating extremely interrelated, composite, and noisy databases with a large dimension. For that purpose, outliers detection techniques (ODT) are used for an effective monitoring system to ensure the safety of a transport process. Therefore, in this paper, a novel model of outliers detection and classification has been developed to complement the existing hardware redundancy and limit checking techniques. To overcome these problems, we present a Combined Kernelized Outliers Detection Technique (CKODT) based WSN for damages detection in water pipeline. Initially, training pressure measurement is collected from the sensors which are implemented outside the pipe. Next, these data are fed into the data reduction algorithm as known as Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) to create discriminant vectors. Then, these vectors were utilized as inputs for the One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) method to classify the feature sets which were extracted using the proposed technique. The main objective of this work was to combine the advantages of these tools to enhance the performance of the monitoring water pipeline system. The accuracy of our Combined Kernelized Outliers Detection Technique for classification was analyzed and compared with variety of techniques. The experimental results showed the improvements of the proposed framework compared to other techniques in the context of damage detection in the monitoring water pipeline process.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.comnet.2019.01.004", "venue": "Comput.

These consist of manually drawn cuneiform characters and their transliteration into an alphanumeric code. Since the Cuneiform script is only available as raster-data, we segment lines with a projection profile, extract Histogram of oriented Gradients (HoG) features, detect outliers caused by tablet damage, and align those features with the transliteration. We apply methods from part-of-speech tagging to learn a correspondence between features and transliteration tokens.

The study presents the realization of an automated risk calculator and death prediction in some life-threatening ailments using Chi-square case-based reasoning (\u03c7 2 CBR) model. The proposed predictive engine is capable of reducing runtime and speeds up execution process through the use of critical \u03c7 2 distribution value. This work also showcases the development of a novel feature selection method referred to as frequent item based rule (FIBR) method. This FIBR method is used for selecting the best feature for the proposed \u03c7 2 CBR model at the preprocessing stage of the predictive procedures. The implementation of the proposed risk calculator is achieved through the use of an in-house developed PHP program experimented with XAMP/Apache HTTP server as hosting server. The process of data acquisition and case-based development is implemented using the MySQL application. Performance comparison between our system, the NBY, the ED-KNN, the ANN, the SVM, the Random Forest and the traditional CBR techniques shows that the quality of predictions produced by our system outperformed the baseline methods studied. The result of our experiment shows that the precision rate and predictive quality of our system in most cases are equal to or greater than 70%.

Therefore, dealing with directional data requires special methods. So far, the design of classifiers for periodic variables adopts a generative approach based on the usage of the von Mises distribution or variants. Since for non-periodic variables state of the art approaches are based on non-generative methods, it is pertinent to investigate the suitability of other approaches for periodic variables. We propose a discriminative Directional Logistic Regression model able to deal with angular data, which does not make any assumption on the data distribution.

We probe for ways to alleviate these problems for supervised GANs in this paper. We explicitly apply the Lipschitz Continuity Condition (LCC) to regularize the GAN. An encoding network that maps the image space to a new optimal latent space is derived from the LCC, and it is used to augment the GAN as a coupling component. The LCC is also converted to new regularization terms in the generator loss function to enforce local invariance. The GAN is optimized together with the encoding network in an attempt to make the generator converge to a more ideal and disentangled mapping that can generate samples more faithful to the target images.

Research aimed at accurate classification of catalytic mechanisms to increase the catalytic activity of GHs is receiving extensive attention. The traditional theories or methods used in the study of catalytic mechanisms of GHs are limited by reaction conditions. They are not suitable for the study of various GHs because different enzymes would show devious physicochemical properties. In this paper, a new method is proposed to classify and predict the catalytic mechanism of a certain glycoside hydrolase according to their sequence and structure features using k-Nearest Neighbour kNN classifier, Support Vector Machine SVM, Naive Bayes NB Classifier and the Multilayer Perception MLP Classifier.

Texture classification is the process of deciding the texture category of an observed image. The proposed approach involves feature extraction and classification stages.

Dominant Local Binary Patterns method captures features which occur most frequently in the image whereas Circularly Symmetric Gabor Filters capture global features to give more textural information. Both these features are combined and given to classification stage. Classification is performed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed approach is implemented on ARM SBC9302. Its performance is evaluated by comparing it with six different featureextraction methods like Daubechies wavelet transform features (DBWP), Rotation invariant Daubechies wavelet transform features(RDBWP), Traditional Gabor filters (TGF), Circular Gabor filters(CGF), Anisotropic circular Gaussian MRFs (ACGMRF), andUniform local binary patterns (LBP). Through experiments, theperformance is also evaluated by applying the approach to originaltextures, histogram-equalized textures , randomly-rotated textures,histogram-equalized and randomly-rotated textures, and texture corrupted by additive Gaussian noise.

Most of the object detection algorithms are used for pictures or videos obtained by a general camera. In practice, fisheye cameras are widely used, which will produce distorted image frames. The research of vehicle detection based on fisheye camera is relatively rare until now. If one network is trained on the existed public dataset, and tested on the distorted images or videos, the accuracy will decrease a lot. Thus, a distorted vehicle dataset needs to be manually labeled in the first. However, if we only use the distorted vehicle dataset to train the model, the mount of the distorted vehicle dataset is small, meanwhile the public datasets will not be fully used. On the other hand, the missing detection and false detection for the distorted images by using SSD algorithm is a considerable problem. Based on those considerations, firstly, transfer learning is adopted to transfer the parameters learned from the public vehicle dataset to the distorted vehicle dataset in this paper. Secondly, an algorithm named MLSSD for the distorted vehicle detection based on the labeled dataset is proposed to achieve a better performance for the vehicle detection, which mainly combines metric learning and SSD algorithm to enormously alleviate the missing detection and false detection. In addition, the scalable overlapping partition pooling (SOPP) method is proposed instead of the spatial pyramid pooling to achieve more robust feature map pooling.

Because of the flexibility of natural language, emergency response plans normally contain unwanted ambiguities, and it is difficult to check consistency and completeness. Automatic text quality analysis of emergency response plans written in Chinese from the perspective of process descriptions is proposed in this paper. Firstly, three types of response tasks including message sending tasks, message receiving tasks and regular tasks are extracted through Bi-LSTM-CRF networks (a Conditional Random Fields network is combined with a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network). Then, a series of text quality analysis rules associated with extracted response tasks are created. These rules focus on the progressive relationship of four levels of emergency responses, completeness of response tasks, ambiguity and redundancy of emergency response plans. Finally, real-world data is collected to validate the proposed approach, which consists of four types of emergency response plans of natural disasters including district, municipal, provincial and national emergency response plans.

This procedure is time consuming and many laboratories resort to the use of less reliable tests to conduct biofilm formation analysis. This is where Machine Learning (ML) could play a significant role. In this study Random Forest Classifier has been applied to a dataset of 960 bacterial isolates, where biofilm formation was tested using the spectrophotometric assay and biofilm categorization was carried out using formulas based on ODc calculations. The proposed model, based on the Random Forest Classifier, achieved the classification accuracy of 96.35% and the classification error is a bare 3.65%.

This method requires the repeated solution of quadraticprograms for different parameter values, and it may imply a large computationalcost, especially in a setting of multiclass SVMs and large training datasets. Formulti-class classification problems, in the presence of different misclassificationcosts, identifying a desirable set of values for these parameters becomes evenmore relevant. In this paper, we propose a partial parametric path algorithm, basedon the property that the path of optimal solutions of the SVMs with respect tothe preceding parameters is piecewise linear. This partial parametric path algorithmrequires the solution of just one quadratic programming problem, and anumber of linear systems of equations. Thus it can significantly reduce the computationalrequirements of the algorithm.

Clusters of microcalcifications are important signs of breast cancer. Manual interpretation of mammographic images, in which the suspicious regions are indicated as areas of varying intensities, is not error free due to a number of reasons. These errors can be reduced by using computer-aided diagnosis systems that result in reduction of either false positives or true negatives. The purpose of the study in this paper is to develop a methodology for distinguishing malignant microcalcification clusters from benign microcalcification clusters. The proposed approach first enhances the region of interest by using morphological operations. Then, two types of features, cluster shape features and cluster texture features, are extracted. A Support Vector Machine is used for classification. A new set of shape features based on the recursive subsampling method is added to the feature set, which improves the classification accuracy of the system. It has been found that these features are capable of differentiating malignant and benign tissue regions. To investigate the performance of the proposed approach, mammogram images are taken from Digital Database for Screening Mammography database and an accuracy of 94.25% has been achieved.

While the task can hardly be completed by machines, we, as humans, are inherently able to sample those relevant persons' details that allow us to correctly solve the problem in a fraction of a second. Thus, knowing where a human might fixate to recognize a person is of paramount interest for re-identification. Inspired by the human gazing capabilities, we want to identify the salient regions of a person appearance to tackle the problem. Toward this objective, we introduce the following main contributions. A kernelized graph-based approach is used to detect the salient regions of a person appearance, later used as a weighting tool in the feature extraction process. The proposed person representation combines visual features either considering or not the saliency. These are then exploited in a pairwise-based multiple metric learning framework. Finally, the non-Euclidean metrics that have been separately learned for each feature are fused to re-identify a person. The proposed kernelized saliency-based person re-identification through multiple metric learning has been evaluated on four publicly available benchmark data sets to show its superior performance over the state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., it achieves a rank 1 correct recognition rate of 42.41% on the VIPeR data set).", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26452280", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2015.2487048", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1911311607", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["7693739", "6979868", "91892", "14411019", "12331515", "9194043", "4649608", "2135173", "10241806", "3389833", "9611427", "36716179", "9022685", "10070153", "7442391", "14397939", "8960049", "9976775", "14909631", "14958192", "19901636", "6029875", "14494104", "16963169", "1447136", "4149132", "11913821", "2835913", "7067277", "10519398", "6213726", "12799509", "4269137", "1661291", "425268", "84297", "4854422", "9643263", "15229292", "11864530", "2938669", "1744852", "350786", "629401", "2539545", "12051918", "15225312", "3527076", "17252485", "3108956", "14327909", "13309728", "18430731", "10615180", "541943"], "inbound_citations": ["12088157", "15678547", "54462907", "10148480", "7420230", "51721246", "78092874", "204777581", "27920491", "73685214", "51929846", "57202137", "14204395", "20014706", "51876046", "37343356", "202750156", "206595765", "53344383", "8152671", "16404696", "39105237", "4402217", "3689898", "4780513", "36985082", "4773332", "35569682", "203951429", "3708495", "56718748", "3455960", "6422867", "54456886", "2374122", "52180262", "2394187", "145862058", "13361796", "7379933", "3391619", "88494148", "52125804", "26081789", "3551557", "203605585", "52821276", "10801526", "29428330", "10632692", "52275719", "202559971", "199587917", "3724310", "3861408", "2177856"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15352079"}

In contrast to the existing algorithm recommendation methods whose meta-target is usually in the form of either the ranking of candidate algorithms or a single algorithm, this article proposes a new and natural multilabel form to describe the meta-target. This is due to the fact that there would be multiple algorithms being appropriate for a given problem in practice. Furthermore, a novel multilabel learning-based generic algorithm recommendation method is proposed, which views the algorithm recommendation as a multilabel learning problem and solves the problem by the mature multilabel learning algorithms.

How miRNA genes are regulated receives considerable attention because it directly affects miRNA-mediated gene regulatory networks. Although numerous prediction models were developed for identifying miRNA promoters or transcriptional start sites (TSSs), most of them lack experimental validation and are inadequate to elucidate relationships between miRNA genes and transcription factors (TFs). Here, we integrate three experimental datasets, including cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) tags, TSS Seq libraries and H3K4me3 chromatin signature derived from high-throughput sequencing analysis of gene initiation, to provide direct evidence of miRNA TSSs, thus establishing an experimental-based resource of human miRNA TSSs, named miRStart. Moreover, a machine-learning-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is developed to systematically identify representative TSSs for each miRNA gene. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resource, an important human intergenic miRNA, hsa-miR-122, is selected to experimentally validate putative TSS owing to its high expression in a normal liver. In conclusion, this work successfully identified 847 human miRNA TSSs (292 of them are clustered to 70 TSSs of miRNA clusters) based on the utilization of high-throughput sequencing data from TSS-relevant experiments, and establish a valuable resource for biologists in advanced research in miRNA-mediated regulatory networks.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3241639", "pubmed_id": "21821656", "doi": "10.1093/nar/gkr604", "venue": "Nucleic Acids Research", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2005596439", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2643676", "8431485", "62806997", "41229429", "25962714", "1721807", "7764682", "7326425", "9375052", "5520417", "14038308", "56073475", "1515737", "8466312", "2007180", "39386865", "22338172", "12449851", "32887491", "8396642", "16766584", "11299474", "7733690", "37182110", "804880", "16375805", "7921510", "1998996", "7782174", "6326093", "52827519", "961425", "32871240", "12797340", "39683427", "22205897", "16226927", "12176099", "7138354", "194951", "11293809", "45174649", "12056148", "27033700", "2194028"], "inbound_citations": ["6707145", "8095416", "7753394", "215641722", "9380014", "6109891", "69435", "5825441", "4203786", "20842492", "12090296", "29283720", "19974312", "215651777", "214876049", "215640780", "19307907", "1684967", "441079", "215193970", "215553878", "15010080", "215181001", "203655573", "6567976", "205285179", "720874", "5924911", "17065802", "1306005", "215017782", "13121070", "432984", "3805149", "211531244", "215226427", "215669485", "4400962", "215635126", "18180351", "20462940", "4790682", "15866551", "10385080", "28726554", "12830770", "195660815", "214880558", "5057313", "6521460", "13501300", "13225729", "17517898", "15739116", "10248186", "22324011", "10451004", "16050938", "22018971", "4628911", "12645354", "15122423", "15275982", "15049350", "7310627", "12775129", "18721480", "11552964", "26722359", "195774112", "24451337", "169038515", "3027293"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:659105"}

In this paper, we propose a novel difference representation learning (DRL) network and present an unsupervised learning framework for multitype CD task. Deep neural networks work well in representation learning but rely too much on labeled data, while clustering is a widely used classification technique free from supervision. However, the distribution of real remote sensing data is often not very friendly for clustering. To better highlight the changes and distinguish different types of changes, we combine difference measurement, DRL, and unsupervised clustering into a unified model, which can be driven to learn Gaussian-distributed and discriminative difference representations for nonchange and different types of changes. Furthermore, the proposed model is extended into an iterative framework to imitate the bottom-up aggregative clustering procedure, in which similar change types are gradually merged into the same classes. At the same time, the training samples are updated and reused to ensure that it converges to a stable solution.

However, in the last few years the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques has increased in many financial institutions because they can provide powerful predictive models. However, the vast majority of the existing AI techniques employ black box models like Support Vector Machine (SVMs) and Neural Network (NNs) which are not able to give clear and transparent reasoning to explain the extracted decision. However nowadays crystal transparent reasoning models is highly needed. This paper explains our work in progress to develop a novel Genetic Type-2 Fuzzy Logic model for decision support to minimize financial default in the banking sector. The proposed system will use evolutionary computing in order to gain the ability to optimize the huge number of rules which are expected to be generated by the type-2 fuzzy inference engine and summarize them in rational number of rules which can provide powerful performance and crystal transparent reasoning model.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CEEC.2018.8674212", "venue": "2018 10th Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CEEC)", "journal": "2018 10th Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CEEC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2934661111", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["32386091", "152947295", "154564388", "121776052", "153827090", "18073068", "60707552", "62543940", "45499905", "38542014", "8933393", "206644080", "153563911", "13928072", "129255687", "14673530", "58184501", "2903810", "62666672", "206107507", "8252337", "19740545", "12069722", "3636900", "24647956", "5120943", "59843901", "844314", "8181525"], "inbound_citations": ["210966578"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:90263421"}

Autonomy in above water vehicles is quite old, with modern cruise missiles exemplifying extreme performance capability in navigation and control in complex environments under sever counter measure attack! Remotely piloted (air) vehicles for surveillance for civil and military usage are both sophisticated and common place today, but offer little intelligence and autonomy in that the majority are teleoperated or at most under significant levels of supervised control/management, with the majority of processing being carried out at the command and control centre. Whilst this approach minimisers the cost of onboard processing, it demands very high communication bandwidth, and lack of flexibility and robustness. It has been demonstrated that decentralised-distributed systems architectures potentially offer a wide range of quality attributes such as ease of systems integration, interoperability, scaling, portability and modularity, inherent robustness and survivability etc, that are necessary for effective implementation of AUVs. Such an architecture must be applicable to all the subsystems necessary for constructing AUVs ie. vehicle locatistaion, obstacle detection, vehicle navigation (and guidance), vehicle control, vehicle local planning and replanning and resource management, and vehicle mission tasking. For the purposes of this talk we will focus on the problems associated with vehicle state determination and control - since they are critical to all other AUV requirements and are relatively well understood and researched. To achieve improved quality of estimation, robustness and fault tolerance, multiple disparate sensors are increasingly being utilised in AUVs, so that following a particular sensor failure other sensors can cover the loss and at worst provide graceful degrading system performance. This in turn requires a mechanism for fusing data from disparate data sources (including symbolic and linguistic) and associated estimation algorithms for dealing with uncertainty and ignorance of coverage etc. Aspects of multi-sensor data fusion for vehicle localisation and obstacle detection, together with developments in estimation algorithms will be covered in the presentation. The generation of full envelope control laws for AUVs that accommodate mass temperature, salinity, depth, etc changes that in turn minimises fuel usage and is robust to damage etc, is extremely difficult by conventional controller design methods. Usually, these methods require an exchange between performance and robustness. In this paper we illustrate AUV modelling and control which enables both criteria to be satisfied utilising Neurofuzzy methods and online data gathering via the sensor bed. The talk will be illustrated by a selection of videos illustrating land based intelligent autonomous vehicles.", "year": 1996, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "146126540", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107379771"}

Input patterns are first classified into a few broad categories, and successive ART modules find increasingly specific categories until a threshold is reached, the level of which can be controlled by a global parameter called 'resolution'. The network thus essentially implements a divisive (or splitting) hierarchical clustering algorithm: hence the name HART-S (for 'hierarchical ART with splitting').

We adopted object-based image analysis (OBIA), applying a multidate segmentation to an OLI time series to generate input data for discrimination of deforestation from seasonal changes using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. We found adequate separability between deforested objects and seasonal changes using SWIR 2. Using spectral indices computed from SWIR 2, the RF algorithm generated a change map with an overall accuracy of 88.3%. For deforestation, the producer\u2019s accuracy was 88.0% and the user\u2019s accuracy was 84.6%.

We propose an incremental transfer learning framework, in which heterogeneous knowledge are integrated and incrementally added to update the target classifier during learning process.

For the image source domain, images are partitioned into several groups according to their semantic information. And for the video source domain, videos are divided in the same way. Unlike traditional methods which measure relevance between the source group and the whole target domain videos, the group weights in this paper are treated as latent variables for each target domain video and learned automatically according to the probability distribution difference between the individual source group and target domain videos.

In this work, we propose a collaborative adversarial learning approach to face completion to explicitly induce the training process. Our method is formulated under a novel generative framework called collaborative GAN (collaGAN), which allows better semantic understanding of a target object through collaborative learning of multiple tasks including face completion, landmark detection, and semantic segmentation. Together with the collaGAN, we also introduce an inpainting concentrated scheme such that the model emphasizes more on inpainting instead of autoencoding.

Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) affects 8.3% of adults in the world, with 43% being underdiagnosed, resulting in 4.9 million deaths per year. In this study, we investigated the potential of urinary volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as novel non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for diabetes. In addition, we investigated the influence of sample age on the diagnostic accuracy of urinary VOCs. We analysed 140 urine samples (73 DM2, 67 healthy) with Field-Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS); a type of eNose; and FOX 4000 (AlphaM.O.S, Toulouse, France). Urine samples were collected at UHCW NHS Trust clinics over 4 years and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C within two hours of collection. Four different classifiers were used for classification, specifically Sparse Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gaussian Process, and Support Vector on both FAIMS and FOX4000. Both eNoses showed their capability of diagnosing DM2 from controls and the effect of sample age on the discrimination. FAIMS samples were analysed for all samples aged 0\u20134 years (AUC: 88%, sensitivity: 87%, specificity: 82%) and then sub group samples aged less than a year (AUC (Area Under the Curve): 94%, Sensitivity: 92%, specificity: 100%). FOX4000 samples were analysed for all samples aged 0\u20134 years (AUC: 85%, sensitivity: 77%, specificity: 85%) and a sub group samples aged less than 18 months: (AUC: 94%, sensitivity: 90%, specificity: 89%). We demonstrated that FAIMS and FOX 4000 eNoses can discriminate DM2 from controls using urinary VOCs. In addition, we showed that urine sample age affects discriminative accuracy.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6316010", "pubmed_id": "30513787", "doi": "10.3390/bios8040121", "venue": "Biosensors", "journal": "Biosensors", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2903229701", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["24442570", "6230902", "3958977", "4850196", "13500200", "95459740", "4976019", "65196649", "35510905", "9804768", "215604779", "32763884", "9115842", "23886612", "20071739", "16510361"], "inbound_citations": ["201621001", "88499678", "209525522"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54465761"}

We design four cascaded modules including multi-label classification, object detection, instance refinement and instance segmentation, which are implemented sequentially by sharing the same backbone. The cascaded pipeline is trained alternatively with a curriculum learning strategy that generalizes labels from high-level images to low-level pixels gradually with increasing accuracy. In addition, we design a proposal calibration module to explore the ability of classification networks to find key pixels that identify object parts, which serves as a post validation strategy running in the inverse order. We evaluate the efficiency of our Label-PEnet in mining instance masks on standard benchmarks: PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012.

These personal opinions, especially negative comments, might have a significant influence on other consumers' purchasing decisions. Therefore, how to detect users' sentiment from textual data to assist companies to carefully respond to customers' comments has become a crucial task. Recently, machine learning methods have been considered as one of solutions in sentiment classification. When applying machine learning approaches to classify sentiment, Term Frequency (TF), Term Presence (TP) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) usually have been employed to describe collected textual data. However, these traditional term weighting methods cannot have positive influence on improving classification performance. Therefore, this work proposes a new term weighting method called Categorical Difference Weights (CDW) by introducing class information.

Gabor transform is then used to detect HFOs in intracerebral Electroencephalography (iEEG) signals recorded in patients candidate to epilepsy surgery. To extract relevant features, energy ratios, along with event duration, are investigated. Discriminant ratios are optimized so as to maximize among the four types of HFOs and artefacts.

In this context, model-based CF algorithms have been studied extensively in the literature and have shown higher accuracy in rating prediction than memory-based ones. The major approach regarding model- based CF is Matrix Factorization (MF). It uses the item ratings given by users to predict unknown ratings, which are posteriorly used in recommendations. Usually, MF learns a data model through optimization algorithms by requiring too much time to process. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel modeling for item ratings that allows one to apply Supervised Learning (SL) algorithms to predict unknown ratings. This modeling consists in computing item similarities to a preselected set of items, namely landmarks. Then, we build a model for each user using his/her ratings as labels and the corresponding vector of item similarities to landmarks as samples. In this work, it was applied Support Vector Regression to learn the data model. We compared our proposal against 5 state-of-the-art CF techniques in 6 different databases.

It is well known that an effective feature can lead to major performance improvements and, as a result, a variety of features have been proposed in the literature. Most of these features have been handcrafted, or designed through trial and error experimentation. Dictionary learning is a class of algorithms that attempt to automatically learn effective features directly from the data (e.g., raw GPR data), with little or no supervision. Dictionary learning methods have yielded state-of-theart performance on many problems, including image recognition, and in this work we adapt them to GPR data in order to learn effective features for buried threat classification. We employ the LC-KSVD algorithm, which is a discriminative dictionary learning approach, as opposed to a purely reconstructive one like the popular K-SVD algorithm.

Although many different algorithms have been developed to solve this problem, real-time adaptive methods are frequently deficient. In this paper, based on filtering and the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs), two approaches are proposed for the aforementioned issue, i.e., a filtering-based restoration scheme (FRS) and a GAN-based restoration scheme (GAN-RS). Distinct from previous methods, FRS restores underwater images in the Fourier domain, which is composed of a parameter search, filtering, and enhancement. Aiming to further improve the image quality, GAN-RS can adaptively restore underwater machine vision in real time without the need for pretreatment. In particular, information in the Lab color space and the dark channel is developed as loss functions, namely, underwater index loss and dark channel prior loss, respectively. More specifically, learning from the underwater index, the discriminator is equipped with a carefully crafted underwater branch to predict the underwater probability of an image. A multi-stage loss strategy is then developed to guarantee the effective training of GANs. Through extensive comparisons on the image quality and applications, the superiority of the proposed approaches is confirmed. Consequently, the GAN-RS is considerably faster and achieves a state-of-the-art performance in terms of the color correction, contrast stretch, dehazing, and feature restoration of various underwater scenes.

Objectives: Estimate the avian-mediated Ecosystem Service Provision (ESP) in contrasting types of forest-matrix interfaces in tropical landscapes, and examine how local habitat and landscape attributes can predict ESPs. Methods: We sampled bird assemblages in forest-pasture (FP) and forest-eucalyptus plantation (FE) interfaces, and estimated their potential as pest control, seed dispersal and pollination agents across human-modified landscapes in southeastern Brazil. Using Random Forest algorithm, we also quantified the relative importance of local vs. landscape attributes in predicting ESPs. Results: The overall ESPs was higher in FP than FE interfaces. Habitat generalist birds were important potential seed disperser and pollinator agents at both FP and FE.

Postma (postma@cs.unimaas.nl) Department of Computer Science, University of Maastricht P.O. Box 616, 6200 MD Maastricht, The Netherlands The outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows. In the next section we discuss the theoretical background. Then, we present the Associative Self-Organizing Network as a model of false memories. In addition, three simulations are described. Finally, we discuss the results and conclude upon the approach. Abstract We present a connectionist model of false memories called the Associative Self-Organizing Network (ASON) model. Four mechanisms underlying the Constructive Memory Framework (CMF) guide the design of the ASON model, a connectionist operationalisation of the CMF. Simulation studies of experiments in the DRM paradigm reveal the ASON model to exhibit false memories. In addition, the effects of Mean Backward Associative Strength and output order on the probability of false recall are simulated. We conclude that the ASON model is capable of simulating and explaining the main findings on false memories. Theoretical Background Introduction Memory is fallible. Every day people are confronted with the shortcomings of their memory, when forgetting things such as -for example- the phone number of a good friend, the title of a book, or the location of their car keys. Memory can also fail in another way; instead of forgetting things that did happen, people may remember events that never took place. These memories can be just as realistic as memories of real events. Such memories of never-happened episodes are called commission errors or false memories. False memories may occur in different situations and their severity can range from attributing a memory to the wrong source to confabulating a complete event (Parkin, 1997). Various studies suggest that false memories are not simply random errors (Gallo & Roediger, 2002; Schwartz et al., 1998). Instead, they appear to be an inevitable consequence of the dynamics of human memory (Schacter et al., 1998). False memories are considered to arise from the very same mechanisms that underlie veridical recall and recognition of true memories. More specifically, we hypothesize that false memories result from the way in which memory representations are stored, processed, and retrieved. Our approach is to investigate the occurrence of false memories in a connectionist model called the Associative Self-Organizing Network (ASON) model. The ASON model is made up of two associatively connected self- organizing maps, for storing and representing stimuli and the contexts in which they occur. Although the scientific literature on false memories is abundant (e.g. Gallo & Roediger, 2002; Johnson et al., 1993; Schacter et al., 1998), to our knowledge, no connectionist model of false memories has yet been proposed. The common view of memory is that of a (re)constructive process (Roediger & McDermott, 1995; Schacter et al., 1998). This means that memories, rather than being literal reproductions of past events, are considered to be reconstructions that are susceptible to a variety of distorting factors. In this view, memories are distorted by schemes, attribution processes, prior knowledge, assumptions, and so forth. This makes it almost impossible to draw a clear boundary between true and false memories in real life situations. For this reason, our study focuses solely on false memories occurring in the experimental setting of the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. A false memory is formalized as a recollection of a stimulus that is ascribed to the experimental context, whereas it was not presented during the experiment. Below, we describe the DRM paradigm in more detail. The DRM Paradigm In order to investigate false memories experimentally, Roediger and McDermott (1995) developed the DRM paradigm, which was a variation of a design originally used by Deese (1959). The experimental set up is as follows. Subjects are presented with lists of twelve or fifteen words that are the strongest associates of a \u201ccritical lure\u201d; a target word which is not presented. Immediately following the presentation of a list, subjects are instructed to recall as many of the list items as possible and to mention only those words of which they are certain that they appeared on the list. Despite this instruction, subjects are about equally likely to recall the critical lure as the other items on the list (Roediger & McDermott, 1995). After completion of the experiment, which usually involves the presentation of multiple lists, recognition performance of items on all the lists is tested. It is found that subjects identify the critical lure as being a list item as often as or more often than words that were actually presented (Roediger & McDermott,", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2587256386", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:151551698"}

Current models have achieved remarkable performance in hallmark vision tasks such as object and scene recognition, and scientists have begun to approach new high-level problems with promising initial results. This project focuses on tasks at the intersection of vision and language, traditionally very distinct Artificial Intelligence fields. In first place, we present an overview of the most widely employed machine learning techniques in computer vision and natural language processing, including Support Vector Machines, Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. A general understanding of these algorithms is needed to comprehend the rest of the project. Secondly, we focus on answering natural language questions about images. A successful solution to this task would allow search engines to retrieve images more effectively, as they would understand which pictures are relevant to complex natural language queries. Chapter \\ref{chapter:question_answering} describes the problem in more detail and analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed solution. We then approach the problem of learning a common representation for language and images that preserves semantic meaning. In such feature space, sentences and pictures depicting similar concepts and scenes would have close encodings. From a practical point of view, it is a useful problem as we could train machine learning models for a given task using language and subsequently use them for vision and vice versa. However, it is also interesting from a theoretical view since it can give insights on how people mix concepts from different domains.

We adopt the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network with skipped connections as the general framework, which can train the models for both sketch synthesis and photo synthesis simultaneously. The two generators can constrain each other. In addition, a feature auto-encoder is introduced to refine the synthetic results. The feature encoder is trained to explore a latent space between the photo domain and sketch domains, assuming that there exists a uniform feature representation for a photo-sketch pair. Instead of participating in the generation process, the feature encoder is only utilized to guide the training process. Meanwhile, the feature loss and the feature consistency loss between the fake images and real images from the latent space are calculated to prevent the important identity-specific information from missing and reduce the artifacts in the synthesized images.

We propose an Information-Distillation Generative Adversarial Network (ID-GAN), a simple yet generic framework that easily incorporates the existing state-of-the-art models for both disentanglement learning and high-fidelity synthesis. Our method learns disentangled representation using VAE-based models, and distills the learned representation with an additional nuisance variable to the separate GAN-based generator for high-fidelity synthesis. To ensure that both generative models are aligned to render the same generative factors, we further constrain the GAN generator to maximize the mutual information between the learned latent code and the output. Despite the simplicity, we show that the proposed method is highly effective, achieving comparable image generation quality to the state-of-the-art methods using the disentangled representation.

Despite solving a linear system is easier than solving a quadratic programming optimization problem, the absence of sparsity in the Lagrange multiplier vector obtained after training a LSSVR model is an important drawback. To overcome this drawback, we present a new approach for sparse LSSVR called Optimally Pruned LSSVR (OP-LSSVR). Our proposal relies on a ranking method, named Multiresponse Sparse Regression (MRSR), which is used to sort the patterns in terms of relevance. After doing so, the leave-one-out (LOO) criterion is also used in order to select an appropriate number of support vectors. Our proposal was inspired by a recent methodology called OP-ELM, which prunes neurons in the hidden layer of Extreme Learning Machines.

Since occupancy levels are piecewise constant, the zero norm of occupancy is plugged into the cost function to penalize non-piecewise constant inputs.

Such findings are typically interpreted as being problematic for the connectionist account. To evaluate whether this interpretation is valid, we carried out simulations in which a set of morphologically related words varying in semantic transparency were embedded in either a morphologically rich or impoverished artificial language.

Hence, quit rent revenue projection is a crucial component for yearly state budget presentation to ensure the sustainable physical and development in the particular state, as well as throughout the whole country. Identifying predictors is essential to accurately predict the revenue for the next coming year. Current practice of quit rent revenue projection in the state of Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia is to increase the past year revenue by a certain percentage according to the performance indicators in the state. This manual prediction has posted an overrated projection every year. Hence, a more intelligent quit rent revenue estimation technique is needed to automate and improve the projection. This project aims to analyse three benchmarking techniques, namely the Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) techniques in quit rent revenue estimation. The studies follows the data science methodology using experimental approach starting from problem formulation to data preparation, model building, results analysis, and concluding on the research findings. The experiment data was built on the quit rent payment transaction in the year of 2015 from the state of Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. The indicators of account active duration, category of land use, arrears, and late payment charges were used as conditional features. The learning models were built to first predict the payment status before estimating the total quit rent revenue for the year of 2016. The estimation results were compared with actual results and further analysis in details using the performance measures of classification accuracy, precision, weighted mean precision, recall, weighted mean recall, and root mean square error (RMSE). The analysis showed that all the three estimation models have demonstrated good performance. The LR model has achieved the best payment status accuracy of 94.78% followed by the NN model at 94.72% and the SVM model at 91.57%. However, the measurement of RMSE has showed a slight different. The NN model has the closest estimation to the actual total amount of quit rent revenue in the coming year with only 2.07% estimation error in Ringgit Malaysia, while the LR and SVM models were recorded with 2.10% and 4.69% difference respectively. In summary, both the LR and NN models are good to be used as the quit rent revenue estimators. However, all the three models are not able to predict the minority class of payment done after yearly quit rent estimation in October because of imbalance data problem. Further research should focus on treating the imbalance data problem before feeding the data into the learning model. Besides, improving the prediction strategy by taking into account the payment trend and behaviors of land owners is another research direction worth to follow.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2897303179", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:158989242"}

In the fuzzy neural framework, decision trees can offer valuable assistance in determining a proper initial system structure, which means not only feature selection, but also rule extraction and organization. This paper proposes a synergistic model that combines the advantages of a subsethood-product neural fuzzy inference system and a CART algorithm, in order to create a novel architecture and generate fuzzy rules of the form \u201cIF - THEN IF\u201d, where the first \u201cIF\u201d concerns the primary attributes and the second \u201cIF\u201d the secondary attributes of the given dataset as defined by our method.

We show that using the commonly adopted transfer learning protocols results in increased overfitting and significantly decreased accuracy compared to optimal protocols, particularly for very small target datasets. We demonstrate that there is a relationship between fine-tuning hyperparameters used and the optimal number of layers to transfer. Our research shows that if this relationship is not taken into account, the optimal number of layers to transfer to the target dataset will likely be estimated incorrectly. Best practice transfer learning protocols cannot be predicted from existing research that has analysed transfer learning under very specific conditions that are not universally applicable. Extrapolating transfer learning training settings from previous findings can in fact be counterintuitive, particularly in the case of smaller datasets. We present optimal transfer learning protocols for various target dataset sizes from very small to large when source and target datasets and tasks are similar. Our results show that using these settings results in a large increase in accuracy when compared to commonly used transfer learning protocols. These results are most significant with very small target datasets. We observed an increase in accuracy of 47.8% on our smallest dataset which comprised of only 10 training examples per class. These findings are important as they are likely to improve outcomes from past, current and future research in transfer learning.

Class imbalance happens when the data categories are not equally represented, i.e., at least one category is minority compared to other categories. It can cause learning bias towards the majority class and poor generalization. Concept drift is a change in the underlying distribution of the problem, and is a significant issue specially when learning from data streams. It requires learners to be adaptive to dynamic changes. Class imbalance and concept drift can significantly hinder predictive performance, and the problem becomes particularly challenging when they occur simultaneously. This challenge arises from the fact that one problem can affect the treatment of the other. For example, drift detection algorithms based on the traditional classification error may be sensitive to the imbalanced degree and become less effective; and class imbalance techniques need to be adaptive to changing imbalance rates, otherwise the class receiving the preferential treatment may not be the correct minority class at the current moment. Therefore, the mutual effect of class imbalance and concept drift should be considered during algorithm design. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from the areas of class imbalance learning and concept drift in order to encourage discussions and new collaborations on solving the combined issue of class imbalance and concept drift. It provides a forum for international researchers and practitioners to share and discuss their original work on addressing new challenges and research issues in class imbalance learning, concept drift, and the combined issues of class imbalance and concept drift.

We propose a novel approach for the simultaneous classification of land cover and land use, where semantic and spatial context is considered. The image sites for land cover and land use classification form a hierarchy consisting of two layers: a land cover layer and a land use layer . We apply Conditional Random Fields (CRF) at both layers. The layers differ with respect to the image entities corresponding to the nodes, the employed features and the classes to be distinguished. In the land cover layer, the nodes represent super-pixels; in the land use layer, the nodes correspond to objects from a geospatial database. Both CRFs model spatial dependencies between neighbouring image sites. The complex semantic relations between land cover and land use are integrated in the classification process by using contextual features. We propose a new iterative inference procedure for the simultaneous classification of land cover and land use, in which the two classification tasks mutually influence each other. This helps to improve the classification accuracy for certain classes. The main idea of this approach is that semantic context helps to refine the class predictions, which, in turn, leads to more expressive context information. Thus, potentially wrong decisions can be reversed at later stages. The approach is designed for input data based on aerial images.

As advanced tools, smart meters can ensure the timely reading of HSPS data, automating metering and producing fine-grained data. However, to ensure the dynamic data management and a better understanding of HSPS operations, it is crucial to analyze and forecast these digital records for decision-making and smart control. Up to now, deep learning algorithms have only been applied sparsely in the field of renewable energy power forecasting. In this paper, we apply an auto-configurable middleware based on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model for several forecasting time dimensions to choose the significant timescale for learning setting.

Mammogram becomes a preferable way to detect the cancer because it has reasonable price with quite good quality of radiographic images. Our work is about developing case tool for processing mammogram with a combination of classification method and image retrieval technique so it could give some helps for the doctors. We selected Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classification method. However SVM gives less accurate results if the learning data of classification has limited amounts. Some modification on SVM called Adaptive SVM (Ada-SVM) has been done in order to solve data limitation. Image retrieval system related to Ada-SVM implementation works to find similar images based on a distance measurement of Eucledian Distance. Then instead of SVM, classification with Ada-SVM is performed on the retrieved images. Ada-SVM is used whenever misclassification happens on learning process. Image classification processes feature values which are extracted from mammograms. Before feature extraction we applied image segmentation with Otsu Thresholding to recognize gray levels of an image that separating its background and foreground. Gray level value which is the largest variance will become a threshold value. Mammogram has black region of radiographic as background and breast image as foreground. Then we produced Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) from segmented foreground of breast image and then uses the matrix to calculate texture features called Haralick features. GLCM is defined in order to find gray level values between pixels which is separated by distance and angle. GLCM will have a matrix with size number the same as the highest gray level value of an image. ::: In our experiment, the system used standard dataset for mammograms research called Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) data in learning and testing phases. The size of image for our experiment was manually resized into the size of breast area only without using dark area in the background. For learning phase we used 90 mammogram images classified into three classes: normal, benign and malign. We implemented SVM as binary classification and made experiment of three combinations, normal \u2013 benign, normal \u2013 malign, and benign \u2013 malign, and then analyzed on their average results.

Detailed pre-surgical evaluation and lateralization using Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is expected to result in a successful surgical outcome. In this study, an optimized pattern recognition approach is proposed for lateralization of mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (mTLE) patients using asymmetry of imaging indices of hippocampus. T1-weighted and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images of 76 symptomatic mTLE patients are considered. First, hippocampus is segmented using automatic and manual segmentation methods; then, volumetric and intensity features are extracted from the MR images. A nonlinear Support Vector Machine (SVM) with optimized Gaussian Radial Basis Function (GRBF) kernel is used to classify the imaging features. Using leave-one-out cross validation, this method results in a correct lateralization rate of 82%, a probability of detection for the left side of 0.90 (with false alarm probability of 0.04) and a probability of detection for the right side of 0.69 (with zero false alarm probability).

In this study, we present clinical validation of CAB. CAB was validated using a retrospective cohort of 857 patients. All patients were treated either with endocrine therapy or chemoendocrine therapy. Risk categorization by CAB was analyzed by calculating Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS) and recurrence rates using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Multivariate analysis was performed to calculate Hazard ratios (HR) for CAB high-risk vs low-risk patients. The results showed that Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS) was significantly different (P-0.002) between low- (DMFS: 95%) and high-risk (DMFS: 80%) categories in the endocrine therapy treated alone subgroup (n = 195) as well as in the total cohort (n = 857, low-risk DMFS: 95%, high-risk DMFS: 84%, P < 0.0001). In addition, the segregation of the risk categories was significant (P = 0.0005) in node-positive patients, with a difference in DMFS of 12%. In multivariate analysis, CAB risk score was the most significant predictor of distant recurrence with hazard ratio of 3.2048 (P < 0.0001). CAB stratified patients into discrete risk categories with high statistical significance compared to Ki-67 and IHC4 score-based stratification. CAB stratified a higher percentage of the cohort (82%) as low-risk than IHC4 score (41.6%) and could re-stratify >74% of high Ki-67 and IHC4 score intermediate-risk zone patients into low-risk category.

Herein, the application of the Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) to soil moisture inversion is explored. Simulation is carried out using different sets of training and test data. The methods have been applied to two sets of data to retrieve bare-surface soil moisture, and the rms error (RMSE) as well as the correlation coefficient (R2) is also obtained. The integral equation model (IEM) is chosen to obtain the backscattering coefficients as the simulated active microwave data. Using the IEM method, problems regarding forward scattering have been addressed, and the optimum incident angle has been determined through sensitivity analyses. Similarly, the emissivity model is applied to simulate a large range of soil moisture and surface roughness in order to acquire the brightness temperature and generate the datasets. The backscattering coefficients and brightness temperature are utilized as the informative microwave data in a manner that combines active and passive remote sensing. The frequencies of interest include 1.4 GHz (L-band), 6.9 GHz (C-band) as well as 10.7 GHz (X-band). Integrating these frequencies as well as multiple polarization states, the inversion accuracy has been improved. The effectiveness of this application is assessed by considering various input combinations (i.e., different microwave sensor frequencies, polarization status and incident angles).

FORM/SORM are very suitable solutions when applicable but, due to their inherent assumptions, they sometimes lead to incorrect results for problems involving for instance multiple design points and/or nonsmooth failure domains. Recourse to simulation methods could therefore be the only viable solution for these kinds of problems. However, a major shortcoming of simulation methods is that they require a large number of calls to the structural model, which may be prohibitive for industrial applications.

Most of the development in this area is based on discontinuous thumb position control, which makes it possible to recreate several of the most important functions of the thumb but does not result in total imitation. The paper looks into the classification of Electromyogram (EMG) signals from thumb muscles for the prediction of thumb angle during flexion motion.

First, our tracker does not rely on a pre-trained object detector to get the initial object hypotheses. Second, our tracker's final output is the fine contours of the targets rather than traditional bounding boxes. Therefore, our tracker simultaneously solves three main problems: detection, data association and segmentation. This is especially important because the output of each of those three problems are highly correlated and the solution of one can greatly help improve the others. The proposed algorithm consists of two main components: structured learning and Lagrange dual decomposition. Our structured learning based tracker learns a model for each target and infers the best locations of all targets simultaneously in a video clip. The inference of our structured learning is achieved through a new Target Identity-aware Network Flow (TINF), where each node in the network encodes the probability of each target identity belonging to that node. The probabilities are obtained by training target specific models using a global structured learning technique. This is followed by proposed Lagrangian relaxation optimization to find the high quality solution to the network. This forms the first component of our tracker. The second component is Lagrange dual decomposition, which combines the structured learning tracker with a segmentation algorithm. For segmentation, multi-label Conditional Random Field (CRF) is applied to a superpixel based spatio-temporal graph in a segment of video, in order to assign background or target labels to every superpixel. We show how the multi-label CRF is combined with the structured learning tracker through our dual decomposition formulation. This leads to more accurate segmentation results and also helps better resolve typical difficulties in multiple target tracking, such as occlusion handling, ID-switch and track drifting.

In binary text classification, linear SVM has shown remarkable efficiency for classifying documents due to its superior performance. It tries to create the best decision boundary that enables the separation of positive and negative documents with the largest margin hyperplane. However, in most cases there are regions in which positive and negative documents are mixed due to the uncertain boundary. With an uncertain boundary, the learning classifier is more complex, and it often becomes difficult for a single classifier to accurately classify all unknown testing samples into classes. Therefore, more innovative methods and techniques are needed to solve the uncertain boundary problem that was traditionally solved by non-linear SVM. In this paper, multiple support vector machines are proposed that can effectively deal with the uncertain boundary and improve predictive accuracy in linear SVM for data having uncertainties. This is achieved by dividing the training documents into three distinct regions (positive, boundary, and negative regions) based on a sliding window technique to ensure the certainty of extracted knowledge to describe relevant information. The model then derives new training samples to build a multiple SVMs based classifier.

Traditional flat classification methods (e.g., binary or multi-class classification) neglect the structural information between different classes. In contrast, Hierarchical Multi-label Classification (HMC) considers the structural information embedded in the class hierarchy, and uses it to improve classification performance. In this paper, we propose a local hierarchical ensemble framework for HMC, Fully Associative Ensemble Learning (FAEL). We model the relationship between each class nodes global prediction and the local predictions of all the class nodes as a multi-variable regression problem with Frobenius norm or l1 norm regularization. It can be extended using the kernel trick, which explores the complex correlation between global and local prediction. In addition, we introduce a binary constraint model to restrict the optimal weight matrix learning.

The primary objective of this work is to propose a three-dimensional (3D) novel brain tumor classification model using MRI images with both micro- and macroscale textures designed to differentiate the MRI of brain under two classes of lesion, benign and malignant. The design approach was initially preprocessed using 3D Gaussian filter. Based on VOI (volume of interest) of the image, features were extracted using 3D volumetric Square Centroid Lines Gray Level Distribution Method (SCLGM) along with 3D run length and cooccurrence matrix. The optimal features are selected using the proposed refined gravitational search algorithm (RGSA). Support vector machines, over backpropagation network, and k-nearest neighbor are used to evaluate the goodness of classifier approach. The preliminary evaluation of the system is performed using 320 real-time brain MRI images. The system is trained and tested by using a leave-one-case-out method.

We describe three approaches of learning systems that use a graph representation: the Galois Lattice, Conceptual Graphs, and Subdue. The study of these systems gave us significant insight on how the concept-learning task is conducted in a graph-based system and also on how we can elaborate a theoretical analysis of our system. In the theory part we performed a PAC learning analysis of our system where we found that it is possible to PAC learn single-graphs with our approach using a polynomial number of examples. For the case of learning multiple graphs in DNF, the number of examples needed is exponential, but with experimental results we show that SubdueCL does not need that many examples to learn. We also compared our graph-based concept learning approach to the Galois lattice formal framework, which attempts to constrain the search space to polynomial size. We show that SubdueCL also creates a Galois lattice except that SubdueCL's lattice may add graphs which are super-graphs of others while removing graphs that are not connected. Then, we present SubdueCL, our graph-based concept learner, and show some experimental results including a comparison of SubdueCL with the Inductive Logic Programming systems FOIL and Progol. Results show that SubdueCL is competitive with logic-based learners using structural data. Results in an artificial domain show that SubdueCL learns successfully in training example graphs of various size, density and noise. In the case of noise (when the positive concept also exists in the negative graphs), SubdueCL learns several more specific graphs found in the positive graphs, but not in the negative graphs. In the case of density, SubdueCL tends to learn more sub-graphs (to represent the concept) as the graph density increases. Results from the theoretical and empirical analyses indicate that our graph-based approach to concept learning is efficient and effective.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "191146219", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["14796048", "6819445", "8518093", "1436941", "17756303"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116998605"}

A major challenge is that clinical data (i.e. patients) with drug response outcome is very limited, creating a need for transfer learning to bridge the gap between large pre-clinical pharmacogenomics datasets (e.g. cancer cell lines), as a source domain, and clinical datasets as a target domain. Two major discrepancies exist between pre-clinical and clinical datasets: 1) in the input space, the gene expression data due to difference in the basic biology, and 2) in the output space, the different measures of the drug response. Therefore, training a computational model on cell lines and testing it on patients violates the i.i.d assumption that train and test data are from the same distribution. Results We propose Adversarial Inductive Transfer Learning (AITL), a deep neural network method for addressing discrepancies in input and output space between the pre-clinical and clinical datasets. AITL takes gene expression of patients and cell lines as the input, employs adversarial domain adaptation and multi-task learning to address these discrepancies, and predicts the drug response as the output. To the best of our knowledge, AITL is the first adversarial inductive transfer learning method to address both input and output discrepancies. Experimental results indicate that AITL outperforms state-of-the-art pharmacogenomics and transfer learning baselines and may guide precision oncology more accurately.

In order to obtain a robust metric for matching, metric learning has been introduced recently. Most existing works focus on seeking a Mahalanobis distance by employing sparse pairwise constraints, which utilize image pairs with the same person identity as positive samples, and select a small portion of those with different identities as negative samples. However, this training strategy has abandoned a large amount of discriminative information, and ignored the relative similarities. In this paper, we propose a novel relevance metric learning method with listwise constraints (RMLLCs) by adopting listwise similarities, which consist of the similarity list of each image with respect to all remaining images. By virtue of listwise similarities, RMLLC could capture all pairwise similarities, and consequently learn a more discriminative metric by enforcing the metric to conserve predefined similarity lists in a low-dimensional projection subspace. Despite the performance enhancement, RMLLC using predefined similarity lists fails to capture the relative relevance information, which is often unavailable in practice. To address this problem, we further introduce a rectification term to automatically exploit the relative similarities, and develop an efficient alternating iterative algorithm to jointly learn the optimal metric and the rectification term. Extensive experiments on four publicly available benchmarking data sets are carried out and demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art approaches. The results also show that the introduction of the rectification term could further boost the performance of RMLLC.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26259221", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2015.2466117", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1605761733", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["765855", "88762", "16512846", "32476706", "4679355", "6485959", "7973738", "10315527", "15225312", "2975493", "5706510", "2054652", "15596406", "10070153", "12562504", "5228609", "7701900", "4095685", "2135173", "17819245", "4149132", "938105", "13536642", "10241806", "10872115", "541943", "6540618", "10351844", "44918", "16963169", "84297", "9643263", "4654536", "425268", "18453384", "198120256", "9022685", "14958192", "17861781", "16773131", "1029934", "3385678", "47325215", "14146409", "4854422", "13309728", "2643381", "3043202", "1815453", "11864530", "15229292", "12148694", "1661291", "13709956", "16224222"], "inbound_citations": ["52310801", "4872833", "4690254", "55417451", "51613467", "57201650", "57363170", "70278399", "19207026", "213505652", "4942108", "38686200", "84185848", "14138494", "2481380", "53034158", "10891011", "7998337", "49575213", "4254465", "51881836", "1357644", "13361796", "54207240", "3970781", "14565941", "10079228", "7379933", "186206547", "186206547", "15556069", "88494148", "26081789", "69874194", "1259407", "32343257", "49190222", "4857212", "51609927", "202559971", "36289174", "199587917", "18036135", "202412956"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14926665"}

Habitat suitability modelling is being used increasingly to predict distribution patterns of VME indicator taxa in the deep sea, where data are particularly sparse, and the models are considered useful for marine ecosystem management. The Louisville Seamount Chain is located within the South Pacific Regional Fishery Management Organisation (SPRFMO) Convention Area, and some seamounts are the subject of bottom trawling for orange roughy by the New Zealand fishery. The aim of the present study was to produce high-resolution habitat suitability maps for VME indicator taxa and VME habitat on these seamounts, in order to evaluate the feasibility of designing within-seamount spatial closures to protect VMEs. We used a multi-model habitat suitability mapping approach, based on bathymetric and backscatter data collected by multibeam echo sounder survey, and data collected by towed underwater camera for the stony coral and habitat-forming VME indicator species Solenosmilia variabilis, as well as two taxa indicative of stony coral habitat (Brisingida, Crinoidea). Model performance varied among the different model types used (Boosted Regression Tree, Random Forest, Generalized Additive Models), but abundance-based models consistently out-performed models based on presence-absence data. Uncertainty for ensemble models (combination of all models) was lower overall compared to the other models. Maps resulting from our models showed that suitable habitat for Solenosmilia variabilis is distributed around the summit-slope break of seamounts, and along ridges that extend down the seamount flanks. Only the flat, soft sediment summits are predicted to be unsuitable habitat for this stony coral species. We translated a definition for stony coral-reef habitat into a Solenosmilia variabilis abundance-based threshold in order to use our models to map this VME habitat. These maps showed that coral-reef occurred in small and isolated patches, and that most of the seabed on these seamounts is predicted to be unsuitable habitat for this VME. We discuss the implications of these results for spatial management closures on the Louisville Seamount Chain seamounts and the wider SPRFMO.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3389/fmars.2017.00335", "venue": "Front.

Our model consists of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that learns a strong prior on the clean image domain using adversarial loss and maps the blurred image to its clean equivalent. To improve the stability of GAN and to preserve the image correspondence, we introduce an additional CNN module that reblurs the generated GAN output to match with the blurred input. Along with these two modules, we also make use of the blurred image itself to self-guide the network to constrain the solution space of generated clean images. This self-guidance is achieved by imposing a scale-space gradient error with an additional gradient module.

By using a Metacognitive Radial basis Function Network classifier, classification accuracy of 59.73%, 61.49% and 70.41% is achieved when considering all males, adolescent males and adult males respectively. This is about (5 to 10%) higher than Support Vector Machine classifier which is commonly used in literature for this problem and about (6 to 15%) higher than Naive Bayes classifier. It is also found that all three classifiers perform better when considering adult and adolescent males separately instead of considering all males together underscoring the need to consider different age-groups separately for ASD detection. VBM analysis indicates that the precentral gyrus, motor cortex, medial frontal gyrus and the paracentral lobule areas are possibly affected for adolescent males with ASD while the superior frontal gyrus and the frontal eye fields areas are possibly affected for adult males with ASD.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280537", "venue": "2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "journal": "2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1653991611", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["214682308", "45265409", "41700949", "15953737", "19647802", "21221784", "36965322", "16495655", "37591737", "5509554", "7047297", "15706424", "14939655", "25426258", "2215535", "3051885", "13861754"], "inbound_citations": ["67873965", "8683982"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:674222"}

After comparing some of the general characteristics of epigeneticist and cognitivist theories, we provide a brief overview of the operating principles underlying Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and their associated learning procedures. Four applications of different PDP architectures to developmental phenomena are described. First, we assess the current status of the debate between symbolic and connectionist accounts of the process of English past tense formation. Second, we introduce a connectionist model of concept formation and vocabulary growth and show how it provides an account of aspects of semantic development in early childhood. Next, we take up the problem of compositionality and structure dependency in connectionist nets, and demonstrate that PDP models can be architecturally designed to capture the structural principals characteristic of human cognition. Finally, we review a connectionist model of cognitive develop ment which yields stage-like behavioural properties even though architectural and input assumptions remain constant throughout training. It is shown how the organizational characteristics of the model provide a simple but precise account of the equilibration of the processes of accommodation and assimilation.

The first key contribution of this paper is to present a system specifically designed for the drills, by attempting not only to detect the faulty drills but also to detect whether the sounds were generated during the active or the idling stage of the whole machinery system, in order to provide a complete remote control. The second key contribution of the work is to represent the power spectrum of the sounds as images and apply some transformations on them in order to reveal, expose, and emphasize the health patterns that are hidden inside them. The created images, the so-called power spectrum density (PSD)-images, are then given to a deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) for a high-level feature extraction process. The final step of the scheme consists of adopting the proposed PSD-images + DCAE features as the final representation of the original sounds and utilize them as the inputs of a nonlinear classifier whose outputs will represent the final diagnosis decision.

As these morphological diversities have been a central subject of adaptive speciation and taxonomic classification, such high diversity could serve as a foundation for automation of species identification of cichlids. ::: ::: ::: METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING ::: Here we demonstrate a method for automatic classification of the Lake Malawi cichlids based on computer vision and geometric morphometrics. For this end we developed a pipeline that integrates multiple image processing tools to automatically extract informative features of color and stripe patterns from a large set of photographic images of wild cichlids. The extracted information was evaluated by statistical classifiers Support Vector Machine and Random Forests. Both classifiers performed better when body shape information was added to the feature of color and stripe. Besides the coloration and stripe pattern, body shape variables boosted the accuracy of classification by about 10%. The programs were able to classify 594 live cichlid individuals belonging to 12 different classes (species and sexes) with an average accuracy of 78%, contrasting to a mere 42% success rate by human eyes. The variables that contributed most to the accuracy were body height and the hue of the most frequent color. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Computer vision showed a notable performance in extracting information from the color and stripe patterns of Lake Malawi cichlids although the information was not enough for errorless species identification. Our results indicate that there appears an unavoidable difficulty in automatic species identification of cichlid fishes, which may arise from short divergence times and gene flow between closely related species.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3808401", "pubmed_id": "24204918", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0077686", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2031200825", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["5623812", "86639587", "41107245", "83144868", "54520095", "3617239", "85394037", "24187326", "28657694", "4315569", "84980996", "84800272", "1973567", "86449219", "18265877", "613573", "17961291", "16789544", "18700", "6147002", "12207213", "84501592", "4877873", "52874011", "8323728", "8390020", "583273", "8714672", "17584818", "3626971", "7730131", "3051595", "961425", "6202829", "205013529", "34468337", "36184843", "14179309", "12829833", "34642937", "85329402", "34442653", "12489815", "82790941", "3035384", "5727373", "2829927", "1241903", "87665211", "24552161", "785788", "24222146", "26049018", "3688264", "19852207", "18021511", "42650118", "198157011", "15791153", "86503375", "7564872", "10323438", "43846597", "17342310", "84786662"], "inbound_citations": ["1381788", "128362994", "4859204", "6186243", "44137325", "201089213", "215088339", "18530519", "10294777"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4048317"}

Minwise hashing schemes become the current researching hot spots in machine learning for similarity preservation. During the data preprocessing stage, the basic idea of minwise hashing schemes is to transfer the original data into binary codes which are good proxies of original data to preserve the similarity. Minwise hashing schemes can improve the computation efficiency and save the storage space without notable loss of accuracy. Thus, they have been studied extensively and developed rapidly for decades. Considering minwise hashing algorithm and its variants, a systematic survey is needed and beneficial to understand and utilize this kind of data preprocessing techniques more easily. The purpose of this paper is to review minwise hashing algorithms in detail and provide an insightful understanding of current developments. In order to show the application prospect of the minwise hashing algorithms, various algorithms have combined with linear Support Vector Machine for large-scale classification. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that these algorithms can achieve massive advantages in accuracy, efficiency and energy-consumption.

The main reason for catastrophic forgetting is that the past data are not available during learning. Typical approaches keep some exemplars for the past classes and use distillation regularization to retain the classification capability on the past classes and balance the past and new classes. However, there are four main problems with these approaches. First, the loss function is not efficient for classification. Second, there is unbalance problem between the past and new classes. Third, the size of pre-decided exemplars is usually limited and they might not be distinguishable from unseen new classes. Forth, the exemplars may not be allowed to be kept for a long time due to privacy regulations. To address these problems, we propose (a) a new loss function to combine the cross-entropy loss and distillation loss, (b) a simple way to estimate and remove the unbalance between the old and new classes , and (c) using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate historical data and select representative exemplars during generation. We believe that the data generated by GANs have much less privacy issues than real images because GANs do not directly copy any real image patches.

Various phenomena depend on phoneme similarity, such as spoken word recognition or serial recall from verbal working memory. This study presents a new framework for learning a metric function for perceptual distances among pairs of phonemes. Previous studies have proposed various metric functions, from simple measures counting the number of phonetic dimensions that two phonemes share (place-, manner-of-articulation and voicing), to more sophisticated ones such as deriving perceptual distances based on the number of natural classes that both phonemes belong to. However, previous studies have manually constructed the metric function, which may lead to unsatisfactory account of the empirical data. This study presents a framework to derive the metric function from behavioral data on phoneme perception using learning algorithms. We first show that this approach outperforms previous metrics suggested in the literature in predicting perceptual distances among phoneme pairs. We then study several metric functions derived by the learning algorithms and show how perceptual saliencies of phonological features can be derived from them. For English, we show that the derived perceptual saliencies are in accordance with a previously described order among phonological features and show how the framework extends the results to more features. Finally, we explore how the metric function and perceptual saliencies of phonological features may vary across languages.

Also, this predictive model will help to lower morbidity and mortality rates through earlier detection and intervention. A new model using an ensemble approach is proposed to improve the accuracy and the performance. A Generalized Boosted Model (GBM) was trained and tested on the balanced dataset.

The problem has been tackled using various models viz., Statistical, Market Based and Computational Intelligence in the past. Among Computational Intelligence models, Artificial Neural Network has become dominant modeling paradigm. In this Paper, we use a novel Soft Computing tool viz., Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM) to solve bankruptcy prediction problem. Support Vector Machine is a powerful statistical classification technique based on the idea of Structural Risk Minimization. Fuzzy Sets are capable of handling uncertainty and impreciseness in corporate data. Thus, using the advantage of Machine Learning and Fuzzy Sets prediction accuracy of whole model is enhanced. FSVM is implemented for analyzing predictors as financial ratios. A method of adapting it to default probability estimation is proposed. The test dataset comprises of 50 largest bankrupt organizations with capitalization of no less than $1 billion that filed for protection against creditors under Chapter 11 of United States Bankruptcy Code in 2001-2002 after stock marked crash of 2000. Experimental results on FSVM illustrate that it is better capable of extracting useful information from corporate data. This is followed by a comparative study of FSVM with other approaches. FSVM is effective in finding optimal feature subset and parameters. This is evident from the results thus improving prediction of bankruptcy. The choice of feature subset has positive influence on appropriate kernel parameters and vice versa which demonstrate its appreciable generalization performance than traditional bankruptcy prediction methods. Choosing appropriate value of parameter plays an important role on the performance of FSVM model. The effect of variability in prediction performance of FSVM with respect to various values of different parameters of SVM is also investigated. Finally, a comparative study of clustering power of FSVM is made with PNN on ripley and bankruptcy datasets.

Conventionally, the researchers have relied on the conventional modeling approaches of regression, time series, and conceptual methods to model the complex rainfall-runoff process. In the last couple of decades, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been employed as suitable alternatives for the modeling of the rainfall-runoff process. The feed-forward neural networks trained using gradient descent algorithm, proposed in [7], have been the most popular ANN among researchers. However, the various algorithms to train ANNs are prone to getting stuck in local minima and are extremely tedious and time consuming. More recently, Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) have been proposed as powerful tools for modeling and forecasting complex physical systems that are much easier to develop as compared to the ANNs. In this study, we demonstrate the use of both ANNs and ELMs for the modeling and forecasting of the complex rainfall-runoff process. The data derived from the Eel River watershed, USA were employed to demonstrate the application of the methodologies proposed here.

Nevertheless, transfer learning imposes heavy computation burden to the resource-constrained edge devices. Existing task allocation works usually assume all submitted tasks are equally important, leading to inefficient resource allocation at a task level when directly applied in Multi-task Transfer Learning (MTL). To address these issues, we first reveal that it is crucial to measure the impact of tasks on overall decision performance improvement and quantify task importance. We then show that task allocation with task importance for MTL (TATIM) is a variant of NP-complete Knapsack problem, where the complicated computation to solve this problem needs to be conducted repeatedly under varying contexts. To solve TATIM with high computational efficiency, we propose a Data-driven Cooperative Task Allocation (DCTA) approach. Finally, we evaluate the performance of DCTA by not only a trace-driven simulation, but also a new comprehensive real-world AIOps case study which bridges model and practice via a new architecture and main components design within AIOps system. Extensive experiments show that our DCTA reduces 3.24 times of processing time, and saves 48.4 percent energy consumption compared with the state-of-the-art when solving TATIM.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TPDS.2019.2962435", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2996942942", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["35505309", "2066395", "12016916", "27255988", "207189668", "25496151", "10884927", "11330347", "15204255", "52964758", "11176327", "1902656", "46886921", "198362071", "116798084", "718679", "9128102", "12833219", "29157927", "115650658", "12273279", "6378010", "199466309", "53984474", "57189394", "52282818", "205242740", "4774976", "7887442", "206779368", "113849927", "107158940", "111315776", "111936645", "110936859", "109024067", "107568439", "110308577", "110553678", "488434", "16804330", "11438116", "39188689", "2235165", "1158124", "126180318", "86842591", "102481936", "750363", "13662098", "11306233", "13219479", "20369776", "44069718", "15779781", "8815024", "201302880", "16067007"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210994829"}

Snow depth data time series are valuable for climatological and hydrological applications. Passive microwave (PMW) sensors are advantageous for estimating spatially and temporally continuous snow depth. However, PMW estimate accuracy has several problems, which results in poor performances of traditional snow depth estimation algorithms. Machine learning (ML) is a common method used in many research fields, and its early application in remote sensing is promising. In this study, we propose a new and accurate approach based on the ML technique to estimate real-time snow depth and reconstruct historical snow depth from 1987\u20132018. First, we trained the random forest (RF) model with advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2) brightness temperatures (TB) at 10.65, 18.7, 36.5 and 89 GHz, land cover fraction (forest, shrub, grass, farm and barren), geolocation (latitude and longitude) and station observation from 2014\u20132015. Then, the trained RF model was used to retrieve a reference dataset with 2012\u20132018 AMSR2 TB data as the accurate snow depth. With this reference snow depth dataset, we developed the pixel-based algorithm for the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMI/S). Finally, the pixel-based method was used to reconstruct a consistent 31-year daily snow depth dataset for 1987\u20132018. We validated the trained RF model using the weather station observations and AMSR2 TB during 2012\u20132013. The results showed that the RF model root mean square error (RMSE) and bias were 4.5 cm and 0.04 cm, respectively. The pixel-based algorithm\u2019s accuracy was evaluated against the field sampling experiments dataset (January\u2013March, 2018) and station observations in 2017\u20132018, and the RMSEs were 2.0 cm and 5.1 cm, respectively. The pixel-based method performs better than the previous regression method fitted in China (RMSEs are 4.7 cm and 8.4 cm, respectively). The high accuracy of the pixel-based method can be attributed to the spatial dynamic retrieval coefficients and accurate snow depth estimates of the RF model. Additionally, the 1987\u20132018 long-term snow depth dataset was analyzed in terms of temporal and spatial variations. On the spatial scale, daily maximum snow depth tends to occur in Xinjiang and the Himalayas during 1992\u20132018. However, the daily mean snow depth in Northeast China is the largest. For the temporal characteristics, the February mean snow depth is the thickest during snowy winter seasons. Interestingly, the January mean snow depth represents the annual mean snow depth, which plays an important role in snow depth prediction and hydrological management. In conclusion, through step-by-step validation using in situ observations, our pixel-based approach is available in real-time snow depth retrievals and historical data reconstruction.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/tc-2019-161", "venue": null, "journal": "The Cryosphere Discussions", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": ["54074350"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203073584"}

Experimental testing reveals that our method achieves better performance than the LSVM alone using synthetic data, the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the Caltech database of Generic Object Classification.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1587/transinf.E94.D.379", "venue": "IEICE Transactions", "journal": "IEICE Transactions", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2061264559", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11326549", "28637672", "116930672", "9743839", "6027413", "14283441", "16902615", "1132351", "13942014", "15193013", "46598491", "88518305", "961425", "5745749", "17584818"], "inbound_citations": ["52014248", "25071405", "9582633", "9484691", "199009183"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35120208"}

The modern face hallucination models demonstrate reasonable performance to reconstruct high-resolution images from its corresponding low resolution images. However, they do not consider identity level information during hallucination which directly affects results of the recognition of low resolution faces. To address this issue, we propose a Face Hallucination Generative Adversarial Network (FH-GAN) which improves the quality of low resolution face images and accurately recognize those low quality images. Concretely, we make the following contributions: (1) we propose FH-GAN network, an end-to-end system, that improves both face hallucination and face recognition simultaneously. The novelty of this proposed network depends on incorporating identity information in a GAN-based face hallucination algorithm via combining a face recognition network for identity preserving. (2) We also propose a new face hallucination network, namely Dense Sparse Network (DSNet), which improves upon the state-of-art in face hallucination.

Most works report classification into the major kingdoms only, not venturing further into their sub-classes. A novel combined technique of Chaos Game Representation (CGR) and machine learning is proposed, the former for feature extraction and the latter for subsequent sequence classification. Eight sub categories of eukaryotic mitochondrial genomes from NCBI are used for the study. The sequences are initially mapped into their Chaos Game Representation format. Genomic feature extraction is implemented by computing the Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) matrix. An order 3 FCGR matrix is considered here, which consists of 64 elements. The 64 element matrix acts as the feature descriptor for classification. The classification methods used are Difference Boosting Naive Bayesian (DBNB) based method, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based methods. Accuracies of individual methods are reported. Although the average accuracy is seen highest for the SVM-CGR combination, better accuracies are seen for some categories in other methods too. Hence a voting classifier is implemented combining all the three methods.

Among the various remote sensing technologies, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) offers the most accurate and consistent means for obtaining reliable canopy structure measurements. A potential solution to reduce the cost of LiDAR data, is to integrate transects (samples) of LiDAR data with frequently acquired and spatially comprehensive optical remotely sensed data. Although multiple regression is commonly used for such modeling, often it does not fully capture the complex relationships between forest structure variables. This study investigates the potential of Random Forest (RF), a machine learning technique, to estimate LiDAR measured canopy structure using a time series of Landsat imagery. The study is implemented over a 2600 ha area of industrially managed coastal temperate forests on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. We implemented a trajectory-based approach to time series analysis that generates time since disturbance (TSD) and disturbance intensity information for each pixel and we used this information to stratify the forest land base into two strata: mature forests and young forests. Canopy cover and height for three forest classes (i.e. mature, young and mature and young (combined)) were modeled separately using multiple regression and Random Forest (RF) techniques. For all forest classes, the RF models provided improved estimates relative to the multiple regression models. The lowest validation error was obtained for the mature forest strata in a RF model ( R 2 = 0.88, RMSE = 2.39 m and bias = \u22120.16 for canopy height; R 2 = 0.72, RMSE = 0.068% and bias = \u22120.0049 for canopy cover). This study demonstrates the value of using disturbance and successional history to inform estimates of canopy structure and obtain improved estimates of forest canopy cover and height using the RF algorithm.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2014.11.007", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "1964789567", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211208241", "51784246", "54944526", "73463634", "58641917", "210998708", "19132008", "25988881", "201635900", "134293982", "15102426", "207818264", "733679", "18258158", "42120812", "6715963", "26725165", "19765611", "20234674", "198407155", "204971474", "44080836", "85525631", "133806162", "42463173", "6387294", "73551845", "210703110", "213342106", "210130671"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:119728493"}

The experiment was divided into three treatments: optimum moisture, light drought, and moderate drought stress. Maize images were obtained every two hours throughout the whole day by digital cameras. In order to compare the accuracy of DCNN, a comparative experiment was conducted using traditional machine learning on the same dataset. The experimental results demonstrated an impressive performance of the proposed method. For the total dataset, the accuracy of the identification and classification of drought stress was 98.14% and 95.95%, respectively. High accuracy was also achieved on the sub-datasets of the seedling and jointing stages. The identification and classification accuracy levels of the color images were higher than those of the gray images. Furthermore, the comparison experiments on the same dataset demonstrated that DCNN achieved a better performance than the traditional machine learning method (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree GBDT).

However, these methods depend on either domain features or string kernels. To date, methods combining information from different sources have not been found yet. Here, we proposed an improved poly(A) motifs recognition method by combing different sources based on decision level fusion. First of all, two novel prediction methods was proposed based on support vector machine (SVM): one method is achieved by using the domain-specific features and principle component analysis (PCA) method to eliminate the redundancy (PCA-SVM); the other method is based on Oligo string kernel (Oligo-SVM). Then we proposed a novel machine-learning method for poly(A) motif prediction by marrying four poly(A) motifs recognition methods, including two state-of-the-art methods (Random Forest (RF) and HMM-SVM), and two novel proposed methods (PCA-SVM and Oligo-SVM). A decision level information fusion method was employed to combine the decision values of different classifiers by applying the DS evidence theory. We evaluated our method on a comprehensive poly(A) dataset that consists of 14,740 samples on 12 variants of poly(A) motifs and 2750 samples containing none of these motifs. Our method has achieved accuracy up to 86.13%. Compared with the four classifiers, our evidence theory based method reduces the average error rate by about 30%, 27%, 26% and 16%, respectively.

Its most representative land cover on peat is a Mauritia flexuosa dominated palm swamp (thereafter called dense PS), which has been under human pressure over decades due to the high demand for the M. flexuosa fruit often collected by cutting down the entire palm. Degradation of these carbon dense forests can substantially affect emissions of greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. The first objective of this research was to assess the impact of dense PS degradation on forest structure and biomass carbon stocks. The second one was to explore the potential of mapping the distribution of dense PS with different degradation levels using remote sensing data and methods. Biomass stocks were measured in 0.25 ha plots established in areas of dense PS with low (n = 2 plots), medium (n = 2) and high degradation (n = 4). We combined field and remote sensing data from the satellites Landsat TM and ALOS/PALSAR to discriminate between areas typifying dense PS with low, medium and high degradation and terra firme , restinga and mixed PS (not M. flexuosa dominated) forests. For this we used a Random Forest machine learning classification algorithm. Results suggest a shift in forest composition from palm to woody tree dominated forest following degradation. We also found that human intervention in dense PS translates into significant reductions in tree carbon stocks with initial (above and below-ground) biomass stocks (135.4 \u00b1 4.8 Mg C ha \u22121 ) decreased by 11 and 17% following medium and high degradation. The remote sensing analysis indicates a high separability between dense PS with low degradation from all other categories. Dense PS with medium and high degradation were highly separable from most categories except for restinga forests and mixed PS. Results also showed that data from both active and passive remote sensing sensors are important for the mapping of dense PS degradation. Overall land cover classification accuracy was high (91%). Results from this pilot analysis are encouraging to further explore the use of remote sensing data and methods for monitoring dense PS degradation at broader scales in the Peruvian Amazon.

The predictive capabilities of the models were compared to identify default-prediction mechanisms in the \u201cMy Home, My Life\u201d Program (Programa \u201cMinha Casa, Minha Vida\u201d \u2014 PMCMV). The PMCMV is one of the largest government initiatives in the world to finance home ownership in the low-income population. Implemented by the Brazilian government, the programme has provided financing in excess of USD 84 billion and by 2016 had already contracted for the construction of over 4.5 million housing units, with 3.3 million units already delivered. The models developed in this study involve different time intervals for default prediction as well as analysis without the use of traditional discriminatory variables (gender, age, and marital status). Three measurements were used to evaluate the quality of the prediction models: area under the ROC curve, the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov index, and the Brier score. The results indicated that (1) the accuracy of the models improves as the number of days overdue used to define the default variable increases; (2) the best prediction results were obtained with traditional ensemble techniques \u2014 in this case Bagging (BG), Random Forest (RF), and Boosting; and (3) there was a negative impact on all criteria when a smaller number of observations was used, especially on the type II error. It was also found that the discriminatory power of the credit risk rating system is preserved when removing discriminatory variables from the models. Applying the BG algorithm, which is the best prediction method, a default rate of 11.80% could be reduced to 2.95%, which leads to a selection that would result in 197,905 fewer delinquent contracts in the PMCMV, thus representing a savings of approximately USD 3.0 billion in credit losses.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2019.105640", "venue": "Appl.

In previous work, NER was limited to a small number of pre-defined entity classes (e.g., people, locations, and organizations). However, NER on the Web is a far more challenging problem. Complex names (e.g., film or book titles) can be very difficult to pick out precisely from text. Further, the Web contains a wide variety of entity classes, which are not known in advance. Thus, hand-tagging examples of each entity class is impractical. ::: ::: This paper investigates a novel approach to the first step in Web NER: locating complex named entities in Web text. Our key observation is that named entities can be viewed as a species of multiword units, which can be detected by accumulating n-gram statistics over the Web corpus. We show that this statistical method's F1 score is 50% higher than that of supervised techniques including Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Conditional Markov Models (CMMs) when applied to complex names.

Success of public urban areas in attraction of residents depends on thermal comfort of the visitors. Thermal comfort of urban open spaces is variable, because it depends on climatic parameters and other influences, which are changeable throughout the year, as well as during the day. Therefore, the prediction of thermal comfort is significant in order to enable planning the time of usage of urban open spaces. This paper presents Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict thermal comfort of visitors at an open urban area. Results from SVM-FFA were compared with two other soft computing method namely artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic programming (GP). The purpose of this research is also to predict carbon dioxide (CO2) emission based on the urban and rural population growth. Estimating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at an urban scale is the first step for adaptation and mitigation of climate change by local governments. The environment that governs the relationships between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and gross domestic product (GDP) changes over time due to variations in economic growth, regulatory policy and technology. The relationship between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions is considered as one of the most important empirical relationships. GDP is also predicted based on CO2 emissions.

Problem-solvers given a specific goal learn more poorly than problem-solvers given a nonspecific goal (Sweller & Levine, 1982). Burns and Vollmeyer (2002) investigated this effect of goal specificity based on the dual space search the- ory. Using a task in which participants were asked to learn the relations between inputs to and outputs from a system, they observed the effect of goal specificity. The NSG (non- specific goal condition) participants, who were not informed of the target values of the outputs, learned the system struc- ture better than the SG (specific goal condition) participants, who were informed of the target values. Burns and Vollmeyer (2002) also found that the NSG participants conducted more hypothesis testing than the SG participants. From these re- sults, they concluded that a nonspecific goal encouraged the participants to search actively in a hypothesis space. There- fore, a nonspecific goal might lead to better learning than a specific goal. We examined the effect of goal specificity on a search in two problem spaces: a hypothesis space and an instance space. Two hypotheses were considered: 1) a nonspecific goal facili- tates a search in a hypothesis space more than a specific goal, and 2) as a hypothesis space is searched more, the performance in discovering the target rule improves. We also defined an initial hypothesis space consisting of initially considered hy- potheses, and investigated the effect of this initial hypothesis space on the goal specificity effect. The results of three ex- periments indicated that when an initial hypothesis space was offered, the goal specificity effect was observed. A nonspe- cific goal actually facilitated a search in the hypothesis space. When, however, no initial hypothesis space was offered, the goal specificity effect was not confirmed. We also found that the facilitation of the hypothesis space search improved perfor- mance in discovering the target rule. Keywords: discovery, rule induction, goal, hypothesis testing Introduction Dual Space Search Theory Rule induction and scientific discovery have been studied based on the dual space search theory. Simon and Lea (1974) first suggested that a problem space consists of two spaces: a \u201crule space\u201d for searching rules and an \u201cinstance space\u201d for testing rules. Both rule and instance spaces are searched to find a correct rule. Klahr and Dunbar (1988) extended the dual space search theory to the Scientific Discovery as Dual Search (SDDS) model for investigating scientific discovery. They consid- ered a \u201chypothesis space\u201d as a rule space and an \u201cexperiment space\u201d as an instance space where the process of scientific discovery develops through the interaction between two types of searches in the two spaces. Reasoners state hypotheses by searching in a hypothesis space, receive feedback from an ex- periment space, and modify the current hypotheses or pro- pose new hypotheses. Klahr and his colleague confirmed this model through a long series of experiments (Klahr & Dun- bar, 1988; Klahr, 2000). They also identified \u201cexperimenters\u201d who preferred to search in an experiment space and \u201ctheo- rists\u201d who preferred to search in a hypothesis space. In this study we call the two spaces a \u201chypothesis space\u201d and an \u201cin- stance space.\u201d The search in a hypothesis space is crucial for scientific dis- covery. Klahr and Dunbar (1988) demonstrated that a search in only a hypothesis space led to the discovery of a correct rule without the execution of any experiments. Present Study A hypothesis space is usually huge, hence a hypothesis space search is performed based on constraints offered by atten- tional perspectives (van Joolingen & de Jong, 1997). In the present study we define the hypothesis space in which the par- ticipants initially search as an \u201cinitial hypothesis space\u201d and the space containing a target rule to be discovered as a \u201ctarget space.\u201d In the earlier studies, the initial hypothesis space was typ- ically decided by an experimenter because the participants were informed of all the relative factors of focus. This ini- tial hypothesis space also contained the target rule to be dis- covered. There was no need for the participants to find the target hypothesis space, as the initial hypothesis space and target hypothesis space were identical (Figure 1(a)). Here, in contrast, we investigate situations in which the participants must find a target hypothesis space by themselves in order to discover an appropriate rule. (1) Initial-space situation One situation we deal with is the \u201cinitial-space situation\u201d (Figure 1(b)). Participants are given an initial hypothesis space by an experimenter. This initial space, however, con- tains no rule to be discovered. The initial hypothesis space differs from the target hypothesis space. To discover the target rule, the participants need to shift a searching space from the initial hypothesis space to the target hypothesis space. This situation typically emerges in insight problem solving (Kaplan & Simon, 1990). Goal Specificity Effect in Dual Space Search On the other hand, we often neglect to consider the theories or rules behind phenomena when we aim for a specific goal. We tend not to search in a hypothesis space at times like this,", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2624450049", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["7137007", "54334455", "61135144", "6834267"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5800693"}

In this study, we show that non-invasive electrical measurements and the use of classifier software can be combined with cellular phone technology to produce inexpensive tissue characterization. This concept was demonstrated by the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish through the cellular phone between heart and kidney tissue via the non-invasive multi-frequency electrical measurements acquired around the tissues. After the measurements were performed at a remote site, the raw data were transmitted through the cellular phone to a central computational site and the classifier was applied to the raw data. The results of the tissue analysis were returned to the remote data measurement site. The classifiers correctly determined the tissue type with a specificity of over 90%. When used for the detection of malignant tumors, classifiers can be designed to produce false positives in order to ensure that no tumors will be missed.

These algorithms employ a two--stage process where the first stage produces an approximate solution to a dual QP problem and the second stage maps this approximate dual solution to an approximate primal solution. For the second stage we describe an O(n log n) algorithm that maps an approximate dual solution with accuracy (2(2Km)1/2+8(\u03bb)1/2)-2 \u03bb ep2 to an approximate primal solution with accuracy ep where n is the number of data samples, Kn is the maximum kernel value over the data and \u03bb > 0 is the SVM regularization parameter. For the first stage we present new results for decomposition algorithms and describe new decomposition algorithms with guaranteed accuracy and run time. In particular, for \u03c4-rate certifying decomposition algorithms we establish the optimality of \u03c4 = 1/(n-1). In addition we extend the recent \u03c4 = 1/(n-1) algorithm of Simon (2004) to form two new composite algorithms that also achieve the \u03c4 = 1/(n-1) iteration bound of List and Simon (2005), but yield faster run times in practice. We also exploit the \u03c4-rate certifying property of these algorithms to produce new stopping rules that are computationally efficient and that guarantee a specified accuracy for the approximate dual solution. Furthermore, for the dual QP problem corresponding to the standard classification problem we describe operational conditions for which the Simon and composite algorithms possess an upper bound of O(n) on the number of iterations. For this same problem we also describe general conditions for which a matching lower bound exists for any decomposition algorithm that uses working sets of size 2. For the Simon and composite algorithms we also establish an O(n2) bound on the overall run time for the first stage. Combining the first and second stages gives an overall run time of O(n2(ck + 1)) where ck is an upper bound on the computation to perform a kernel evaluation.

The great majority of these insights go undiscovered because it is so difficult and time-consuming to analyze data. A key source of this difficulty is that questions and analyses that take human scientists only a few seconds to formulate in human language can take days using existing computer interfaces and data analysis software. For example, consider the task of determining which are the five molecules that most highly correlate with the expression of genes regulating neurotransmitters involved in creating or erasing longterm memories. This is a task that now can take a highly trained researcher days to accomplish. This is true even though all the data required is publicly available and the computational power to analyze it is very inexpensive. Such data analyses are so expensive because of the computer interfaces people must use to perform them. Today, one cannot simply ask a computer in ordinary human language \u201cWhich are the five molecules that most highly correlate with the expression of genes regulating neurotransmitters involved in creating or erasing long-term memories\u201d and get the answer. Instead, because of the limitations of computer natural language processing abilities, people must use cumbersome software and often write specially tailored programs to perform such analyses. If, however, these limitations of natural language processing were overcome, scientists would become dramatically more productive. They would be able to generate and explore hypotheses that in the past were too time-consuming. They could ask and answer, literally, orders of magnitudes more questions than they could in the past. A key challenge to elevating the natural language processing abilities of computers to the level where they will be useful in data analysis is the gulf between the nature of human and computer languages. Human language is generally ambiguous, incomplete, and often non-literal while computer languages are specifically and purposely designed to be unambiguous, complete, and literal.

Inspired ::: by visuoperceptual principles such as compositionality and connectionism, i.e. complex structures can be expressed by the relation and interplay of simpler ones, the presented work proposes a hierarchical and data-driven abstraction process to reveal visual patterns and persistent structures: from generating building blocks of our surroundings over detecting potential object candidates to reasoning about the semantics of object shapes. In the course of our work, we aim on generic approaches such as detection of unknown objects in unstructured environments or the classification of object shape types instead of the recognition of individual object instances. Our eventual goal is a data-driven unsupervised conceptualization of shape commonalities regarding object appearance. Therein we aim to reduce supervision in form of handcrafted labeled data and to learn machine-centric prediction models that are solely based on the given data without incorporating knowledge that is not inferable from given data or is biased by supervision. ::: Further on, we specifically aim on the applicability in real-world scenarios coping with challenging conditions as in form of noisy sensor data to partial observations and occlusions.

Several tests are required to diagnose it for evaluating different physiological characteristics. One of the most applied tests for this is the manual classification of tear film images captured with Doane interferometer. Interferometry images can be categorized into five groups: debris, fine fringes, coalescing fine fringes, strong fringes, and coalescing strong fringes. Instability in the tear film creates the need for an automatic system to provide experts with diagnostic support. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to propose a method for automatic classification of the tear film lipid layer using phylogenetic diversity indexes for feature extraction and several classifiers. Methods The proposed method consisted of five main steps: (1) acquisition of VOPTICAL_GCU image dataset, (2) segmentation of the region of interest, (3) feature extraction using phylogenetic diversity indexes, (4) classification using the algorithms Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Tree, and RBFNetwork, and, (5) validation of results. Results The best result was obtained using Random Forest classifier, reaching an accuracy of over 97%, standard deviation of 0.51%, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99, a Kappa index of 0.96, and an F-Measure of 0.97.

The model uses the acoustic properties of the audio files as their features for classification. The three models are trained as Error-Correcting Output Code Classifiers and they individually classify the audio files with certain posterior probabilities. The results from the three classifiers are fused using the sum rule to evaluate the final outcome of the combined model.

However, DNNs consume a lot of processing power, especially if realized on General Purpose GPUs or CPUs, which make them unsuitable for low-power applications. ::: ::: On the other hand, neuromorphic computing systems are heavily investigated as a potential substitute for traditional von Neumann systems in high-speed low-power applications. One way to implement neuromorphic systems is to use memristor crossbar arrays because of their small size, low power consumption, synaptic like behavior, and scalability. However, these systems are in their early developing stages and still have many challenges to be solved before commercialization. ::: ::: In this dissertation, we will investigate designing of neuromorphic computing systems, targeting classification and generation applications. Specifically, we introduce three novel neuromorphic computing systems. The first system implements a multi-layer feed-forward neural network, where memristor crossbar arrays are utilized in realizing a novel hybrid spiking-based multi-layered self-learning system. This system is capable of on-chip training, whereas for most previously published systems training is done off-chip. The system performance is evaluated using three different datasets showing improved average failure error by 42% than previously published systems and great immunity against process variations. ::: ::: The second system implements an Echo State Network (ESN), as a special type of recurrent neural networks, by utilizing a novel memristor double crossbar architecture. The system has been trained for sample generation, using the Mackey-Glass dataset, and simulations show accurate sample generation within a 75% window size of the training dataset. Finally, we introduce a novel neuromorphic computing for real-time cardiac arrhythmia classification. Raw ECG data is directly fed to the system, without any feature extraction, and hence reducing classification time and power consumption. The proposed system achieves an overall accuracy of 96.17% and requires only 34 ms to test one ECG beat, which outperforms most of its counterparts. ::: ::: For future work, we introduce a preliminary neuromorphic system implementing a deep Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), based on ESNs.

The proposed PAD algorithm is based on both Binarized Statistical Image Features (BSIF) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) that can capture a prominent micro-texture features. The linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then trained independently on these two features that are applied on both local and global region to obtain the comparison scores.
