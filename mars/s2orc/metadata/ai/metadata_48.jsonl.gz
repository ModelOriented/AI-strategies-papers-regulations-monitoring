First, if other agents are simultaneously learning then the environment is no longer stationary, thus undermining convergence guarantees. Second, learning is often susceptible to deception, where the other agents may be able to exploit a learner's particular dynamics. In the worst case, this could result in poorer performance than if the agent was not learning at all. These challenges are identifiable in the two most common evaluation criteria for multiagent learning algorithms: convergence and regret. Algorithms focusing on convergence or regret in isolation are numerous. In this paper, we seek to address both criteria in a single algorithm by introducing GIGA-WoLF, a learning algorithm for normal-form games. We prove the algorithm guarantees at most zero average regret, while demonstrating the algorithm converges in many situations of self-play. We prove convergence in a limited setting and give empirical results in a wider variety of situations. These results also suggest a third new learning criterion combining convergence and regret, which we call negative non-convergence regret (NNR).", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.7939/R3ZS2KF41", "venue": "NIPS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2138362680", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6277700", "8108362", "7671810", "5228823", "871178", "11866341", "291197", "2713175", "8963242", "553962", "118602977"], "inbound_citations": ["9148696", "52981002", "8532635", "167748102", "49146", "49146", "17546995", "12833378", "3810945", "205768549", "13171013", "12661184", "207223784", "7525738", "3503217", "7858358", "56020414", "15465273", "2854148", "2340253", "11891044", "7865833", "19006883", "12469927", "843234", "53346484", "12406848", "4715758", "7411925", "54588311", "13515575", "18713007", "7764536", "59316728", "2661363", "31989312", "18325938", "6254095", "18862561", "1840820", "8431579", "918565", "6803221", "71148066", "4508443", "211244760", "1127658", "53046335", "206794869", "173990609", "787470", "13984666", "7107132", "208131957", "16204231", "6277700", "21842069", "10221976", "14131105", "14131105", "1236677", "10608623", "202779955", "17263536", "10194283", "16899552", "2326290", "49185093", "12166801", "201666696", "14115029", "55896728", "1685963", "1664425", "152282351", "16114420", "11440994", "17136625", "34173801", "8798570", "69603903", "16566745", "5972732", "9626254", "11477279", "15621749", "17813510", "5959967", "2129928", "1526521", "9291621", "14121086", "321069", "321069", "22009597", "195974081", "19099582", "14836942", "6466442", "5048981", "13990323", "964156", "16986353", "210932434", "8447468", "5943662", "18143263", "14246580", "53292640", "61822689", "3321420", "2763152", "1445679", "9152915", "15454837", "960890", "204866900", "14757211", "18491377", "15293968", "961334", "15145618", "325189", "197544984", "197545249", "10762534", "8862416", "35436723", "18452095", "214611664", "53838315", "8941867", "18374939", "3023273", "14258494", "4212742"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6277700"}

Different from the existing CNN based methods that only use the features output from the final layer for recognition, in this paper, the feature maps of intermediate convolutional layers are all applied for recognition based on the fact that these convolutional features can provide hierarchical representations of the images. Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) strategy is adopted to divide the feature map, and each SPM sub-region is encoded to generate a feature representation vector. These feature representation vectors of convolutional layers and the output feature vector of the global pooling layer are normalized and cascaded as a whole feature vector, which is finally utilized to train Support Vector Machine classifier to obtain the recognition model.

However, many constraints still need to be addressed, such as time-series incompleteness in cloudy environments, high intra- and inter-fields spatial variability, and large volume of data. In this paper, we propose 1. to test a combined Random Forest (RF) classifier applied to multisource satellite data with an object-based approach, in order to produce land use maps at different levels (from cropland to crop type) ; 2. to optimize the performance of the RF classifier by reducing the number of input variables. The test site is a small agricultural zone in Madagascar. RF is applied by using two approaches: classical (by classifying the different levels from the whole learning database) and hierarchical (by classifying first the cropland and non-cropland and classifying crop types inside the cropland only). The importance (mean decrease accuracy measure) of the different variables is analyzed according to their source (high spatial resolution (HRS) time series simulating Sentinel-2 data, PLEIADES images, DEM), and category (reflectance, texture, spectral indices, auxiliary data). The contribution to the classification accuracy of each source andcategory of variables is also tested. Results showed that optimizing the RF classifier allowed dividing the number of variables to be extracted by 1.5 to 6, depending on the classification level. Using a hierarchical approach improved the classification results whatever the level of classification and allowed to obtain 64.4% overall accuracy for crop type classification. The HRS time series derived spectral variables revealed to be the more discriminant, with a slight advantage of spectral indices over reflectances. Next step is the application of the optimized approach to a Sentinel-2 time series acquired over a large area in the context of the Sen2-Agri demonstration phase.

Malware poses a major threat for computer security and information security in general. Over the years, malware has evolved to the point that a single malware specimen can have hundreds or maybe thousands of variants using polymorphic and metamorphic transformation to change the signature of the malware variant in propagation. The common signature-based malware detection methods are no longer robust to detect these variants due to the alteration of code. Static analysis is required to obtain these signatures and anti-virus companies are required to propagate these signature updates to their software. A faster detection method is needed to compensate the exponentially increasing number of malware variants. Machine learning is a trending approach for malware detection. This removes the need to use signature-based detection and is also faster. Software companies do not need to propagate signatures as often. Machine learning algorithms using opcode sequences can recognise patterns in the malicious code that are not present in common signatures and classify them more efficiently. Therefore, a machine learning approach for malware detection should be adopted for faster and more efficient detection. Most research in malware detection using machine learning used static attributes such as network connections, processes spawned, hashes, etc., that were not that robust to changes. In this paper we introduced our novel approach in using trigrams and PE file attributes as features for malware detection. We took a text mining approach to make our detection method more robust to polymorphism and metamorphism. The instruction sequence for critical code in malware on the assembly level is basically the same across malware families. We used opcode trigram sequences as the main feature for our machine learning algorithm. We used Support Vector Machine(SVM) as our classifying algorithm which is a discriminative classifier model that gives a definite decision whether the predicted outcome belongs to the learned class or not.

The purpose is to provide guidance on how to train a powerful learning machine for change detection in SAR images and to contribute to a better understanding of potentials and limitations of supervised change detection approaches. This becomes particularly important on the background of a rapidly growing demand for SAR change detection to support rapid situation awareness in case of natural disasters. The application environment of this study thus focuses on detecting changes caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami disaster, where single polarized TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR intensity images are used as input. An unprecedented reference dataset of more than 18,000 buildings that have been visually inspected by local authorities for damages after the disaster forms a solid statistical population for the performance experiments. Several critical choices commonly made during the training stage of a learning machine are being assessed for their influence on the change detection performance, including sampling approach, location and number of training samples, classification scheme, change feature space and the acquisition dates of the satellite images. Furthermore, the proposed machine learning approach is compared with the widely used change image thresholding. The study concludes that a well-trained and tuned SVM can provide highly accurate change detections that outperform change image thresholding. While good performance is achieved in the binary change detection case, a distinction between multiple change classes in terms of damage grades leads to poor performance in the tested experimental setting. The major drawback of a machine learning approach is related to the high costs of training. The outcomes of this study, however, indicate that given dynamic parameter tuning, feature selection and an appropriate sampling approach, already small training samples (100 samples per class) are sufficient to produce high change detection rates. Moreover, the experiments show a good generalization ability of SVM which allows transfer and reuse of trained learning machines.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs8100792", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2522177496", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["7738974", "10851163", "38018641", "13864618", "10225796", "62683366", "14283205", "6353122", "55638756", "4439936", "6886142", "6625545", "5714300", "7428842", "1340051", "129996510", "128423194", "38685706", "18451813", "28756578", "36211710", "20695215", "54970525", "7138354", "56563878", "7664224", "61649919", "64172358", "60266817", "18885017", "5662006", "12531442", "15425891"], "inbound_citations": ["133950260", "215722751", "125165633", "58013657", "59410593", "53230788", "4000004", "11507559", "135423156", "29723574", "52932330", "144207613", "25147809", "133780257", "204843023", "201116538"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6960681"}

In this paper, we propose model class reliance (MCR) as the range of VI values across all well-performing model in a prespecified class. Thus, MCR gives a more comprehensive description of importance by accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of different parametric forms, may fit the data well. In the process of deriving MCR, we show several informative results for permutation-based VI estimates, based on the VI measures used in Random Forests. Specifically, we derive connections between permutation importance estimates for a single prediction model, U-statistics, conditional variable importance, conditional causal effects, and linear model coefficients. We then give probabilistic bounds for MCR, using a novel, generalizable technique.

Recent Earth Observation missions feature a notable tradeoff between a fairly high spatial resolution and large area coverage. In particular, ESA\u2019s Sentinel-2 satellites provide superspectral imagery with a spatial resolution of 10 meters for the bands covering visible light and near infrared. Notably, Sentinel-2 data are provided free of charge to the public via a data hub, which is accessible online. In parallel, open-source geoinformation compiled by volunteers such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) can provide valuable information for characterization of urban environments. Numerous cities around the globe were already mapped in detail. Such data sets allow for instance the computation of built-up heights and built-up densities. However, spatially continuous and detailed OSM data are not available everywhere. To allow for truly large-area application, we combine OSM data and Sentinel-2 imagery and render the mapping of built-up heights and built-up densities as a supervised learning problem. Given the rational level of measurement of the two variables to be predicted, we generate a regression model based on Areas where data from both OSM and Sentinel-2 are available in order to estimate the target variables for areas where only Sentinel-2 data is available: The regression estimation problem is regarded as finding the mapping between an incoming vector (i.e., ubiquitously available image features from Sentinel-2) and an observable output from a given set of samples (i.e., automatically derived over spatially limited areas where data from both OSM and Sentinel-2 are available). From a methodological point of view, we introduce a novel regression approach to account for the No-free-Lunch-Theorem, which states that there is no algorithm that induces the most accurate learner in any domain, all the time. As such, we combine the model outputs of advanced machine learning-based Regression algorithms incorporating Support Vector Regression, Regression Trees, Gaussian Process Regression, and Neural Networks within a decision fusion framework.

This paper presents a novel two-step fall detection method which uses data extracted from smartphone sensors to detect falls. A fall can happen in many ways. A person can fall while he/she is walking, jogging, sitting, or even sleeping. Patterns of all falls are not the same. It is important to identify the type of falls to precisely distinguish it from non-falls (normal activities). Hence, our method first identifies the correct type of falls by performing multi-class classification. In the second step, this method produces a binary decision based on the multiclass prediction. We collected data from 10 users to evaluate our proposed fall detection method. Each user performed five normal activities\u2013namely, walking, jogging, standing, sitting, lying, and also fell after performing each activity. We performed experiments with five common smartphone sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, gravity, and linear acceleration.

In addition, we construct target-specific saliency map by backprojecting CNN features with guidance of the SVM, and obtain the final tracking result in each frame based on the appearance model generatively constructed with the saliency map.

One option to minimize this risk is the application of forest management measures aimed at generating species mixtures predicted to be more resilient to these threats. In order to apply such measures appropriately, forest managers need up-to-date, accurate and consistent forest maps at relatively fine spatial resolutions. Cost efficiency is a major factor when creating such maps. Taking European spruce ( Picea abies ) and Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) as an example, this paper describes an innovative approach for mapping two tree species using a combination of commercial very high resolution WorldView-2 (WV2) images and Landsat time series data. As a first step, this study used a supervised object-based classification of WV2 images covering relatively small test sites distributed across the region of interest. Using these classification maps as training data, wall-to-wall mapping of fractional coverages of spruce and pine was achieved using multi-temporal Landsat data and Random Forests (RF) regression. The method was applied for the entire state of Bavaria (Germany), which comprises a total forested area of approximately 26,000 km 2 . As applied here, this two-step approach yields consistent and accurate maps of fractional tree cover estimates with a spatial resolution of 1 ha. Independent validation of the fractional cover estimates using 3780 reference samples collected through visual interpretation of orthophotos produced root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 11% (for spruce ) and 14% (for pine ) with almost no bias, and R 2 values of 0.74 and 0.79 for spruce and pine , respectively. The majority of the validation samples (75% ( spruce ) and 84% ( pine )) were modeled within the assumed uncertainty of \u00b1 15% of the reference sample. Accuracies were significantly better compared to those achieved using a single-step classification of Landsat time series data at the pixel level (30 m), because the two-step approach better captures regional variation in the spectral signatures of target classes. Moreover, the increased number of available reference cells mitigates the impact of occasional errors in the reference data set. This two-step approach has great potential for cost-effective operational mapping of dominant forest types over large areas.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2017.09.031", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2756843371", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["54885019", "89141", "17097270", "16791809", "656774", "18464421", "132396890", "89862111", "17398081", "84179581", "26051679", "134468311", "61649919", "17928997", "23541992", "44908942", "13826115", "86313599", "21605657", "129244215", "52085056", "5323545", "5512875", "53696922", "3093707", "2839014", "126033661", "129343507", "11687149", "24489818", "131528125", "119472178", "130322838", "33291311", "133358670", "16560581", "3901858", "18512474", "89126956", "15114733", "1749153", "5447645", "129709658", "17054335", "140663136", "17544334", "129895666", "140613899"], "inbound_citations": ["208302706", "198231506", "7383064", "174800925", "197672639", "198264942", "52278356", "210913310", "202923803", "54172654"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55152006"}

The restriction between steel tubular and core concrete in CFSTs is complex and the relationship between geometric and material properties and axial compression behavior is highly nonlinear. These challenges have prompted the use of soft computing methods to predict the ultimate bearing capacity (abbreviated as Nu) under axial compression. Taking the square CFST short column as an example, a mass of experimental data is obtained through axial compression tests. Combined with support vector machine (SVM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), this paper presents a new method termed PSVM (SVM optimized by PSO) for Nu value prediction. The nonlinear relationship in Nu value prediction is efficiently represented by SVM, and PSO is used to select the model parameters of SVM. The experimental dataset is utilized to verify the reliability of the PSVM model, and the prediction performance of PSVM is compared with that of traditional design methods and other benchmark models.

Then, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle was used to take photos in the way of concentric circles with different radius. We preprocessed the image sequences by Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, and pixel information only containing targeted plants were achieved. We evaluated the accuracy of calculated individual height, blade length and maximum width with the measured data. Image sensitivity analysis was also done at 25 and 79 days after emergence by reducing the image numbers. Canopy coverage and plant height were compared between different scenarios. The results showed that there was a good agreement between measured and calculated plant height, blade length and blade maximum width with R2>0.90. Then the dynamic changes of plant height, crown surface and organ growth were extracted based on reconstructed 3D architecture.

The goal is to link individual database entries with sentences that verbalize the same information. By providing explicit semantics-to-text links, these alignments can aid the training of natural language generation and information extraction systems. Beyond these pragmatic benefits, the alignment problem is appealing from a modeling perspective: the mappings between database entries and text sentences exhibit rich structural dependencies, unique to this task. Thus, the key challenge is to make use of as many global dependencies as possible without sacrificing tractability. To this end, we cast text-database alignment as a structured multilabel classification task where each sentence is labeled with a subset of matching database entries. In contrast to existing multilabel classifiers, our approach operates over arbitrary global features of inputs and proposed labels.

In this study, we attempt to predict RNA-binding proteins directly from amino acid sequences. A novel approach, PRBP predicts RNA-binding proteins using the information of predicted RNA-binding residues in conjunction with a random forest based method. For a given protein, we first predict its RNA-binding residues and then judge whether the protein binds RNA or not based on information from that prediction. If the protein cannot be identified by the information associated with its predicted RNA-binding residues, then a novel random forest predictor is used to determine if the query protein is a RNA-binding protein. We incorporated features of evolutionary information combined with physicochemical features (EIPP) and amino acid composition feature to establish the random forest predictor. Feature analysis showed that EIPP contributed the most to the prediction of RNA-binding proteins. The results also showed that the information from the RNA-binding residue prediction improved the overall performance of our RNA-binding protein prediction.

The current study presents a new data-driven model to predict the two-phase oil/water relative permeability over a wide range of temperature in unconsolidated sand and sandstone formations. We found that the carbonate rock systems have different characteristics and the reported high temperature relative permeability data for them is limited, which prevented us from including them alongside the sand systems. For developing the model, the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) in the form of a supervised learning approach was implemented, in which the coupled simulated annealing optimization technique was employed for calculation of LSSVM hyper-parameters. To gather a comprehensive dataset for constructing the model, 626 experimental oil relative permeability and 547 experimental water relative permeability data points were obtained from the open literature. To identify the doubtful data points (the outliers) the method of Leverage Value Statistics was applied. The temperature (ranging from 21 to 200 \u00b0C), water saturation, oil viscosity (ranging from 0.42 to 1190 cP), water viscosity (ranging from 0.136 to 1.1 cP), and the absolute permeability (ranging from 152 to 95,000 mD) were used as the independent variables in the model. The statistical analysis of the obtained LSSVM for prediction of relative permeability demonstrated that the coefficient of determination, root mean square error, and average absolute error were 0.9987, 0.0111, and 5.36% for oil relative permeability and 0.9991, 0.0056, and 8.40% for water relative permeability.

Therefore, in this paper, a progressive growing neural gas network algorithm (PGNGN) is proposed, which is a systematic and general approach to obtain the topology of the workspace based on IKP equations. After establishing a preliminary network with few initial data points, the network starts to develop itself by considering new data points around its border neurons through a boundary data generation procedure. The proposed algorithm is able to continue learning, adding units and connections, until a performance criterion has been met which leads to a clear workspace topology with minimal errors.

Doctoral Dissertation Proposal", "authors": [{"first": "Raymond", "middle": ["J."], "last": "Mooney", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Mikhail", "middle": [], "last": "Bilenko", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Many machine learning and data mining tasks depend on functions that estimate similarity between instances. Similarity computations are particularly important in clustering and information integration applications, where pairwise distances play a central role in many algorithms. Typically, algorithms for these tasks rely on pre-defined similarity measures, such as edit distance or cosine similarity for strings, or Euclidean distance for vector-space data. However, standard distance functions are frequently suboptimal as they do not capture the appropriate notion of similarity for a particular domain, dataset, or application. ::: In this thesis, we present several approaches for addressing this problem by employing learnable similarity functions. Given supervision in the form of similar or dis-similar pairs of instances, learnable similarity functions can be trained to provide accurate estimates for the domain and task at hand. We study the problem of adapting similarity functions in the context of several tasks: record linkage, clustering, and blocking. For each of these tasks, we present learnable similarity functions and training algorithms that lead to improved performance. ::: In record linkage, also known as duplicate detection and entity matching, the goal is to identify database records referring to the same underlying entity. This requires estimating similarity between corresponding field values of records, as well as overall similarity between records. For computing field-level similarity between strings, we describe two learnable variants of edit distance that lead to improvements in linkage accuracy. For learning record-level similarity functions, we employ Support Vector Machines to combine similarities of individual record fields in proportion to their relative importance, yielding a high-accuracy linkage system. We also investigate strategies for efficient collection of training data which can be scarce due to the pairwise nature of the record linkage task. ::: In clustering, similarity functions are essential as they determine the grouping of instances that is the goal of clustering. We describe a framework for integrating learnable similarity functions within a probabilistic model for semi-supervised clustering based on Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRFs). The framework accommodates learning various distance measures, including those based on Bregman divergences (e.g., parameterized Mahalanobis distance and parameterized KL-divergence), as well as directional measures (e.g., cosine similarity). Thus, it is applicable to a wide range of domains and data representations. Similarity functions are learned within the HMRF-KMEANS algorithm derived from the framework, leading to significant improvements in clustering accuracy. ::: The third application we consider, blocking, is critical in making record linkage and clustering algorithms scalable to large datasets, as it facilitates efficient selection of approximately similar instance pairs without explicitly considering all possible pairs. Previously proposed blocking methods require manually constructing a similarity function or a set of similarity predicates, followed by hand-tuning of parameters. We propose learning blocking functions automatically from linkage and semi-supervised clustering supervision, which allows automatic construction of blocking methods that are efficient and accurate. This approach yields computationally cheap learnable similarity functions that can be used for scaling up in a variety of tasks that rely on pairwise distance computations, including record linkage and clustering.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Proceedings of the Nineteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Sixteenth Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2139945125", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["3077937", "56128297", "2852345", "11244187", "2045411", "6482591", "6745692", "2900150", "6436838", "11425181", "18265687", "10180842", "14916760", "10625463", "6029205", "9242771", "18340548", "17288818", "2341726", "2286629", "7839315", "1637011", "60565534", "2852254", "14733212", "13900302", "17593228", "15366852", "2354883", "15335378", "16915407", "12744045", "122725444", "3628209", "5340931", "43845208", "277918", "1144461", "3531625", "7268328", "4428232", "60222498", "6994953", "669209", "775373", "11664683", "7311285", "207699574", "10070991", "7520966", "16071510", "10427338", "10957914", "17406543", "1471056", "1092004", "56563878", "13618539", "3231298", "8844862", "60700469", "14949756", "43685115", "15165174", "1713753", "7869993", "20031248", "122918146", "6420555", "16553919", "62018951", "5509836", "9173202", "36399389", "1835649", "28637672", "13491515", "54580585", "117751780", "3992544", "2643381"], "inbound_citations": ["15637129"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:408013"}

First of all, the researcher transferred an image from RGB color space to YCbCr and Normalized Color Coordinates (NCC) color space to reduce the influence affected by different light condition to skin sample. After color space translation, the researcher could obtain YCbCr skin and NCC skin, and then found out some skin regions from original image by fuzzy computation. Finally, these skin regions were inputted into Support Vector Machines to distinguish which are or are not human faces. The result of this research appears that the overall accuracy rate of this system is 94.73%. After face detection, which is to identify the position of the mouth according to the eye coordinates, the researcher can use curve fitting to calculate the degree of a smile. It is hoped that by applying the result of this research to many situations more intuitive interactions between users and the systems can be obtained. For example, robots with this kind of equipment can understand the emotional reactions of humans. This technique could also be used to assist doctors to estimate the emotions of their patients, or to help people understand the emotions of their counter parties during cell phone communications.

For this purpose, we utilize supervised learning techniques, which allow us to detect the modes without the use of a mechanical model of the system. We analyze the individual roles of specific features available through both the actuator and visual data, and identify the ones that have the most significance for detecting the operation modes.

Our experiments show that SVM rescoring of hidden Markov models typically reduces the error rate significantly compared to standard ML training.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSP.2007.906741", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1982827240", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2048632", "1435919", "7835262", "6477991", "5846219", "28637672", "194951", "14561315", "26399144", "7022117", "4193919", "37344085", "6330633", "7788300", "35864917", "277918", "201720", "9699301", "2336178", "9228120", "42906443", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["10050588", "18814700", "7880539", "206827796", "21474852", "15885154", "23523499", "8312504", "8686514", "40218", "7342588", "214736991", "57378267", "13309906", "30812046", "27696144", "14031900", "25748639", "241424", "17751716", "9447325", "18215799", "27824086", "1378647", "55153743", "207880105", "28627980", "14578870", "14369093", "16113988", "15960299", "20797325", "17056026", "29501960", "19844222", "21819957", "77999", "9234945", "211690752", "23138730", "12750502", "7506917", "26253161", "2109422", "11357415", "31952121", "31222324", "18061608", "12090928", "14032500", "9047031", "37321530", "204939595", "19995122", "14093270", "41327923", "14681245", "21599803", "26919696", "89241", "6053301", "23083583", "16309911", "11069508", "57378383", "789692", "6717205", "52256458", "25734140", "31742607", "14871839", "2950408"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2751026"}

In the study, the inverse ECG problem can be treated as a regression problem with multi-inputs (body surface potentials) and multi-outputs (transmembrane potentials), which can be solved by the support vector regression (SVR) method. In order to obtain an effective SVR model with optimal regression accuracy and generalization performance, the hyperparameters of SVR must be set carefully. Three different optimization methods, that is, genetic algorithm (GA), differential evolution (DE) algorithm, and particle swarm optimization (PSO), are proposed to determine optimal hyperparameters of the SVR model. In this paper, we attempt to investigate which one is the most effective way in reconstructing the cardiac TMPs from BSPs, and a full comparison of their performances is also provided. The experimental results show that these three optimization methods are well performed in finding the proper parameters of SVR and can yield good generalization performance in solving the inverse ECG problem. Moreover, compared with DE and GA, PSO algorithm is more efficient in parameters optimization and performs better in solving the inverse ECG problem, leading to a more accurate reconstruction of the TMPs.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3741919", "pubmed_id": "23983808", "doi": "10.1155/2013/158056", "venue": "Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine", "journal": "Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2136927491", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13487995", "6799998", "23541600", "22474078", "23911136", "24938110", "83868499", "61134593", "28753040", "21916888", "9988056", "25167148", "93625462", "108769731", "153568267", "9746602", "15480929", "961425", "109588511", "5297867", "120110653", "9758870", "195357775", "5579574"], "inbound_citations": ["196180869", "62810814", "11418154", "64567004", "49330689", "15692073"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13902239"}

Detection of such impact events in terms of location and severity will be a significant milestone for aerospace structural health monitoring applications. This can result in well-targeted inspection programs thereby reducing the time and cost of periodic inspections. One of the easy and efficient ways of getting the impact response of a structure is through strain measurement. LVI event monitoring using fiber Bragg grating sensors has evolved as an attractive choice in recent years along with various soft computing algorithms and advanced signal processing techniques. Machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks and support vector machine are widely used to localize impact events. Getting information regarding the ensuing damage due to LVI event from the strain response is not straight forward as it could involve estimation of intermediate parameters like energy/force of impact, which are further related with probable damage size.

However, these techniques are data-driven, delegating the accuracy to the training dataset which must resemble the images in the target task. The acquisition of a dataset involves annotating images, an arduous and expensive process, generally requiring time and manual effort. Thus, a challenging scenario arises when the target domain of application has no annotated dataset available, making tasks in such situation to lean on a training dataset of a different domain. Sharing this issue, object detection is a vital task for autonomous vehicles where the large amount of driving scenarios yields several domains of application requiring annotated data for the training process. In this work, a method for training a car detection system with annotated data from a source domain (day images) without requiring the image annotations of the target domain (night images) is presented. For that, a model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is explored to enable the generation of an artificial dataset with its respective annotations. The artificial dataset (fake dataset) is created translating images from day-time domain to night-time domain. The fake dataset, which comprises annotated images of only the target domain (night images), is then used to train the car detector model. Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved significant and consistent improvements, including the increasing by more than 10% of the detection performance when compared to the training with only the available annotated data (i.e., day images).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1907.08719", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852008", "venue": "2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "journal": "2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2977464309,2963509788", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["699703", "19843081", "23613653", "52986165", "52987883", "71149224", "1900911", "3621240", "15644803", "2717049", "1033682", "11758569", "14542261", "6200260", "206770979", "740063", "10627900", "206595056", "7646250", "196129418", "10328909", "52902523", "6755881", "206594738", "206771220", "206770307", "1241368", "44138353", "3345317", "37428828", "1687220", "3719281", "206594692", "206597351", "12330432"], "inbound_citations": ["211132805", "211020797"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198147601"}

Wheezing detection identifies wheezing lung sounds and helps physicians in diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of pulmonary diseases. Different from the traditional way to detect wheezing sounds using digital image process methods, automatic wheezing detection uses computerized tools or algorithms to objectively and accurately assess and evaluate lung sounds. We propose an innovative machine learning-based approach for wheezing detection. The phases of the respiratory sounds are separated automatically and the wheezing features are extracted accordingly to improve the classification accuracy. Methods To enhance the features of wheezing for classification, the Adaptive Multi-Level In-Exhale Segmentation (AMIE_SEG) is proposed to automatically and precisely segment the respiratory sounds into inspiratory and expiratory phases. Furthermore, the Enhanced Generalized S-Transform (EGST) is proposed to extract the wheezing features. The highlighted features of wheezing improve the accuracy of wheezing detection with machine learning-based classifiers. Results To evaluate the novelty and superiority of the proposed AMIE_SEG and EGST for wheezing detection, we employ three machine learning-based classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), with public datasets at segment level and record level respectively. According to the experimental results, the proposed method performs the best using the KNN classifier at segment level, with the measured accuracy, sensitivity, specificity as 98.62%, 95.9% and 99.3% in average respectively. On the other aspect, at record level, the three classifiers perform excellent, with the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity up to 99.52%, 100% and 99.27% respectively. We validate the method with public respiratory sounds dataset.

Recorded speech signal through the microphone is blocked to the frame of 1024 speech samples. Energy is divided speech signal to voiced signal and unvoiced signal. The extracted 12 orders LPC cpestrum coefficients are used with input data for neural network. The speakers are identified with the speaker identification system using the neural network. The neural network has the structure of MLP which consists of 12 input nodes, 8 hidden nodes, and 4 output nodes. The number of output node means the identified speakers. The first output node is excited to the first speaker. Incremental learning begins when the new speaker is identified. Incremental learning is the learning algorithm that already learned weights are remembered and only the new weights that are created as adding new speaker are trained. It is learning algorithm that overcomes the fault of neural network. The neural network repeats the learning when the new speaker is entered to it. The architecture of neural network is extended with the number of speakers. Therefore, this system can learn without the restricted number of speakers.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5391/IJFIS.2005.5.1.076", "venue": "Int.

Co-occurrence networks displayed the differences of macroinvertebrate community stability among three different stream types. Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling demonstrated distinct impacts of heavy rain and drought on macroinvertebrate communities. The samples from the heavy rain and dry events were clearly classified under different clusters than other samples regardless of the stream type. Lotic preferred species such as Kiotina decorata and Sweltsa nikkoensis were selected as an indicator species in the perennial stream, whereas lentic preferred species such as Ephemera strigata and Davidius lunatus were chosen in the intermittent stream. In the ephemeral stream, oligochaetes such as Dorydrilus sp. and Fridericia sp., which are readily found in unstable habitats with their short-life cycle, were selected as indicator species. Based on the Random Forest model, the amount of precipitation was the most influential factor, mainly for determining the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrate species, followed by electric conductivity and velocity. The Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) detected 32 (17.6%) of 182 taxa in total as robust 42 response, and most of the taxa (26 taxa) were sensitive to the increase in precipitation, whereas 6 taxa were tolerant. The community change points for the amount of precipitation were 121.2 mm/month for tolerant species and 36.6 mm/month for sensitive species. Finally, our results revealed that the occurrences of two extreme hydrological disturbances (i.e., heavy rain and dry events) were primary factors for determining the spatial and temporal extent of habitat diversity and stability in the Korean peninsula streams under the least disturbance conditions.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.02.060", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Indicators", "mag_id": "2921490194", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202025473"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:92580477"}

We show that a slight generalization of their construction can be used to give a pac style bound on the tail of the distribution of the generalization errors that arise from a given sample size. Algorithms arising from the approach are related to those of Cortes and Vapnik. We generalise the basic result to function classes with bounded fat- shattering dimension and the 1-norm of the slack variables which gives rise to Vapnik's box constraint algorithm. We also extend the results to the regression case and obtain bounds on the probability that a randomly chosen test point will have error greater than a given value. The bounds apply to the $\\epsilon$-insensitive loss function proposed by Vapnik for Support Vector Machine regression.

Current work focuses on either (1) whether the embedding is designed as an unsupervised learning task by explicitly preserving the structural connectivity in the network, or (2) whether the embedding is a by-product during the supervised learning of a specific discriminative task in a deep neural network. In this paper, we focus on bridging the gap of the two lines of the research. We propose to adapt the Generative Adversarial model to perform network embedding, in which the generator is trying to generate vertex pairs, while the discriminator tries to distinguish the generated vertex pairs from real connections (edges) in the network. Wasserstein-1 distance is adopted to train the generator to gain better stability. We develop three variations of models, including GANE which applies cosine similarity, GANE-O1 which preserves the first-order proximity, and GANE-O2 which tries to preserves the second-order proximity of the network in the low-dimensional embedded vector space. We later prove that GANE-O2 has the same objective function as GANE-O1 when negative sampling is applied to simplify the training process in GANE-O2.

Moreover, we employ a domain discriminator, in which adversarial learning is adopted to align the less-annotated target domain features with the well-annotated source domain features in the feature space. We further propose a novel training strategy for the adversarial learning by coupling data from source and target domains and alternating the subnet updates.

Investors are able to distribute their money to demand points through this market. For a smooth running of the market, the market have to be efficient and liquid. This implies that investors can buy or sell a share of a stock at a reasonably fair price. The decision to buy or sell a share of the stock is a major investment decision to be made by investors/market players in the capital market. In this paper, different machine learning techniques are used to predict the movement of stocks on the stock market. Stocks are classified into labels according to their current and day-ahead closing price. That is, if the day-ahead closing price is greater than or equal to the current closing price, the investor/market player sells the shares of the stock, else the investor/market player buys additional shares of the stock. Four features (the difference between the price low and price high, the difference between the closing and opening price, the market capitalization, and the volume traded) are used to predict the labels. Two machine learning classifiers (Adaptive Boosting and K-Nearest Neighbour) and Stacking ensemble classifier are trained and used for the classification problem. Using dataset obtained from the Nairobi Stock Exchange, the robustness and effectiveness of the methods on the testing datasets are validated. The results shows that: 1) the Stacking Ensemble Learning Method with two base learners (Adaptive Boosting and K-Nearest Neighbour) and Gradient Boosting Machine as the meta-classifier outperforms the two individual classifiers with an accuracy of 0.7810, area under curve of 0.8238, a kappa of 0.5516, and an out of bag error (OOB) rate of 21.89%, 2) the Volume of shares traded on a specific day does not have much importance when buying or selling shares on the Nairobi stock exchange capital market, and 3) machine learning classifiers can be applied to the stock market for optimal investment decisions.

It is not clear whether genetic characteristics of the bacteria contribute to disease pathogenesis in MRSA infection. We hypothesized that whole genome analysis of MRSA strains could reveal the key gene loci and/or the gene mutations that affect clinical manifestations of MRSA infection. Methods Whole genome sequences (WGS) of MRSA of 154 strains were analyzed with respect to clinical manifestations and data. Further, we evaluated the association between clinical manifestations in MRSA infection and genomic information. Results WGS revealed gene mutations that correlated with clinical manifestations of MRSA infection. Moreover, 12 mutations were selected as important mutations by Random Forest analysis. Cluster analysis revealed strains associated with a high frequency of blood stream infection (BSI). Twenty seven out of 34 strains in this cluster caused BSI. These strains were all positive for collagen adhesion gene (cna) and have mutations in the locus, those were selected by Random Forest analysis.

Performance comparison with previous studies is presented in order to demonstrate the proposed algorithm's advantages over various classification methods. The goal of the paper is to provide the grasp of a methodology that can be efficiently used to raise classification success rates obtained by the use of conventional approaches such as Neural Networks, RBF networks and K-nearest neighbors. The suggested algorithm divides the training set into two subsets: one that arises from the joining of coherent data regions and one that comprises of the data portion that is difficult to be clustered. Consequently, the first subset is used to train a Support Vector Machine with a RBF kernel and the second subset is used to train another Support Vector Machine with a polynomial kernel. During classification the algorithm is capable of identifying which of the two Support Vector Machine models to use. The intuition behind the suggested algorithm relies on the expectation that the RBF Support Vector Machine model is more appropriate to use on data sets of different characteristics than the polynomial kernel. In the specific study case the suggested algorithm raised average classification success rate to 82.2% while the best performance obtained by previous studies was 81% given by a fine tuned highly complex ARTMAP-IC model.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BIBE.2012.6399663", "venue": "2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Bioinformatics & Bioengineering (BIBE)", "journal": "2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Bioinformatics & Bioengineering (BIBE)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1983405239", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62139681", "1159293", "18834074"], "inbound_citations": ["31039732", "16285337", "211207864", "758015", "202729798", "133603254", "45753882", "67867204", "209381248"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9526028"}

But CTP data alone, even with the generated perfusion maps is not enough to describe the precise location of infarct core or penumbra. Considering the good performance demonstrated on Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), We propose a CTP data analysis technique using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [2] to generate DWI, and segment the regions of ischemic stroke lesion on top of the generated DWI based on convolutional neutral network (CNN) and a novel loss function. Specifically, our CNN structure consists of a generator, a discriminator and a segmentator. The generator synthesizes DWI from CT, which generates a high quality representation for subsequent segmentator. Meanwhile the discriminator competes with the generator to identify whether its input DWI is real or generated. And we propose a novel segmentation loss function that contains a weighted cross-entropy loss and generalized dice loss [1] to balance the positive and negative loss in the training phase. And the weighted cross entropy loss can highlight the area of stroke lesion to enhance the structural contrast. We also introduce other techniques in our network, like GN [13], Maxout [14] in the proposed network. Data augmentation is also used in the training phase. In our experiments, an average dice coefficient of 60.65% is achieved with four-fold cross-validation. From the results of our experiments, this novel network combined with the proposed loss function achieved a better performance in CTP data analysis than traditional methods using CTP perfusion parameters.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-11723-8_25", "venue": "BrainLes@MICCAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2913554309", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59943285"}

In this paper, we examine a dataset consisting of 610 users who were messaged by Twitter bots, and determine which features describing these users were most helpful in predicting whether or not they would interact with the bots (through replies or following the bot). We then use six classifiers to build models for predicting whether a given user will interact with the bot, both using the selected features and using all features. We find that a users' Klout score, friends count, and followers count are most predictive of whether a user will interact with a bot, and that the Random Forest algorithm produces the best classifier, when used in conjunction with one of the better feature ranking algorithms (although poor feature ranking can actually make performance worse than no feature ranking).

The European Space Agency\u2019s (ESA) Sentinel1 constellation provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images coverage with a 6 days revisit period at a high spatial resolution of pixel spacing 20 m. Sentinel-1 data are considerable useful, as they provide valuable information of the vegetation cover. The objective of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the capabilities of Sentinel-1 radar images for rice height and dry biomass retrievals. To do this, we train Sentinel1 data against ground measurements with classical machine learning techniques (Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF)) to estimate rice height and dry biomass. The study is carried out on a multi-temporal Sentinel-1 dataset acquired from May 2017 to September 2017 over the Camargue region, southern France. The ground in-situ measurements were made in the same period to collect rice height and dry biomass over 11 rice fields. The images were processed in order to produce an intensity radar data stack in C-band including dual-polarization VV (Vertical receive and Vertical transmit) and VH (Vertical receive and Horizontal transmit) data. We found that non-parametric methods (SVR and RF) had a better performance over the parametric MLR method for rice biophysical parameter retrievals. The accuracy of rice height estimation showed that rice height retrieval was strongly correlated to the in-situ rice height from dual-polarization, in which Random Forest yielded the best performance with correlation coefficient R 2 = 0.92 and the root mean square error (RMSE) 16% (7.9 cm). In addition, we demonstrated that the correlation of Sentinel-1 signal to the biomass was also very high in VH polarization with R 2 = 0.9 and RMSE = 18% (162 g.m \u22122 ) (with Random Forest method). Such results indicate that the highly qualified Sentinel-1 radar data could be well exploited for rice biomass and height retrieval and they could be used for operational tasks", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2325174", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2896908315", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17405867", "155672756", "128977933", "89977539", "131490989", "28327408", "34932756", "16244918", "11687149", "9262050", "2293997", "129494315", "34993994", "130848624", "13020515", "1235217", "45608780", "129599517", "9552875", "128889810", "30657273", "7439234", "129560440", "28367341", "44543563", "84447695", "52276856", "123683961", "1430472", "89141", "37903200", "1721126", "1087939", "4042499", "52276856", "19023004", "40432379", "23240574", "122725444", "41215492", "133996454", "2910891", "3500677", "19294430", "11944870", "2232024", "8928929", "122636433", "130657266", "84447695", "9377686"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134960434"}

We propose a method for streaming NLDR when the observed data is either sampled from multiple manifolds or irregularly sampled from a single manifold. We show that existing NLDR methods, such as Isomap, fail in such situations, primarily because they rely on smoothness and continuity of the underlying manifold, which is violated in the scenarios explored in this paper.

To account for the varying quality of different annotator outputs, we first utilized crowdsourcing to measure the accuracy of individual entity annotators, and then used supervised machine learning to combine different entity annotators based on their relative accuracy.

The selection of the right variables is far more complicated than the development of predictive models. In this study, eight continuous and categorical data sets were employed to explore the applicability of two distinct variable selection methods random forests (RF) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Variable selection was performed: (1) by using recursive random forests to rule out a quarter of the least important descriptors at each iteration and (2) by using LASSO modeling with 10-fold inner cross-validation to tune its penalty \u03bb for each data set. Along with regular statistical parameters of model performance, we proposed the highest pairwise correlation rate, average pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficient, and Tanimoto coefficient to evaluate the optimal by RF and LASSO in an extensive way. Results showed that variable selection could allow a tremendous reduction of noisy descriptors (at most 96% with RF method in this study) and apparently enhance model's predictive performance as well. Furthermore, random forests showed property of gathering important predictors without restricting their pairwise correlation, which is contrary to LASSO. The mutual exclusion of highly correlated variables in LASSO modeling tends to skip important variables that are highly related to response endpoints and thus undermine the model's predictive performance. The optimal variables selected by RF share low similarity with those by LASSO (e.g., the Tanimoto coefficients were smaller than 0.20 in seven out of eight data sets). We found that the differences between RF and LASSO predictive performances mainly resulted from the variables selected by different strategies rather than the learning algorithms. Our study showed that the right selection of variables is more important than the learning algorithm for modeling. We hope that a standard procedure could be developed based on these proposed statistical metrics to select the truly important variables for model interpretation, as well as for further use to facilitate drug discovery and environmental toxicity assessment.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25746224", "doi": "10.1021/ci500715e", "venue": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "journal": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "mag_id": "1976151630", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["1586085", "42857949", "209434735", "149868560"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32184345"}

The basic idea behind RC is the expansion of an original complex problem (input data), onto the higher dimensional phase space of the reservoir, in which it is expected that a simple linear separation can solve the problem formulated by the input data. Standard reservoirs are composed of a large number of randomly interconnected nodes. It has been recently shown that a single nonlinear node with delayed feedback substitutes an entire network of nodes maintaining similar processing power [1]. By defining virtual nodes as delayed states that reside in the delay line, it is enough to have only one hardware node in the setup.Experimental realizations of this approach to RC has been recently implemented in photonics using semiconductors laser with delayed feedback [2,3]. The obtained results are similar or even outperform the state of the art for prediction of time series or speech recognition. In spite of these encouraging results, a single nonlinear node with delayed feedback has a limited memory capacity. The memory capacity is a key property of the reservoir computers that allows the processing of dynamical signals. Tasks that require high memory capacities are until now unattainable with photonic reservoir computers. In this work we have added extra delay lines to the nonlinear node to increase the memory capacity. The equation that governs our electro-optical delayed system with multiple delays is given by the following equation:x t x t \u03b2 \u03b3 I t 2 ( ) = - ( ) + sin ( ( ) + \u03a3 w x ( t - \u03c4 ) + \u03c8 ), i i i 1 where \u03b2 is the feedback gain, \u03b3 is the input scaling, I is the input signal, \u03c8 is the phase of the nonlinearity, and wi and \u03c4i determine the strength and the length of the feedback lines.Actually, we have found that the Memory capacity increases with the number of delay lines allowing the processing of high demanding tasks (see Fig.1 right). To test the computational power of the multiple delay approach we have implemented two standard tests: the NARMA test that consist on the output calculation of a noise driven nonlinear iteration, and the delayed PARITY test that consist on the calculation of the parity of a binary input for a given delay \u03b4.

Four supervised classification techniques namely, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and Random Forest (RF) as well as three unsupervised classification techniques namely, k-Means, Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), are compared in terms of correct classification rate, F-measure, recall, precision, and specificity.

The longer is the time spent on performing the reloading, the higher is the loss of money. Due to the great complexity involved in this process, it is not feasible to solve it by classical methods such as hill climbing or gradient ones. For this reason, the optimization methods known as evolutionary algorithms such as the genetic algorithms have been used as an alternative to the traditional practices. Genetic algorithms use the biological metaphor of the survival of the fittest proposed by Darwin to motivate its mechanism of individuals composing a population. Based on these concepts, Baluja has proposed the Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL), a stochastic optimization technique. This paper presents a review study related to the evolution of PBIL when used to optimize the nuclear reload process of the 7th operation cycle of the Brazilian PWR Angra 1. Since 1999, several researchers have been using the most varied optimization techniques which analyze this particular case study. Therefore, this survey aims to describe in which ways the different strategies adopted by some of PBIL's variations has contributed to obtain better results along the years on solving this particular problem, besides making a comparison of the results obtained by each of them.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.anucene.2017.11.043", "venue": null, "journal": "Annals of Nuclear Energy", "mag_id": "2774969091", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["198928981"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125128817"}

Many existing approaches fail to provide favorable results due to being: 1) shallow in architecture; 2) hand engineered in features; and 3) separate in learning. In this paper we propose a deep architecture that consists of two parts, i.e., a deep belief network (DBN) at the bottom and a multitask regression layer at the top. A DBN is employed here for unsupervised feature learning. It can learn effective features for traffic flow prediction in an unsupervised fashion, which has been examined and found to be effective for many areas such as image and audio classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that applies the deep learning approach to transportation research. To incorporate multitask learning (MTL) in our deep architecture, a multitask regression layer is used above the DBN for supervised prediction. We further investigate homogeneous MTL and heterogeneous MTL for traffic flow prediction. To take full advantage of weight sharing in our deep architecture, we propose a grouping method based on the weights in the top layer to make MTL more effective.

Second, the framework adopts SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) as features, which is more suitable for dealing with real-time situations. Third, we use region attributes to revise incorrectly detected visual features (described by invisible image attributes at segmented regions of the image). Combining these approaches, the efficiency of machine learning can be improved.

Classification accuracy is also dramatically reduced in the presence of background noise when only sparse train and test data is available because of nonstationary noise. Methods such as MAP and Eigenvoice can be used to address short duration (10 sec) train data for speaker recognition, but even more effective adaptation strategies are needed when there is half the amount of train (5 sec) and test (2 \u223c 6 sec) data. In this study, limited train data is analyzed with a Gaussian Mixture Tagger (GMT) in order to estimate a complete acoustic information inventory. With this knowledge, this dissertation proposes two speaker adaptation schemes, entitled TDBU and MRNC speaker adaptations. The TDBU separates the speaker model into \"Top\" and \"Bottom\" models, where the method reinforces the available train data for the \"Top\" and fills the acoustic holes for the \"Bottom\" by borrowing data from acoustically similar speakers'. The MRNC method balances the cohort speakers' data to represent the conversational speech so that the MRNC speaker model covers the acoustic space more naturally. For the second contribution, a leveraged speaker and background noise system is also proposed to address any noise present in the sparse data. Using the assumption, where a speaker produces speech in the same environment, the proposed system takes advantage of analyzing the background noise with the speaker information to balance the output evaluation results. The TDBU method achieves a relative +14% EER improvement over traditional MAP adaptation, and the MRNC method improves the relative +16% EER over MAP and Eigenvoice using only 5 sec of train and 6 sec of test data from the Fisher corpus. Results with the in-vehicle CU-Move corpus also show similar performance improvement for both speaker modeling methods. The noise leverage system improves performance by a relative +27% EER using 10 sec train/test on the NIST SRE evaluation. ::: For the third contribution, advancements in negative speaker selection are addressed. A discriminant training model such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), requires effective selection of negative examples to acquire optimum classification performance. The SVM system cannot obtain optimum performance with unseen evaluation data, since the SVM system is designed to use a fixed size set of negative examples based on development data. The ErrDiff method is proposed which ErrDiff method is evaluated using the NIST SRE corpus framework, and is shown to achieve a relative +6% improvement over the best SVM baseline system without a hard configuration of the system. The strength in this advancement is the consistency in performance between development testing and open testing results. ::: The main contributions of this dissertation based on TDBU and MRNC impact speaker modeling using limited duration train/test sets for speaker recognition. The leveraged noise system can be applied in many speech applications exposed to noisy environments. Finally, the ErrDiff can impact SVM based speaker and language ID problems as well as text classification. These contributions provide meaningful steps towards improving speech, speaker, and language identification systems for human-machine interaction.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2520765863", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114938472"}

Comparing with other energy options, the PEMFCs need only hydrogen and air during operation. Meanwhile, as a by-product during operation, water is produced. This energy-conversion process is 100% eco-friendly and completely unharmful to the environment. However, PEMFCs are vulnerable to the impurities of hydrogen or fluctuation of operational condition, which could cause the degradation of output performance over time during operation. Thus, the prediction of the performance degradation is critical to the PEMFC system. In this work, a novel PEMFC performance-forecasting model based on a modified relevance vector machine (RVM) has been proposed, followed by a comparison with the approach of classic support vector machine (SVM). First, the theoretical formulation of RVM is briefly introduced, then the implementation steps of RVM using the experimental aging data sets of PEMFC stack output voltage are presented. By considering the specific feature of aging data-prediction problem, an innovative modified RVM formulation is proposed. The results of proposed modified RVM method are analyzed and compared to the results of SVM. The results have demonstrated that the modified RVM can achieve better performance of prediction than SVM, especially in the cases with relatively small training data sets.

Within biometrics, automatic signature identification and verification has been a strong research area because of the social and legal acceptance and extensive use of the written signature as an individual authentication. Signature verification is a process in which the questioned signature is examined in detail in order to determine whether it belongs to the claimed person or not. Despite substantial research in the field of signature verification involving Western signatures, very few works have been dedicated to non-Western signatures such as Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, or Persian etc. In this paper, the performance of an off-line signature verification system involving Bangla signatures, whose style is distinct from Western scripts, was investigated.

For transfer learning to be successful, it is critical to find the similarity between auxiliary and target domains, even when such mappings are not obvious. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for finding the structural similarity between two domains, to enable transfer learning at a structured knowledge level. In particular, we address the problem of how to learn a non-trivial structural similarity mapping between two different domains when they are completely different on the representation level. This problem is challenging because we cannot directly compare features across domains. Our algorithm extracts the structural features within each domain and then maps the features into the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), such that the \"structural dependencies\" of features across domains can be estimated by kernel matrices of the features within each domain. By treating the analogues from both domains as equivalent, we can transfer knowledge to achieve a better understanding of the domains and improved performance for learning.

This finding, if confirmed, has major implications for diagnosis and care of severely brain-injured patients. We were concerned about the method\u2019s validity because of the difficulty of the task, and its critical reliance on certain statistical assumptions. To allow us to test the validity of the method, Cruse and colleagues graciously supplied their data and analysis software. Below we show that the patient data do not meet the statistical assumptions made in Cruse et al., likely because of the presence of various artifacts (Table). We then show that when the data are re-analyzed by methods that do not depend on these model assumptions, there is no evidence for task performance in the patients. ::: ::: ::: ::: Table ::: ::: Overview of analyses and findings. ::: ::: ::: ::: To begin, we examine the EEG data itself. The normals have findings typical of healthy adults (Figure 1A, left): rhythmicity in the alpha range (~10 Hz) with minimal eye-blink and muscle artifact. In contrast, the patients\u2019 EEG (Figure 1A, right) is dominated by 1\u20134 Hz activity, as is typical of severe brain dysfunction, deep sleep or anesthesia2. Frequency-domain representation (Figure 1B) confirms these findings. It also reveals that the patient\u2019s EEG has significant muscle artifact3 that fluctuates block-to-block. ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 1 ::: ::: Time and frequency domain representations of the EEG of a typical normal (N2) and patient (P13) who had similar classification rates in Cruse et al. (75% and 78%, respectively; Webappendix for methods). A. Laplacian-montaged EEG of the first trial of ... ::: ::: ::: ::: To determine whether subjects performed motor imagery, Cruse and colleagues used a multivariate method (Support Vector Machine; SVM)4,5 to differentiate EEG signals recorded while subjects were asked to imagine moving their hand, vs. their toes. SVM is a powerful technique, but, without a gold-standard for task performance, the validity hinges on the appropriateness of the statistical model.6 As detailed below, the statistical model used in Cruse et al. did not account for relationships between adjacent blocks, or correlations between trials within a block. ::: ::: For calculation of accuracy (how often the SVM correctly classified trials as \u201chand\u201d vs. \u201ctoe\u201d), the Cruse et al. methods did not take into account the possibility of slow variations across blocks, as their approach always classified pairs of neighbouring blocks (e.g., hand and toe block 1, but never hand block 1 and toe block 4). We modified their analysis to use these alternative pairings for cross-validation6 (Webappendix). In two of the positive patients (Webappendix Figure 1), accuracy decreased to chance (P1), or worse-than-chance (P12) as the test-block-pairs were further apart. This drop in accuracy implies that idiosyncratic relationships between adjacent blocks contributed substantially to SVM performance in these subjects. ::: ::: For calculation of significance, Cruse and colleagues calculated p-values using a binomial distribution for the number of correct trials, an approach that assumes that each trial is an independent assay. We found that this assumption does not hold in the patients. First, frequency domain representation of the EEG (Figure 1B; Webappendix) reveals a lack of independence: data from individual trials are more nearly matched within a block than across blocks. Second, we applied the Cruse et al. analysis separately to all time points of the trials. For patients, we found that worse-than-chance classification occurred substantially more often than expected from binomial statistics. This excess of outliers implies that trials are correlated (Webappendix and Webappendix Figure 2). ::: ::: We next show that when the SVM results are re-analyzed with a statistical approach that takes into account the correlations mentioned above (Webappendix and Webappendix Table 1 for full details), there is no statistical evidence of a task-related signal. To take into account correlations between blocks, we defined accuracy using all block-pairs as test components6, rather than restricting consideration to adjacent block pairs. To account for dependence among trials, we determined significance via a permutation test that recognized the block design. With this approach, positive normals remained significant, but only one patient (P13) remained significant (p=0\u00b70286; lowest possible p-value with 4 blocks). We further note that even for random data, a classifier would be expected to yield 1 in 20 positive subjects at p\u22640.05. We therefore corrected for multiple comparisons via the False-Discovery Rate (FDR)7; normals remained significant but none of the patients were significant at p\u22640\u00b705. ::: ::: Finally, we applied an independent approach that asked whether there was a significant difference between task and rest periods, using univariate statistics (i.e., separate tests for each frequency and channel of the EEG; methods in Webappendix and8; Webappendix Figures 3 and 4). Normals showed the expected task-related changes in motor imagery tasks (decreases in EEG power from 7\u201330 Hz, especially over the motor cortices contralateral to the imagined limb movement; p\u22640. 05 after FDR correction)9,10. None of the 16 patients had significant changes identified by this measure. This emphasizes that even if we were to accept the \u2018positive\u2019 patient classifications of Cruse et al. as different from chance, the EEG signals lack the expected physiological changes associated with motor imagery (in contrast to the suggestion made by Cruse and colleagues in connection with their Figure 2). ::: ::: In sum, we found that the method of Cruse et al. is not valid because the patient data do not meet the assumptions of their statistical model. Specifically, the model does not allow for correlations between nearby trials and blocks, which are likely induced by fluctuating artifact and arousal state; when these factors are taken into account, there is no statistical evidence for task performance in patients. Importantly, the model of Cruse et al. generally suffices for normals, where there is minimal artifact contamination. These findings cast doubt about conclusions drawn from this method, both in Cruse et al., and a more recent study11. ::: ::: SVM and related methods are useful tools, particularly in EEG analysis for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)10,12. In BCI applications, subjects can confirm task performance and the consequences of classifier failure are limited to reduced device performance. But in the diagnostic setting (e.g., determination of consciousness, genomic diagnosis of cancer13,14), classifier failure can misinform clinical decision making, with major consequences for patients and families. Given this, and the ease of dissemination of EEG technology, standards of demonstration of validity need to be high. Our analysis suggests that the approach of Cruse et al. falls short of this standard. ::: ::: Finally, we wish to emphasize the importance of data sharing. This analysis would not have been possible without full access to the original data and code.15", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3641526", "pubmed_id": "23351802", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60125-7", "venue": "Lancet", "journal": "Lancet", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1965624581", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["1926221", "1101322", "58776597", "237761", "11227964", "45174121", "8444752", "15622379", "24756702", "9744778"], "inbound_citations": ["1033840", "4773233", "7734370", "8657802", "215035357", "146424009", "4085553", "20564439", "55888505", "14919537", "9861279", "53220674"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37489673"}

Since traditional methods (e.g. field surveys) used for the mapping of the tree species tend to be time consuming, date lagged and too expensive, a technology of remote sensing might potentially offer a practical solution for the problem of tree species mapping, especially over large areas. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of Formosat-2 multi-spectral image time series for classification of the tree species in temperate woodlands. Since phenological variations might increase spectral separability of the trees species, additional aim of the study was to assess the possibility of using multispectral-image time series as an alternative to hyper-spectral data for forest type mapping. Noise from the Formosat-2 images was removed with the Whittaker smoother algorithm, which performed quite well although some additional work might be needed during the selection of the optimal regularization parameter. Several supervised classification methods, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), were used to discriminate tree species from the image time series. All of the classifiers performed reasonably well, with classification accuracies from 88.5 % to 99.2 % (Kappa statistic), although SVM model was the most accurate, while GMM was the most efficient in terms of computing time. High classification accuracy also indicated that the multi-spectral image time series and remote sensing might be a useful method for the mapping of tree species.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2903134327", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69911265"}

Recently, the brain tumor segmentation from IoT generated images has emerged as a promising issue that requires sophisticated and efficient techniques. The accurate brain tumor segmentation is challenging due to large variations in tumor appearance. Existing methods either use handcrafted features based techniques or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In this paper, a novel cascading approach for fully automatic brain tumor segmentation has been proposed, which intelligently combines handcrafted features and CNN. First, three handcrafted features are computed namely mean intensity, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and then Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed to perform pixel classification that results in Confidence Surface Modality (CSM). This CSM along with the given Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is fed to a novel three pathways CNN architecture.

The paper introduces a new automated seizure detection model that integrates Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier model to enhance the sensitivity and precision of the detection process. The proposed system utilizes the fact that entropy based measures for the EEG segments during epileptic seizure are lower than in normal EEG. The new suggested model better tracks abrupt changes in the signal and assigns less complexity to segments that exhibit regularity or are subjected to noise effects. The Weighted Permutation Entropy algorithm relies on the ordinal pattern of the time series along with the amplitudes of its sample points. The proposed technique is implemented and tested on hundreds real EEG signals and the performance is compared based on sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Various experiments have been applied in different scenarios including healthy with eyes open, healthy with eyes closed, epileptic patients during no-seizure state from two different location of the brain. Other scenarios have been applied accompanied by background simulated noise resulting from physiological and environmental artifacts.

{"paper_id": "59408378", "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning - Pretraining actor-critic networks using state representation learning", "authors": [{"first": "J.", "middle": [], "last": "Munk", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "In control, the objective is to find a mapping from states to actions that steer a system to a desired reference. A controller can be designed by an engineer, typically using some model of the system or it can be learned by an algorithm. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one such algorithm. In RL, the controller is an agent that interacts with the system, with the aim of maximizing the rewards received over time. In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been successfully used as function approximators in RL algorithms. One particular algorithm, that is used to learn various continuous control tasks, is the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). The DDPG learns two DNNs, an actor network that maps states to actions and a critic network that is used to find the policy gradient. The policy gradient is subsequently used to update the actor, in the direction that maximizes the rewards over time. A disadvantage of using a DNN as function approximator is the amount of data that is necessary to train such a network. Data, which is not always available or can be expensive to obtain. An advantage of DNNs is that they can cope with high-dimensional state and actions spaces, something other (local) function approx- imators are less suitable for. State Representation Learning (SRL) is a technique that is typically used to lower the dimensionality of the state space. Instead of learning from the raw observations of the system, SRL is used to map a high- dimensional observation to a low-dimensional state, before learning the RL task. The main idea is that the learning algorithm first learns how to extract the relevant information from the system, before it learns to control it. In this thesis two algorithms are designed, the Robotic Prior Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (RP- DDPG) and the Model Learning Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (ML-DDPG) that both combine SRL with the DDPG algorithm, with the aim of improving the data-efficiency and/or performance of the original algo- rithm. The two algorithms differ in the type of SRL method that is used. The RP-DDPG uses a concept known as the Robotic Priors, which describes a desirable structure of the state such that it is consistent with physics. The ML-DDPG learns a model of the system. The algorithms are compared on three different benchmark problems. For each benchmark, various ob- servation vectors are \u201cdesigned\u201d, to simulate different ways of how the information about the state of the system is communicated to the agent. In our experiments, the RP-DDPG is unable to learn two out of three benchmarks problems and requires 4 times more data on the third problem. The ML-DDPG is more success- ful, it outperforms the original DDPG on one benchmark and performs similarly on the other two. In general, the DDPG and the ML-DDPG do not learn state-of-the-art policies. When the task is to track a certain reference signal, the controlled system has a steady-state error and/or significant overshoot for some of the reference positions. It does, however, learn reasonable policies under very difficult circumstances. It can learn (to some degree) to ignore irrelevant inputs, deal with a reference position that is given in a dif- ferent coordinate system than the configuration of its body and learn from high-dimensional observations. Most importantly, it does so, without the need to specifically design or alter the algorithm to deal with these challenges. In a final experiment, the ability of a DNN to generalize what it has learned to examples that differ sub- stantially from examples that it has seen during training is investigated. This ability is what sets a DNN apart from other function approximators and is believed to be the reason why DNN can cope with high- dimensional observations. In the experiment, it is shown that the actor can generalize its policy, i.e., it can produce a control action for observations that differ substantially from observations it has seen during train- ing. Furthermore, the experiment support the claim that a DNN is able to generalize, by learning individual factors that each contribute to the control action independently.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2580724973", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59408378"}

In this paper, a method of combining principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector regression (SVR) technique is proposed for modeling temperature-caused variability of modal frequencies for structures instrumented with long-term monitoring systems. PCA is first applied to extract principal components from the measured temperatures for dimensionality reduction. The predominant feature vectors in conjunction with the measured modal frequencies are then fed into a support vector algorithm to formulate regression models that may take into account thermal inertia effect. The research is focused on proper selection of the hyperparameters to obtain SVR models with good generalization performance. A grid search method with cross validation and a heuristic method are utilized for determining the optimal values of SVR hyperparameters. The proposed method is compared with the method directly using measurement data to train SVR models and the multivariate linear regression (MLR) method through the use of long-term measurement data from a cable-stayed bridge. It is shown that PCA-compressed features make the training and validation of SVR models more efficient in both model accuracy and computational costs, and the formulated SVR model performs much better than the MLR model in generalization performance.

In typical GAN architectures, the discriminator block is designed mainly to capture the class-specific content from images without explicitly imposing constraints on the visual quality of the generated images.

We translate this insight into a constraint on the loss function of the discriminator in the GAN architecture with the goal of improving the visual quality of the generated images. Specifically, this constraint is based on the Multi-scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM) index to guarantee local structural and statistical integrity.

Extracting features which facilitate cancer symptoms detection without significant decrease in sensitivity, minimizes false positives and is of great importance. Microcalcification is an important indicator of cancer. In this research a new method for detecting microcalcifications in mammography is presented. Due to the ability of wavelet transform in image decomposition and detaching details, it can be used to expose this symptom in mammograms. In this work, a two dimensional wavelet transform is performed for feature extraction; and these features are used to diagnose cancer symptoms in mammography images.

We extended the large-scale linear support vector machine library LIBLINEAR with state-of-the-art virtual high-throughput screening metrics to train classifiers on whole large and unbalanced data sets. The formulation of this linear support machine has an excellent performance if applied to high-dimensional sparse feature vectors. An additional advantage is the average linear complexity in the number of non-zero features of a prediction. Nevertheless, the approach assumes that a problem is linearly separable. Therefore, we conducted an extensive benchmarking to evaluate the performance on large-scale problems up to a size of 175000 samples. To examine the virtual screening performance, we determined the chemotype clusters using Feature Trees and integrated this information to compute weighted AUC-based performance measures and a leave-cluster-out cross-validation. We also considered the BEDROC score, a metric that was suggested to tackle the early enrichment problem. The performance on each problem was evaluated by a nested cross-validation and a nested leave-cluster-out cross-validation. We compared LIBLINEAR against a Na\u00efve Bayes classifier, a random decision forest classifier, and a maximum similarity ranking approach. These reference approaches were outperformed in a direct comparison by LIBLINEAR. A comparison to literature results showed that the LIBLINEAR performance is competitive but without achieving results as good as the top-ranked nonlinear machines on these benchmarks.

This extension, relational neural gas, is directly applicable in important domains such as bioinformatics or text clustering.

However, evaluating the performance of GANs is still an open and challenging problem. Existing evaluation metrics primarily measure the dissimilarity between real and generated images using automated statistical methods. They often require large sample sizes for evaluation and do not directly reflect human perception of image quality. In this work, we introduce an evaluation metric called Neuroscore, for evaluating the performance of GANs, that more directly reflects psychoperceptual image quality through the utilization of brain signals. Our results show that Neuroscore has superior performance to the current evaluation metrics in that: (1) It is more consistent with human judgment; (2) The evaluation process needs much smaller numbers of samples; and (3) It is able to rank the quality of images on a per GAN basis. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based neuro-AI interface is proposed to predict Neuroscore from GAN-generated images directly without the need for neural responses. Importantly, we show that including neural responses during the training phase of the network can significantly improve the prediction capability of the proposed model.

In EEG classification, Feature Selection (FS) represents a pivotal phase, as these problems request the processing of a large amount of high-dimensional patterns. In this paper, FS has been solved by an embedded multi-objective genetic optimization procedure which evolves a population of potential solutions (subsets of features), subject to the simultaneous minimization of the misclassification ratio and number of selected attributes. Random Forests (RF) classifiers are adopted, due to their fast training and their compatibility with spread classes of very diverse patterns. The main contribution presented in this paper consists in introducing an inertial behavior to feature extraction. The available feature set is extended with features from previous time frames, and FS is performed on this extended set. In this context, the experimental analysis illustrates the impact of the temporal extension on FS. Additionally, two enhancements are proposed for the multi-objective optimization, to support an effective Pareto-ranking of the solutions in the expanded exploration search space. Thus, the number of trees in the embedded RF classifier is gradually increased, for reducing the computational load requested for the evaluation of the misclassification ratio, without impeding the exploration. Also, the preference for the minimization of misclassifications is set by introducing a dynamic objective function for describing the parsimony of the selected subset of attributes.

Machine Learning is a complex and resource consuming process that requires a lot of computing power. With the constant growth of information, the need for efficient algorithms with high performance is increasing. Today's commodity graphics cards are parallel multi processors with high computing capacity at an attractive price and are usually pre-installed in new PCs. The graphics cards provide an additional resource to be used in machine learning applications. The Random Forest learning algorithm which has been showed competitive within machine learning has a good potential for performance increase through parallelization of the algorithm. Objectives. In this study we implement and review a revised Random Forest algorithm for GPU execution using CUDA. Methods. A review of previous work in the area has been done by studying articles from several sources, including Compendex, Inspec, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library and Springer Link. Additional information regarding GPU architecture and implementation specific details have been obtained mainly from documentation available from Nvidia and the Nvidia developer forums. The implemented algorithm has been benchmarked and compared with two state-of-the-art CPU implementations of the Random Forest algorithm, both regarding consumed time for training and classification and for classification accuracy. Results. Measurements from benchmarks made on the three different algorithms are gathered showing the performance results of the algorithms for two publicly available data sets. Conclusion. We conclude that our implementation under the right conditions is able to outperform its competitors.

Existing works build upon Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) such that the distribution of the translated images are indistinguishable from the distribution of the target set. However, such set-level constraints cannot learn the instance-level correspondences (e.g. aligned semantic parts in object configuration task). This limitation often results in false positives (e.g. geometric or semantic artifacts), and further leads to mode collapse problem. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework for instance-level image translation by Deep Attention GAN (DA-GAN). Such a design enables DA-GAN to decompose the task of translating samples from two sets into translating instances in a highly-structured latent space. Specifically, we jointly learn a deep attention encoder, and the instancelevel correspondences could be consequently discovered through attending on the learned instance pairs. Therefore, the constraints could be exploited on both set-level and instance-level.

Additionally, although the steganalysis of Yet Another Steganographic Scheme (YASS) was actively conducted, the detection of the YASS steganograms by a large B-block parameter has not been well explored. In this paper, we aim to detect the state-of-the-art adaptive steganographic system in DCT-embedding and to improve the steganalysis of YASS. To detect DCT-embedding based adaptive steganography, we design the features of differential neighboring joint density on the absolute array of DCT coefficients between the original JPEG images and the calibrated versions. To discriminate YASS steganograms from covers, the candidate blocks that are possibly used for embedding and the non-candidate block neighbors that are impossibly used for information hiding are identified first. The difference of the neighboring joint density between candidate blocks and the non-candidate neighbors is obtained. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and logistic regression classifiers are employed for classification. Experimental results show that our approach is very promising when detecting DCT-embedding based adaptive steganography.

High-resolution data was used to investigate changes in Shanghai\u2019s urban core. The images were co-registered and mosaicked. Tasseled Cap transformations and texture features were used to increase class separabilities prior to pixel-based Random Forest and SVM classifications. Urban land cover in Shanghai and Beijing were derived through object-based SVM classification in KTH-SEG. After post-classification refinements, urbanization indices, Ecosystem Services and Landscape Metrics were used to quantify and characterize environmental impact. Urban growth was observed in all studies. China's urban agglomerations showed most prominent urbanization trends. Stockholm\u2019s urban extent increased only little with minor environmental implications. On a regional/metropolitan scale, urban expansion progressed predominately at the expense of agriculture. Investigating urbanization patterns at higher detail revealed trends that counteracted negative urbanization effects in Shanghai's core and Beijing's urban-rural fringe. Beijing's growth resulted in Ecosystem Services losses through landscape structural changes, i.e. service area decreases, edge contamination or fragmentation. Methodological frameworks to characterize urbanization trends at different scales based on remotely sensed data were developed. For detailed urban analyses high-resolution data are recommended whereas medium-resolution data at metropolitan/regional scales is suggested. The Ecosystem Service concept was extended with Landscape Metrics to create a more differentiated picture of urbanization effects.\u200b", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2552642943", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["165048117"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132427808"}

We adapted some automatic recognition methods and conducted experiments on the manually denoised dataset. The aim of this paper is to extend that earlier research to work on noising data. To this end, we face two main issues. Firstly, the current pre-built dataset is still small which is usually a main drawback for deep learning based methods. Therefore, some data augmentation techniques will be evaluated and investigated to increase the number and variation of samples in the dataset. Second, even with the augmented dataset, the fact of training a deep model from scratch could be very long and sometimes cannot meet a good local minimum. Therefore, we use a simple transfer learning procedure which inherits knowledge from similar or of the same family language.

Better classifiers where expert variables will not be necessary may be identified or developed. ::: For the performance comparison, in parallel to Deep Learning Neural Network, we use other ML methods: Boosted Trees, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine.

Combined Heat and Power (CHP) processes are a proper example of this kind of complex industrial processes. In this work, an optimized model of a steam turbine of a real CHP process using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is proposed.

The key to this representation method is that the embedding vector of a node should preserve its properties in the graph as much as possible. Most traditional network embedding algorithms only consider the local neighborhood as the context to build the node representation and fail to capture the important hierarchical clustering property ubiquitous in real-world graphs. To solve this problem, we propose ACE, a novel network embedding method, to preserve the features of hierarchical clustering structures. ACE works by using an ant colony-based graph coarsening algorithm to group the nodes according to their relationship to achieve a multi-level clustering pyramid of the input graph. Then, we generate the embedding vectors from multiple layers of the graph pyramid and blend these multi-level vectors into the final representation of nodes based on the PCA dimension reduction algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACE over state-of-the-art network embedding algorithms on the node classification tasks in several real-world graph datasets. The experiments show that ACE is easy to be integrated with other network embedding algorithms, such as DeepWalk, Line, node2vec, and SDNE, to significantly improve their performance by up to 22% on Macro F1.

Unlike existing GANs, which employ a predefined adversarial objective function alternately training a generator and a discriminator, we evolve a population of generators to play the adversarial game with the discriminator. Different adversarial training objectives are employed as mutation operations and each individual (i.e., generator candidature) are updated based on these mutations. Then, we devise an evaluation mechanism to measure the quality and diversity of generated samples, such that only well-performing generator(s) are preserved and used for further training. In this way, E-GAN overcomes the limitations of an individual adversarial training objective and always preserves the well-performing offspring, contributing to progress in, and the success of GANs.

As an extended version of the binary ECOC, the ternary $(\\{0,\\ *,\\ 1\\})$ ECOC have also been discussed, where ternary classifiers classify data into positive examples when the element is 1, into negative examples when the element is 0, and no classification when the element is $*$. In this paper, we discuss the ternary ECOC system from the view point of the system evaluation model based on rate-distortion function. First, we discuss a table of M code words with length N which is given by a ternary matrix W of M rows and N columns.

In particular, the aim of this work is to establish an accurate machine representation of the Vulnerable Road Users (VRU, e.g. pedestrians, cyclists) by using image-based cues to support context-aware automated driving. A robust detection of the VRU is achieved by applying efficient stereo-based proposals within region-based Convolutional Neural Networks. Various network and proposal configurations are compared on a newly introduced dataset focusing on the challenging detection of cyclists in urban areas. A pixel-wise segmentation of the detected VRU facilitates higher-level, semantic scene analysis (e.g. pose estimation, activity analysis). Accurate object segmentations are gained by combining statistical shape models with multiple visual data cues within an iterative framework using a Conditional Random Field formulation. Head and body part locations and orientations are jointly estimated from a set of orientation-specific detector responses. The applied Dynamic Bayesian Network model accounts for spatial and temporal anatomical constraints resulting in stable part localization and orientation estimates. The inferred orientations are used to anticipate the behavior of the VRU by modeling situational awareness within a context-based Switching Linear Dynamic System.

Although many local livestock breeds are \u201cat risk\u201d on the basis of the number of purebred breeding females in a breed registry, there is often also a reservoir of unregistered animals that may belong to the same breed. However, due to the missing pedigree it is not possible for breed societies or herd books to include those animals in their breeding program for purebred animals. A genetic test was developed to unequivocally determine the breed origin of cattle without pedigree data. Such a test will open up the possibility to incorporate animals without pedigree data in the breed registry that turn out to be purebred based on the test results. In this study we developed and validated such a test. Genotype data (50k SNP array) were used to compose reference populations for six local Dutch cattle breeds. The combination Principal Component Analysis and Random Forest was used to perform SNP selection. A total of 133 informative SNPs were selected to determine breed composition of individual animals. Overall, 82.0% of the animals in the test population are correctly assigned to the breed in question.

To enable knowledge discovery from such networked data, network representation learning (NRL) aims to learn vector representations for network nodes, such that off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms can be directly applied. To date, existing NRL methods either primarily focus on network structure or simply combine node content and topology for learning. We argue that in information networks, information is mainly originated from three sources: (1) homophily, (2) topology structure, and (3) node content. Homophily states social phenomenon where individuals sharing similar attributes (content) tend to be directly connected through local relational ties, while topology structure emphasizes more on global connections. To ensure effective network representation learning, we propose to augment three information sources into one learning objective function, so that the interplay roles between three parties are enforced by requiring the learned network representations (1) being consistent with node content and topology structure, and also (2) following the social homophily constraints in the learned space. Experiments on multi-class node classification demonstrate that the representations learned by the proposed method consistently outperform state-of-the-art NRL methods, especially for very sparsely labeled networks.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2016.0072", "venue": "2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "journal": "2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2585247128", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3051291", "8399404", "62016134", "4937576", "207372751", "2341021", "12761051", "207173395", "16447573", "17341970", "2452205", "1536455", "17572432", "355820", "207176497", "3264198", "138996", "1326925", "3116168"], "inbound_citations": ["57362081", "49655016", "90260278", "195346658", "51940456", "58004726", "53116443", "23674572", "3714415", "3689901", "53746051", "196199434", "202541326", "2409634", "202888816", "59525833", "208158334", "55845365", "202541524", "209862256", "3610386", "1479507", "22049936", "52984663", "199512352", "129946442", "58004685", "53749224", "7052799", "148574582", "28464262", "28112498", "210715216", "50776071", "53447012", "145917304", "198927740", "13999578", "201645182"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6857482"}

Therefore, the method which can automatically identify workload is required in these environments. In this paper, we propose PCA-SVM workload classifier for identifying DBMS workloads automatically. For achieving this, we collect workload data according to performance ratio while changing the resource parameters. We reduce the dimension of the feature vectors existing in the workload data by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and classify the workload by one-against-all approach of multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM). We experimentally select an optimal PCA-SVM workload classifier by adjusting kernel parameters for each kernel and error-tolerance threshold, C. Experimental results show that the proposed PCA-SVM workload classifier reduces dimension of the feature vector by a factor of 2/5, and its accuracy is about 7% higher than other classifiers.

However, there is a lack of methods that can reliably detect such interactions, especially for quantitative traits. Random Forest was previously recognized as a powerful tool to identify the genetic variants that regulate trait variation, mainly due to its ability to take epistasis into account. However, although it can account for interactions, it does not specifically detect them. Therefore, we propose three approaches that extract interactions from a Random Forest by testing for specific signatures that arise from interactions, which we termed \u2019paired selection frequency\u2019, \u2019split asymmetry\u2019, and \u2019selection asymmetry\u2019. Since they complement each other for different epistasis types, an ensemble method that combines the three approaches was also created. We evaluated our approaches on multiple simulated scenarios and two different real datasets from different Saccharomyces cerevisiae crosses. We compared them to the commonly used exhaustive pair-wise linear model approach, as well as several two-stage approaches, where loci are pre-selected prior to interaction testing. The Random Forest-based methods presented here generally outperformed the other methods at identifying meaningful genetic interactions both in simulated and real data. Further examination of the results for the simulated and real datasets established how interactions are extracted from the Random Forest, and explained the performance differences between the methods. Thus, the approaches presented here extend the applicability of Random Forest for the genetic mapping of biological traits. Author summary The genetic mechanisms underlying biological traits are often complex, involving the effects of multiple genetic variants. Interactions between these variants, also called epistasis, are also common. The machine learning algorithm Random Forest can be used to study genotype-phenotype relationships, by using genetic variants to predict the phenotype. One of Random Forest\u2019s strengths is its ability to implicitly model interactions. However, Random Forest does not give any information about which predictors specifically interact, i.e. which variants are in epistasis. Here, we developed three approaches that identify interactions in a Random Forest. We demonstrated their ability to detect genetic interactions using simulations and real data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our Random Forest-based methods generally outperformed several other commonly used approaches at detecting epistasis. This study contributes to the long-standing problem of extracting information about the underlying model from a Random Forest. Since Random Forest has many applications outside of genetic association, this work represents a valuable contribution to not only genotype-phenotype mapping research, but also other scientific applications where interactions between predictors in a Random Forest might be of interest.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/353193", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2809551314", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["85852302", "358630", "13926372", "2890707", "1431889", "15020800", "12064878", "2378574", "11128159", "5686200", "6367179", "1944770", "9951318", "661151", "15503502", "83904805", "12516789", "17759402", "5922358", "13658302", "6117989", "4304462", "34913251", "2468472", "5507142", "5555155", "12416799", "21029222", "89141", "12715698", "6532142", "18957897", "119539", "6568475", "14266453", "215676253", "9293695", "6608490", "15711501", "9679219", "26026616", "13498219", "11343012", "2040675", "16065340", "12662304", "2332329", "7848552", "2585218", "7506017", "7271202", "12092013", "12140952", "11714483", "84771", "2254643"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:89987070"}

We show how a region-based geometric model is coupled with conditional random fields (CRF) in a simple graphical model, such that the model evolution is driven by a dynamically updated probability field. We define the model shape with the signed distance function, while we formulate the internal energy with a C(1) continuity constraint, a shape prior, and a term that forces the zero level of the shape function towards a connected form. The latter can be seen as a term that forces different closed curves on the image plane to merge, and, therefore, our model inherently carries the property of merging regions. We calculate the image likelihood that drives the evolution using a collaborative formulation of conditional random fields (CoCRF), which is updated during the evolution in an online learning manner. The CoCRF infers class posteriors to regions with feature ambiguities by assessing the joint appearance of neighboring sites, and using the classification confidence to regulate the inference. The novelties of our approach are (i) the tight coupling of deformable models with classification, combining the estimation of smooth region boundaries with the robustness of the probabilistic region classification, (ii) the handling of feature variations, by updating the region statistics in an online learning manner, and (iii) the improvement of the region classification using our CoCRF.

This has been reported to be the primary transport route for contaminants on sloping fields and hillslopes. Generally, contaminants are transported faster and in larger amounts with runoff, and much slower and in smaller amounts with infiltration. Runoff transports are strongly affected by surface topography, soil properties, vegetation, and weather. The risk of transport is also highly dependent on the contaminant load at the soil surface, interactions with soil particles, and transformations. An understanding of and the ability to predict processes that influence the transport and fate of contaminants in runoff water are therefore needed to assess and mitigate risks of contamination of surface water supplies on human health.Physically-based, spatially-distributed models have the potential to be an efficient tool to examine and optimize the removal of contaminants from agricultural runoff through land-use changes and best management practices. In this research, the existing subsurface version of HYDRUS-1D was adapted to simulate uniform or physical nonequilibrium flow and reactive solute transport processes during runoff at the soil surface. The numerical results obtained by the new model produced an excellent agreement with an analytical solution for the kinematic wave equation. Additional model tests further demonstrated the applicability of the adapted model to simulate the transport and fate of many different solutes (non-adsorbing tracers, nutrients, pesticides, microbes, and sediments) that undergo equilibrium and/or kinetic sorption and desorption, and first- or zero-order reactions.Along with PBMs, data-driven models are becoming increasingly popular for describing the behavior of hydrological and water resources systems since these models can be used to complement or even replace physically based-models when there is a lack of required data. Here we propose a new data-driven model as an alternative to a physically-based overland flow and transport model. Several machine learning techniques including Linear Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbor regression (kNN), Support Vector Machine with linear (SVM-L) and non-linear (SVM-NL) kernels, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) (Neural Networks with multiple hidden layers) were explored to find input - output functional relations. The results indicated that the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model with two hidden layers performed the best among selected data-driven models. This DNN model accurately predicted runoff water quantity over a wide range in parameters. It also predicted well runoff water quality for near-equilibrium solute transport over a wide range in parameters.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2905735504", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135039290"}

First results show that the addition of Haralick parameters to intensity channel may improve significantly the accuracy of the classification results. However, their performance for classification discrimination strongly depends on the size of the neighborhood from which they are estimated. Preliminary analysis of variograms allows optimizing the choice of the neighborhood size.

The salient feature of this proposal is a novel neurofuzzy self-tuning scheme aimed at tuning the dissipation rate gain (DRG) so as to enforce dissipativity in closed-loop, rather than the standard scheme of tuning the feedback control gains, or the control structure, which in our case stands for a simple constant feedback gain orthogonalized PID + I f controller. In fact, in virtue of such orthogonalization, it emerges a simple and low cost parallel structure of the neuro-fuzzy network that targets solely the DRG so as to drive error dynamics to zero with exponential rate, without any knowledge of robot dynamics or carrying out any approximation of inverse dynamics.

The dependencies among activity type, activity sequence and socio-demographic data are captured by employing hidden Markov models. In order to learn model parameters, we use sequential multinomial logit models (MNL) and multiclass Support Vector Machines (K-SVM) with two different dependency structures. In the first dependency structure, it is assumed that type of activity at time \u2018t\u2019 depends on the last previous activity and socio-demographic data, whereas in the second structure we assume that activity selection at time \u2018t\u2019 depends on all of the individual\u2019s previous activity types on the same day and socio-demographic characteristics.

The proposed method copes with the usual problems of the symbolic association rule extraction method that are computation time and rule selection. Introduction Symbolic association rule extraction models [1] suffer of very serious limitations. Rule generation is a highly timeconsuming process that generates a huge number of rules, including a large ratio of redundant rules. Hence, this prohibits any kind of rule computation and selection as soon as data are numerous and they are represented by very high-dimensional description space. This latter situation is very often encountered with documentary data. In this paper we propose a new approach for knowledge extraction that consists in using a MultiGAS model as a front-end for unsupervised extraction of association rules. In our approach we exploit both the generalization and the intercommunication mechanisms of the model. We also make use of our original recall and precision measures that derive from the Galois lattice theory and from Information Retrieval (IR) domains. Basic principles The MultiGAS model is a neural network model that represents a viewpoint-oriented extension of the Neural Gas model. Its main principle is to be constituted by several gases that have been generated from the same data. Each gas is itself issued from a specific data description subspace (i.e. viewpoint). The relation between gases is established through the use of two main mechanisms: the inter-gas communication mechanism and the generalization mechanism. A detailed description of the model is given in [2]. Copyright \u00a9 2007, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. The classical evaluation measures for the quality of classification are based on the intra-class inertia and the inter-class inertia (see [3]). These measures are often strongly biased because they depend both on the preprocessing and on the classification methods. Therefore, we have proposed to derive from the Galois lattice and Information Retrieval (IR) domains two new quality measures, Recall and Precision. The Precision and Recall measures are based on the properties of class members [3]. The Precision criterion measures in which proportion the content of the classes generated by a classification method is homogeneous. The greater the Precision, the nearer the intensions of the data belonging to the same classes will be one with respect to the other, and consequently, the more homogenous will be the classes. In a complementary way, the Recall criterion measures the exhaustiveness of the content of said classes, evaluating to what extent single properties are associated with single classes. The Recall criterion should be considered as a specific application of the statistical concept of sensitivity (i.e. true positive rate) to class properties. The Recall (Rec) and Precision (Prec) measures for a given property p of the class c are expressed as:", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "FLAIRS Conference", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "20530366", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["36095119", "14369895", "15197420", "57881244"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1451737"}

The HAPs characterize the marginal local distribution of attribute filter responses to model the texture information. This is achieved based on a two steps algorithm. In the first step the standard attribute profiles (AP) are built through sequential application of attribute filters to the considered image. In the second step a local histogram is initially computed for each sample of each image in the APs. Then the local histograms of the same pixel locations in the APs are concatenated. Accordingly, each sample is characterized by a texture descriptor whose components model local distributions of the filter responses.

In order to overcome its shortage, an improved interpolation called support vector machine-Kriging interpolation (SVM-Kriging) was proposed in this paper. The SVM-Kriging uses least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) to fit the variogram, which neednpsilat select the basic variogram model and can directly get the optimal variogram of real interpolated field by using SVM to fit the variogram curve automatically. Based on GODAS data, by using the proposed SVM-Kriging and the general Kriging based on other traditional variogram models, the interpolation test was carried out and the interpolated results were analyzed contrastively. The test show that the variogram of SVM-Kriging can avoid the subjectivity of selecting the type of variogram models and the SVM-Kriging is better than the general Kriging based on other variogram model as a whole.

In this paper, we consider the domain adaptation problem in image emotion recognition.

We develop a novel adversarial model for emotion distribution learning, termed EmotionGAN, which alternately optimizes the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) loss, semantic consistency loss, and regression loss. The EmotionGAN model can adapt source domain images such that they appear as if they were drawn from the target domain, while preserving the annotation information.

However, training SVM requires large memory and long cpu time when training set is large. One way to circumvent this computational burden is to select some of training patterns in advance which contain most information given to learning. One of the merits of SVM theory distinguishable from other learning algorithms is that it is clear that which patterns are of importance to training. Those are called support vectors (SVs), distributed near the decision boundary, and fully and succinctly define the classification task at hand. Furthermore, on the same training set, the SVMs trained with different kernel functions, i.e., RBF, polynomial, and sigmoid, have selected almost identical subset as support vectors. Therefore, it is worth finding such would-be support vectors prior to SVM training. In the thesis, we propose neighborhood property based pattern selection algorithm (NPPS) which selects the patterns near the decision boundary based on the neighborhood properties. We utilizes k nearest neighbors to look around the pattern\u2019s periphery. The first neighborhood property is that \u201ca pattern located near the decision boundary tends to have more heterogeneous neighbors in their class-membership.\u201d The second neighborhood property dictates that \u201can overlap or a noisy pattern tends to belong to a different class from its neighbors.\u201d The first one is used for identifying those patterns located near the decision boundary. The second one is used for removing the patterns located on the wrong side of the decision boundary. These properties are first implemented as a naive form with time complexity O(M) where M is the number of given training patterns. Then, to accelerate the pattern selection procedure we utilize another property.

This study proposed a hybrid geostatistical method of extreme learning machine-ordinary kriging (ELMOK), to predict the spatial variability of the SOM content. To assess the feasibility of ELMOK, a case study was conducted in a regional scale study area in Shaanxi Province, China. A total of 472 topsoil (0\u201320 cm) samples were collected. A total of 14 auxiliary variables (predictors) were obtained from remote sensing data and environmental factors. The proposed method was compared with the ability of traditional geostatistical methods such as simple kriging (SK) and ordinary kriging (OK), in addition to hybrid geostatistical methods such as regression-ordinary kriging (ROK) and artificial neural network-ordinary kriging (ANNOK). The results showed that the extreme learning machines (ELM) model used principal components (PCs) as input variables, and performed better than both multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Compared with geostatistical and hybrid geostatistical prediction methods of SOM spatial distribution, the ELMOK model had the highest coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.671) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD = 2.05), as well as the lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 1.402 g kg\u22121). In conclusion, the application of remote sensing imagery and environmental factors has a deeper driven significance of a non-linear and multi-dimensional hierarchy relationship for explaining the spatial variability of SOM, tracing local carbon sink and high quality SOM maps.

This paper introduces novel data-driven predictive models based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture for temperature and wind speed prediction in weather data. In particular, the proposed deep learning framework employs different upgrading versions of the convolutional neural networks i.e. 1d-, 2d- and 3d-CNN. The introduced models exploit the spatio-temporal multivariate weather data for learning shared representations using historical data and forecasting weather elements for a number of user defined weather stations simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion. The embedded feature learning component of the models as well as coupling the learned features of different input layers have shown to have a significant impact on the prediction task. The proposed models show promising results compared to the classical neural networks architecture used for modeling nonlinear systems. Two experimental setups have been considered based on a dataset collected from the Weather Underground website at six stations located in Netherlands and Belgium as well as a larger dataset with higher temporal resolution from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) at five stations located in Denmark. First, we focus on simultaneously predicting the temperature of two main stations of Amsterdam and Brussels for 1\u201310 days ahead. The second experiment concerns wind speed prediction at three weather stations located in Denmark for 6 and 12 h ahead.

In this case the metric is said to be inconsistent. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel metric learning framework known as consistent distance metric learning (CDML), which solves the problem under covariate shift situations. We theoretically analyze the conditions when the metrics learned under covariate shift are consistent. Based on the analysis, a convex optimization problem is proposed to deal with the CDML problem.

We introduce a CRF based scene labeling model that incorporates both local features and features aggregated over the whole image or large sections of it. Secondly, traditional CRF learning requires fully labeled datasets which can be costly and troublesome to produce. We introduce a method for learning CRFs from datasets with many unlabeled nodes by marginalizing out the unknown labels so that the log-likelihood of the known ones can be maximized by gradient ascent. Loopy Belief Propagation is used to approximate the marginals needed for the gradient and log-likelihood calculations and the Bethe free-energy approximation to the log-likelihood is monitored to control the step size.

In this study, a novel method called iDNA-KACC is presented, which combines the support vector machine (SVM) and the auto-cross covariance transformation. The protein sequences are first converted into profile-based protein representation, and then converted into a series of fixed-length vectors by the auto-cross covariance transformation with Kmer composition. The sequence order effect can be effectively captured by this scheme. These vectors are then fed into support vector machine (SVM) to discriminate the DNA-binding proteins from the non-DNA-binding ones. iDNA-KACC achieves an overall accuracy of 75.16% and Matthew correlation coefficient of 0.5 by a rigorous jackknife test. Its performance is further improved by employing an ensemble learning approach, and the improved predictor is called iDNA-KACC-EL.

We propose a novel framework to create such GRNs, based on Conditional Inference Forests (CIFs) as proposed by Strobl et al.

We show on synthetic microarray data that taking the original implementation of CIFs with conditional permutation scheme (CIFcond) may lead to improved performance compared to Breiman's implementation of Random Forests (RF). Among all newly introduced CIF-based methods and five network scenarios obtained from the DREAM4 challenge, CIFcond performed best. Networks derived from well-tuned CIFs, obtained by simply averaging P-values over tree ensembles (CIFmean) are particularly attractive, because they combine adequate performance with computational efficiency. Moreover, thresholds for variable selection are based on significance levels for P-values and, hence, do not need to be tuned. From a practical point of view, our extensive simulations show the potential advantages of CIFmean-based methods. Although more work is needed to improve on speed, especially when fully exploiting the advantages of CITs in the context of heterogeneous and correlated data, we have shown that CIF methodology can be flexibly inserted in a framework to infer biological interactions.

This study showed that the methodology used here brought prediction levels similar to other approaches, but it was applied to several hosts. It was possible to demonstrate in bipartite graphs the importance of viral proteins associated with immune escape mechanisms or virus transmission by vectors based on the number of interactions performed and indicate possibilities of malformation in the nervous system, especially in the embryonic phase, in other species besides H. sapiens.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2940575320", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:150025124"}

The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system leads to improvement in performance of emotion recognition and performs significantly better than the recent state-of-the-art schemes adopting fine-tuning/pre-trained approaches.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1805.09946", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICPR.2018.8545411", "venue": "2018 24th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)", "journal": "2018 24th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2803891126,2963670216,2902522261,2963999921,2952645480", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9472070", "20220468", "14824812", "206591220", "17233536", "626923", "10075571", "4728226", "3461877", "53081362", "12359230", "28708160", "15350923", "5093104", "5160005", "35249701", "9936656", "14495302", "2600778", "20854023", "18268744", "16852518", "42281583", "14860163", "206592484", "206593880", "1023605", "12670695", "206594692", "6447277", "14124313"], "inbound_citations": ["209852978", "214641374"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44066520"}

This error can be solved by using multilayer scintillation detector (phoswish detector) where each layer has a different decay constant. Each phoswish detector is optically coupled to a single PMT. Hence, by applying pulse shape discrimination (PSD) methods to identify the scintillated layer, the parallax error can be reduced. This paper proposes a PSD method relied on a Fractional Discrete Cosine Transform (FrDCT) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed method can be used to differentiate between two arbitrary types of scintillation pulses where each type has a different decay constant. For demonstration of its performance, the proposed FrDCT-based method is applied to a data set of scintillation pulses of LSO and LuYAP crystals. Furthermore, FrDCT with different factors as well as different kernels of SVM; such as Linear, Quadratic, and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels, are used to study their effects on the discrimination efficiency. The highest achieved efficiency is equal to 95.9% for the 0.9 factor of FrDCT using a quadratic kernel SVM. On the other hand, the linear kernel consumes the lowest execution time at the expense of slightly reducing the discrimination efficiency.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1088/1748-0221/14/06/p06017", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Instrumentation", "mag_id": "2950119370", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197501573"}

In order to make full use of the cross-modal data, we need to establish a common semantic representation to achieve effective measurement and comparison of different modal data. However, due to the heterogeneous distributions of cross-modal data, there exists a semantic gap between them. Although some deep neural network (DNN) based methods have been proposed to deal with this problem, there still exist several challenges: the qualities of the modality-specific features, the structure of the DNN, and the components of the loss function. In this paper, for representing cross-modal data in IoV, we propose a common semantic representation method based on object attention and adversarial learning (OAAL). To acquire high-quality modality-specific feature, in OAAL, we design an object attention mechanism, which links the cross-modal features effectively. To further alleviate the heterogeneous semantic gap, we construct a cross-modal generative adversarial network, which contains two parts: a generative model and a discriminative model. Besides, we also design a comprehensive loss function for the generative model to produce high-quality features. With a minimax game between the two models, we can construct a shared semantic space and generate the unified representations for cross-modal data. Finally, we apply our OAAL on retrieval task, and the results of the experiments have verified its effectiveness.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TVT.2018.2890405", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2907233095", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["57966281", "51615073", "21666363", "32449357", "14634330", "202473", "2864373", "207216960", "352650", "21682855", "21690797", "21889425", "1780254", "49557311", "1033682", "50777270", "6704804", "8355505", "1930231", "61556494", "4422720", "54561216", "19214156", "1998416", "1918428", "22504814", "6774239", "206594692", "206770307", "22219686", "686835", "4616218", "14932020", "5583509", "14113767"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69944815"}

In pursuit of this objective, we introduce the General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark (GLUE), a tool for evaluating and analyzing the performance of models across a diverse range of existing NLU tasks. GLUE is model-agnostic, but it incentivizes sharing knowledge across tasks because certain tasks have very limited training data. We further provide a hand-crafted diagnostic test suite that enables detailed linguistic analysis of NLU models. We evaluate baselines based on current methods for multi-task and transfer learning and find that they do not immediately give substantial improvements over the aggregate performance of training a

Digital maps offer reliable information that can be used in spatial planning programs. Several broad types of data mining approaches through Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) have been tested. The usual approach is to select a model that produces the best validation statistics. However, instead of choosing the best model, it is possible to combine all models realizing their strengths and weaknesses. We applied seven different techniques for the prediction of soil classes based on 194 sites located in Isfahan region. The mapping exercise aims to produce a soil class map that can be used for better understanding and management of soil resources. The models used in this study include Multinomial Logistic Regression (MnLR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Bayesian Networks (BN), and Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression (SMnLR). Two ensemble models based on majority votes (Ensemble.1) and MnLR (Ensemble.2) were implemented for integrating the optimal aspects of the individual techniques. The overall accuracy (OA), Cohen's kappa coefficient index (\u03ba) and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated based on 10-fold-cross validation with 100 repeats at four soil taxonomic levels. The Ensemble.2 model was able to achieve larger OA, \u03ba coefficient and AUC compared to the best performing individual model (i.e., RF). Results of the ensemble model showed a decreasing trend in OA from Order (0.90) to Subgroup (0.53). This was also the case for the \u03ba statistic, which was the largest for the Order (0.66) and smallest for the Subgroup (0.43). Same decrease was observed for AUC from Order (0.81) to Subgroup (0.67). The improvement in \u03ba was substantial (43 to 60%) at all soil taxonomic levels, except the Order level. We conclude that the application of the ensemble model using the MnLR was optimal, as it provided a highly accurate prediction for all soil taxonomic levels over and above the individual models. It also used information from all models, and thus this method can be recommended for improved soil class modelling.

The assessment of coronary artery layers with OCT and early detection of coronary sequelae secondary to KD is a promising tool for preventing myocardial infarction in this population. More importantly, OCT is promising for tissue quantification of the inner vessel wall, including neo intima luminal myofibroblast proliferation, calcification, and fibrous scar deposits. The goal of this study is to classify the coronary artery layers of OCT imaging obtained from a series of KD patients.

We have identified the apex frame from a video sequence automatically. The Euclidean distance between the feature points in apex and neutral frame is determined and their difference in corresponding neutral and the apex frame is calculated to form the feature vector. The feature vectors thus formed for all the emotions and subjects are given to Random Forests and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. We have compared the accuracy obtained by the two classifiers. Our proposed method is simple, uses only two frames and yields good accuracy for BU-4DFE database.

Several computational methods have been proposed for the classification of missense SNPs to neutral and disease associated. However, existing computational approaches fail to select relevant features by choosing them arbitrary without sufficient documentation. Moreover, they are limited to the problem of missing values, imbalance between the learning datasets and most of them do not support their predictions with confidence scores. Results: To overcome these limitations, a novel ensemble computational methodology is proposed. EnsembleGASVR facilitates a twostep algorithm, which in its first step applies a novel evolutionary embedded algorithm to locate close to optimal Support Vector Regression models. In its second step these models are combined to extract a universal predictor, which is less prone to overfitting issues, systematizes the rebalancing of the learning sets and uses an internal approach for solving the missing values problem without loss of information. Confidence scores support all the predictions and the model becomes tunable by modifying the classification thresholds. An extensive study was performed for collecting the most relevant features for the problem of classifying SNPs and a superset of 88 features was constructed. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms well-known algorithms in terms of classification performance in the examined datasets. Finally, the proposed algorithmic framework was able to uncover the significant role of certain features such as the solvent accessibility feature and the top-scored predictions were further validated by linking them with disease phenotypes.

In this paper, a deep neural network is proposed for accurately forecasting PM2.5 pollution concentration based on manifold learning. Firstly, meteorological factors are specified by the manifold learning method, reducing the dimension without any expert knowledge. Secondly, a deep belief network (DBN) is developed to learn the features of the input candidates obtained by the manifold learning and the one-day ahead PM2.5 concentration.

WEBSPAM-UK2007 dataset includes 0.1 million different hosts and four kinds of feature sets: Obvious, Link, Transformed Link and Content. We use five prominent machine learning (ML) techniques (i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest) to build a ML-based classifier. To evaluate the performance of our classifier, we compute accuracy and F-1 score and perform 10-fold cross validation. We also compare graph based features with content based textual features and find that graph properties are similar or better than text properties. We achieve above 99% training accuracy for most of our machine learning models. We test our model with uk-2014 dataset with 4.7 million hosts for the graph-based feature sets and achieve accuracy in between 90-94% for most of the models.

After determining feature vectors, a modified DTW method is proposed for feature matching. Finally, for classification Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial basis function (RBF) is utilized.

The objective of this paper is to present a possible new solution for developing the spatial distribution of asbestos\u2013cement products used across the country by applying the supervised machine learning algorithm, i.e., Random Forest. Based on the results of a physical inventory taken on asbestos\u2013cement products with the use of aerial imagery, and the application of selected features, considering the socio-economic situation of Poland, i.e., population, buildings, public finance, housing economy and municipal infrastructure, wages, salaries and social security benefits, agricultural census, entities of the national economy, labor market, environment protection, area of built-up surfaces, historical belonging to annexations, and data on asbestos manufacturing plants, best Random Forest models were computed. The selection of important variables was made in the R v.3.1.0 program and supported by the Boruta algorithm. The prediction of the amount of asbestos\u2013cement products used in communes was executed in the randomForest package. An algorithm explaining 75.85% of the variance was subsequently used to prepare the prediction map of the spatial distribution of the amount of asbestos\u2013cement products used in Poland. The total amount was estimated at 710,278,645 m2 (7.8 million tons).

Two nontrivial issues are addressed in synthesizing two-character motions in competitive environment: how to reveal the embedded routines while keeping visual reality and how to build interactive models based on singly captured motions. To solve these issues, we employ a hierarchical framework: the finite state machine (FSM) controls the state transition in the higher layer, and the hybrid approach controls the action selection in the lower layer. The proposed approach contains two folds: first, a rule-based control scheme is proposed to simulate routine steps based on statistical analysis. Second, the interactive models are designed for simulating dense interactions between two players. The Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) algorithm is adopted to select attack styles and coupled with motion transition graph to determine combination blows.

Moreover, rule-based systems are inappropriate for handling uncertain knowledge. Managing and maintaining rule based systems is also very difficult task and poses many problems. Our method, using the semantic class properties of words, reduces the lexical ( word) level data sparseness problem. Neural networks are also very good in capturing the complex nature of semantic association among the words, and as a result capture the selectional restrictions.

This dissertation investigates syntactic parsing in the temporal synchrony variable binding model of symbolic computation in a connectionist network. This computational architecture solves the basic problem with previous connectionist architectures, while keeping their advantages. However, the architecture does have some limitations, which impose computational constraints on parsing in this architecture. This dissertation argues that, despite these constraints, the architecture is computationally adequate for syntactic parsing, and that these constraints make significant linguistic predictions. To make these arguments, the nature of the architecture's limitations are first characterized as a set of constraints on symbolic computation. This allows the investigation of the feasibility and implications of parsing in the architecture to be investigated at the same level of abstraction as virtually all other investigations of syntactic parsing. Then a specific parsing model is developed and implemented in the architecture. The extensive use of partial descriptions of phrase structure trees is crucial to the ability of this model to recover the syntactic structure of sentences within the constraints. Finally, this parsing model is tested on those phenomena which are of particular concern given the constraints, and on an approximately unbiased sample of sentences to check for unforeseen difficulties. The results show that this connectionist architecture is powerful enough for syntactic parsing. They also show that some linguistic phenomena are predicted by the limitations of this architecture. In particular, explanations are given for many cases of unacceptable center embedding, and for several significant constraints on long distance dependencies. These results give evidence for the cognitive significance of this computational architecture and parsing model. This work also shows how the advantages of both connectionist and symbolic techniques can be unified in natural language processing applications. By analyzing how low level biological and computational considerations influence higher level processing, this work has furthered our understanding of the nature of language and how it can be efficiently and effectively processed.", "year": 1994, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1487042649", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["15675746", "2367783", "16913782", "10294441", "14079757", "15814580", "19689538", "18735889", "17607480", "14106221", "8867443", "12072531", "14795610", "934581", "2569149"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56950383"}

The number of digital document data stored in databases is enormous, accordingly it is difficult for analysts to read all documents and classify it by hand. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the technology of automatic document classification by using computers these days. From the above needs, many classifiers with good performance have been proposed, i.e., Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) that are known as good binary classifiers. For multi-valued document classification problems, it is known that a multi-valued classifier by combining several binary classifiers has a good performance. In this study, the method to construct an efficient combination of binary classifiers based on improving Generalized Bradley-Terry (GBT) model, which has high extensibility, is focused. This model is an expansion of Bradley-Terry (BT) model. Though the BT model has a limitation on combination of classes, the GBT model enables us to utilize any binary classifier which classifies into two arbitrary subsets in the class set. Generally, when several binary classifiers learn from the training dataset, there would be the difference of accuracy between these binary classifiers, due to the existence of categories that cannot be easily classified. However, the conventional method of multi-valued classification by GBT binary classifiers does not take the accuracy of each classifier into consideration. To avoid this problem, a new way of multi-valued classification method by considering each classifier\u2019s accuracy is proposed. The purpose of this study is to construct a good multi-valued classifier by calculating the accuracy of each classifier and utilizing it as the weight.

The proposed method combines the effectiveness of a measure based on data compression concepts (Jaccard dictionary similarity), which exploits the information among EGMs, and the classification power of kernel methods. It also requires minimal EGM preprocessing and allows us to deal with EGMs of different duration. A database of 6848 EGMs extracted from a national scientific big data service for ICDs, named SCOOP platform, were used in our experiments. Performance for two classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbors or k-NN, and Support Vector Machines or SVM) were compared in two CAC scenarios using four different input spaces. Results showed that k-NN worked better than SVM when previous episodes from the same patient were available in the classifier design, and vice-versa. For the best cases, k-NN and SVM yielded accuracies near to 95% and 85%, respectively.

One of the problems we have faced in this context is the accuracy of their prediction, which has great influences on the understanding of biological meanings inferred from their results. In this sense there is the need for further research to improve the accuracy of protein-protein interaction prediction. It is known that some of conserved domains physically interact each other, and some predictive methods have been devised based on this fact.

A feature selection strategy eliminated 93% of variables, and then a subset of the 47 most essential variables was generated.

Urban fire continues to be a persistent disaster, especially with the proliferation of highly dense urban settlements. As a response, several measures were established to help mitigate the losses caused by fire including simulating the fire spread. The cellular automaton system has been widely used to simulate the complex process of fire development along with Physics-based models. A data-driven approach has been rarely employed. This paper presents the result of incorporating machine learning techniques to the existing cellular automaton based urban fire spread models. Specifically, instead of manually calculating the ignition probability of each cell in the automaton, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was used to learn the ignition probability from the historical data. After building the model, its performance was evaluated using the data collected from the four fires in Basak, Lapu-Lapu City. By using a confusion matrix to compare the actual and the predicted values, the Burned Actual \u2013 Burned Predicted relationship was derived. Results suggest that the proposed method can effectively describe the development of fire, and the model accuracy is quite good (i.e., the Burned Actual - Burned Predicted relationship ranges from 78% to 83%).

Isolating normal from malicious data traffic across networks is one regular task that is naturally affected by that randomness and diversity. We propose a robust algorithm Sample-Measure-Assess (SMA) that detects intrusion based on rules learnt from multiple samples. We adapt data obtained from a set of simulations, capturing data attributes identifiable by number of bytes, destination and source of packets, protocol and nature of data flows (normal and abnormal) as well IP addresses. A fixed sample of 82,332 observations on 27 variables was drawn from a superset of 2.54 million observations on 49 variables and multiple samples were then repeatedly extracted from the former and used to train and test multiple versions of classifiers, via the algorithm. With two class labels\u2013binary and multi-class, the dataset presents a classic example of masked and spurious groupings, making an ideal case for concept learning. The algorithm learns a model for the underlying distributions of the samples and it provides mechanics for model assessment. The settings account for our method\u2019s novelty\u2013i.e., ability to learn concept rules from highly masked to highly spurious cases while observing model robustness. A comparative analysis of Random Forests and individually grown trees show that we can circumvent the former\u2019s dependence on multicollinearity of the trees and their individual strength in the forest by proceeding from dimensional reduction to classification using individual trees. Given data of similar structure, the algorithm can order the models in terms of optimality which, means our work can contribute towards understanding the concept of normal and malicious flows across tools. The algorithm yields results that are less sensitive to violated distributional assumptions and, hence, it yields robust parameters and provides a generalisation that can be monitored and adapted to specific low levels of variability.

Performance of such task can be enhanced via transfer of helpful knowledge from related domains, which is referred to as transfer learning. In previous transfer learning works, instance transfer learning algorithms mostly focus on selecting the source domain instances similar to the target domain instances for transfer. However, the selected instances usually do not directly contribute to the learning performance in the target domain. Hypothesis transfer learning algorithms focus on the model/parameter level transfer. They treat the source hypotheses as well-trained and transfer their knowledge in terms of parameters to learn the target hypothesis. Such algorithms directly optimize the target hypothesis by the observable performance improvements. However, they fail to consider the problem that instances that contribute to the source hypotheses may be harmful for the target hypothesis, as instance transfer learning analyzed. To relieve the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel transfer learning algorithm, which follows an analogical strategy. Particularly, the proposed algorithm first learns a revised source hypothesis with only instances contributing to the target hypothesis. Then, the proposed algorithm transfers both the revised source hypothesis and the target hypothesis (only trained with a few samples) to learn an analogical hypothesis. We denote our algorithm as Analogical Transfer Learning.

Greenhouse detection using remote sensing technologies is an important research area for yield estimation, sustainable development, urban and rural planning and management. An approach was developed in this study for the detection and delineation of greenhouse areas from high resolution satellite imagery. Initially, the candidate greenhouse patches were detected using supervised classification techniques. For this purpose, Maximum Likelihood (ML), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification techniques were applied and compared. Then, sieve filter and morphological operations were performed for improving the classification results. Finally, the obtained candidate plastic and glass greenhouse areas were delineated using boundary tracing and Douglas Peucker line simplification algorithms. The proposed approach was implemented in the Kumluca district of Antalya, Turkey utilizing pan-sharpened WorldView-2 satellite imageries. Kumluca is the prominent district of Antalya with greenhouse cultivation and includes both plastic and glass greenhouses intensively. When the greenhouse classification results were analysed, it can be stated that the SVM classification provides most accurate results and RF classification follows this. The SVM classification overall accuracy was obtained as 90.28%. When the greenhouse boundary delineation results were considered, the plastic greenhouses were delineated with 92.11% accuracy, while glass greenhouses were delineated with 80.67% accuracy.

In Indian mining industry, blast designs are fundamentally based on the experience and capability of the blasting crew and its assessment is more qualitative in nature, based on conventional trial and error basis. With the change in site geology and geotechnical parameters, the blast design parameters also require alterations, which can be standardized with the development of an intelligent system such as neural network. In this paper, the concept of artificial neural network and random forest algorithm has been used for better blast designs. Over 120 blast results from an opencast coal mine have been used for prediction of burden and energy factor with blast hole diameter, bench height to stemming ratio, nature of strata and average fragment size as input parameters. Out of 120 data sets 85 data sets recorded at a surface coal mine was used to train the model and 20 for the validation. Co-efficient of determination and root mean square error was chosen as the indicators to identify the optimum neural network and random forest model. The root mean square values obtained for energy factor is 0.153 while it is 0.1947 for burden. Similarly, the RMSE values obtained using random forest tree algorithm is 0.48 for burden while 50.76 for energy factor.

In this paper we present a new research aimed at analyzing, with image processing/pattern analysis techniques, facial images for detecting objective elements of similarity between siblings. To this end, we have constructed a database of high quality pictures of pairs of siblings, shot in controlled conditions, including frontal, profile, expressionless and smiling face images.

Specifically, a Support Vector Machine and a Random Forest algorithm were implemented, having as a case study an area located in the NW of Peloponnese, Greece. Nine landslide related variables were analyzed, namely: lithology, slope, aspect, altitude, topographic wetness index, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance to rivers, and distance to faults. Furthermore, a database of 160 locations that were classified into non-landslide and landslide areas were recorded and separated into a training data set (70% of the total data) and a validation data set (30% of the total data). The validation of each model was achieved by estimating statistical evaluation measures, the receiving operating characteristic and the area under the success and prediction rate curves. The comparison of the models was based on non-parametric and linear regression analysis. In addition, multi-collinearity analysis was implemented in order to estimate the conditional independence among the variables and revealed the absence of multi-collinearity among the nine conditioning variables. From the outcomes of the performed analysis, it was revealed that the most accurate model was Random Forest, which identified correctly 97.92% of the instances during the validation phase, followed by Support Vector Machine (89.58%). The area under the prediction rate curve for the Random Forest was calculated to be 0.9831, while the Support Vector Machine model showed a slightly lower predictive performance, 0.9531. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that the two models were significantly different. A moderate evidence of linear correlation between the two models exists, at a 95% confidence level, with R 2 equal to 0.4010, indicating that 40.10% of the variability in the Support Vector Machine model can be explained by the variation in the Random Forest model.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-12-811318-9.00024-7", "venue": "Handbook of Neural Computation", "journal": "Handbook of Neural Computation", "mag_id": "2738420143", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133978882"}

The method used two configurations of the recursive least-squares (RLS) filter to remove CC artifacts from the ECG. For each filtered ECG segment over 200 shock/no-shock decision features were computed and fed into a random forest (RF) classifier to select the most discriminative 25 features. The proposed SAA is an ensemble of two RF classifiers which were trained using the 25 features derived from different filter configurations.

While studies have demonstrated different kNN imputation approaches for estimating forest biomass from remote sensing data and forest inventory plots, there is no general agreement on which approach is most appropriate for biomass estimation across large areas. In this study, we compared several imputation approaches for estimating forest biomass using Landsat time-series and inventory plot data. We evaluated 18 kNN models to impute three aboveground biomass (AGB) variables (total AGB, AGB of live trees and AGB of dead trees). These models were developed using different distance techniques (Random Forest or RF, Gradient Nearest Neighbour or GNN, and Most Similar Neighbour or MSN) and different combinations of response variables (model scenarios). Direct biomass imputation models were trained according to the biomass variables while indirect biomass imputation models were trained according to combinations of forest structure variables (e.g., basal area, stem density and stem volume of live and dead-standing trees). We also assessed the ability of our imputation method to spatially predict biomass variables across large areas in relation to a forest disturbance history over a 30-year period (1987-2016). Our results show that RF consistently outperformed MSN and GNN distance techniques across different model scenarios and biomass variables. The lowest error rates were achieved by RF-based models with generalized root mean squared difference (gRMSD, RMSE divided by the standard deviation of the observed values) ranging from 0.74 to 1.24. Whereas gRMSD associated with MSN-based and GNN-based models ranged from 0.92 to 1.36 and from 1.04 to 1.42, respectively.

We start with constructing a parametric model of pylon, based on its actual structure and the characteristics of point clouds data. In this model, a pylon is divided into three parts: pylon legs, pylon body and pylon head. The modeling approach mainly consists of four steps. Firstly, point clouds of individual pylon are detected and segmented from massive high-voltage transmission corridor point clouds automatically. Secondly, an individual pylon is divided into three relatively simple parts in order to reconstruct different parts with different strategies. Its position and direction are extracted by contour analysis of the pylon body in this stage. Thirdly, the geometric features of the pylon head are extracted, from which the head type is derived with a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier. After that, the head is constructed by seeking corresponding model from pre-build model library. Finally, the body is modeled by fitting the point cloud to planes.

However, cloud detection is particularly challenging in polar regions because of the snow and ice coverage. Collaborating with Dr. Eugene Clothiaux and Dr. Amy Braverman, we propose new algorithms to detection polar clouds using data collected by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). ::: We devise an Enhanced Linear Correlation Matching Classification (ELCMC) algorithm to improve the MISR polar cloud detection based on the multi-angle information and the ELCMC algorithm provides a 92% average accuracy rate. The accuracy is further improved when the ELCMC results are used as labels to train nonlinear classifiers such as Quadratic Discriminate Analysis (QDA) or Gaussian kernel Support Vector Machines (SVM). Combining MISR data with the hyper-spectral information provided by MODIS, we propose an algorithm to improve the polar cloud detection. The highly accurate (97%) consensus pixels are used to train QDA on all MISR and MODIS features. Then the resulting classifier provides a 94% accuracy rate, higher than both the MISR rate (88%) and the MODIS rate (90%) over \"partly cloudy\" scenes. ::: Because SVMs provide better classification results but require much more computation than QDA in the cloud detection problem, we use binning to reduce the computation of Gaussian kernel regularization methods. In regression we show that binning keeps the same minimax rates of the unbinned estimator and reduces the computation from O(n 3) to O(m3), with n as the sample size and m as the number of bins. To achieve the minimax rate in the k-th order Sobolev space, m needs to be in the order of O(kn 1/(2k+1)), which makes the computation of order O(n) for k = 1 and even less for larger k. On a particular polar scene, the SVM trained on 966 bins has a comparable test classification rate as the SVM trained on 27,179 samples, but significantly reduces the training time from 5.99 hours to 2.56 minutes.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "168575817", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126703548"}

A more nuanced characterization of the influence of different urban land uses and the determination of cumulative thresholds will further inform watershed planning and management. To this end, we investigated the utility of two machine learning algorithms (Random Forests (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT)) to model stream impairment through multimetric macroinvertebrate index known as High Gradient Macroinvertebrate Index (HGMI) in an urbanizing watershed located in north-central New Jersey, United States. These machine learning algorithms were able to explain at least 50% of the variability of stream integrity based on watershed land use/land cover. While comparable in results, RF was found to be easier to train and was somewhat more robust to model overfitting compared to BRT. Our results document the influence of increasing high-medium density (> 30% Impervious Surface cover (ISC)), low density (15\u201330% ISC) urban and transitional/barren land had in negatively affecting stream biological integrity. The thresholds generated by partial plots suggest that the stream integrity decreased abruptly when the percentage of high-medium and low density urban, and transitional/barren land went above 10%, 8%, and 2% of the watershed, respectively. Additionally, when rural residential surpassed 30% threshold, it behaved similar to low density urban towards stream integrity.

This document presents a hand biometric system oriented to mobile devices, proposing a non-intrusive, contact-less acquisition process where final users should take a picture of their hand in free-space with a mobile device without removals of rings, bracelets or watches. The main contribution of this paper is threefold: firstly, a feature extraction method is proposed, providing invariant hand measurements to previous changes; second contribution consists of providing a template creation based on hand geometric distances, requiring information from only one individual, without considering data from the rest of individuals within the database; finally, a proposal for template matching is proposed, minimizing the intra-class similarity and maximizing the inter-class likeliness. The proposed method is evaluated using three publicly available contact-less, platform-free databases. In addition, the results obtained with these databases will be compared to the results provided by two competitive pattern recognition techniques, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM) and $k$-Nearest Neighbour, often employed within the literature. Therefore, this approach provides an appropriate solution to adapt hand biometrics to mobile devices, with an accurate results and a non-intrusive acquisition procedure which increases the overall acceptance from the final user.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICHB.2011.6094312", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2086598950", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57588216"}

We hereby advance the state of the art by describing a multi-subject experiment in which sEMG is successfully used to predict simultaneous forces applied by a human subject at the fingertips, that is, when six voluntary muscle contractions (VMCs) are elicited (flexion of the little, ring, middle and index fingers, thumb rotation and thumb adduction). Using a multi-sensor setup sEMG activity of the forearm of a human subject and the forces exerted at the fingertips are measured; a Support Vector Machine is then used to associate sEMG signals and forces. Our results clearly show that sEMG can be used to predict the required forces with an error as small as 1.5% of the sensor range. Targeted positioning of the electrodes is not required. The prediction is uniformly accurate across all VMCs and all 12 subjects considered, and it is robust against subsampling.

MFO is known for its inherent capability to efficiently address multiple optimization tasks at the same time, while transferring information among such tasks to improve their convergence speed. On the other hand, the quantum leap made by Deep Q Learning (DQL) in the Machine Learning field has allowed facing Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems of unprecedented complexity. Unfortunately, complex DQL models usually find it difficult to converge to optimal policies due to the lack of exploration or sparse rewards. In order to overcome these drawbacks, pre-trained models are widely harnessed via Transfer Learning, extrapolating knowledge acquired in a source task to the target task. Besides, meta-heuristic optimization has been shown to reduce the lack of exploration of DQL models. This work proposes a MFO framework capable of simultaneously evolving several DQL models towards solving interrelated RL tasks. Specifically, our proposed framework blends together the benefits of meta-heuristic optimization, Transfer Learning and DQL to automate the process of knowledge transfer and policy learning of distributed RL agents.

Diabetes Mellitus is a disease with high mortality rate that affects more than 60% population. The mindset of this task is to analyze various machine learning techniques for binary classification concerning with illness i.e. to diagnose whether a subject is suffering from disease or not. There are in total fifteen classifiers considered and out of them five major techniques namely: ANN, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes and Ensemble are used. For achieving the desired goals the tools that were employed namely matrix laboratory (MATLAB) and WEKA 3.6.13. In Ensemble method the predictive potentials of various individual classifiers are fused together. Using Ensemble method, it increases the performance by combining the classifying ability of individual classifiers and the chances of misclassifying a particular instance are reduced significantly, this provides a greater accuracy to the overall classification process. It is the enhancing technique that does the majority voting and gives us the percolated results. The medical database analysed in this study includes a rich database of about 400 people from across a wide geographical region and ten physiological attributes. Furthermore, this diagnostic tool is examined by verifying denary cross attestation; on top of that the outcome has been confronted along the truly existing real interpretation about the cases. A GUI based diagnostic tool founded upon ensemble classifier is developed in such a manner it would be able to predict whether a patient is enduring against the disease or not when it is fed with all the 10 attributes from user through a user friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface).The development of this diagnostic tool is done using MATLAB 2013a. Out of 10 parameters that the user needs to enter as input in GUI based diagnostic tool five are numeric and the rest are nominal values. The diagnostic tool in execution is demonstrated below in Fig. 3. The main objective of this manuscript is to propose an intelligent framework that will act as a useful aid for doctors for correct and timely biopsy can be done at early stage.

As the first time in the literature, we jointly train and optimize the parameters of the LSTM architecture and the OC-SVM (or SVDD) algorithm using highly effective gradient and quadratic programming based training methods. To apply the gradient based training method, we modify the original objective criteria of the OC-SVM and SVDD algorithms, where we prove the convergence of the modified objective criteria to the original criteria.

It was regarded as a new research direction of neural network's learning and has recognized by people in China as well. The relationship between SVM based algorithms and programming based learning algorithms in neural networks is addressed in this paper. First, we will show that SVM based algorithms (Vapnik) and programming based algorithms we presented in 1999 are equivalent. That is, under the linear separability condition, both can obtain the maximal margin (optimal) solutions. In order to have the optimal solution, the computational complexity of the SVM based algorithms grows exponentially with the training sample size, since the Lagrange multiplier method is often used in the algorithms. But the latter only has polynomial complexity. Second, we show that the essence of programming based algorithms is to solve the projection of a point on some convex set. By using the above geometric intuition, an iterative algorithm, the simplex iterative algorithm, is presented. From the geometric intuition, we can also get a deeper understanding of neural network's learning (under linear separability). Then, the necessary and sufficient conditions of linear separability of training samples are obtained. Finally, we show that the following principle can be used as a new way of solving neural network's learning problem.

Although several NLP tasks related to hypernymy prediction have been extensively addressed, few methods have fully exploited the large number of hypernymy relations in Web-scale taxonomies.In this paper, we introduce the Taxonomy Enhanced Adversarial Learning (TEAL) for hypernymy prediction. We first propose an unsupervised measure U-TEAL to distinguish hypernymy with other semantic relations. It is implemented based on a word embedding projection network distantly trained over a taxonomy. To address supervised hypernymy detection tasks, the supervised model S-TEAL and its improved version, the adversarial supervised model AS-TEAL, are further presented.

The problem concerns learning a decision rule that allows to assign a pattern to a decision option on the basis of observed attributes or features. Contexts in which a classification task is fundamental include, sorting letters on the basis of machine-read postcodes, the preliminary diagnosis of a patient\u2019s disease or the fraud currency and documents detection. In the classical framework, decision options are given by the pre-defined classes and a decision rule is designed by optimizing a given loss function, for instance the misclassification rate. In some cases, the loss function should be more general. First, for some applications, like face identification or cancer diagnosis, one may favor withholding decision instead of taking a wrong decision. In such cases, the introduction of rejection options should be considered in order to ensure a higher reliability Ha (1997); Horiuchi (1998); Jrad, Grall-Maes & Beauseroy (2008); Jrad et al. (2009d). Basic rejection consists of assigning a pattern to all classes which means that no decision is taken. More advanced rejection methods enable to assign a pattern ambiguously to a subset of classes. In this class-selective rejection scheme, decision options are given by the pre-defined classes as well as by defined subsets of different combinations among these classes. In order to define a decision rule, a general loss function can be defined by costs that penalize differently the wrong decisions and the ambiguous ones. Some applications may require to control the performance of the decision rule or more specifically, the performance measured by indicators related to the decision rule. These latter could be formulated as the performance constraints. Hence, the decision problem should also take into account these constraints. A general formulation of this problem was proposed in GrallMaes & Beauseroy (2009). The decision problem is formulated as an optimization problem with constraints. It was shown that the optimal rule can be obtained by optimizing its Lagrangian dual function which consists of finding the saddle point of this Lagrangian function. This optimal theoretical rule is applicable when the probability distributions are known. However, in many applications, only amounts of training set is available. Therefore, one should infer a classifier from a more or less limited set of training examples. In the classical decision framework, referred as the classical framework, many historical strands of research can be identified: statistical, Support Vector Machines, Neural Network Bishop (2006); Guobin & Lu (2007); Hao & Lin (2007); Husband & Lin (2002); Vapnik (1998); Yang et al.

Their reliability is vital to ensure reliable and accurate information for condition based maintenance. For the gearbox, the critical machine component in the rotating machinery, the vibration signals collected by sensors are usually noisy. At the same time, the fault detection results based on the vibration signals from a single sensor may be unreliable and unstable. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an intelligent multi-sensor data fusion method using the relevance vector machine (RVM) based on an ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO-RVM) for gearboxes\u2019 fault detection. RVM is a sparse probability model based on support vector machine (SVM). RVM not only has higher detection accuracy, but also better real-time accuracy compared with SVM. The ACO algorithm is used to determine kernel parameters of RVM. Moreover, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is applied to preprocess the raw vibration signals to eliminate the influence caused by noise and other unrelated signals. The distance evaluation technique (DET) is employed to select dominant features as input of the ACO-RVM, so that the redundancy and inference in a large amount of features can be removed. Two gearboxes are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the ACO-RVM has higher fault detection accuracy than the RVM with normal the cross-validation (CV).", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4610522", "pubmed_id": "26334280", "doi": "10.3390/s150921857", "venue": "Sensors", "journal": "Sensors", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1892983833", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["14937873", "111152560", "109341581", "110224845", "109766398", "108511668", "29687932", "205432382", "207327928", "62721560", "58780761", "120771992", "62598202", "8078570", "123574761", "121070291", "7596571", "64543020", "9825046", "111161013", "207579044", "111191601", "135561", "6530745", "20515146", "109800504", "30809834", "14415122", "137297059"], "inbound_citations": ["209435795", "52212897", "11862796", "211106181", "2937124", "6995331", "215683536", "44155773", "85464139", "17583183", "208036348"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167793"}

Pooling is widely used to aggregate views in deep learning models. However, pooling disregards a lot of content information within views and the spatial relationship among the views, which limits the discriminability of learned features. To resolve this issue, 3D to Sequential Views (3D2SeqViews) is proposed to more effectively aggregate the sequential views using convolutional neural networks with a novel hierarchical attention aggregation. Specifically, the content information within each view is first encoded. Then, the encoded view content information and the sequential spatiality among the views are simultaneously aggregated by the hierarchical attention aggregation, where view-level attention and class-level attention are proposed to hierarchically weight sequential views and shape classes. View-level attention is learned to indicate how much attention is paid to each view by each shape class, which subsequently weights sequential views through a novel recursive view integration. Recursive view integration learns the semantic meaning of view sequence, which is robust to the first view position. Furthermore, class-level attention is introduced to describe how much attention is paid to each shape class, which innovatively employs the discriminative ability of the fine-tuned network. 3D2SeqViews learns more discriminative features than the state-of-the-art, which leads to the outperforming results in shape classification and retrieval under three large-scale benchmarks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30872228", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2019.2904460", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2921891839", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["12810980", "19603871", "51613778", "2407217", "10887391", "206441208", "6175076", "5548308", "1009127", "11242565", "4377681", "11170942", "3817802", "4562636", "206592833", "2782113", "6598262", "3248075", "395534", "4341709", "32907204", "8846709", "6962442", "3603485", "741188", "14124313", "2554264", "14620252", "2271164", "14543802", "5115938", "1745976", "8338993", "26324501", "3934562", "18315327", "4564025", "206594692", "3943864"], "inbound_citations": ["199552106", "213186081", "199064226", "202572639", "214713889", "211119290", "198985902", "212675638", "212747798", "201671359"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:78094669"}

{"paper_id": "124041386", "title": "Towards a Theory of Learning in High-Dimensional Spaces", "authors": [{"first": "Alon", "middle": [], "last": "Zakai", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "With advances in computing technology, it is becoming feasible to consider automated learning tasks on high-dimensional data, i.e., data with very large numbers of variables. Such datasets are challenging for learning methods because of (1) the \u2018curse of dimensionality\u2019, that learning rates may be slow in high-dimensional problems, and (2) that the computational resources needed to work on such datasets can be very large. Developing theoretical results towards understanding such problems, specifically in the areas of classification and regression, is the focus of this thesis. This thesis takes two approaches towards considering the matter of performance in high-dimensional problems. In the first approach, the motivatation is that the data may lie on a lower-dimensional subspace. Towards the goal of utilizing that assumption, this thesis includes a chapter\u2014which can be seen in a more general setting, not just a highdimensional one\u2014regarding local learning. Specifically, a localizable learning method is defined as one that, when estimating a particular point based on a training set, behaves similarly to how it would have behaved had the training set been limited to only those elements that are close to the point being estimated; call a new learning method purposefully limited to those elements a \u2018local version\u2019 of the first. This is a generalization of previous definitions of local learning which were concerned with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) and the re-weighting of cost functions to emphasize local training points. We will consider a more generally-applicable set of definitions, in the context of which it is proven that, on the one hand, not every consistent learning method is localizable; yet, on the other hand, if regularization is applied to the local version, prompting the new term \u2018approximately localizable\u2019, then in fact every consistent learning method is approximately localizable. This general learning-theoretic result guarantees that we can take a consistent learning method and localize it without ending up with a non-consistent method. In addition, it is proven that consistency is logically equivalent to the combination of two properties, approximate localizability and correctly estimating the global mean. Thus, approximate localizability can be seen as the \u2018local\u2019 aspect of consistency, since the other property is a \u2018global\u2019 one. In the second approach towards investigating the matter of high-dimensional performance, the behavior of an important existing learning method, the Support Vector Machine (SVM), is considered on high-dimensional problems. This is of interest both because of the possibility of using SVMs on high-dimensional problems, and because the \u2018kernel trick\u2019 used in SVMs implies the use of a high-dimensional space even for low-dimensional problems. We consider a specific high-dimensional setup in which the variables are i.i.d standard normal, which allows analytic investigation. Both the number of samples and the number of variables are taken to infinity. We will see that the maximal-margin hyperplane (i.e., a hard-margin SVM) will tend to have all training examples as support vectors when the number of variables is large, specifically, greater than the square of the number of samples. Motivated by these theoretical results, local learning is then applied to a particular type of high-dimensional problem, that of text categorization. By working locally, some of the problems of high-dimensionality can be reduced, since we no longer need to train on high-dimensional datasets\u2014local datasets are not only smaller, but also lowerdimensional. Experiments were conducted on the standard Reuters-21578 text categorization database. The results show that a localized SVM\u2019s performance is greater than that of the K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm (K-NN), while having significantly lower computational requirements than SVMs in certain types of problems. In addition, it is shown that \u2018local information\u2019 exists in small local training sets that is sufficient for performance close to that of global SVMs, and that that information is not fully utilized by K-NN.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2181917792", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3243015"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124041386"}

Lidar has established its position as providing accurate material for structure-based analyses but its limited availability, relatively short history, and lack of spectral information, however, are generally impeding the use of lidar data for change detection purposes. A potential solution in respect of detecting both contemporary vegetation structures and their previous trajectories is to combine lidar acquisitions with optical remote sensing data, which can substantially extend the coverage, span and spectral range needed for vegetation mapping. In this study, we tested the simultaneous use of a single low-density lidar data set, a series of Landsat satellite frames and two high-resolution orthophotos to detect vegetation succession related to grassland overgrowth, i.e. encroachment of woody plants into semi-natural grasslands. We built several alternative Random Forest models with different sets of variables and tested the applicability of respective data sources for change detection purposes, aiming at distinguishing unchanged grassland and woodland areas from overgrown grasslands. Our results show that while lidar alone provides a solid basis for indicating structural differences between grassland and woodland vegetation, and orthophoto-generated variables alone are better in detecting successional changes, their combination works considerably better than its respective parts. More specifically, a model combining all the used data sets reduces the total error from 17.0% to 11.0% and omission error of detecting overgrown grasslands from 56.9% to 31.2%, when compared to model constructed solely based on lidar data. This pinpoints the efficiency of the approach where lidar-generated structural metrics are combined with optical and multitemporal observations, providing a workable framework to identify structurally oriented and dynamically organized landscape phenomena, such as grassland overgrowth.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2017.05.016", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2623120631", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125870559"}

In the procedure of constructing graph with distance metric learning, equivalence and non-equivalence pairwise constraints are imposed for better capturing similarity of samples from different classes.

Current compiler static locality analysis has limited applicability due to limited run-time information. By instrumenting and running programs, training-based locality analysis is able to predict the locality of an application based on the size of the input data accurately; however, it is costly in terms of time and space. In this paper, we combine source-code analysis with training-based locality analysis to construct a supervised-learning model parameterized only by the source code properties. This model is the first to be able to predict the upper bound of data reuse change (locality pattern complexity) at compile time for loop nests in array-based programs without the need to instrument and run the program. The result is the ability to predict how virtual memory usage grows as a function of the input size efficiently. We have evaluated our model using array-based code as input to a variety of classification algorithms. These algorithms include Naive Bayes, Decision tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our experiments show that SVM outperforms the other classifiers with 97% precision, a 97% true positive rate and a 1% false positive rate.

The authors investigated whether this pattern is shaped by recent experience. Specifically, they tested whether the phonological coactivation of an alternative name is attenuated, when speakers consistently only use one particular name in a large number of naming episodes. In 3 picture-word interference experiments, the authors measured the phonological coactivation of basic-level alternative names during subordinate-level naming (Experiments 1 and 3) and of subordinate-level alternative names during basic-level naming (Experiment 2). They measured the coactivation of the alternative name at different points in time with distractor words that were phonologically related or unrelated to that name. If the pattern of lexical activation is shaped by previous naming episodes and the phonological coactivation of the nonproduced alternative name decreases, interference from related distractors should be reduced in the course of the experiment.

Human skin detection with suitable speed and high accuracy is very necessary and very valuable in promoting quality of detection and can give suitable features for more correct detection. In this paper, a new fuzzy method is studied to identify human skin based on YCBCR colorful model. Skin color in YCBCR space forms a continuous set. Considering histogram of continuous set in color space, suitable membership functions are considered for fuzzy system. Based on inputs of fuzzy system, decision is made about each pixel. Tests have been performed on fei database and the obtained results show accuracy of 97% on test images. Humans see each other and remember each other based on memorization of a series of features. Human mind detects and identifies different humans based on extraction of a series of features and its adaption to the surrounding environments. Face detection in images has broad applications in supervision and tracking of face and human-system interaction. Human skin detection has broad cultural and military applications. Of its applications are attention of researchers in the country to an unethical images detection system and use of this image processing branch in security and military systems in modern world (1-5). Face detection in images has broad applications in video supervision, human-system interaction and tracking. Many studies have been conducted in this case. One of the most important applications of digital image processing is face detection. Face detection has gained high popularity and importance in computer visual society. With concurrent attendance of new information technology and mass media, more effective and familiar methods are developed for human- system interactions (HSI). Human -computer interfaces which are based on facial expressions and body motions of human have been used as methods which have replaced traditional interfaces such as keyboard, mouse and displays. The expanding researches on face processing are based on the fact that information about identity, position and intention of a user about images can be extracted and consequently, the correspondent computer also can show reaction. Efforts are made to process face include face detection, face tracking, facial expressions detection, face verification and detection. To make automatic systems which analyze the information included in face images, effective and powerful face detection algorithms are required. With a separate image, goal of face detection is to determine all areas of face which include face apart from three-dimensional condition of image, its direction and luminance condition. In recent years, many activities have been performed to detect face4. Many supervisory and commercial applications have been developed in the field of these activities. Many techniques have been suggested for face detection in separate images. These methods have been classified into two more general groups based on feature and image each having its social advantages and disadvantages. Among these methods, chrominance methods and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Based methods are more common and they are more efficient than other methods. Chrominance techniques are very safe but they may result in numerous false detections. As a result, they should be combined with other methods (9-10). Support Vector Machine Based methods which are based on learning and classification algorithms usually include numerous parameters which should be adjusted and these operations are time consuming. Face detection action is a partial and negligible action for human brain while it has left hard challenges and problems for the computer to detect face. Some performed works in this case have been limited to face detection in gray-level images (5) where face has been detected in images from the opposite direction with emphasis on features of face such as eyes and corners of lip. Other works such as (5) have been limited to face detection in the image while face detection is necessary in the images which have several human faces. On the contrary, goal of this paper is to detect face in broad scope of directions to be viewed or from different perspectives with emphasis on general features of face. The feature used for face detection is skin color of the human. The first step for achieving this goal is detection of skin area in image. One of the methods which have been used in skin color detection is based on a model for skin color (4). When ycbcr is formed, it is necessary to note that skin color in color space gives a cluster and for this reason, a direct approach to neural or fuzzy networks seems suitable for skin color detection. Many studies have been conducted in this field. In some studies conducted so far, face detection is limited to gray-level images in which one can detect face by relying on location of eyes and corner of lips (5). In this paper, the goal is to detect face in all directions to be viewed with emphasis on general feature of face. The feature used for face detection is skin color of the human.

It has been tested extensively and has demonstrated excellent performance on large real-world data sets. It has been implemented in real-time versions in vehicle mounted GPR. The EHD captures the spatial distribution of the edges within a 3D GPR volume. To keep the computation simple, 2D edge operators are used, and two types of edge histograms are computed. The first one, called EHDDT, is obtained by fixing the cross-track dimension and extracting edges in the (time, down-track) B-scans. The second edge histogram, called EHDCT, is obtained by fixing the down-track dimension and extracting edges in the (time, cross-track) B-Scans. For confidence assignment, it uses either a possibilistic K-Nearest Neighbors (p-KNN) or a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In this paper, we first propose an improvement to the EHD by adding a new feature component extracted from (down-track, cross-track) C-Scans. We show that this feature can improve the probability of detection while reducing the false alarm rate. Second, we design a large-scale experiment to compare the performance of the p-KNN and SVM classifiers and investigate their risk of over-fitting the training data. We use large datasets accumulated across multiple dates and multiple test sites by a vehicle mounted mine detector (VMMD) using a GPR sensor. The data includes a diverse set of buried explosive objects consisting of varying shapes, metal content, and underground burial depths.

This study proposes an integrated pipeline methodology to measure the biomass of different tree cultivars in plantation forests with high crown density, which combines unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), hyperspectral image sensors, and data processing algorithms using machine learning.

The key problem in learning rules is to efficiently identify the optimal cut points from training data. For uncertain numerical data, we propose an optimization mechanism which merges adjacent bins that have equal classifying class distribution and prove its soundness. For the uncertain categorical data, we also propose a new method to select cut points based on possible world semantics. We then present the uRule algorithm in detail.

This is of clinical relevance to the diagnosis of osteoporosis by vertebral fracture, and to grading fractures in clinical trials. In order to locate the vertebrae we train detectors for the upper and lower vertebral endplates. Each detector uses random forest regressor voting applied to Haar-like input features. The regressors are applied at a grid of points across the image, and each tree votes for an endplate centre position. Modes in the smoothed vote image are endplate candidates, some of which are the neighbouring vertebrae of the one sought.

The captured frame from the surveillance camera is initially pre-processed using Gaussian filter to remove noise. The foreground object of interest is extracted utilizing ViBe algorithm. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm is used as the shape descriptor which derives the shape and size information of the extracted foreground object. Finally, stray dogs are classified from humans using a polynomial Support Vector Machine (SVM) of order 3. The proposed composite approach is simulated in MATLAB and OpenCV. Further it is validated with real time video feeds taken from an existing surveillance system. From the results obtained, it is found that a classification accuracy of about 96% is achieved.

This paper introduced an efficient and fast CBIR system, which is based on the combination of computationally light weighted colour and texture features viz. chromaticity moment, colour percentile, and local binary pattern. For searching, this paper proposes inverse variance based varying weighted similarity measure (low for high variance feature and high for low variance feature), which reduces the effect of redundancy by assigning the priority to each feature, and effectively retrieves relevant images. In addition, this paper also proposes query image classification and retrieval model by filtering out irrelevant class images using Random Forests (RF) classifier, which recovers the class of a query image based on distinct learning (supervised) of various decision trees. This successful ensemble classification of query images reduces the semantic gap, searching space, and enhances the retrieval performance.

In order to solve the problem of information redundancy of massive observation data in meteorological forecast, a feature selection method based on Information Value(IV) and Maximum Correlation(MC) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the observation data and its various statistical features are taken as the original feature set, and the IV of each dimension is calculated and sorted accordingly. Then, the dependence of various weather conditions on the temporal characteristics of the observed data is analyzed, and the maximum statistical correlation is calculated, so as to determine the feature dimension that needs to be retained. Finally, the feature selection is carried out from the original feature set according to the reserved dimension and feature priority. Based on the real observation data of high altitude airport, in this paper, three types of classifiers are used, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to conduct experiments of extreme weather prediction on feature sets that extracted from information value, gradient boosting tree and correlation coefficient.

However, NFV over multiple clouds has not yet attained the level of performance to be a viable replacement for traditional networks. One of the reasons is the absence of a standard based Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security (FCAPS) framework for the virtual network services. In NFV, faults and performance issues can have complex geneses within virtual resources as well as virtual networks and cannot be effectively handled by traditional rule-based systems. To tackle the above problem, we propose a fault detection and localization model based on a combination of shallow and deep learning structures. Relatively simpler detection has been effectively shown to be handled by shallow machine learning structures like Support Vector Machine (SVM). Deeper structure, i.e., the stacked autoencoder has been found to be useful for a more complex localization function where a large amount of information needs to be worked through to get to the root cause of the problem.

In contrast to the monitoring of pedestrians cattle activity tracking poses special challenges to both sensors and data analysis. Interesting states are not directly observable by a single sensor. In addition, sensors must be accepted by cattle and need to be robust enough to cope with a rough environment. In this article, we introduce the novel combination of heart rate and positioning sensors. Attached to neck and chest they are less interfering than accelerometers at the ankles. Exploiting the potential of such combined sensor system that records locomotion and non-spatial information from the heart rate sensor however is challenging. We introduce a novel two level method for the activity tracking focused on the duration and sequence of activity states. We combine Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Conditional Random Field (CRF) and extend Conditional Random fields by an explicit representation of duration. The SVM characterizes local activity states, whereas the CRF addresses sequences of local states to sequences incorporating spatial and non-spatial contextual knowledge. This combination provides a reliable and comprehensive identification of defined activity patterns, as well as their chronology and durations, suitable for the integration in an activity data base. This data base is used to extract physiological parameters and promises insights into internal states such as fitness, well-being and stress.

The objective of SVM is to find an optimal boundary -- also known as hyperplane -- which separates the samples (examples in a dataset) of different classes by a maximum margin. Usually, very few samples contribute to the definition of the boundary. However, existing parallel algorithms use the entire dataset for finding the boundary, which is sub-optimal for performance reasons. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed memory algorithm to eliminate the samples which do not contribute to the boundary definition in SVM. We propose several heuristics, which range from early (aggressive) to late (conservative) elimination of the samples, such that the overall time for generating the boundary is reduced considerably. In a few cases, a sample may be eliminated (shrunk) pre-emptively -- potentially resulting in an incorrect boundary. We propose a scalable approach to synchronize the necessary data structures such that the proposed algorithm maintains its accuracy. We consider the necessary trade-offs of single/multiple synchronization using in-depth time-space complexity analysis. We implement the proposed algorithm using MPI and compare it with libsvm -- de facto sequential SVM software -- which we enhance with OpenMP for multi-core/many-core parallelism.

End-to-end ASR systems trained using the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss do not require frame-level alignment and hence simplify model training. However, sparse and arbitrary posterior spike timings from CTC models pose a new set of challenges in posterior fusion from multiple models and knowledge distillation between CTC models. We propose a method to train a CTC model so that its spike timings are guided to align with those of a pre-trained guiding CTC model.

These methods require the effort of a domain expert, who must build specific queries and rules for interpreting the processor output.

C5.0, a decision tree generator, was used to create a rule base for a natural language understanding system. A general-purpose natural language processor using this rule base was tested on a set of 200 chest radiograph reports. When a small set of reports, classified by physicians, was used as the training set, the generated rule base performed as well as lay persons, but worse than physicians. When a larger set of reports, using ICD9 coding to classify the set, was used for training the system, the rule base performed worse than the physicians and lay persons.

Aim: To assess health effects of self-reported risk factors and PM10 estimates in a sub-sample of long-term residents. Methods: 305 Pisan subjects (mean age 64 years) living at the same address from 1991-1993 to 2011 were selected. Questionnaire information on occurrence of respiratory diseases/symptoms and risk factors was available. Mean PM10 concentrations (\u00b5g/m3, year 2011) were estimated at residential address (1-km2 resolution) using a Random Forest Machine Learning Approach (RFMLA). Data were analysed through multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was associated with increasing age (years) (OR=1.06 [95% CI: 1.03, 1.11] per unit increase [p.u.i.]), and with increasing PM10 concentrations (OR=2.19 [1.27, 4.27] p.u.i.). Chronic cough was linked to increasing PM10 concentrations (OR=2.27 [1.09, 5.99] p.u.i.) and current active smoking (OR=5.29 [1.47, 22.81] vs never smoking). Chronic phlegm was related to increasing age (OR=1.04 [1.01, 1.07] p.u.i.), current active smoking (OR=4.33 [1.44, 14.74] vs never smoking) and occupational exposure (OR=2.34 [1.09, 5.5] vs not exposed).

Most current methods concentrate on learning representations based on triple information while ignoring integrating the textual knowledge and network topology of KG. This leads to ambiguous completions. To address this problem and implement more accurate KG completion, we propose a new representation learning model, TDN model, which integratedly embeds the information of triples, text descriptions, and network structure of KG in a low-dimensional vector space. The framework of TDN is defined and the methodology of implementing TDN embedding is explored. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we evaluate TDN via the experiments of link prediction on the real-world datasets.

Run timing is a polygenic trait that shows evidence of rapid parallel evolution in some lineages, signifying a key role for this phenotype in the ecological divergence between populations. Studying the genetic basis of local adaptation in quantitative traits is often impractical in wild populations. Therefore, we used a novel approach, Random Forest, to detect markers linked to run timing across 14 populations from contrasting environments in the Columbia River and Puget Sound, USA. The approach permits detection of loci of small effect on the phenotype. Divergence between populations at these loci was then examined using both principle component analysis and FST outlier analyses, to determine whether shared genetic changes resulted in similar phenotypes across different lineages. Sequencing of 9107 RAD markers in 414 individuals identified 33 predictor loci explaining 79.2% of trait variance. Discriminant analysis of principal components of the predictors revealed both shared and unique evolutionary pathways in the trait across different lineages, characterized by minor allele frequency changes. However, genome mapping of predictor loci also identified positional overlap with two genomic outlier regions, consistent with selection on loci of large effect. Therefore, the results suggest selective sweeps on few loci and minor changes in loci that were detected by this study.

We evaluated algorithms by calculating the expected yearly ED visits among the 5% highest risk individuals. We estimated the breakeven cost per patient per year for an intervention that reduced ED visits by 10%. We estimated uncertainty via cross-validation and bootstrapping. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Bivariate analyses showed multiple potential predictors of ED use (demographics, social determinants of health, comorbidities, insurance, disease severity, and prior health care utilization). A 3-variable model (prior ED use, insurance, number of antiepileptic drugs [AEDs]) performed as well as the best machine learning algorithm at one center (N = 2730; ED visits among top 5% highest risk, 3-variable model, mean = 2.9, interquartile range [IQR] = 2.7-3.1 vs Random Forest, mean = 2.9, IQR = 2.7-3.1), and superior at the second (N = 784; mean = 2.5, IQR = 2.2-2.9 vs mean = 1.9, IQR = 1.6-2.5).

Monozygotic twins (four pairs discordant for systemic lupus erythematosus, four pairs discordant for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and two pairs discordant for juvenile dermatomyositis) were studied to minimize polymorphic gene effects. Comparisons were also made to 10 unrelated, matched controls.ResultsMultiple plasma proteins, including acute phase reactants, structural proteins, immune response proteins, coagulation and transcriptional factors, were differentially expressed similarly among the different SAID studied. Multivariate Random Forest modeling identified seven proteins whose combined altered expression levels effectively segregated affected vs. unaffected twins. Among these seven proteins, four were also identified in univariate analyses of proteomic data (syntaxin 17, \u03b1-glucosidase, paraoxonase 1, and the sixth component of complement).

Analyzing driving behaviors can help us assess driver performances, improve traffic safety, and, ultimately, promote the development of intelligent and resilient transportation systems. While some efforts have been made for analyzing driving behaviors, existing methods can be improved via representation learning by jointly exploring the peer and temporal dependencies of driving behaviors. To that end, in this paper, we develop a Peer and Temporal-Aware Representation Learning based framework (PTARL) for driving behavior analysis with GPS trajectory data. Specifically, we first detect the driving operations and states of each driver from their GPS traces. Then, we derive a sequence of multi-view driving state transition graphs from the driving state sequences, in order to characterize a driver's driving behaviors that vary over time. In addition, we develop a peer and temporal-aware representation learning method to learn a sequence of time-varying yet relational vectorized representations from the driving state transition graphs. The proposed method can simultaneously model both the graph-graph peer dependency and the current-past temporal dependency in a unified optimization framework. Also, we provide two effective solutions for the optimization problem: (i)a joint optimization solution of representation learning and prediction; and (ii) a step-by-step solution of representation learning and prediction. Besides, we explore two strategies to fuse the learned representations from multi-view transition graphs: (i) simple alignment and (ii) collective fusion. Moreover, we apply the developed framework to the two applications of quantitative transportation safety: (i) scoring of driving performances, and (ii)detection of dangerous regions.

Train support vector machine classifier is used to implement SVM with the proposed kernels to verify two properties: 1) leads to good generalization performance even in case of high-dimensional data and a small set of training patterns, 2) to solve difficult problems, which are not linearly separable. The generalized Poisson-Charlier kernels are evaluated in comparisons with the existing kernels such as: Gaussian, polynomial (POLY), and universal kernels by application to a variety of non-separable data sets with several attributes, leading to good classification accuracy in nearly all the data sets, especially those of high dimensions.

Among various methods that build survival predictive models, a class of methods combining with machine learning techniques make assumptions about hazard functions, while another class of methods directly exploit complex neural networks to learn the latent representation of hazard functions. For the traditional survival predictive models, the assumption about hazard functions restricts their performance to some extends. Similarly, the advanced survival predictive models built by complex neural networks also suffer from fairly poor interpretation in real applications. To solve these problems, in this paper, a novel survival analysis method named HitBoost is proposed to predict the probability distribution of the first hitting time (FHT). Instead of making any assumptions about the underlying stochastic process, the proposed HitBoost adopts the multi-output gradient boosting decision tree to implicitly capture the connections between the static covariate and the underlying stochastic process. Furthermore, in the process of tree boosting, the relevant statistics can be utilized to effectively measure the feature importance. The results of evaluations and case studies on benchmarks show that, in comparison to the classical methods, the proposed HitBoost is superior in prediction performance and risk discrimination.

The proposed research is to develop a RPW identification system using Support Vector Machine method. The problem is to extract image features from an image and using SVM to find out the existence of RPW in an image. Approach: Images are snapped and image processing techniques of Regional Properties and Zernike Moments are used to extract different features of an image. The obtained features are fed into the SVM based system individually as well as in combination. The database used to train and test the system includes 326 RPW and 93 other insect images. The input data from database is selected randomly and fed into the system in three steps i.e., 25, 50 and 75% while remaining database is used for testing purpose. In SVM, polynomial kernel function and Radial Basis Function are used for training. Each experiment is repeated 10 times and the average results are used for analysis. Results: The optimal results are obtained by using Radial Basis Function in SVM at lower values of sigma \u2018\u03c3\u2019 while Polynomial kernel function is not successful in returning adequate results. Further detailed analysis of results for \u2018\u03c3\u2019 value of 10 and 15 revealed that proposed system works well with large training data and with inputs obtained by Regional Properties.

Regretfully, previous research didn't thoroughly explore not only air pollutant prediction but also air quality evaluation, and relevant research work is still scarce, especially in China. Therefore, a novel air quality early-warning system composed of prediction and evaluation was developed in this study. Firstly, the advanced data preprocessing technology Improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (ICEEMDAN) combined with the powerful swarm intelligence algorithm Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the efficient artificial neural network Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) formed the prediction model. Then the predictive results were further analyzed by the method of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, which offered intuitive air quality information and corresponding measures. The proposed system was tested in the Jing-Jin-Ji region of China, a representative research area in the world, and the daily concentration data of six main air pollutants in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang for two years were used to validate the accuracy and efficiency. The results show that the prediction model is superior to other benchmark models in pollutant concentration prediction and the evaluation model is satisfactory in air quality level reporting compared with the actual status.

However, manual segmentation of the numerous scans is time consuming, tedious and error-prone. Fortunately, machine learning-based automated approaches for image segmentation tasks are becoming more common. However, poor performance of these methods can result from a lack of quantity or diversity in the data used to train the models. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated the ability to generate synthetic images, which may be useful for data augmentation purposes. Here, we propose the application of GANs to construct chorio-retinal patches from OCT images which may be used to augment data for a patch-based approach to boundary segmentation. Given the complexity of GAN training, a range of experiments are performed to optimize performance. We show that it is feasible to generate 32\u00d732 versions of such patches that are visually indistinguishable from their real variants. In the best case, the segmentation performance utilizing solely synthetic data to train the model is nearly comparable to real data on all three layer boundaries of interest.

This information can be treated as numerous URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), which can be categorized into URLs of Qaamp;As and URLs in Qaamp;As. The domain of former ones is Stack-Overflow itself, while domains of latter ones are miscellaneous, such as some personal blogs and so on. Although each Qaamp;A has been manually assigned tags, relations between URLs and tags are not clear enough. In this paper, we propose SOLinker, a method to build semantic links between various URLs and tags. Firstly, SOLinker identifies proper relations from a predefined relation set between tags and URLs, which is modeled as a text classification problem. Features are extracted from content of Qaamp;A, the URL and the tag list, and classification algorithms are Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, depending on the category of URLs. Secondly, there exists a partial tagging problem, which means for a URL in a Qaamp;A, there are only a part of tags of the Qaamp;A relating to the URL. To address this problem, we propose a semantic analysis method to analyze context of this URL and the URL itself from both implicit and explicit aspects. Then SOLinker will infer proper tags by the label propagation technique. Results show that our method is feasible and practical in constructing semantic links between tags and URLs of/in Qaamp;As.

However these methods are issues with computational complexity and accuracy of dataset. To avoid the above mentioned issues, in the proposed system, AABC-Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is proposed. This research contains modules are such as preprocessing, feature selection and classification. In preprocessing, k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is applied which is used to handle the noise data efficiently. The size of the dataset is reduced significantly. Then these features are taken into feature selection process. In this research, AABC algorithm is used for performing feature selection. AABC optimization algorithm is used to select the important and relevant features from the preprocessed data.

In a departure from previous correlations, this study proposes a hybrid surrogate intelligent model for predicting C\u03b1. The new combined model integrates a meta-heuristic particle optimization swarm (PSO) in the random forest (RF) to overcome the user experience dependence and local optimum problems. A total of 151 datasets having four parameters (liquid limit wL, plasticity index Ip, void ratio e, clay content CI) and one output variable C\u03b1 are collected from the literature. Eleven combinations of these four parameters (one with four parameters, four with three parameters and six with two parameters) are used as input variables in the RF algorithm to determine the optimal combination of variables. In this novel model, PSO is employed to determine the optimal hyper-parameters in the RF algorithm, and the fitness function in the PSO is defined as the mean prediction error for 10 cross-validation sets to enhance the robustness of the RF model. The performance of the RF model is compared specifically with the existing empirical formulae. The results indicate that the combinations IP\u2013e, CI\u2013IP\u2013e and CI\u2013wL\u2013Ip\u2013e are optimal RF models in their respective groups, recommended for predicting C\u03b1 in engineering practice.

Parametric investigation indicates that the relationships between C\u03b1 and the four input variables in the proposed RF models harmonize with the physical explanation.

Current works typically struggle with object detection and localization problems due to crowded and complex scenes. Hence, we propose a Deep Spatiotemporal Translation Network (DSTN), novel unsupervised anomaly detection and localization method based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Edge Wrapping ( $EW$ ). In training, we use only the frames of normal events in order to generate their corresponding dense optical flow as temporal features. During testing, since all the video sequences are input into the system, unknown events are considered as anomalous events due to the fact that the model knows only the normal patterns. To benefit from the information provided by both appearance and motion features, we introduce (i) a novel fusion of background removal and real optical flow frames with (ii) a concatenation of the original and background removal frames. We improve the performance of anomaly localization in the pixel-level evaluation by proposing (iii) the Edge Wrapping to reduce the noise and suppress non-related edges of abnormal objects. Our DSTN has been tested on publicly available anomaly datasets, including UCSD pedestrian, UMN, and CUHK Avenue.

For model optimization, we apply online passive aggressive optimization algorithm to solve the proposed LML framework, where the lifelong dictionary and task-specific partition are optimized alternatively and consecutively.

The aim was identify a robust gene expression signature of corticosteroid treatment for the classification of commercial samples, despite the effects of biological variation and other confounding factors. DNA-Microarray data from 5 different batches of bovine skeletal muscle samples were analyzed (146 samples). After preprocessing, expression data from animals treated with corticosteroids and controls from the different batches (89 samples) were used to train a Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifier. The optimal number of gene probes chosen by our classification framework was 73. The SVMs with linear kernel built on these 73 biomarker genes was predicted to perform on novel samples with a high classification accuracy (Matthew's correlation coefficient equal to 0.77) and an average percentage of false positive and false negative equal to 5% and 6%, respectively. Concluding, a relatively small set of genes was able to discriminate between controls and corticosteroid-treated animals, despite different breeds, animal ages, and combination of GPs. The results are extremely promising, suggesting that integrated analysis provides robust transcriptomic signatures for GP abuse.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25533795", "doi": "10.1016/j.fct.2014.12.001", "venue": "Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association", "journal": "Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2087939725", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35164765", "4573616", "35093260"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30647698"}

The proposed approach combines the geostatistical interpolation of punctual kriging, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and fuzzy logic based approaches. Images degraded with Gaussian white noise are restored by first utilizing fuzzy logic for selecting pixels that needs kriging. Three fuzzy systems are employed. Both type-I and type-II fuzzy sets in addition with neuro fuzzy classifier (NFC) have been used for the detection of noisy pixels. To avoid edge pixels, a post processing technique is used to check the edge pixel connectivity up to lag 5. If the pixel under consideration is an edge pixel, it is excluded from the fuzzy map and thus not estimated. The concept of punctual kriging is then used to estimate the intensity of a noisy pixel. ANN is employed to minimize the cost function of the kriging based pixel intensity estimation procedure. ANN, in contrast to analytical methodologies, avoids both matrix inversion failure and negative weights problems. Image restoration performance based comparison has been made against adaptive Weiner filter and existing fuzzy kriging approaches. Experimental results using 450 images are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Each solution is a distinct type of decision support system. They show three common properties: personalized health care decision support, reduction of the use of medical resources, and improvement of outcomes. The first decision support system assists individual hospital selection. This system can help a user make the best decision in terms of the combination of mortality, complication, and travel distance. Both machine learning and optimization techniques are utilized in this type of decision support system. Machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines, learn a decision function. Next, the function is transformed into an objective function and then optimization methods are used to find the values of decision variables to reach the desired outcome with the most confidence. The second decision support system assists diagnostic decisions in a sequential decision-making setting by finding the most promising tests and suggesting a diagnosis. The system can speed up the diagnostic process, reduce overuse of medical tests, save costs, and improve the accuracy of diagnosis. In this study, the system finds the test most likely to confirm a diagnosis based on the pre-test probability computed from the patient\u2019s information including symptoms and the results of previous tests. If the patient\u2019s disease post-test probability is higher than the treatment threshold, a diagnostic decision will be made, and vice versa. Otherwise, the patient needs more tests to help make a decision. The system will then recommend the next optimal test and repeat the same process. The third decision support system recommends the best lifestyle changes for an individual to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Due to the availability of the Internet, a lot of user-generated content is produced across the globe in a single day using various social media platforms. Nowadays, it has become very easy to create fake news and propagate it worldwide within a short period of time. Despite receiving significant attention in the research community, fake news detection did not improve significantly due to insufficient context-specific news data. Most of the researchers have analyzed the fake news problem as a binary classification problem, but many more prediction classes exist. In this research work, experiments have been conducted using a tree-based Ensemble Machine Learning framework (Gradient Boosting) with optimized parameters combining content and context level features for fake news detection. Recently, adaptive boosting methods for classification problems have been derived as gradient descent algorithms. This formulation justifies key elements and parameters in the methods, which are chosen to optimize a single common objective function. Experiments are conducted using a multi-class dataset (FNC) and various machine learning models are used for classification. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ensemble framework compared to existing benchmark results.

Second, using local features alone ignores the spatial\u2013temporal relationships of these features, which may decrease the classification accuracy. Finally, the distance mainly used in the clustering algorithm of the BoW model did not take the semantic context into consideration. Based on these problems, we proposed a systematic framework for recognizing realistic actions, with considering the spatial\u2013temporal relationship between the pruned local features and utilizing a new discriminate group distance to incorporate the semantic context information. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) with multiple kernels is employed to make use of both the local feature and feature group information.

Protein kinases are integral to the autophagy process, and when dysregulated or mutated cause several human diseases. Atg1, the first autophagy-related protein identified is a serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs). mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin), AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), Akt, MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and PKC (protein kinase C) are other STPKs which regulate various components/steps of autophagy, and are often deregulated in cancer. MAPK have three subfamilies \u2013 ERKs, p38, and JNKs. JNKs (c-Jun N-terminal Kinases) have three isoforms in mammals \u2013 JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3, each with distinct cellular locations and functions. JNK1 plays role in starvation induced activation of autophagy, and the context-specific role of autophagy in tumorigenesis establish JNK1 a challenging anticancer drug target. Since JNKs are closely related to other members of MAPK family (p38, MAP kinase and the ERKs), it is difficult to design JNK-selective inhibitors. Designing JNK isoform-selective inhibitors are even more challenging as the ATP-binding sites among all JNKs are highly conserved. Although limited informations are available to explore computational approaches to predict JNK1 inhibitors, it seems diificult to find literature exploring machine learning techniques to predict JNKs inhibitors. This study aims to apply machine learning to predict JNK1 inhibitors regulating autophagy in cancer using Random Forest (RF). Here, RF algorithm is used for two purposes\u2010 to select and rank the molecular descriptors calculated using PaDEL descriptor software and as clasifier. The descriptors are prioritized by calculating Variable Importance Measures (VIMs) using functions based on mean square error (IncMSE) and node purity (IncNodePurity) of RF. The classification models based on a set of 22 prioritized descriptors shows accuracy 86.36%, precision 88.27% and AUC (Area Under ROC curve) 0.8914. We conclude that machine learning-based compound classification using Random Forest is one of the ligand-based approach that can be opted for virtual screening of large compound library of JNK1 bioactives. Author Summary Out of the three isoforms of JNKs (cJun N-terminal Kinases) in human (each with distinct cellular locations and functions), JNK1 plays role in starvation induced activation of autophagy. The role of JNK1 in autophagy modulation and dual role of autophagy in tumor cells makes JNK1 a promising anticancer drug target. Since JNKs are closely related to other members of MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases) family, it is difficult to design JNK selective inhibitors. Designing JNK isoformselective inhibitors are even more challenging as the ATP binding sites among all JNKs are highly conserved. Random forest classifier usually outperforms several other machine learning algorithms for classification and prediction tasks in diverse areas of research. In this work, we have used Random Forest algorithm for two purposes: (i) calculating variable importance measures to rank and select molecular features, and (ii) predicting JNK1 inhibitors regulating autophagy in cancer. We have used paDEL calculated molecular features of JNK1 bioactivity dataset from ChEMBL database to build classification models using random forest classifier. Our results show that by optimally selecting features from top 10% based on variable importance measure the classification accuracy is high, and the classification model proposed in this study can be integrated with drug design pipeline to virtually screen compound libraries for predicting JNK1 inhibitors.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/459669", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2899203390", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["12454277", "12642358", "4594197", "35680655", "16681789", "1688614", "41706539", "35971899", "11587503", "207368098", "3772788", "23369575", "17243442", "25783135", "41450790", "206032727"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91266945"}

At first, an axis aligned bounding box is fitted around the target object point cluster, proposing a limited set of possible grasps. A Support Vector Machine is trained to take the decision of the preferred grasp via supervised Machine Learning. Such decision is based on the distribution of obstacles around the target object, inferred by sampling the OctoMap of the scene.

A critical first step in the credit granting process usually involves a careful financial analysis of the creditworthiness of the potential client.

It is thus of crucial importance to develop models that estimate the probability of corporate bankruptcy with a high degree of accuracy. Many studies focused on the use of financial ratios in linear statistical models, such as linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression. However, the obtained error rates are often high. In this paper, Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifiers, also known as kernel Fisher discriminant analysis, are applied within the Bayesian evidence framework in order to automatically infer and analyze the creditworthiness of potential corporate clients. The inferred posterior class probabilities of bankruptcy are then used to analyze the sensitivity of the classifier output with respect to the given inputs and to assist in the credit assignment decision making process.

Comparing to conventional impact-echo test, the proposed method presents several favourable properties: 1. Conventional impact-echo method mostly relies on frequency peak in echo spectrum, the proposed method characterizes rich temporal-spectral patterns in addition to the spectral peak. 2. Proposed method is performed over local area on concrete surface with integration of several consecutive echo responses, and thus produces more stable condition evaluation result comparing to point-wise impact-echo approach. 3. To cope with extracted echo feature, effective similarity metric on Grassmann manifold is employed, which favourably facilities condition-based assessment.

Instead of analyzing all 135 Android permissions, our approach applies 3-level pruning by mining the permission data to identify only significant permissions that can be effective in distinguishing benign and malicious apps. SIGPID then utilizes classification algorithms to classify different families of malware and benign apps. Our evaluation finds that only 22 out of 135 permissions are significant. We then compare the performance of our approach, using only 22 permissions, against a baseline approach that analyzes all permissions. The results indicate that when Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as the classifier, we can achieve over 90% of precision, recall, accuracy, and F-measure, which are about the same as those produced by the baseline approach while incurring the analysis times that are 4 to 32 times smaller that those of using all 135 permissions.

A minimax formulation is able to establish among a classifier, a discriminator, and a set of generators in a similar spirit with GAN. Generators create samples that are intended to come from the same distribution as the training data, whilst the discriminator determines whether samples are true data or generated by generators, and the classifier specifies which generator a sample comes from. The distinguishing feature is that internal samples are created from multiple generators, and then one of them will be randomly selected as final output similar to the mechanism of a probabilistic mixture model. We term our method Mixture GAN (MGAN). We develop theoretical analysis to prove that, at the equilibrium, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between the mixture of generators' distributions and the empirical data distribution is minimal, whilst the JSD among generators' distributions is maximal, hence effectively avoiding the mode collapse. By utilizing parameter sharing, our proposed model adds minimal computational cost to the standard GAN, and thus can also efficiently scale to large-scale datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic 2D data and natural image databases (CIFAR-10, STL-10 and ImageNet) to demonstrate the superior performance of our MGAN in achieving state-of-the-art Inception scores over latest baselines, generating diverse and appealing recognizable objects at different resolutions, and specializing in capturing different types of objects by generators.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1708.02556", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2742658863", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7201816", "9957731", "308212", "6104263", "5216145", "1033682", "17206794", "5808102", "6628106", "18268744", "207763512", "6610705", "1059659", "11758569", "2930547", "1687220", "206592484", "57832010", "15876696"], "inbound_citations": ["53409648", "4364640", "51894817", "54457410", "162168957", "52148139", "55703209", "149785168", "53716997", "212736831", "208527795", "214713733", "51877895", "204915917", "51607577", "210157209", "210839653", "53250043", "204798918"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35171213"}

Glycosylated proteins (glycoproteins) are involved in various cellular biological functions like protein folding, cell-cell interactions, cell recognition and host-pathogen interactions. A large number of eukaryotic glycoproteins also have therapeutic and potential technology applications. Therefore, characterization and analysis of glycosites (glycosylated residues) in these proteins is of great interest to biologists. In order to cater these needs a number of in silico tools have been developed over the years, however, a need to get even better prediction tools remains. Therefore, in this study we have developed a new webserver GlycoEP for more accurate prediction of N-linked, O-linked and C-linked glycosites in eukaryotic glycoproteins using two larger datasets, namely, standard and advanced datasets. In case of standard datasets no two glycosylated proteins are more similar than 40%; advanced datasets are highly non-redundant where no two glycosites' patterns (as defined in methods) have more than 60% similarity. Further, based on our results with several algorihtms developed using different machine-learning techniques, we found Support Vector Machine (SVM) as optimum tool to develop glycosite prediction models. Accordingly, using our more stringent and non-redundant advanced datasets, the SVM based models developed in this study achieved a prediction accuracy of 84.26%, 86.87% and 91.43% with corresponding MCC of 0.54, 0.20 and 0.78, for N-, O- and C-linked glycosites, respectively. The best performing models trained on advanced datasets were then implemented as a user-friendly web server GlycoEP (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/glycoep/).

However, this method still requires specialised technicians and much time and effort to make routinary fecundity studies commonly used in fish stock assessment, because the available software does not allow an automatic analysis. The automatic fecundity estimation requires both the classification of cells depending on their stage of development and the measurement of their diameters, based on those cells that are cut through the nucleous within the histological slide. Human experts seem to use colour and texture properties of the image to classify cells, i.e., colour texture analysis from the computer vision point of view. In the current work, we provide an exhaustive statistical evaluation of a very wide variety of parallel and integrative texture analysis strategies, giving a total of 126 different feature vectors. Besides, a selection of 17 classifiers, representative of the currently available classification techniques, was used to classify the cells according to the presence/absence of nucleous and their stage of development. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieves the best results for nucleous (99.0% of accuracy using colour Local Binary Patterns (LPB) feature vector, integrative strategy) and for stages of development (99.6% using First Order Statistics and grey level LPB, parallel strategy) with the species Merluccius merluccius, and similar accuracies for Trisopterus luscus.

Some existing delayed reinforcement learning techniques have shown promise in simple domains. However, a number of hurdles must be passed before they are applicable to realistic problems. This paper describes one such difficulty, the input generalization problem (whereby the system must generalize to produce similar actions in similar situations) and an implemented solution, the G algorithm. This algorithm is based on recursive splitting of the state space based on statistical measures of differences in reinforcements received. Connectionist backpropagation has previously been used for input generalization in reinforcement learning. We compare the two techniques analytically and empirically.

Comprehensive studies are needed to assess these relationships through the use of consistently collected field-based data. One approach to achieve this is to make use of preexisting forest inventory data to estimate understory vegetation height and cover from site and overstory attributes. In this study, overstory, understory, and abiotic data describing site conditions were obtained from over 6700 Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) fixed radius plots collected between 2000 and 2012 to assess how understory vegetation cover and height vary with overstory attributes and site characteristics. The focus was restricted to four common forest types including lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and grand fir (Abies grandis) found on approximately 43 million hectares in the western United States. Random Forest regression classification trees were developed for cover and height of shrub and herb understories as a function of field-measured predictor variables. Separate analyses were undertaken for the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and the Interior West (IW) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) regions. Models developed from the IW data generally performed better and the OOB (out-of-bag) percent variance explained varied from 8.08% for forb height to 39.24% for shrub height. For the PNW data, percent variance explained ranged from 13.82% for forb height to 27.4% for shrub height. Percent variance explained values were higher in all corresponding models for the IW than PNW, except for forb and grass height. Differences in model performance were smallest in the case of forb cover (27.17% vs. 26.15%) and greatest in the case of percent shrub cover (30.92% vs. 15.53%) for IW and PNW models, respectively. Cover models within each dataset performed better, on average, than their associated height models. The most influential variables for predicting understory cover and height were ones representing overstory conditions and conform to ecological expectation corroborated by many studies examining the influence of forest overstories on understory vegetation dynamics. Several variables, including aspect, slope, and stand disturbance and treatment, were not important and contrary to expectation.

PEMFC are promising source of renewable energy that can operate on low temperature and have the advantages of high power density and low pollutant emissions. However, PEMFC technology is still in the developing phase, and its large-scale industrial deployment requires increasing the life span of fuel cells and decreasing their exploitation costs. In this context, Prognostics and Health Management of fuel cells is an emerging field, which aims at identifying degradation at early stages and estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for life cycle management. Indeed, due to prognostics capability, the accurate estimates of RUL enables safe operation of the equipment and timely decisions to prolong its life span. This paper contributes data-driven prognostics of PEMFC by an ensemble of constraint based Summation Wavelet-Extreme Learning Machine (SW-ELM) algorithm to improve accuracy and robustness of long-term prognostics.

The classifiers were trained using randomly selected 3600 CSIs from an Incident Information Management System (IIMS) used by seven hospitals. The taxonomies investigated were the Generic Reference Model (GRM) and the World Health Organization (WHO) patient safety classification. The classifiers trained 13 GRM CSI classes and 9 WHO CSI classes using a bag-of-words approach. The overall taxonomies performance on the RF classifier was better than on the DT classifier. The performance achieved by the classifier applying the WHO taxonomy was better than the GRM taxonomy. Four of the five poorly performing classes in the GRM taxonomy significantly improved their performance on changing the taxonomy.

This paper analyzes whether the sentiment expressed in Twitter feeds, which discuss selected companies and their products, can indicate their stock price changes. To address this problem, an active learning approach was developed and applied to sentiment analysis of tweet streams in the stock market domain. The paper first presents a static Twitter data analysis problem, explored in order to determine the best Twitter-specific text preprocessing setting for training the Support Vector Machine (SVM) sentiment classifier. In the static setting, the Granger causality test shows that sentiments in stock-related tweets can be used as indicators of stock price movements a few days in advance, where improved results were achieved by adapting the SVM classifier to categorize Twitter posts into three sentiment categories of positive, negative and neutral (instead of positive and negative only). These findings were adopted in the development of a new stream-based active learning approach to sentiment analysis, applicable in incremental learning from continuously changing financial tweet streams. To this end, a series of experiments was conducted to determine the best querying strategy for active learning of the SVM classifier adapted to sentiment analysis of financial tweet streams.

Such invariant DS models can be used to generate trajectories of the robot that will always remain in a prescribed set. In order to achieve invariance to a set, Barrier certificates are employed. The DS is approximated using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and a parameter learning problem subject to Barrier certificates enforced at all the points in the prescribed set is solved. To solve an infinite constraint problem for enforcing Barrier Certificates at every point in a given compact set, a modified constraint is developed that is sufficient to hold the Barrier certificates in the entire set. An active sampling strategy is formulated to minimize the number of constraints in learning. Simulation results of ELM learning with and without Barrier certificates are presented which show the invariance property being preserved in the ELM learning when learning procedure involves Barrier constraints.

In particular, defining an appropriate distance metric between the person images is very important. Existing metric learning approaches used in person re-identification either learn a single measure, or ignore the positive semi-definite (PSD) of measurement matrix, at the same time, since the number of negative sample pairs largely exceeds the number of positive sample pairs, some metric learning methods are largely influenced by the sample imbalance. Considering the above issues, we propose a new adaptive local metric learning method with positive semi-definite (PSD) constraint. Unlike existing metric learning methods which learn a single distance metric, we use an approximation error bound of a smooth metric matrix function over the data manifold to learn local metrics as linear combinations of basis metrics defined on anchor points over different regions of the instance space. Besides, we develop an efficient two stage algorithm that first learns the anchor points and the linear combinations of each instance, then learns the metric matrices of the anchor points. We employ the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm which is a fast first-order optimization algorithm in the learning process of the linear combinations as well as the basis metrics of the anchor points. Our metric learning method has excellent performance. We firstly apply the proposed method on 5 UCI databases, which are widely used in machine learning, to test and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Then the proposed approach is applied for person re-identification, achieving better performance on three challenging databases (GRID, VIPeR, CUHK01) than the existing methods.

The 3-D-SRNet replaces 3-D convolutions with spatial and spectral separable 3-D convolutions, thus showing much less parameters than models that use standard 3-D convolutions. First, we pretrain a classification model with the proposed 3-D-SRNet on the source HSI data set with sufficient training samples compared with the target HSI data set. Then, the pretrained model is transferred to the target HSI data set for fine-tuning to finish the classification task. It is worth noting that the source data for pretraining can be captured by the different sensor with the target data. Compared with the conventional 3-D-ResNet, the proposed 3-D-SRNet has less parameters involving lower computation cost while achieving better classification performance.

However, using RNA-Seq datasets with many experimental conditions from diverse sources introduces batch effects and other artefacts that might obscure the real co-expression signal. Moreover, only a subset of experimental conditions is expected to be relevant for finding genes related to a particular Gene Ontology (GO) term. Therefore, we hypothesize that when the purpose is to find similar functioning genes that the co-expression of genes should not be determined on all samples but only on those samples informative for the GO term of interest. Results To address both types of effects, we developed MLC (Metric Learning for Co-expression), a fast algorithm that assigns a GO-term-specific weight to each expression sample. The goal is to obtain a weighted co-expression measure that is more suitable than the unweighted Pearson correlation for applying Guilt-By-Association-based function predictions. More specifically, if two genes are annotated with a given GO term, MLC tries to maximize their weighted co-expression, and, in addition, if one of them is not annotated with that term, the weighted co-expression is minimized. Our experiments on publicly available Arabidopsis thaliana RNA-Seq data demonstrate that MLC outperforms standard Pearson correlation in term-centric performance.

Detecting sarcastic tone, which conveys a sharp, bitter, or cutting expression, remark or taunt in natural language is tricky even for humans, making its automated detection more arduous.

This work is a preliminary to understand the what, how and why of using context in sentiment analysis.

This paper presents application of pattern directed inference system for static and transient security evaluation and classification. A straightforward and quick procedure called Sequential Forward Selection method is used for feature selection process. The classifier model in the pattern directed inference system is designed using different pattern classifier algorithms, viz., conventional, neural network and machine learning classifiers. Support Vector Machine (SVM), one of the popular machine learning classifier, is recognized as a suitable pattern classifier for security evaluation problem. The generalization performance of SVM classifier is greatly influenced by the proper setting of its parameters. This paper also addresses different heuristic optimization techniques used in the selection of SVM parameters. The design, development and performance of different classifiers for power system security classification are presented in detail. Simulation work is performed on standard New England 39-bus benchmark system and the feasibility of implementation of the proposed SVM based classifier system for on-line security evaluation is also discussed.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ijepes.2012.07.065", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems", "mag_id": "2043233166", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["123260149", "199384355", "59343859", "17685520", "37149395", "52090185", "203171676", "23674127", "109972529", "9932684", "3831249"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110145615"}

As genes often work interactively at the pathway level, studying the cellular heterogeneity based on pathways can facilitate the interpretation of biological functions of different cell populations. In this paper, we propose a pathway-based analytic framework using Random Forests (RF) to identify discriminative functional pathways related to cellular heterogeneity as well as to cluster cell populations for scRNA-Seq data. We further propose a novel method to construct gene-gene interactions (GGIs) networks using RF that illustrates important GGIs in differentiating cell populations. The co-occurrence of genes in different discriminative pathways and 'cross-talk' genes connecting those pathways are also illustrated in our networks. Our novel pathway-based framework clusters cell populations, prioritizes important pathways, highlights GGIs and pivotal genes bridging cross-talked pathways, and groups co-functional genes in networks.

Immersion frequency (landings per 10-min interval) was used to define foraging events. EENM combining Generalized Additive Models (GAM), MaxEnt, Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) identified the biophysical conditions characterizing the locations of foraging events, using time-matched oceanographic predictors (Sea Surface Temperature, SST; chlorophyll a, chl-a; thermal front frequency, TFreq; depth). Model performance was assessed through iterative cross-validation and extrapolative performance through cross-validation among years. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: ::: ::: Predictable foraging habitats identified by EENM spanned neritic ( 0.5 mg m\u22123) and frequent manifestation of mesoscale thermal fronts. Our results confirm previous indications that GHA exploit enhanced foraging opportunities associated with frontal systems and objectively identify the APFZ as a region of high foraging habitat suitability. Moreover, at the spatial and temporal scales investigated here, the performance of multi-model ensembles was superior to that of single-algorithm models, and cross-validation among years indicated reasonable extrapolative performance. ::: ::: ::: Main conclusions ::: ::: ::: EENM techniques are useful for integrating the predictions of several single-algorithm models, reducing potential bias and increasing confidence in predictions.

The first describes a simulation of chunking in a connectionist network. The network applies context-sensitive rewrite rules to strings of symbols as they flow through its input buffer. Chunking is implemented as a form of self-supervised learning using back-propagation. Over time, the network improves its efficiency by replacing simple rule sequences with more complex chunks. The second paper describes the first implementation of Lakoff's new theory of cognitive phonology. His approach is based on a multilevel representation of utterances to which all rules apply in parallel. Cognitive phonology is free of the rule ordering constraints that make classical generative theories computationally p awkward. The connectionist implementation utilizes a novel many maps architecture that may explain certain constraints on phonological rules not adequately accounted for by more abstract models.

Chaos theory offers new concepts, algorithms and methods for processing, enhancing and analyzing the measured signals. In recent years, researchers are applying the concepts from this theory to bio-signal analysis. In this work, the complex dynamics of the bio-signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) are analyzed using the tools of nonlinear systems theory. In the modern industrialized countries every year several hundred thousands of people die due to sudden cardiac death. The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important biosignal representing the sum total of millions of cardiac cell depolarization potentials. It contains important insight into the state of health and nature of the disease afflicting the heart. Heart rate variability (HRV) refers to the regulation of the sinoatrial node, the natural pacemaker of the heart by the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. Heart rate variability analysis is an important tool to observe the heart's ability to respond to normal regulatory impulses that affect its rhythm. A computerbased intelligent system for analysis of cardiac states is very useful in diagnostics and disease management. Like many bio-signals, HRV signals are non-linear in nature. Higher order spectral analysis (HOS) is known to be a good tool for the analysis of non-linear systems and provides good noise immunity. In this work, we studied the HOS of the HRV signals of normal heartbeat and four classes of arrhythmia. This thesis presents some general characteristics for each of these classes of HRV signals in the bispectrum and bicoherence plots. Several features were extracted from the HOS and subjected an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test. The results are very promising for cardiac arrhythmia classification with a number of features yielding a p-value < 0.02 in the ANOVA test. An automated intelligent system for the identification of cardiac health is very useful in healthcare technology. In this work, seven features were extracted from the heart rate signals using HOS and fed to a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The performance evaluation protocol in this thesis uses 330 subjects consisting of five different kinds of cardiac disease conditions. The classifier achieved a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 89%. This system is ready to run on larger data sets. In EEG analysis, the search for hidden information for identification of seizures has a long history. Epilepsy is a pathological condition characterized by spontaneous and unforeseeable occurrence of seizures, during which the perception or behavior of patients is disturbed. An automatic early detection of the seizure onsets would help the patients and observers to take appropriate precautions. Various methods have been proposed to predict the onset of seizures based on EEG recordings. The use of nonlinear features motivated by the higher order spectra (HOS) has been reported to be a promising approach to differentiate between normal, background (pre-ictal) and epileptic EEG signals. In this work, these features are used to train both a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Results show that the classifiers were able to achieve 93.11% and 92.67% classification accuracy, respectively, with selected HOS based features. About 2 hours of EEG recordings from 10 patients were used in this study. This thesis introduces unique bispectrum and bicoherence plots for various cardiac conditions and for normal, background and epileptic EEG signals. These plots reveal distinct patterns. The patterns are useful for visual interpretation by those without a deep understanding of spectral analysis such as medical practitioners. It includes original contributions in extracting features from HRV and EEG signals using HOS and entropy, in analyzing the statistical properties of such features on real data and in automated classification using these features with GMM and SVM classifiers.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "44976137", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["96447916"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107339227"}

Here, our aim was to construct a new analytical framework to predict high-risk snail habitats based on a large sample field survey for Oncomelania hupensis, providing guidance for schistosomiasis control and prevention. Methodology/Principal findings Ten ecological models were constructed based on the occurrence data of Oncomelania hupensis and a range of variables in the Poyang Lake region of China, including four presence-only models (Maximum Entropy Models, Genetic Algorithm for rule-set Production, Bioclim and Domain) and six presence-absence models (Generalized Linear Models, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, as well as machine algorithmic models\u2013Random Forest, Classification Tree Analysis, Generalized Boosted Model), to predict high-risk snail habitats. Based on overall predictive performance, we found Presence-absence models outperformed the presence-only models and the models based on machine learning algorithms of classification trees showed the highest accuracy. The highest risk was located in the watershed of the River Fu in Yugan County, as well as the watershed of the River Gan and the River Xiu in Xingzi County, covering an area of 52.3 km2. The other high-risk areas for both snail habitats and schistosomiasis were mainly concentrated at the confluence of Poyang Lake and its five main tributaries. Conclusions/Significance This study developed a new distribution map of snail habitats in the Poyang Lake region, and demonstrated the critical role of ecological models in risk assessment to directing local field investigation of Oncomelania hupensis.

Emotion recognition can be correctly done by EEG signals. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the direct reflection of the activities of hundreds and millions of neurons residing within the brain. Different emotion states create distinct EEG signals in different brain regions. Therefore EEG provides reliable technique to identify the underlying emotion information. This paper proposes a novel approach to recognize users emotions from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Audio signals are used as stimuli to elicit positive and negative emotions of subjects. For eight healthy subjects, EEG signals are acquired using seven channels of an EEG amplifier. The result reveal that frontal, temporal and parietal regions of the brain are relevant to positive emotion recognition and frontal and parietal regions are activated in case of negative emotion identification. After proper signal processing of the raw EEG, for the whole frequency bands the features are extracted from each channel of the EEG signals by Multifractral Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) method. We introduce an effective classifier named Support Vector Machine (SVM) to categorize the EEG feature space related to various emotional states into their respective classes.

However, while they have had great success with time series data [1], [2], many time series have a multiscale structure, which a single-hidden-layer RC model may have difficulty capturing. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical reservoir computing framework we call Deep Echo State Networks (Deep-ESNs). The most distinctive feature of a Deep-ESN is its ability to deal with time series through hierarchical projections. Specifically, when an input time series is projected into the high-dimensional echo-state space of a reservoir, a subsequent encoding layer (e.g., a PCA, autoencoder, or a random projection) can project the echo-state representations into a lower-dimensional space. These low-dimensional representations can then be processed by another ESN. By using projection layers and encoding layers alternately in the hierarchical framework, a Deep-ESN can not only attenuate the effects of the collinearity problem in ESNs, but also fully take advantage of the temporal kernel property of ESNs to explore multiscale dynamics of time series. To fuse the multiscale representations obtained by each reservoir, we add connections from each encoding layer to the last output layer. Theoretical analyses prove that stability of a Deep-ESN is guaranteed by the echo state property (ESP), and the time complexity is equivalent to a conventional ESN. Experimental results on some artificial and real world time series demonstrate that Deep-ESNs can capture multiscale dynamics, and outperform both standard ESNs and previous hierarchical ESN-based models.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1711.05255", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2768937892", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2184251", "2954335", "819257", "5618949", "14740600", "6471086", "43839409", "8743334", "1045112", "1463401", "20071973", "17200921", "1668634", "3338763", "206741496", "1870512", "537138", "14708001", "5717920", "27054014", "8888128", "30362685", "207147499", "6468316", "12004294", "122072756", "12051918", "206757279", "207974943", "1854295", "2640788", "319654", "2378587", "15334598", "15989172", "191139062"], "inbound_citations": ["201090523", "67855644", "53096672", "207833892", "109931561", "199543889", "49564619", "208131588", "49529792", "51908202", "208123082"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21282296"}
