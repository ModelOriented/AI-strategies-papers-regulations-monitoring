Finger vein recognition uses the unique patterns of finger veins to identify individuals at a high level of accuracy. This paper proposes new algorithms for finger vein recognition. This research presents the following three advantages and contributions compared to previous works. First, we extracted local information of the finger veins based on a LBP (Local Binary Pattern) without segmenting accurate finger vein regions. Second, the global information of the finger veins based on Wavelet transform was extracted. Third, two score values by the LBP and Wavelet transform were combined by the SVM (Support Vector Machine).

Along this line, some recent studies revealed that the high-level concepts, such as word clusters, could help model the differences of data distributions, and thus are more appropriate for classification. In other words, these methods assume that all the data domains have the same set of shared concepts, which are used as the bridge for knowledge transfer. However, in addition to these shared concepts, each domain may have its own distinct concepts. In light of this, we systemically analyze the high-level concepts, and propose a general transfer learning framework based on nonnegative matrix trifactorization, which allows to explore both shared and distinct concepts among all the domains simultaneously. Since this model provides more flexibility in fitting the data, it can lead to better classification accuracy. Moreover, we propose to regularize the manifold structure in the target domains to improve the prediction performances. To solve the proposed optimization problem, we also develop an iterative algorithm and theoretically analyze its convergence properties. Finally, extensive experiments show that the proposed model can outperform the baseline methods with a significant margin.

In this study, canopy height in French Guiana was estimated using multiple linear regression models and the Random Forest technique (RF). This analysis was either based on LiDAR waveform metrics extracted from the GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) spaceborne LiDAR data and terrain information derived from the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM (Digital Elevation Model) or on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of GLAS waveforms. Resultsshow that the best statistical model for estimating forest height based on waveform metrics and digital elevation data is a linear regression of waveform extent, trailing edge extent, ::: and terrain index (RMSE of 3.7 m). For the PCA based models, better canopy height estimation results were observed using a regression model that incorporated both the first 13 principal components (PCs) and the waveform extent (RMSE = 3.8 m). Random Forest regressions revealed that the best configuration for canopy height estimation used all the following metrics: waveform extent, leading edge, trailing edge, and terrain index (RMSE = 3.4 m). Waveform extent was the variable that best explained canopy height, with an importance factor almost three times higher than those for the other three metrics (leading edge, trailing edge, and terrain index). Furthermore, the Random Forest regression incorporating the first 13 PCs and the waveform extent had a slightly-improved canopy height estimation in comparison to the linear model, with an RMSE of 3.6 m. In conclusion, multiple linear regressions and RF regressions provided canopy height estimations with similar precision using either LiDAR metrics or PCs. However, a regression model (linear regression or RF) based on the PCA of waveform samples with waveform extent information is an interesting alternative for canopy height estimation as it does not require several metrics that are difficult to derive from GLAS waveforms in dense forests, such as those in French Guiana.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs61211883", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2042823696", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["42458151", "206524740", "588160", "140648068", "39661904", "16576961", "84216932", "85326252", "8148608", "129724974", "16340118", "20465296", "61317779", "127121901", "59025010", "5708355", "12085247", "129548243", "55073370", "129235659", "6164799", "17290111", "126674016", "16533940", "129663445", "53539814", "140629858", "44731871", "8081457", "128609252", "2910891", "132889712", "128399891", "14088963", "129286883", "126711830", "131113180", "7721675", "129520559", "131344795", "43927620", "129854229", "9140417", "140670170", "120421742", "120732389", "17103325", "140694798", "55695956", "128891777", "11687149", "89141", "46178495", "15882424", "129617953", "26762965"], "inbound_citations": ["211208241", "56233501", "3614904", "29875950", "4417742", "2312489", "126314078", "923875", "10862500", "57378262", "9994540", "7839544", "51729376", "3243816", "5440627", "51764953", "23755147"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1298716"}

Traditional investigation method for plant community is mainly based on statistical sampling, which is limited by the data acquisition from complex terrain areas. In contrast, highresolution remote sensing technique provides a convenient way to quickly access data in a large area. To overcome the shortcomings derived from the high dimensional features, which is caused by related data increasing, we choose the algorithm of projection pursuit learning network(PPLN) along with field samples of typical plant communities to realize a fast classification on the vegetation in the east of Shenzhen. Then,in the experiment, the spectral and texture information extracted from Pleiades images,and the terrain interpolated from topographic map are selected and used to build high dimensional features, which is crucial to the vegetation classification using remote sensing images. The learning network for projection pursuit is applied to discriminating the typical communities in both plantation and natural secondary forest in the study area. Compared with Maximum- likelihood classification(MLC) and Support Vector Machine(SVM), PPLN can achieve more accurate results for plant community classification.

Manual spelling, or finger spelling, is a system where each letter of the alphabet is represented by an unique and discrete movement of the hand. RGB and depth images can be used to characterize hand shapes corresponding to letters of the alphabet. The advantage of depth cameras over color cameras for gesture recognition is more evident when performing hand segmentation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid system approach for finger spelling recognition using RGB-D information from Kinect sensor. In a first stage, the hand area is segmented from background using depth map and precise hand shape is extracted using both depth data and color data from Kinect sensor. Motivated by the performance of kernel based features, due to its simplicity and the ability to turn any type of pixel attribute into patch-level features, we decided to use the gradient kernel descriptor for feature extraction from depth images. The Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is used for describing the content of the RGB image. Then, the Bag-of-Visual-Words approach is used to extract semantic information. Finally, these features are used as input of our Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

Grass swards are harvested three times in season, and fertilizer is applied similarly three times\u2014once for each harvest when aiming at maximum yields. Timely information of the yield is thus necessary several times in a season for making decisions on harvesting time and rate of fertilizer application. Our objective was to develop and assess a novel machine learning technique for the estimation of canopy height and biomass of grass swards utilizing multispectral photogrammetric camera data. Variation in the studied crop stand was generated using six different nitrogen fertilizer levels and four harvesting dates. The sward was a timothy-meadow fescue mixture dominated by timothy. We extracted various features from the remote sensing data by combining an ultra-high resolution photogrammetric canopy height model (CHM) with a pixel size of 1.0 cm and red, green, blue (RGB) and near-infrared range intensity values and different vegetation indices (VI) extracted from orthophoto mosaics. We compared the performance of multiple linear regression (MLR) and a Random Forest estimator (RF) with different combinations of the CHM, RGB and VI features. The best estimation results with both methods were obtained by combining CHM and VI features and all three feature classes (CHM, RGB and VI features). Both estimators provided equally accurate results.

This distance is used as the value of similarity or closeness between the testingdata. Problems will appear we wrong to choose the metric of distance in a case that we willclassify.. The result is a decrease in the accuracy of our classification. In this study it can beconcluded that there are many alternative distance metrics that can be used in classification usingK-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. Changes in the use of standard distance metrics provide significantchanges in accuracy. From the above experiments also the authors can conclude that Manhattan'sdistance metrics have better accuracy compared to other distance metrics in the case studies ofBreast Cancer.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2949344263", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196196111"}

Most of traditional crowd estimation approaches rely on sophisticated computer vision algorithms to estimate crowd based on camera data, therefore suffering from privacy issues and high deployment and data processing cost. In this paper we present a sensor fusion based approach to real-time crowd estimation based on privacy-conscious and inexpensive sensors. The approach has been implemented and verified first by a small scale deployment at our lab, and then tested based on a 3-month trial at a shopping mall in Singapore. A deep analysis has been carried out based on the data sets collected from the trial, showing promising results: 1) the data from CO2, sound pressure and infrared sensors are influential in estimating crowd levels for indoor environments, 2) Random Forest and C4.5 are identified as the more suitable supervised learning models, 3) an accuracy of 95% can be achieved by our crowd estimation system in a real scenario. In contrast to the state of the art, our approach is privacy preserving and can provide comparable estimation accuracy with lower deployment and processing cost and better applicability for large scale setups.

This has long been a challenging task as customer modelling is a multi-faceted, noisy and time-dependent problem. The most common way to tackle this problem is indirectly through task-specific supervised learning prediction problems, with relatively little literature on modelling a customer by directly simulating their future transactions. In this paper we propose a method for generating realistic sequences of baskets that a given customer is likely to purchase over a period of time. Customer embedding representations are learned using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which takes into account the entire sequence of transaction data. Given the customer state at a specific point in time, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained to generate a plausible basket of products for the following week. The newly generated basket is then fed back into the RNN to update the customer's state. The GAN is thus used in tandem with the RNN module in a pipeline alternating between basket generation and customer state updating steps.

Attempts to predict natural peptides are limited by the low performance of proteolytic site predictors and by the high combinatorial complexity of pairing such sites. To overcome these limitations, we analyzed the site-wise evolutionary mutation rates of peptide hormone precursors, calculated using the Rate4Site algorithm. Results: Our analysis revealed that within their precursors, peptide residues are significantly more conserved than the pro-peptide residues. This disparity enables the prediction of peptides with a precision of \ufffd 60% at a recall of 40% [receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) AUC 0.79]. Subsequently, combining the Rate4Site score with additional features and training a Random Forest classifier enable the prediction of natural peptides hidden within secreted human proteins at a precision of \ufffd 90% at a recall of 50% (ROC AUC 0.96). The high performance of our method allows it to be applied to full secretomes and to predict naturally occurring active peptides. Our prediction on Homo sapiens revealed several putative peptides in the human secretome that are currently unannotated.

However, graph matching algorithms are usually computationally complex. In addition, graphs are harder to manipulate and operate than feature vectors. In the last years, some attempts have been made to combine the best of the graph and the vector domains in order to get the advantages of both worlds. In this paper we review some of these works on graph kernels and graph embedding and we show how graph embedding can be used to obtain accurate and efficient approximations of the median graph. The median graph can be seen as the representative of a set of graphs but its application has been very limited up to now due to computational reasons. With this new approach, we can obtain an approximate median graph using real databases containing large graphs. Mots-cles : Graph Matching, Graph Embedding, Graph Kernels, Vector Spaces, Median Graph tors. Secondly, the repository of algorithmic tools based on graphs is quite limited when compared to the tools available for patterns represented using feature vectors. This is mainly due to the fact that vectors are simple structures with good mathematical properties that can be readily manipulated algebraically. For this reason, new trends in structural pattern recognition have been proposed merging both worlds in order to extend the available statistical tools to the graph domain [BUN 05]. In this way, graph kernels permit to compute the dot product of the representation of a pair of graphs in a vector space without having to define the explicit transformation between the graphs and the vector space. As a consequence all classification algorithms based on the computation of a dot product, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) become immediately available for graphs. On the other hand, graph embedding aims to find an explicit transformation between graphs and a vector space. In this way, we can give a semantic interpretation to this transformation. In addition we can also manipulate the vectors resulting from this transformation with all the mathematical machinery that can be applied to vectors. We are not restricted to the dot product. In this paper, we firstly review the main techniques used to define graph kernels and graph embedding in sections 2 and 3, respectively. Then, in section 4 we show the application of graph embedding to a particular complex graph matching problem : the computation of the median graph. In this section we introduce the concept of median graph as a representative of a set of graphs and then, we describe how it can be efficiently computed using graph embedding. We also show some results of its application to real pattern recognition problems.

In this approach, QoS requirements were achieved by estimation of signal strength, network capacity, MAC scheduling, link scheduling and slot assignment. In addition, congestion was controlled based on the bandwidth management mechanism which is according to the congestion window on the dynamic traffic conditions. Based on these approaches, congestion over the network was controlled. However, the congestion window size was not precisely adjusted and selected by using these approaches. Therefore in this article, CHLA-QSCACAR is enhanced by including adaptive congestion window size based on the machine learning algorithm (CHLA-MQSCACAR). In this approach, congestion window size is predicted for adjusting the congestion in the next transmission. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm utilizes the congestion balance status as label and congestion control parameters as input attributes. Initially, congestion balance status of different transmissions and their corresponding input congestion control parameters are gathered. The collected database is trained with aid of SVM classifier.

While some approaches perform joint activity segmentation and recognition, they typically suffer from a poor modeling of the transitions between actions and a representation that does not incorporate contextual information about the scene. In this paper, we propose a model for action segmentation and recognition that improves upon existing work in two directions. First, we develop a variation of the Skip-Chain Conditional Random Field that captures long-range state transitions between actions by using higher-order temporal relationships. Second, we argue that in constrained environments, where the relevant set of objects is known, it is better to develop features using high-level object relationships that have semantic meaning instead of relying on abstract features. We apply our approach to a set of tasks common for training in robotic surgery: suturing, knot tying, and needle passing, and show that our method increases micro and macro accuracy by 18.46% and 44.13% relative to the state of the art on a widely used robotic surgery dataset.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/WACV.2015.154", "venue": "2015 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision", "journal": "2015 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2029294400", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["23174393", "3198903", "14554383", "16185857", "6496956", "14293781", "16199335", "15505214", "2993559", "62249159", "13975490", "1925530", "1471813", "2527818", "618577", "9349950", "12532946", "14602050", "8777811", "12943282", "11359025", "17952638", "6583079", "622833", "17671150", "61844025", "11784473", "3509338", "1899849", "6526542"], "inbound_citations": ["148574250", "20801251", "143554", "46896988", "3983555", "210164437", "54443011", "25693150", "139103002", "7836064", "211060776", "46943712", "49349445", "3219922", "5633749", "136934", "8273302", "14151704", "212644657", "88488119", "1940188", "14749264", "4300105", "6056179", "3524140", "14450424", "9185333", "210692703", "467833", "1413441", "6672845", "207293255", "17049299", "11173913"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16420613"}

The proposed MIFGMOS transistor enables to build a large scale system by combining multiple inputs in a single transistor with a small silicon footprint. Here, we show the MIFGMOS based implementation of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) architecture using the receptive field approach with transistor operating in the sub-threshold region. The MIFGMOS produces output current as a function of the weighted combination of the voltage applied to its gate terminals. In the ELM architecture, the weights between the input and the hidden layer are random and this allows exploiting the random device mismatch due to the fabrication process, for building Integrated Circuits (IC) based on ELM architecture. Thus, we use implicit random weights present due to device mismatch, and there is no need to store the input weights. We have verified our architecture using circuit simulations on regression and various classification problems such as on the MNIST data-set and a few UCI data-sets.

Multi-voxel pattern analysis was used to test if these 18 different brain activation patterns were specific. We chose a Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) as the classifier in this study. The results showed that the classification accuracies of different brain activation patterns were significantly above chance level, which suggests that the classifier can successfully distinguish the brain activation patterns. Our results suggest that the specific brain activation patterns to different pixelized images can be obtained in the primary visual cortex using a 4 mm \u00d7 4 mm \u00d7 4 mm voxel size and a 100-voxel pattern.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4660756", "pubmed_id": "26692860", "doi": "10.4103/1673-5374.167761", "venue": "Neural regeneration research", "journal": "Neural regeneration research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2215566763", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["30447053", "23896141", "34990614", "24379462", "20256027", "10638844", "18172770", "28107350", "15032282", "8360828", "38571947", "19438858", "5051787", "9477190", "11882251", "3652598", "7613531", "18995478", "6497776", "33103223", "28308947", "75662924", "5704796", "11352032", "4404323", "46337119", "2662166", "5276381", "1561668"], "inbound_citations": ["14235954"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11701277"}

Human beings communicate with each other through mutual conversations and they process this information by one of the following medium: speech and vision. Therefore, facial emotion recognition can be considered as a vital and useful visual based tool for building systems which can identify, interpret, process, and sim- ulate human emotions. The traditional approach for performing facial emotion recognition is tracking changes in the facial muscles which are defined as Action Units(AU)[1]. Although Action Units has proven to be a quite successful approach in the process of identification of facial expressions, there are a total of 7000 AUs combinations of different AUs charac- terized to distinguish the emotions which can prove to be really a very extensive and time consuming procedure [2]. In this paper we provide an alternative approach of using feature points instead of action units to develop a faster and efficient recognition method. In this paper we attempt to achieve higher efficiency in recognizing human emotions accurately by using minimal number of geometrical feature points. We first take pre-processed dataset of JAFFE image database as our input, then we perform extraction of the feature points of only two features: Eyes and Eyebrows of human face. In the final stage, we generate some geometrical features on basis of the extracted feature points and classify them by taking as input vectors for the Random Forest Algorithm and are able to achieve 87.4% recognition rate when we run it across for 213 images in overall.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Engineering and Future Technology", "mag_id": "2517163180", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64338232"}

It can also provide important information for developing efficient water quality management strategies. Most common methods for water quality zoning do not consider the uncertainties associated with water resources systems. Also, these methods only categorize the water quality monitoring stations into some classes based on existing water quality but do not provide any information about the quality of water which is categorized in a class. In this paper, a new methodology for probabilistic water quality zoning is developed which utilizes the capabilities of Probabilistic Support Vector Machines (PSVMs) and Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The required data for training the PSVM is generated by using the FIS in a Monte Carlo Analysis. The trained PSVM-based water quality index provides the probabilities of belonging quality of water to different water quality classes. The applicability of the proposed methodology is investigated by applying it to two surface and groundwater resources systems in Iran. Also, for more evaluating the efficiency of the methodology, the results are compared with those obtained from two clustering techniques, namely Fuzzy Clustering Technique (FCT) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM). The results of surface and ground water quality zoning are depicted in maps by utilizing the Geographic Information System (GIS).

Despite significant advances, most current state-of-the-art algorithms are regular-grid region based; when attention is used, it is mainly applied between individual regular-grid regions and a word. These approaches are sufficient to generate images that contain a single object in its foreground, such as a \"bird\" or \"flower\". However, natural languages often involve complex foreground objects and the background may also constitute a variable portion of the generated image. Therefore, the regular-grid based image attention weights may not necessarily concentrate on the intended foreground region(s), which in turn, results in an unnatural looking image. Additionally, individual words such as \"a\", \"blue\" and \"shirt\" do not necessarily provide a full visual context unless they are applied together. For this reason, in our paper, we proposed a novel method in which we introduced an additional set of attentions between true-grid regions and word phrases. The true-grid region is derived using a set of auxiliary bounding boxes. These auxiliary bounding boxes serve as superior location indicators to where the alignment and attention should be drawn with the word phrases. Word phrases are derived from analysing Part-of-Speech (POS) results. We perform experiments on this novel network architecture using the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MSCOCO) dataset and the model generates $256 \\times 256$ conditioned on a short sentence description.

A smart software tool named Support Vector Machine (SVM), which minimizes the upper bound of an empirical risk function, is proposed to approximate the nonlinear function seen in the control law by using very limited number of numerical data. This removes the necessity of knowing the functional form of the nominal nonlinearity in the control law. It is shown that the controller is robust against noisy measurements, considerable amount of parameter variations, discontinuities in the command signal and large initial errors.

At present, there is some research on sentiment analysis for English traveler generated reviews, but very few studies pay attention to sentiment analysis for traveler reviews in Chinese. China is the largest country in terms of the number of Internet users. Internet technologies are gradually playing more and more important roles for many industries including tourism industry. The lack of sentiment analysis methods will block the use of word-of-mouth for tourism industry in China. To solve the problem, this study conducts an exploring research on sentiment analysis to Chinese traveler reviews by support vector machine (SVM) algorithm.

The proposed model can employ a set of real-time sensor measurements to: 1) diagnose the hidden degradation level of the system and 2) predict the likelihood and the uncertainty of failure without imposing unrealistic heavy distributional assumptions. We provide analytical results for the prediction and update steps of the associated particle filter, as well as for the estimation of model parameters.

A training sample set and testing sample set were randomly generated according to the classification standards of groundwater quality, then Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) was used to optimize the input weights and thresholds of hidden-layer neurons of the ELM; thus, the CSA-ELM evaluation model of groundwater quality was constructed based on optimization of the ELM by the CSA. Base on the training sample set and testing sample set, the CSA-ELM model was tested. The test results indicate that the evaluating precision and generalization ability of the CSA-ELM model reach a high level and can be used for comprehensive evaluations of groundwater quality. The Jiansanjiang Administration in Heilongjiang Province, China, was used as an example; the groundwater quality of 15 farms in this region was evaluated based on the CSA-ELM model. The groundwater quality in this region was generally good, and the groundwater quality appeared to have spatial distribution characteristics. Compared with the Nemerow Index Method (NIM), the CSA-ELM evaluation model of groundwater quality is more reasonable and can be used for the comprehensive evaluation of groundwater quality. The stability of the NIM, ELM model, back propagation (BP) model and CSA-ELM model was analyzed using the theory of serial number summation and Spearman's correlation coefficient. The stability of the NIM and BP model in groundwater quality evaluation was poor, while the stability of the ELM model and CSA-ELM model was relatively superior.

There is growing interest in detecting genetic variants associated with such multivariate traits, especially in genome-wide studies. Random forests (RFs) classifiers, which are ensembles of decision trees, are amongst the best performing machine learning algorithms and have been successfully employed for the prioritisation of genetic variants in case-control studies. RFs can also be applied to produce gene rankings in association studies with multivariate quantitative traits, and to estimate genetic similarities measures that are predictive of the trait. However, in studies involving hundreds of thousands of SNPs and high-dimensional traits, a very large ensemble of trees must be inferred from the data in order to obtain reliable rankings, which makes the application of these algorithms computationally prohibitive.ResultsWe have developed a parallel version of the RF algorithm for regression and genetic similarity learning tasks in large-scale population genetic association studies involving multivariate traits, called PaRFR (Parallel Random Forest Regression). Our implementation takes advantage of the MapReduce programming model and is deployed on Hadoop, an open-source software framework that supports data-intensive distributed applications. Notable speed-ups are obtained by introducing a distance-based criterion for node splitting in the tree estimation process. PaRFR has been applied to a genome-wide association study on Alzheimer's disease (AD) in which the quantitative trait consists of a high-dimensional neuroimaging phenotype describing longitudinal changes in the human brain structure. PaRFR provides a ranking of SNPs associated to this trait, and produces pair-wise measures of genetic proximity that can be directly compared to pair-wise measures of phenotypic proximity. Several known AD-related variants have been identified, including APOE4 and TOMM40. We also present experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis of a linear relationship between the number of top-ranked mutated states, or frequent mutation patterns, and an indicator of disease severity.AvailabilityThe Java codes are freely available at http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~gmontana.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3853073", "pubmed_id": "24564704", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-14-S16-S6", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2069716529", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["19987352", "14419689", "18401995", "12019872", "21029222", "14245485", "18957897", "207747678", "1431889", "5985249", "214038", "7140819", "10966780", "1312032", "89141", "121619337", "18976374", "9233854", "26026616", "17764599", "7228526", "12131125", "14828113", "7187403", "4680408", "10014124", "12206069", "2976127", "6396694", "1245121", "17583075"], "inbound_citations": ["50051", "196690424", "215034688", "16706488", "49427611", "52902468", "15781431", "5700060", "3196617", "8997979", "53350684", "15850826", "3309638", "91263658", "20520621", "195774186", "15383046", "17161411"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:325442"}

One major technique that has been gaining ground recently is dynamic analysis based on system call invocations recorded during the executions of Android applications. Dynamic analysis has traditionally been based on converting system calls into flat feature vectors and feeding the vectors into machine learning algorithms for classification. In this paper, we implement three traditional feature-vector-based representations for Android system calls. For each feature vector representation, we also propose a novel graph-based representation. We then use graph kernels to compute pair-wise similarities and feed these similarity measures into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

Specifically, we create an instance generator to synthesize the primitive color distribution and the detailed texture for each instance. Then, an image generator is designed to combine all of these instances to synthesize an image retaining texture and color. Besides, to generate more significant details, such as eyes, ears, and so on, we propose a novel technique called discriminative sketch augmentation, which can provide structural constraint by obtaining the sketch of the discriminative region.

One of the most popular techniques consists in dividing the original data set into two-class subsets, learning a different binary model for each new subset. These techniques are known as binarization strategies. In this work, we are interested in ensemble methods by binarization techniques; in particular, we focus on the well-known one-vs-one and one-vs-all decomposition strategies, paying special attention to the final step of the ensembles, the combination of the outputs of the binary classifiers. Our aim is to develop an empirical analysis of different aggregations to combine these outputs. To do so, we develop a double study: first, we use different base classifiers in order to observe the suitability and potential of each combination within each classifier. Then, we compare the performance of these ensemble techniques with the classifiers' themselves.

In previous work, a generalized cycle-to-cycle mapping function coupled with epsilon-Support Vector Regression was shown to predict experimentally observed cycle-to-cycle phasing over a wide range of engine conditions, despite some of the aforementioned difficulties. The main limitation of the previous approach was that a partially acausual randomly sampled training dataset was used to train proof of concept offline predictions.

This extension enables fully causal phasing predictions at randomly chosen engine set points, and is shown to achieve results that are as good as or better than the previous offline method.

Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems Massachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA Abstract\u2014Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been widely used in many application domains. How to apply RFID technology to develop an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) has become a hot research topic in recent years. LANDMARC approach is one of the first IPSs by using active RFID tags and readers to provide location based service in indoor environment. However, major drawbacks of the LANDMARC approach are that its localization accuracy largely depends on the density of reference tags and the high cost of RFID readers. In order to overcome these drawbacks, two localization algorithms, namely weighted path loss (WPL) and extreme learning machine (ELM), are proposed in this paper. These two approaches are tested on a novel cost-efficient active RFID IPS. Based on our experimental results, both WPL and ELM can provide higher localization accuracy and robustness than existing ones. I. I NTRODUCTION The demands on Indoor Positioning System (IPS) have increased a lot in recent years. The GPS based outdoor location service has been widely used, however GPS cannot provide positioning service with sufficient localization accuracy in indoor environments due to the lack of line of sight (LoS) transmission channel between the satellite and the receiver. In addition, a lot of other problems make positioning and navigation in indoor environment much more complicated and challenging than in outdoor environment, such as physical layout changes of furniture, signal scattering due to large density of obstacles, multipath effect of signal reflection from walls and furniture and even momentary changes of human movements or opening and closing of doors. Various approaches based on different technologies such as Infrared, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Ultra- Wideband (UWB) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) have been proposed and developed in order to provide posi- tioning and navigation in indoor environment [1] [2] [3]. RFID technology has been widely used in many application domains such as asset tracking, industrial automation and medical care. How to apply RFID technology to develop IPS has become a hot research topic in recent years. RFID has several advantages, such as no requirement of LoS, RFID tags are small and light and most importantly, it can uniquely identify different equipment and persons. The basic components of an RFID IPS include RFID readers, RFID tags and the communication network between them. The RFID reader is able to read the data emitted from RFID tags. Both RFID readers and tags use a predefined RF frequency and protocol to transmit and receive data. Passive RFID tags operate without a battery and they are mainly used to replace the traditional barcode technology. Active RFID tags are small transceivers with button-cell batteries to power the transceivers. They can actively transmit their ID and additional information to RFID readers. They are quite suitable for identifying and tracking high-unit-value products or persons in complex indoor environments. A well-known IPS using the RFID technology is LAND- MARC [4]. It utilizes the concept of reference RFID tags. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) from these reference tags that is received by the receiver is used as the realtime training data. It is reported that the localization accuracy of LANDMARC is around 1.5-2m with 50 percent probability. An enhanced LANDMARC approach has been proposed in [5]. This improved scheme aims to make the calculated coordinate of the tracking tags closer to the real time measurements without extra readers and reference tags. However, one drawback in these RFID IPSs is the high cost of RFID readers and the active tags. Another issue is that when the number of tracking tags increases in the system, the event of RSS data package loss occurs more frequently due to the limitation of RF data transmission channel or signal collision. It affects and reduces the localization accuracy of the system severely.

Several studies have documented the ability of confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy optic disc topographic measurements to discriminate between healthy and glaucomatous eyes2-4. Function-specific tests of visual function have been shown to be more sensitive to glaucomatous damage than standard automated perimetry (SAP)5-7. Short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP), for example, targets the blue-yellow pathway and may detect glaucomatous damage up to five years earlier than SAP8. A recent study has shown that the sensitivity to detect glaucoma can be improved by combining data from structural and function-specific tests9. ::: ::: In efforts to summarize the large amount of data produced by structural and functional tests, various types of pattern-recognition algorithms known as machine learning classifiers have been applied to optic disc imaging results and visual field data. Machine learning classifiers (MLCs) are well suited for evaluating these large data sets, because they are able to detect complex patterns and trends. Several types of MLCs have been applied to glaucoma, including the mixture of Gaussian (MoG), sub-space mixture of Gaussian (SS-MoG), support vector machine (SVM) and the relevance vector machine (RVM). The RVM classifier incorporates a probabilistic output and has previously been shown to perform as well as the support vector machine (SVM) classifier10. This probabilistic output allows for an intuitive interpretation of the RVM results and may provide a particularly useful clinical perspective. Using either structural10, 11 or functional12-15 measurements alone, machine learning classifiers showed similar or better diagnostic accuracy for glaucoma than traditional analyses. A few studies have reported an improvement in the ability of machine learning classifiers to detect glaucoma when they are trained using standard automated perimetry (SAP) and structural measurements16-19, compared to when they are trained with either data in isolation. ::: ::: Bowd et al19 reported that combining optical coherence tomography (OCT) and SAP data resulted only in a marginal improvement in the ability of machine learning classifiers to classify eyes as glaucomatous or healthy. This study may have been somewhat biased by the use of SAP to both classify the eyes and train the machine learning classifiers. This problem is a consequence of the inexistence of a gold standard for glaucoma and is very difficult to overcome when studying structure and function simultaneously. In the present study, we reduced the classification bias by using different measures to classify the eyes and train the machine learning classifier. Our purpose was to determine whether combining structural and functional data improves the diagnostic accuracy of relevance vector machine (RVM) classifiers for detecting glaucomatous eyes compared to using each test alone.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2891254", "pubmed_id": "19528827", "doi": "10.1097/IJG.0b013e3181a98b85", "venue": "Journal of glaucoma", "journal": "Journal of glaucoma", "mag_id": "1973647286", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3531660", "17776410", "3634085", "26018825", "21672833", "215206737", "14550161", "40750031", "42305429", "3637809", "54630932", "7776341", "9403200"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7825808"}

However, most of these approaches produces output that is not equivalent to the probability estimates of how credible and reliable the output can be for each prediction. One widely utilized, highly accorded for generalized performance but non-probabilistic machine learning algorithm is the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). As with other classification systems, ELM generates outputs that cannot be treated as probabilities. Current literature shows approaches attempt to assimilate probabilistic concept in ELM however their outputs are not equivalent to probabilities. Furthermore, these methods invoke two-stage post processing procedures with iterative learning procedures which are against the salient features of ELM that highlight no iterative operations involved in learning. Hence, we want to probe in this paper the ability of ELM to produce probabilistic output from the original architecture of ELM itself while preserving the merits of ELM without the need for a post processing two-stage procedures to convert the output to probability and eliminates iterative learning to compute output weights. Two methodologies of unified probabilistic ELM framework are presented, i.e., Probabilistic Output Extreme Learning Machine (PO-ELM) and Constrained Optimization Posterior Probabilistic Outputs based Extreme Learning Machine (CPP-POELM).

Our analysis clearly showed significant lower values for chaotic parameters, correlation dimension, and largest Lyapunov exponent for EEG in patients with metabolic encephalopathy compared to normal EEG. The chaotic features of EEG have been shown in previous studies to be an indicator of the complexity of brain dynamics. The smaller values of chaotic features for encephalopathy suggest that normal complexity of brain function is reduced in encephalopathy. To the best knowledge of the authors, no similar work has been reported on metabolic encephalopathy. This finding may be useful to understand the neurobiological phenomena in encephalopathy. These chaotic features are then utilized as feature sets for Support Vector Machine classifier to identify cases of encephalopathy from normal healthy subjects yielding high values of accuracy.

Then, diverse sampling is ensured by considering the relative position of the candidate in the SVM feature space. Such position is evaluated by using partitioning of the feature space via nonlinear clustering. Among all candidates belonging to the same cluster, the winner is the pixel minimizing the weighted combination of the distances from both the SVM hyperplane and the cluster center. This way, the proposed approach provides a way to i) account for and minimize the redundancy of the sampled pixels and ii) maximize the speed of convergence to an optimal classification accuracy. In order to discover clusters and to evaluate the distance between the cluster center and the samples, the kernel k-means algorithm is used in a hierarchical way.

Also, the Tikhonov regularization term is incorporated to the objective of our approach to reduce the singularity problems of Quadratic Programming Problems (QPPs), and then to minimize its 1-norm measure. This approach leads to a strong feature suppression capability, called as Feature Selection for Least Squares Projection Twin Support Vector Machine (FLSPTSVM). The solutions of FLSPTSVM can be obtained by solving two smaller QPPS arising from two primal QPPs as opposed to two dual ones in Twin Support Vector Machine (TWSVM). Thus, FLSPTSVM is capable of generating sparse solutions. This means that FLSPTSVM can reduce the number of input features for a linear case. Our linear FLSPTSVM can also be extended to a nonlinear case with the kernel trick. When a nonlinear classifier is used, the number of kernel functions required for the classifier is reduced.

For example, in document classification, a research article can be categorized as \u201cscience\u201d, \u201cdrug discovery\u201d and \u201cgenomics\u201d at the same time. The goal of multilabel classification is to reliably predict multiple outputs for a given input. As multiple interdependent labels can be \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d simultaneously, the central problem in multilabel classification is how to best exploit the correlation between labels to make accurate predictions. Compared to the previous flat multilabel classification approaches which treat multiple labels as a flat vector, structured output learning relies on an output graph connecting multiple labels to model the correlation between labels in a comprehensive manner. The main question studied in this thesis is how to tackle multilabel classification through structured output learning. This thesis starts with an extensive review on the topic of classification learning including both single-label and multilabel classification. The first problem we address is how to solve the multilabel classification problem when the output graph is observed apriori. We discuss several well-established structured output learning algorithms and study the network response prediction problem within the context of social network analysis. As the current structured output learning algorithms rely on the output graph to exploit the dependency between labels, the second problem we address is how to use structured output learning when the output graph is not known. Specifically, we examine the potential of learning on a set of random output graphs when the \u201creal\u201d one is hidden. This problem is relevant as in most multilabel classification problems there does not exist any output graph that reveals the dependency between labels. The third problem we address is how to analyze the proposed learning algorithms in a theoretical manner. Specifically, we want to explain the intuition behind the proposed models and to study the generalization error. The main contributions of this thesis are several new learning algorithms that widen the applicability of structured output learning. For the problem with an observed output graph, the proposed algorithm \u201cSPIN\u201d is able to predict an optimal directed acyclic graph from an observed underlying network that best responses to an input. For general multilabel classification problems without any known output graph, we proposed several learning algorithms that combine a set of structured output learners built on random output graphs. In addition, we develop a joint learning and inference framework which is based on max-margin learning over a random sample of spanning trees.

Modeling the shape and appearance of human motion is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the articulated human motion, variations of shape and appearance from different views and in different people, and the nonlinearity in shape and appearance deformations in the observed sequences. Recent interest in modeling human motion is originated from the various potential real-world applications such as visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, video analysis, computer animation, etc. ::: We present a novel framework to model dynamic shape and appearance using nonlinear manifold embedding and factorization. We investigate different representations to embed high-dimensional human motion sequences in low dimensional spaces by supervised and unsupervised manifold learning techniques to achieve representations that capture the intrinsic structure of the motion. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques based on visual data and kinematic data are applied to discover low dimensional intrinsic manifold representation for body configuration. Also, we investigate the use of supervised manifold learning from a known manifold topology to model deformation of manifolds from an ideal case. By learning nonlinear mapping from the embedding space to the input shape or appearance, we can generate shape and appearance sequences according to the motion state on the embedded manifold. ::: We present a decomposable generative model to analyze shape and appearance variations by different factors such as person\u2019s style, motion type, and view point.

Also, we investigate learning generative models to represent continuous body configuration and continuous view manifolds in a product space (i.e. body configuration manifold \u00d7 view manifold). The proposed factorized generative models provide rich models for the analysis of dynamic shape and appearance of human motion.

In particular, we study estimation of individual-level causal effects, such as a single patient's response to alternative medication, from recorded contexts, decisions and outcomes. We give generalization bounds on the error in estimated effects based on distance measures between groups receiving different treatments, allowing for sample re-weighting. We provide conditions under which our bound is tight and show how it relates to results for unsupervised domain adaptation. Led by our theoretical results, we devise representation learning algorithms that minimize our bound, by regularizing the representation's induced treatment group distance, and encourage sharing of information between treatment groups.

However, when fitting a generic model to multiple users with varying hand shape, there is likely to be residual errors between the model and their hand. Also, local minima can lead to failures in tracking that are difficult to recover from. Therefore, we introduce an error regression stage that learns to correct these instances of optimisation failure. The approach provides improved accuracy over the current state of the art methods, through the inclusion of temporal cohesion and by learning to correct from failure cases. Using discriminative learning, our approach performs guided optimisation, greatly reducing model fitting complexity and radically improves efficiency. This allows tracking to be performed at over 40 frames per second using a single CPU thread.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cviu.2016.11.005", "venue": "Comput.

It was observed that XYF and BDK are not suited to tackle regression problems due to the limited number of output values stored in the output map weights and the fact that these networks can not interpolate between the learned output values. We combine in this paper the mapping strength of BDK with the modelling power of partial least squares (PLS). In a supervised way a BDK input and output map, which captures, in a global sense, the multivariate structure and the input\u2013output relationship present in the data, is built. Based on the weights of the input map a kernel matrix, which serves as starting point for the PLS algorithm, is computed. This kernel approach guarantees that linear, as well as non-linear, regression problems can be handled. It is shown that the cascade of the supervised BDK Self-Organising Maps and PLS (referred to as SOMPLS) yields a transparent and powerful regression model: the BDK maps and the PLS loadings and regression coefficients will be exploited to visualise various model properties. Moreover, the SOMPLS algorithm guarantees a stable and fast solution for various complex regression problems. For a number of real-world data sets and one simulated data set the performance of SOMPLS is compared to PLS, Kernel Function PLS (KPLS) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

Part of the attraction is the variable selection effect: parsimonious models are obtained, which are very suitable for interpretation. In terms of predictive power, however, these regularized linear models are often slightly inferior to machine learning procedures like tree ensembles. Tree ensembles, on the other hand, lack usually a formal way of variable selection and are difficult to visualize. A Garrote-style convex penalty for trees ensembles, in particular Random Forests, is proposed. The penalty selects functional groups of nodes in the trees. These could be as simple as monotone functions of individual predictor variables. This yields a parsimonious function fit, which lends itself easily to visualization and interpretation.

These measures used to calculate pairwise similarities between samples rely on data representations in a feature space. However, discriminative clustering fails if the samples in a feature space are linearly inseparable. This problem can be solved by performing a nonlinear data transformation into a high dimensional feature space, which can increase the probability of the linear separability of the samples within the transformed feature space and simplify the associated data structure. Mercer kernels, which are constructed using such a nonlinear data transformation, have been widely used in clustering tasks. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a new method that exhibits promising clustering performance owing to its universal approximation capability, easy parameter selection, explicit feature mapping process, and excellent feature representation capability. This study proposes an ELM based multi-view learning approach with different views generated by ELM random feature mapping with respect to different hidden-layer nodes, and exploits the properties of these views. Experiments show that better clustering results can be obtained by combining these views together compared with the corresponding ELM-based single-view clustering methods and the traditional algorithms which are performed in the feature space of the original data. Moreover, local kernel alignment property is widespread in these views. This alignment helps the clustering algorithm focus on closer sample pairs. This study also proposes an ELM based multiple kernel clustering algorithm with local kernel alignment maximization. The proposed algorithm is experimentally demonstrated on 10 single-view benchmark datasets and yields superior clustering performance when compared with the state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods in recent literatures. Thus, the effectiveness and superiority of maximizing local kernel alignment on those views constructed by the proposed method are verified.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2017.09.060", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2760495993", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208208196", "52192468", "203170417", "4409059", "208013406"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25005564"}

Hence a system which could classify these documents with acceptable accuracy would be of an unfathomable help in document engineering. We have created multiple classifiers for document classification and compared their accuracy on raw and processed data. We have garnered data used in a corporate organization as well as publicly available data for comparison. Data is processed by removing the stop-words and stemming is implemented to produce root words. Multiple traditional machine learning techniques like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random forest Classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron are used for classification of documents. Classifiers are applied on raw and processed data separately and their accuracy is noted.

In this thesis, we provide tools for estimating and understanding the treatment heterogeneity.Chapter 1 introduces a unifying framework for many estimators of the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE), a function that describes the treatment heterogeneity. We introduce meta-learners as algorithms that can be combined with any machine learning/regression method to estimate the CATE. We also propose a new meta-learner, the X-learner, that can adapt to structural properties such as the smoothness and sparsity of the underlying treatment effect. We then present its desirable properties through simulations and theory and apply it to two field experiments.As part of this thesis, we created an R package, causalToolbox, that implements eight CATE estimators and several tools that are useful to estimate the CATE and understand the underlying causal mechanism. Chapter 2 focuses on the causalToolbox package and explains how the package is structured and implemented. The package uses the same syntax for all implemented CATE estimators. That makes it easy for appliers to switch between estimators and compare different estimators on a given data set. We give examples of how it can be used to find a well-performing estimator for a given data set, how confidence intervals for the CATE can be computed, and how estimating the CATE for a unit with many CATE estimators simultaneously can give practitioners a sense for which estimates are unstable and depend heavily on the chosen estimator. Chapter 3 is an application of the causalToolbox package. It shows how useful it is in a simulation study that has been set up for the Empirical Investigation of Methods for Heterogeneity Workshop at the 2018 Atlantic Causal Inference Conference by Carlos Carvalho, Jennifer Hill, Jared Murray, and Avi Feller, based on the National Study of Learning Mindsets.When implementing the CATE estimators, we noticed that there was a need for a variation of the Random Forests (RF) algorithm that works particularly well for statistical inference. We designed an R package, forestry, that implements a new version of the RF algorithm and several tools for statistical inference with it. In Chapter 4, we describe the problem that confidence interval estimation with RF can perform poorly in areas where RF are biased or in areas outside of the support of the training data. We then introduce a new method that allows us to screen for points for which our confidence intervals methods should not be used. CATE estimates can be used to assign treatments to subjects, but in many studies, estimating the CATE is not the ultimate goal. Researchers often want to understand the underlying causal mechanisms. In Chapter 5, we discuss a modification of the RF algorithm that is particularly interpretable and allows practitioners to understand the underlying mechanism better. Usually, RF are based on deep regression trees that are difficult to understand. In this new version of the RF, we use linear response functions and very shallow trees to make the results more easily understandable. The algorithm finds splits in quasi-linear time and locally adapts to the smoothness of the underlying response functions. In an experimental study, we show that it leads to shallow and interpretable trees that compare favorably to other regression estimators on a broad range of real-world data sets.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2990473687", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214052701"}

In order to classify the quality of a water resource such as an aquifer, it is necessary that the quality of a large number of water samples be determined, which might be a very time consuming process. The goal of this paper is to classify the water quality using classification algorithms in order to reduce the computational time. The question is whether and to what extent the results of the classification algorithms are different. Another question is what method provides the most accurate results. In this regard, this paper investigates and compares the performance of three supervised methods of classification including support vector machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) for water quality classification. Using two performance evaluation statistics including error rate and error value, the efficiency of the algorithms is investigated. Furthermore, a 5-fold cross validation is performed to assess the effect of data value on the performance of the applied algorithms. Results demonstrate that the SVM algorithm presents the best performance with no errors in calibration and validation phases. The KNN algorithm, having the most total number and total value of errors, is the weakest one for classification of water quality data.

It has become apparent in the past few years that, as much as discovering vulnerabilities in the power network, accurate simulations are very critical. This study explores a classification method for validating simulation models, using disturbance measurements from phasor measurement units (PMU). The technique used employs the Random Forest learning algorithm to find a correlation between specific model parameter changes, and the variations in the dynamic response. Also, the measurements used for building and evaluating the classifiers were characterized using Prony decomposition. The generator model, consisting of an exciter, governor, and its standard parameters have been validated using short circuit faults. Single-error classifiers were first tested, where the accuracies of the classifiers built using positive, negative, and zero sequence measurements were compared. The negative sequence measurements have consistently produced the best classifiers, with majority of the parameter classes attaining F-measure accuracies greater than 90%. A multiple-parameter error technique for validation has also been developed and tested on standard generator parameters. Only a few target parameter classes had good accuracies in the presence of multiple parameter errors, but the results were enough to permit a sequential process of validation, where elimination of a highly detectable error can improve the accuracy of suspect errors dependent on the former\u2019s removal, and continuing the procedure until all corrections are covered.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1603717448", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60632218"}

A few existing works approached this by learning either d2 \u00d7 p or d \u00d7 k transformation matrix for d\u00d7 d SPD matrices. Different from these methods, this paper proposes a new member to the family of distance metric learning for SPD matrices. It learns only d parameters to adjust the eigenvalues of the SPD matrices through an efficient optimisation scheme. Also, it is shown that the proposed method can be interpreted as learning a sample-specific transformation matrix, instead of the fixed transformation matrix learned for all the samples in the existing works. The optimised d parameters can be used to massage the SPD matrices for better discrimination while still keeping them in the original space. From this perspective, the proposed method complements, rather than competes with, the existing linear-transformation-based methods, as the latter can always be applied to the output of the former to perform distance metric learning in further.

To maximize the accuracy of TVM, twin vectors are adjusted during the training phase to approximate the data distribution near the decision boundary. Given a new training example, TVM is updated in three steps. First, the new example is added as a new twin vector if it is near the decision boundary. If this happens, two twin vectors are selected and merged into a single twin vector to maintain the budget. Finally, TVM is updated by incremental and decremental learning to account for the change. Several methods for twin vector merging were proposed and experimentally evaluated. TVMs were thoroughly tested on 12 large data sets. In most cases, the accuracy of low-budget TVMs was comparable to the state of the art resource-unconstrained SVMs. Additionally, the TVM accuracy was substantially larger than that of SVM trained on a random sample of the same size.

Classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning models have been widely used to solve the traffic classification task. However, training such models requires a large amount of labeled data. Labeling data is often the most difficult and time-consuming process in building a classifier. To solve this challenge, we reformulate the traffic classification into a multi-task learning framework where bandwidth requirement and duration of a flow are predicted along with the traffic class. The motivation of this approach is twofold: First, bandwidth requirement and duration are useful in many applications, including routing, resource allocation, and QoS provisioning. Second, these two values can be obtained from each flow easily without the need for human labeling or capturing flows in a controlled and isolated environment. We show that with a large amount of easily obtainable data samples for bandwidth and duration prediction tasks, and only a few data samples for the traffic classification task, one can achieve high accuracy.

Experimental results show that features learned using deep convolutional StochasticNets, with fewer neural connections than conventional deep convolutional neural networks, can allow for better or comparable classification accuracy than conventional deep neural networks: relative test error decrease of ~4.5% for classification on the STL-10 dataset and ~1% for classification on the SVHN dataset. Furthermore, it was shown that the deep features extracted using deep convolutional StochasticNets can provide comparable classification accuracy even when only 10% of the training data is used for feature learning.

The methodology presented combines, within a unified framework, surrogate distillation column models based on artificial neural networks, feasibility constraints constructed using a support vector machine, and pinch analysis to maximize heat recovery, in order to optimize the distillation column configuration and its operating conditions. The inputs to the surrogate column model are given by the column structure and operating conditions, while the outputs are related to the column performance. The support vector machine classifier filters infeasible design alternatives from the search space, thus reducing computational time, and ultimately improves the quality of the final solution. The overall optimization problem takes the form of a mixed-integer nonlinear program, which is solved by a genetic algorithm that seeks the design and operating variables values that minimize the total annualized cost. The capabilities of the proposed approach are illustrated using an industrially\u2013relevant case study. Numerical results show that promising design alternatives can be obtained using the proposed method. The approach can help engineers to design and operate petroleum refineries optimally, where these are expected to continue to play a major role in the energy mix for some years.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cherd.2018.03.006", "venue": null, "journal": "Chemical Engineering Research & Design", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2793177228", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": ["14682896", "18267806", "107355616", "196832404", "60723605", "119901764", "118031323", "109786029", "60848482", "2319118", "110210764", "98937845", "116717458", "56378134", "10853966", "1051744", "109582627", "96077300", "17886738", "46100169", "101295627", "98549801", "98160166", "97269855", "99455993", "29228706", "61603791", "7849237", "109955202", "7138354", "107132473", "111367169", "96623466"], "inbound_citations": ["127785247", "53497772"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:103672955"}

To address these modeling limitations, a decision-support tool framework was conceived that predicts sediment contamination from the sub-estuary to broader estuary extent. For this study, a Random Forest (RF) model was implemented to predict the distribution of a model contaminant, triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) (TCS), in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. TCS is an unregulated contaminant used in many personal care products. The RF explanatory variables were associated with TCS transport and fate (proxies) and direct and indirect environmental entry. The continuous RF TCS concentration predictions were discretized into three levels of contamination (low, medium, and high) for three different quantile thresholds. The RF model explained 63% of the variance with a minimum number of variables. Total organic carbon (TOC) (transport and fate proxy) was a strong predictor of TCS contamination causing a mean squared error increase of 59% when compared to permutations of randomized values of TOC. Additionally, combined sewer overflow discharge (environmental entry) and sand (transport and fate proxy) were strong predictors. The discretization models identified a TCS area of greatest concern in the northern reach of Narragansett Bay (Providence River sub-estuary), which was validated with independent test samples. This decision-support tool performed well at the sub-estuary extent and provided the means to identify areas of concern and prioritize bay-wide sampling.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5524344", "pubmed_id": "28738089", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0179473", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2738247240", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["27822014", "34558488", "25727878", "206933729", "133701204", "97055576", "10305464", "23092001", "21324860", "129442438", "43308146", "93109655", "73622367", "25657298", "32921249", "36656381", "30854908", "31310220", "33816435", "95656189", "140688914", "13294468", "93349929", "24728277", "20025587", "25579492", "89141", "3626971", "118037410", "129532064", "55911890", "131066758", "22967751", "128679058", "13597560", "24579134", "21143604", "16036351", "84140345", "31135429", "121034351", "84981014", "14145935", "46271948", "18600099", "15990725", "10892450", "55691142", "8397120", "14864905", "83227104"], "inbound_citations": ["201124800", "86716952", "155700050", "143434023", "214783721"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6165453"}

Our hierarchical prediction strategy first predicts the point wait time of a job using dynamic k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) method. It then performs a multi-class classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) among all the classes of the jobs. The probabilities given by the SVM for the class predicted using k-NN and its neighboring classes are used to provide a set of ranges of predicted wait times with probabilities. We have used these predictions and probabilities in a meta-scheduling strategy that distributes jobs to different queues/sites in a multi-queue/grid environment for minimizing wait times of the jobs.

The discussion focused on the careful consideration of the nature of the knowledge, how it is learned, and the type of task used to tap into that knowledge, with particular emphasis on matching task and knowledge to maximize the probability of observing an influence of both feature correlations and relations.

In traditional intelligent diagnosis methods, however, the features are manually extracted depending on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise. Such processes take advantage of human ingenuity but are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Inspired by the idea of unsupervised feature learning that uses artificial intelligence techniques to learn features from raw data, a two-stage learning method is proposed for intelligent diagnosis of machines. In the first learning stage of the method, sparse filtering, an unsupervised two-layer neural network, is used to directly learn features from mechanical vibration signals. In the second stage, softmax regression is employed to classify the health conditions based on the learned features. The proposed method is validated by a motor bearing dataset and a locomotive bearing dataset, respectively. The results show that the proposed method obtains fairly high diagnosis accuracies and is superior to the existing methods for the motor bearing dataset.

Developmental psychology is ready to blossom into a modern science that focuses on causal mechanistic explanations of development rather than just describing and classifying behaviors. Computational modeling is the key to this process. However, to be effective, models must not only mimic observed data. They must also be transparent, grounded, and plausible to be accepted by the developmental psychology community. Connectionist model provides one such example.

Automatic modulation classification (AMC) plays a pivotal role in most of these technologies. AMC for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems is a domain that still lacks the due attention. Keeping in view the recent advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, we propose two relatively simple neural network architectures, i.e., Sparse Autoencoders(SAE) based Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) for AMC of Space-Time-Block-Codes(STBC)-MIMO systems. An assorted set of features is proposed on the basis of distribution analysis to train these classifiers.

The impact of channel estimation error on the classification outcome is thoroughly investigated for blind classification scenarios. Performance comparison of the proposed methods with one of the most recent works in this context validates the effectiveness of proposed features and classifiers. Moreover, comparison with optimal Maximum-Likelihood(ML) based classifier and state of the art machine learning algorithms including, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is also carried out.

These methods exploit the capability of computers to search huge amounts of data in a fast and effective manner. However, the data to be analyzed is imprecise and afflicted with uncertainty. In the case of heterogeneous data sources such as text, audio and video, the data might moreover be ambiguous and partly conflicting. Besides, patterns and relationships of interest are usually vague and approximate. Thus, in order to make the information mining process more robust or say, human-like methods for searching and learning it requires tolerance towards imprecision, uncertainty and exceptions. Thus, they have approximate reasoning capabilities and are capable of handling partial truth. Properties of the aforementioned kind are typical soft computing. Soft computing techniques like Genetic Algorithms (GA), Artificial Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, Rough Sets and Support Vector Machines (SVM) when used in combination was found to be effective. Therefore, soft computing algorithms are used to accomplish data mining across different applications (Mitra S, Pal S K & Mitra P, 2002; Alex A Freitas, 2002).

As a building block, it is now well positioned to be part of a larger system that tackles real-life multimedia tasks. An unresolved issue is that such model is trained on a static snapshot of data. Instead, this paper positions the training as a continuous learning process as new classes of data arrive. A system with such capability is useful in practical scenarios, as it gradually expands its capacity to predict increasing number of new classes. It is also our attempt to address the more fundamental issue: a good learning system must deal with new knowledge that it is exposed to, much as how human do. We developed a training algorithm that grows a network not only incrementally but also hierarchically. Classes are grouped according to similarities, and self-organized into levels.

This proposed method consists of two modules: 1) extraction of histogram of oriented gradient variant (HOGv) feature and 2) a single classifier trained by extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. The presented HOGv feature keeps a good balance between redundancy and local details such that it can represent distinctive shapes better. The classifier is a single-hidden-layer feedforward network. Based on ELM algorithm, the connection between input and hidden layers realizes the random feature mapping while only the weights between hidden and output layers are trained. As a result, layer-by-layer tuning is not required. Meanwhile, the norm of output weights is included in the cost function. Therefore, the ELM-based classifier can achieve an optimal and generalized solution for multiclass TSR. Furthermore, it can balance the recognition accuracy and computational cost. Three datasets, including the German TSR benchmark dataset, the Belgium traffic sign classification dataset and the revised mapping and assessing the state of traffic infrastructure (revised MASTIF) dataset, are used to evaluate this proposed method.

It is implemented for pain relief and joint function restoration. There is an increasing expectation from patients concerning post-operative performance [1]. However, TKA patients often experience functional impairment such as movement, loading, and muscle activation pattern abnormalities [2]. This project focused on identifying temporal differences in muscle activations in lower limb electromyographs (EMG) between healthy persons and TKA patients, using wavelet patterns and machine learning classification. METHODS Ten post-surgical female TKA patients (TKA: 19\u00b13 months post-surgery; 61.9\u00b18.8 yrs; BMI 28.0\u00b15.3) and 9 healthy age matched female controls (CON: 61.4\u00b17.4 yrs; BMI 25.6\u00b12.4) participated in this study. EMGs for 7 lower leg muscles during both level walking and stair climbing were collected. Muscles of interest were: tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius (GAS), semitendinosus (SEM), biceps femoris (BF), rectus femoris (RF), vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL). Five acceptable EMG trials per subject were selected for analysis, normalized in time (stance phase \u00b130%) and processed in Matlab using a wavelet transform [3]. EMG data were normalized to the total signal intensity. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification was performed for all subjects using an iterative thresholding approach and leave-one-out cross-validation. Rates of classification (called recognition rates) were deemed significant if they were greater than or equal to 68.4% (according to binomial test). SVM discriminants were visualized to aid in the identification of functional differences between CON and TKA groups. RESULTS Mean multi muscle patterns (MMPs) for walking (Figure 1) demonstrate substantive differences between groups. The muscles that gave significant recognition rates in level walking were: VM (68.4%) and BF (73.7%); and in stair climbing were: BF (84.2%), SEM (73.7%), GAS (68.4%), and TA (68.4%). DISCUSSION Application of a SVM with iterative thresholding provided significant recognition rates between groups, for both walking and stair-stepping tasks. The stepping task was characterized by a greater number of muscles with significant recognition rates, as well as the highest recognition rates. Temporal activation differences, indicative of muscle co-activation by TKA subjects, were observable in the discriminant pattern. In walking, BF and VM were active in mid-stance, illustrated as a red activity pattern in the discriminant. BF activity shifted from pre-HS to post-HS to coincide with the main activity in the quadriceps muscles (VL, VM, RF). Similarly, in stair climbing, TA displayed a co-activation with GAS at mid-stance. Further, SEM and BF displayed pronounced activation patterns at mid-stance and at TO and early swing. This may indicate an activation strategy to assist in hip extension for the TKA group. CONCLUSION The analysis approach chosen in this study identified functional differences between healthy subjects and TKA patients. There is evidence for the employment of co-activation strategy by the TKA group in both walking and stair climbing.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Undergraduate Research in Alberta", "mag_id": "2803384409", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:81685144"}

In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method using generative adversarial networks (GAN). It can complement and complete the data manifold and find better margins between neighboring classes. Specifically, we design a framework with a CNN model as the classifier and a cycle-consistent adversarial networks (CycleGAN) as the generator.

On the other hand, a compositional method can fail if a MWE is non-compositional. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method to learn the representation of MWEs from their external context and component words with a compositionality constraint. This method can make use of both the external context and component words. Instead of simply combining the two kinds of information, we use compositionality measure from lexical semantics to serve as the constraint.

The goal of this tutorial is to provide a basic understanding of the ideas behind kernel methods sufficient to allow practical application of the methods and to provide background for those interested in researching further into the subject. First we will use an intuitive geometric examination of SVM classification to introduce SVMs and understand the principals behind them. We will provide intuitions behind the extensive statistical learning theory underlying the approach without going into mathematical detail. Then, we will use case studies in regression and principal component analysis to show how these basic principals can be applied to make practical robust nonlinear versions of other linear inference methods. The power and flexibility of kernel methods comes from their ability to easily use different kernel functions. We will investigate how by changing kernel functions, the same kernel method can be applied to both traditional vector data as well as non-vector data such as strings and graphs. We will then examine some of the practical issues in support vector machines such as parameter selection, algorithms, and software. We will conclude with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of kernel methods. Outline: I. What are Support Vector Machine and Kernel Methods? II. Intuitive guide to SVM Classification a.

Specifically, the proposed method provides a geological model with high vertical resolution and optimized by the Zeoppritz function, introducing logging and seismic data simultaneously.

The proposed method presents the three-flow architecture of DeGAN to balance the contributions of three neural network models and utilizes this strategy in an offshore area successfully. By introducing multiple data sets, density experiments demonstrate that this approach can provide density profile with super-resolution for revealing possible thin layers, and the frequency distribution is in accord with loggings.

There is no doubt in my mind that this is a remarkable and outstanding piece of work. ::: ::: In his thesis Kristian has made an assault on one of the hardest integration problems at the heart of Artificial Intelligence research. This involves taking three disparate major areas of research and attempting a fusion among them. The three areas are: Logic Programming, Uncertainty Reasoning and Machine Learning. Every one of these is a major sub-area of research with its own associated international research conferences. Having taken on such a Herculean task, Kristian has produced a series of widely published results which are now at the core of a newly emerging area: Probabilistic Inductive Logic Programming. The new area is closely tied to, though strictly subsumes, a new field known as \u201cStatistical Relational Learning\u201d which has in the last few years gained major prominence in the American Artificial Intelligence research community. ::: ::: Within his thesis Kristian makes several major contributions, many of which have already been published in refereed conference and journal papers. Firstly, Kristian introduces a series of definitions which circumscribe the new area formed by extending Inductive Logic Programming to the case in which clauses are annotated with probability values. This represents a new and powerful framework which supersedes a number of influential papers and research areas in Artificial Intelligence. Secondly, Kristian introduces Bayesian Logic Programs (BLPs). These represent an elegantly defined lifting of Judea Pearl's Bayesian networks to the logic programming level. Since Kristian's introduction of BLPs, a number of results indicate that BLPs generalise many previously defined representations, not the least of which are Bayesian networks, Logic Programs, Probabilistic Relation Models and Stochastic Logic Programs. Next Kristian investigates the approach of Learning from proofs. This is an interesting new learning framework which is the first to go beyond the two standard semantic frameworks of Inductive Logic Programming. ::: ::: Kristian then looks at the problem of upgrading HMMs to logical HMMs. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are one of the most widely used machine learning technologies in Statistical Linguistics and Bioinformatics, and allow the representation of probabilistic finite automata. Kristian has upgraded standard HMMs to allow relational descriptions to be included within the description of the automata. The three standard HMM estimation algorithms are also upgraded. He has demonstrated the power of such representations using biological predictive modelling problems, and shown performance increases over alternative approaches. ::: ::: Kristian next considers the issue of upgrading Fisher Kernels to Relational Fisher kernels. Fisher kernels have been widely used within statistics and more recently in support vector machines. Building on his previous approaches involving lifting propositional representations Kristian shows how relations can be usefully included within this context. The approach was empirically tested on protein fold prediction and shown to have high predictive accuracy relative to logical HMMs. ::: ::: Lastly, Kristian introduces Markov decision programs. As a final demonstration of his general approach Kristian shows how temporal descriptions involving action can be introduced by lifting Markov decision processes to logical Markov decision programs. Kristian demonstrates how these can be learned using relational reinforcement algorithms which he tests empirically in a Blocks World setting. ::: ::: In summary, this thesis represents an extremely powerful and wide-ranging study which has made strong contributions right across the intellectual landscape. Both Kristian and his thesis supervisor Luc De Raedt, should be highly commended for this important contribution. ::: ::: London, July 2006, Stephen H.

Experimental data from a hydrodesulfurization (HDS) setup were collected to validate the proposed SVR model. The SVR model yields better performances both in accuracy and computation time (CT) for predicting the sulfur quality with hyper parameters optimized by HMH algorithms.

Detecting congestion and communicating it in a timely manner may enable a number of mitigation strategies such as re-directing traffic as well as individuals adopting alternate routes or transportation methods. We seek to crowd-source road congestion information detected on individual user's smart phones as a low-cost approach for such detection. To encourage users to participate in such crowd-sourcing, it is critical that the information is collected conveniently, with as little user action required as possible, and the use of low-cost sensors that would be ubiquitously available on smart phones. Moreover, unlike the use of GPS, the use of these sensors should consume very little energy, thus resulting in minimal drain on the phone's battery. We propose using the barometer sensor present in mobile phones to detect traffic congestion. Roads which seem perfectly flat to naked eye actually vary in altitude at different points along the way. The barometer sensor is sensitive enough to measure these altitude changes. On a congested road, a vehicle covers a much shorter distance over a time period. A vehicle experiences a significantly larger number of altitude changes on a free flowing road compared to a congested road. This forms the basis for our traffic congestion detection. We extract features based on the altitude change and use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier to initially classify into two broad categories of vehicular state: still and in motion. The sequence of vehicle states is then used to determine the traffic condition. Traffic condition is categorized into 3 states: \u2018stuck\u2019, \u2018congestion\u2019 and \u2018moving\u2019, based on chosen thresholds for the number of still/motion states. To validate the state determination by our RoadSphygmo1 algorithm, we compared it with the GPS speeds during the same time period. While the thresholds we chose are not exact measures of traffic state, they nevertheless provide useful information about the congestion on the road.

Companies try to commercialize these data using data mining or machine learning methods. For this purpose, the data are often categorized or classified, but many times at high (monetary or temporal) cost. An effective approach to reduce these cost is to apply any kind of active learning (AL) methods, as AL controls the training process of a classifier by specifically querying individual data points (samples), which are then labeled (e.g., provided with class memberships) by a domain expert. However, an analysis of current AL research shows that AL still has some shortcomings. In particular, structure information given by the spatial pattern of the (un)labeled data in the input space of a classification (e.g., cluster information), is used in an insufficient way. To meet this challenge, this article presents a new approach for AL based on support vector machines (SVM) for classification.

These measurements are generated continuously and in a very high fluctuating data rates. Examples include sensor networks, web logs, and computer network traffic. The storage, querying and mining of such data sets are highly computationally challenging tasks. Mining data streams is concerned with extracting knowledge structures represented in models and patterns in non stopping streams of information. The research in data stream mining has gained a high attraction due to the importance of its applications and the increasing generation of streaming information. Applications of data stream analysis can vary from critical scientific and astronomical applications to important business and financial ones. Algorithms, systems and frameworks that address streaming challenges have been developed from the past few years. This paper presents a system for induction of forest of functional trees from data streams able to detect concept drift. The Ultra Fast Forest of Trees (UFFT)is an incremental algorithm, which works online, processing each example in constant time, and performing a single scan over the training examples. It uses analytical techniques to choose the splitting criteria, and the information gain to estimate the merit of each possible splitting-test. For multi-class problems the algorithm builds a binary tree for each possible pair of classes, leading to a forest of trees. Decision nodes and leaves contain naive-Bayes classifiers playing different roles during the induction process. Naive-Bayes in leaves are used to classify test examples. Naive-Bayes in inner nodes play two different roles. They can be used as multivariate splitting-tests if chosen by the splitting criteria, and used to detect changes in the classdistribution of the examples that traverse the node. When a change in the class-distribution is detected,all the subtree rooted at that node will be pruned. The use of naiveBayes classifiers at leaves to classify test examples, the use of splitting-tests based on the outcome of naive-Bayes, and the use of naive-Bayes classifiers at decision nodes to detect changes in the distribution of the examples are directly obtained from the sufficient statistics required to compute the splitting criteria, without no additional computations. This aspect is a main advantage in the context of high-speed data streams. This methodology was tested with artificial and real-world data sets. The experimental results show a very good performance in comparison to a batch decision tree learner, and high capacity to detect drift in the distribution of the examples.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2109161140", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16830886"}

The operator psi is a composition of nullnorms. Based on input-output data, the learning procedure proposed here adjusts not only the weights associated with the individual inputs of the nullneurons, but also the type of the nullneuron in the network (AND or OR) learning the value of parameter u. Adjustment of u is done individually and after learning each nullneuron can be either a AND neuron or a OR neuron, independently of the state of the remaining nullneurons.

The Sinop Nuclear Power Plant consist of four different reactors. The construction of the first unit is expected to be completed by 2023, and the fourth unit is planned to be activated by 2028. On the other hand, the construction of the nuclear power plant will alter the land use at the actual plant site and its surroundings and hence may cause significant environmental changes. As an indicator, more than 650000 trees have been cut so far for the construction of nuclear power plant, and this can adversely affect the ecological balances of the region by endangering habitats and creating ecological damages. The aim of this study is to analyse the land use/land cover changes (LULC) in the forestry-dominated areas due to the construction of nuclear power plants using the multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical satellite images.

A similar strategy suggests itself in the subsequent stage when speech is produced from the intermediate representation, which makes it possible to bypass a symbolic, phonemic stage in the overall system, once trained. (This second stage is dealt with in a later chapter.) Error can still be calculated in terms of phonemes correct, but this is not necessarily a good measure of the naturalness and acceptability of the output speech. In contrast to other trainable text-to-speech systems, emphasis is laid here on the fundamental importance of phonetic and phonological sources of variability, and their separation from the underlying physical and temporal events.

The problem of feature selection is multi-objective in nature and hence optimizing feature subsets with respect to any single evaluation criteria is not sufficient [1]. Moreover, discovering a single best subset of features is not of much interest. In fact, finding several feature subsets reflecting a trade off among several objective criteria is more beneficial as it provides the users a broad choice for feature subset selection. Thus, in order to combine several feature selection criteria, we propose multi-objective optimization of feature subsets using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm. This work is an attempt to discover non-dominated feature subsets of smaller cardinality with high predictive power and least redundancy. To meet this purpose we have used NSGA II, a well known Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), for discovering non-dominated feature subsets for the task of classification. The main contribution of this paper is the design of a novel multi-objective fitness function consisting of information gain, mutual correlation and size of the feature subset as the multi-optimization criteria. The suggested approach is validated on seven datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. Support Vector Machine, a well tested classification algorithm is used to measure the classification accuracy.

Subjects suffering from AUD are prone to various diseases, psychological and cognitive issues if not identified and treated timely. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used to record the internal structure and activity of the brain. The manual screening of EEG signals for AUD detection is complicated for practitioners because EEG signals are recorded in microvolts (\u03bcv) and consists of the inherent internal complexity of the brain. Therefore, an automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is used for assisting the medical practitioner in AUD screening process. The recorded EEG signals of a subject are nonlinear and oscillatory, and CAD methods examine these signals in their frequency sub-bands. In this paper, flexible analytical wavelets transform (FAWT) based machine learning models are proposed for automated alcoholism detection. In the proposed methodology, EEG signals are decomposed into approximate and detailed wavelet coefficients using FAWT. The statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness, and Shannon entropy are extracted from the selected wavelet coefficients. The features are fed to the various machine learning models including Least Square -Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes learners for training. The training and testing are performed using 10-fold cross-validation. The performance of models is evaluated using all essential measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, precision, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and ROC. The results suggest that LS-SVM using polynomial kernel performed best with accuracy 99.17%, Sensitivity 99.17%, and Specificity as 99.44% using 10-fold cross-validation technique.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bspc.2018.10.017", "venue": "Biomed.

In the case of the target variables exhibit statistical dependencies among them, a multi-target modelling permits to improve the predictive accuracy of a regressor. Apart from describing the dependencies among the targets, the multi-target approaches could offer better performance and less overfit than traditional single-target methods. A group of multi-target regression methods have already addressed this demand with success. However, by modifying the Multi-Target Regressor Stacking (MTRS) from a single layer to a deep structure, we improved the prediction capability, and by an asynchronous tracking we could exploit the dependency of each target individually. This paper presents the novel method Deep Structure for Tracking Asynchronous Regressor Stack (DSTARS) and compares its performance to MTRS, Ensemble of Regressor Chain (ERC) and the independent regression by single-target (ST). As base-learners were used Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) to investigate the prediction capability of the different family of machine learning algorithms.

Machine-learning based approaches are promising for the online SOH estimation. This paper proposes a machine-learning based algorithm for the online SOH estimation of Li-ion battery. A predictive diagnosis model used in the algorithm is established based on support vector machine (SVM). The support vectors, which reflects the intrinsic characteristics of the Li-ion battery, are determined from the charging data of fresh cells. Furthermore, the coefficients of the SVMs for cells at different SOH are identified once the support vectors are determined. The algorithm functions by comparing partial charging curves with the stored SVMs. Similarity factor is defined after comparison to quantify the SOH of the data under evaluation. The operation of the algorithm only requires partial charging curves, e.g., 15 min charging curves, making fast on-board diagnosis of battery SOH into reality. The partial charging curves can be intercepted from a wide range of voltage section, thereby relieving the pain that there is little chance that the driver charges the battery pack from a predefined state-of-charge. Train, validation, and test are conducted for two commercial Li-ion batteries with Li(NiCoMn)1/3O2 cathode and graphite anode, indicating that the algorithm can estimate the battery SOH with less than 2% error for 80% of all the cases, and less than 3% error for 95% of all the cases.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TVT.2019.2927120", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2963691557", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["109081405", "27836962", "102562936", "110858260", "11252699", "40563194", "6924814", "22645698", "206818861", "114717100", "23593858", "9481320", "108575818", "110924941", "115065058", "18715389", "26170791", "102493388", "53285510", "52304783", "125611379", "31824773", "102606679", "21667175", "27742766", "6038807", "37386750", "114524669", "108622547", "49864704", "301636", "30368527", "102417189", "70123234", "116843689", "110940521", "104343713"], "inbound_citations": ["215722554", "212634884", "214624448"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199585502"}
{"paper_id": "8431282", "title": "Elaboration Tolerance of Logical Theories", "authors": [{"first": "Eyal", "middle": [], "last": "Amir", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "We consider the development and modification of logical theories (e.g., commonsense theories). During development of such knowledge bases (KBs) a knowledge engineer makes some design and modeling choices. These decisions may later force the KB to undergo some redesign and rewriting when new knowledge needs to be integrated. We then say that the KB lacks Elaboration Tolerance. (McCarthy 1998) illustrated this problem using example elaborations for the toy problem of the Missionaries and Cannibals. The influence of representation on elaboration tolerance is not well understood at present (see (Gogic et al. 1995)). In fact, unlike many other development tasks, there is no model for the development of logical theories in general and commonsense theories in particular. We investigate elaboration tolerance in two complementary directions: (1) We model the development logical theories, and explore the theoretical properties of change in our model; and (2) We develop a knowledge representation system that follows the intuitions arising from knowledge and software engineering. On the theoretical front, we have defined a measure of syntactic distance between formal systems (Amir 1998). This measure counts the number of the operations of add axiom and remove axiom that one must do to transform one knowledge base to be logically equivalent to another. Comparing various reformulations of KBs, we found that (1) some reformulations can make a knowledge base have a shorter syntactic distance to all theories, but in the extreme a price must be paid in terms of the size of the resulting theory and language; and (2) changing the entaihnent relation does not have such a drastic impact on syntactic distance. Currently, we are working on expanding our theoretical model to an Oracle-based search (somewhat similar to some Inductive Logic Programming models). In this model, the Oracle is expected to answer whether the current node is the goal node and, if not, what sentence should hold that does not (or vice versa).

The contributions of this paper are three fold. First, we propose a novel supervised autoencoder that is able to capture the high-level identity feature despite of pose variations. Second, we enrich the identity features by replacing the target values of conventional autoencoders with random signals (RFs in this paper), which are unique for each subject under different poses. Third, we further improve the performance of the framework by incorporating deep convolutional neural network facial descriptors and linking discriminative identity features from different RFs for the augmented identity features. Finally, we conduct face identification experiments on Multi-PIE database, and face verification experiments on labeled faces in the wild and YouTube Face databases, where face recognition rate and verification accuracy with Receiver Operating Characteristic curves are rendered.

Although an adequate model when dealing with limited data, the capacity of RAAM to scale-up to real-world tasks has been frequently questioned. RAAM networks are difficult to train (due to the moving target effect) and as such training times can be lengthy. Investigations into RAAM have produced many variants in an attempt to overcome such limitations.

Allocating water absorption of each sublayer by dividing coefficient or numeric simulation cannot accurately reflect the actual water injection of the reservoir. Calculation based on water absorption profile monitored on site is the most commonly used method in oil field. However, access to these type of data is limited due to its cost and time related to acquisition. In this study, a machine learning approach was adopted to predict water absorption in sublayer based on geologic and production parameters of injectors and producers. On the one hand, it can save test costs. On the other hand, it can continuously predict water absorption of sublayers, and make up for water injection wells with insufficient injection profiles. A handful of training observations are obtained from on-site monitoring. Interwell connectivity is first conducted to identify connected producers for injectors. Introducing interwell connectivity helps to constitute predictor variables and yield significant improvements in feature selection. Connectivities in the well group are represented by similarity between injection sequence and production sequence, which is computed by Dynamic Time Warping. Average importance of predictors are then measured based on Mean Decrease Impurity, Mean Decrease Accuracy, and Ridge regression. Some relative important features are selected to consist the final predictors. The Extreme Gradient Boosting model is developed and then trained for making predictions given any set of observations. The proposed approach is validated by using actual field case from SL oilfield, China.

In this work, an automated and effective supervised classification framework is presented for classifying high-resolution remote sensing data. Specifically, the presented method proceeds in three main stages: feature extraction, classification, and classified result refinement. In the feature extraction stage, both multispectral images and 3D geometry data are used, which utilizes the complementary information from multisource data. In the classification stage, to tackle the problems associated with too many training samples and take full advantage of the information in the large-scale dataset, a random forest (RF) ensemble learning strategy is proposed by combining several RF classifiers together. Finally, an improved fully connected conditional random field (FCCRF) graph model is employed to derive the contextual information to refine the classification results.

We incorporate this dependency using stochastic modeling of the context as a Markov Random Field (MRF). The MRF is modeled using Besag model and implemented using the Iterative Conditional Modes (ICM) algorithm.

To investigate the underlying synaptic mechanism, we considered a spiking neuron model of decision making endowed with synaptic plasticity that follows a reward-dependent stochastic Hebbian learning rule. This general model is tested in a matching task in which rewards on two targets are scheduled randomly with different rates. Our main results are threefold. First, we show that plastic synapses provide a natural way to integrate past rewards and estimate the local (in time) \u201creturn\u201d of a choice. Second, our model reproduces the matching behavior (i.e., the proportional allocation of choices matches the relative reinforcement obtained on those choices, which is achieved through melioration in individual trials). Our model also explains the observed \u201cundermatching\u201d phenomenon and points to biophysical constraints (such as finite learning rate and stochastic neuronal firing) that set the limits to matching behavior. Third, although our decision model is an attractor network exhibiting winner-take-all competition, it captures graded neural spiking activities observed in LIP, when the latter were sorted according to the choices and the difference in the returns for the two targets. These results suggest that neurons in LIP are involved in selecting the oculomotor responses, whereas rewards are integrated and stored elsewhere, possibly by plastic synapses and in the form of the return rather than income of choice options.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6674121", "pubmed_id": "16597727", "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5159-05.2006", "venue": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2062444449", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["118789246", "2017979", "323396", "39262142", "35971282", "14280188", "53307075", "9504238", "1812797", "1645864", "10850460", "143576906", "5508840", "13321487", "14597875", "7019461", "2981869", "23371104", "10867460", "8044092", "118426325", "142067840", "29190836", "15782283", "83616697", "6991397", "7973600", "3015126", "7120657", "2138784", "12446725", "13882677", "193147", "17642980", "4389701", "17453150", "4400823", "1111976", "12499466", "7489407", "2694048", "1030047", "206088928", "11534967", "13953649", "10807316", "272332", "28405980", "1607914", "1876245", "9166388", "208973001", "37289161", "389468"], "inbound_citations": ["6840119", "18503444", "215534736", "14112215", "14923268", "26932160", "217294", "6188352", "2889335", "31098684", "14046264", "20600902", "2230321", "6527908", "15333833", "8403076", "199637353", "6210453", "7133914", "10135616", "14977865", "11642999", "3057815", "25111582", "195837511", "3048163", "14710020", "215683869", "89616764", "3752899", "196636889", "584644", "8456019", "40981992", "15148650", "53020077", "15738338", "8966366", "21346305", "215531524", "17437160", "9666559", "17879699", "46748902", "37482163", "24550736", "151772124", "29976184", "6966240", "12568805", "7413567", "929067", "6066890", "1716856", "212640500", "215579154", "207218659", "49429161", "2963016", "16968229", "14277013", "3029258", "16469921", "215297521", "15730781", "9614583", "1114478", "7891708", "155545", "5987631", "44106653", "17008550", "13400417", "14730196", "210704085", "170078439", "7058234", "8240634", "19183823", "10946836"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17347562"}

Recent studies on self-thinning focus on understanding how the variability arises and are dedicated to a broader theory, with different biotic and abiotic factors suggested to explain the variability of the self-thinning line. However, the relative role and importance of different factors in altering the self-thinning line are still unclear. Using a generic individual-based model which simultaneously implements different modes (symmetric versus asymmetric) of both competition and facilitation among individual plants, we explored the variability of the self-thinning line in simulated plant populations. We employed a machine learning approach (Random Forests) to evaluate the potential effect and importance of seven biotic and abiotic factors (i.e. mode of competition, mode of facilitation, abiotic stress level, initial density, initial spatial distribution pattern, threshold of death and method used for fitting self-thinning lines) on simulated self-thinning lines. Simulations of the individual-based model demonstrated a significant variation in self-thinning lines. Our Random Forests models were able to explain and predict more than 98% of the variation in both the slope and intercept of the self-thinning line. These models identified mode of competition as being the most important factor that alters both the slope and intercept of the self-thinning line. For the variation of slope, other factors were much less important than competition. Most of the factors were more important in altering the intercept rather than the slope of self-thinning line. Changes of the slope and intercept in response to different factors indicated their divergent roles and partial effects on self-thinning mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that different biotic and abiotic factors have distinct effects and importance in altering the self-thinning rule, implying context dependent outcomes and consequences. We highlight that individual-based models and machine learning approaches are powerful tools to evaluate driving factors and to understand hidden mechanisms underlying complex patterns. The joint application of the two powerful tools will help to extend the framework of self-thinning and foster other research in ecology.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.01.019", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Modelling", "mag_id": "2914252488", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204855606", "195764192"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91809562"}

The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features.

One potential approach to address this challenge is to propose a generic and minimal set of functioning domains that captures the experience of individuals and populations with respect to functioning and health. The objective of this investigation was to identify a minimal generic set of ICF domains suitable for describing functioning in adults at both the individual and population levels. We performed a psychometric study using data from: 1) the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998, 2) the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007/2008, and 3) the ICF Core Set studies.

The method is based on electrochemical signals of an array of semiconductor gas sensors. In these sensor signals characteristic patterns of different substances are hidden. There are non-linear correlative relationships between the measured sensor signals and the chemical substances which are treated using two methods derived from statistical learning theory (Support Vector Machine \u2013 SVM, Maximum Likelihood Estimation \u2013 MLE) for the detection of the substance characteristics in the sensor signals. A key criterion for the presented pattern recognition is a newly developed type of features, which is specially adapted to the low frequency signals of semiconductor sensors. The presented features are based on the evaluation of the range of the transient response in the sensor signals in the frequency domain. To derive the new features, both real measurement data and synthetic generated signals were used. In the experiments the focus was set on the creation of reproducible sensor signals to get characteristic signal patterns. Synthetic signals were derived from a Gaussian Plume Model. With the new features, training data sets were calculated using the classification methods SVM and MLE. With these training data sets new sensor measurements may be assigned to the substances which are to be sought. The advantage of the presented method is that no feature reduction is needed and no loss of information occurs in the learning process. The classification results based on the new features have been compared with the classification based on a conventional method for feature extraction. It was proved that the recognition rate of the substances used with the new feature type is higher. The substance classification is primarily limited by the sensitivity of the semiconductor sensors, because sufficiently large sensor signals must have been provided to obtain appropriate substance patterns. At the present stage of development the method presented is suitable for the classification of substance groups, such as nitro aromatics or alcohols, but not for specific substances.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.snb.2011.05.042", "venue": null, "journal": "Sensors and Actuators B-chemical", "mag_id": "2042580708", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["9189641", "56125506", "6535073", "14760936", "8994307", "149956798", "12939093", "40585947", "33055046", "9481690"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:94839013"}

It is natural to enable the systems to look not only for documents but also for experts. In this paper, we study the problem of expert retrieval in enterprise corpora: given a topic, also known as query containing a set of words, identify a rank list of candidate experts who have expertise on the topic. To tackle the problem, we propose an unsupervised semantic two-player minimax game, i.e., our unsupervised semantic generative adversarial networks (USGAN). Unlike almost all the previous generative adversarial networks-based algorithms that require ground truth training data, our USGAN is an unsupervised semantic expert retrieval algorithm that consists of a discriminative network and a generative network aiming at capturing the representations of words and experts in an unsupervised way. Candidates that have similar semantic representations to that of the topic are retrieved as relevant to the topic. Our USGAN would provide inspiration on how to extend the standard GAN and its variants by unsupervised ways to address other retrieval tasks where labelled data are missing.

We conduct a systematic study of the utility of various components in subsequence encoding and propose a method of constructing and deriving segment string embeddings. Extensive experiments on three typical segmentation problems, namely, shallow syntax parsing, named entity recognition, and Chinese word segmentation are conducted. The results show that we can achieve equally-performed subsequence encoding with a three times faster concatenation network compared to previous work. The results also show that the segment string embeddings help our neural semi-CRF model to achieve a macro-averaged error reduction of 13.15% over a strong baseline using deep contextualized embeddings and bidirectional long-short-term memory CRF, which also show the usefulness of semi-CRF even with contextualized embeddings.

There are five main factors which are equipment's, outside temperature, building structure, operating hour and people. Among these factors, temperature will be considered to analyse energy consumption in two different commercial buildings in Malaysia. The motivation to conduct this analysis is to establish the benchmarking of the energy efficiency of the commercial buildings since it has not established yet in Malaysia. In this paper, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has been implemented for energy efficiency analysis. The results of this analysis showed that the energy prediction by using artificial neural network is better than traditional method used by industry which is linear regression where linear regression show the highest error square for both buildings which is 30491.23 for Skywarth and 91738.31 for Skymage building. By comparing the results of two different buildings, we can conclude that outside temperature plays an important role in determining energy consumption of commercialize building.

However, the biomechanical mechanism by which reduced shoe weight improves athletic performance is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of basketball shoe weight on performance and corresponding lower-extremity biomechanics for the example of a 10 m sprint start. ::: Methods: For twenty-two male recreational athletes, sprint start (3.7 m) and 10 m sprint performances were quantified from timing lights in three basketball shoe conditions (light=352 g; medium=510 g; heavy=637 g). Ground reaction forces and kinematics and kinetics of the lower-extremity joints during the first sprinting stride were determined using 3D-motion analysis and a force platform. A Support Vector Machine analysis and linear regression were performed to analyze biomechanical differences between the shoe conditions and their association with performance. Results: Average sprint start and 10 m sprint times in the light shoe were significantly reduced compared to the heavy shoe by up to 24 ms (3%) and 32 ms (1.8%), respectively. The reduction in shoe weight led to significantly different ankle joint biomechanics with a 5% increase in peak plantarflexion velocity in the light shoe that was associated with a decrease in sprint start time. ::: Conclusion: Lighter basketball shoes enhance sprint start performance, likely by facilitating faster ankle plantarflexion during the first sprinting stride.

Optical sensing techniques such as visible-near infrared spectroscopy offer rapid sensing of plant diseases. Although optical sensing methods have few limitations, they offer unique benefits that can greatly aid in citrus disease detection. We have worked on several spectroscopic and imaging techniques to detect citrus diseases, especially HLB.

In this paper, a comparison study is conducted between several new PolSAR speckle reduction methods such as POSSC, PNGF, and ANLM. For this comparison, a 4-look L-band AIRSAR NASA/JPL PolSAR dataset that obtained over an agriculture land from Flevoland, Netherlands, was employed. The de-speckling assessment was completed based on some no-reference quantitative indicators. All the de-speckling methods were evaluated in terms of speckle reduction form homogeneous areas, details, and radiometric preservation, and retaining the polarimetric information. Furthermore, the impact of PolSAR de-speckling on classification was evaluated. For this purpose, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was used to classify H/A/Alpha decomposition. Experimental results showed that the ANLM method was better to suppress the speckle, followed by the PNGF method.

GE has been widely employed to represent syntactic structure of a function or a program in order to satisfy the design objective. As the GE decoding process parses the genotype chromosome into array or list structures with left-order traversal, encoding process could change gene codons or orders after genetic operations. For improving this issue, this paper proposes a novel GE algorithm using tree representation learning (GETRL) and presents three contributions to the original GE, genetic algorithm (GA) and genetic programming (GP). Firstly, GETRL uses a tree-based structure to represent the functions and programs for practical problems. To be different from the traditional GA, GETRL adopts a genotype-to-phenotype encoding process, which transforms the genes structures for tree traversal. Secondly, a pointer allocation mechanism is introduced in this method, which allows the GETRL to pursue the genetic operations like typical GAs. To compare with the typical GP, however GETRL still generates a tree structure, our method adopts a phenotype-to-genotype decoding process, which allows the genetic operations be able to be apply into tree-based structure. Thirdly, due to each codon in GE has different expression meaning, genetic operations are quite different from GAs, in which all codons have the same meaning. In this study, we also suggest a multi-chromosome system and apply it into GETRL, which can prevent from overriding the codons for different objectives.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-70093-9_36", "venue": "ICONIP", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2766445604", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35281424"}

These\"glitches\"can easily be confused for transient gravitational-wave signals, and their robust identification and removal will help any search for astrophysical gravitational-waves. We apply Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) to the problem, using data from auxiliary channels within the LIGO detectors that monitor degrees of freedom unaffected by astrophysical signals. The number of auxiliary-channel parameters describing these disturbances may also be extremely large; an area where MLAs are particularly well-suited. We demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of three very different MLAs: Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests. These classifiers identify and remove a substantial fraction of the glitches present in two very different data sets: four weeks of LIGO's fourth science run and one week of LIGO's sixth science run. We observe that all three algorithms agree on which events are glitches to within 10% for the sixth science run data, and support this by showing that the different optimization criteria used by each classifier generate the same decision surface, based on a likelihood-ratio statistic.

The complexity further increases, when there is absence of prior knowledge about ground truth (or failure definition).

This paper contributes a new data-driven prognostics approach namely, an \"enhanced multivariate degradation modeling,\" which enables modeling degrading states of machinery without assuming a homogeneous pattern. In brief, a predictability scheme is introduced to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Following that, the proposed prognostics model is achieved by integrating two new algorithms namely, the summation wavelet-extreme learning machine and subtractive-maximum entropy fuzzy clustering to show evolution of machine degradation by simultaneous predictions and discrete state estimation.

This study investigates to what extent climate conditions (temperature and precipitation) and biophysical landscape characteristics (elevation, slope, soil type, forest type, and distance to rivers) facilitate or mitigate deforestation processes in Peru's tropical Andes. A Random Forest regression model was constructed for the entire Peruvian tropical Andes, and separate models were developed for some of the known direct deforestation drivers in the region (coca production, gold mining, and land-use by indigenous and non-indigenous communities). Soil type and precipitation were identified as the most important deforestation predictors when the entire Peruvian tropical Andes was considered, whereas distance to rivers was associated with deforestation by mining activities, and elevation and temperature with coca cultivation areas. Using the regression results, a Random Forest classification model was constructed to locate areas where the composition of environmental factors could either facilitate or mitigate deforestation processes. It was found that almost 85% of the forests classified as having high to very high probability to deforestation were located outside current protected areas.

In object oriented software engineering, the relationship between various modules also depend on class hierarchy. In such a scenario, a careful analysis on the use case diagrams will lead to a better translation of analysis modeling to design documents. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a technique to understand the various components of use case diagrams and to make suitable design based on analysis modeling. In the past, new techniques were proposed for program slicing and dynamic slicing of software architectures. Such features are useful to enhance the design metrics. In this paper, a new design methodology is introduced to improve the software design by applying slicing technique for increasing the cohesion and for reducing the coupling. The materials and methods of this work uses the analysis documents and makes decisions based on the components of use case diagrams. For this purpose, the use cases are sliced using intelligent rules and the parameters for design are identified from these slices. Moreover, these slices are used to perform effective classification in which the parameters obtained from the use case diagram are used as features for classification. In addition, the parameters are ranked using a new feature ranking algorithm based on information gain and classification is performed using Multiclass Support Vector Machines. The analysis phase is classified based on the classes and modules so that the cohesion and coupling necessary for scheduling the activities can be identified. This work uses a preemptive model in which the important modules are given priority and high priority modules can preempt the low priority modules with the approval of a decision manager.

In other words, natural cognitive systems do not, in general, forget catastrophically. Unfortunately, however, this is precisely what occurs under certain circumstances in distributed connectionist networks. It turns out that the very features that give these networks their much-touted abilities to generalize, to function in the presence of degraded input, etc., are the root cause of catastrophic forgetting. The challenge is how to keep the advantages of distributed connectionist networks while avoiding the problem of catastrophic forgetting.

Usually, medical images are labeled by multiple experts. However, the uncertainty of this training data, assessible as the unity of opinions of observers, is neglected as training is commonly performed on binary decision labels. In this work, we present a novel method to incorporate this label uncertainty into the learning problem using weighted Support Vector Machines (wSVM). The idea is to assign an uncertainty score to each data point. The score is between 0 and 1 and is calculated based on the unity of opinions of all observers, where u = 1 if all observers have the same opinion and u = 0 if the observers opinions are exactly 50/50, with linear interpolation in between. This score is integrated in the Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimization as a weighting of errors made for the corresponding data point. For evaluation, we asked 15 observers to label 48 2D ultrasound images of aortic roots addressing whether the images show a healthy or a pathologically dilated anatomy, where the ground truth was known. As the observers were not trained experts, a high diversity of opinions was present in the data set. We performed image classification using both approaches, i.e. classical SVM and wSVM with integrated uncertainty weighting, utilizing 10-fold Cross Validation, respectively (linear kernel, C = 7). By incorporating the observer uncertainty, the classification accuracy could be improved by 3.1 percentage points (SVM: 83.5%, wSVM: 86.6%).

Moreover, negative links tend to couple with positive links to form signed networks. In this paper, we thus study the problem of disentangled link prediction (DLP) for signed networks, which includes two separate tasks, i.e., inferring positive links and inferring negative links. Recently, representation learning methods have been proposed to solve the link prediction problem because the entire network structure can be encoded in representations.

Six structural parameters are selected as decision variables to describe the cross section shape of the cooling gallery. An oil filling ratio is regarded as an additional variable for finding the optimal volume fracture of the cooling gallery. The objective functions include the maximum temperature and the maximum thermal stress. In order to avoid a new gallery shape over the borders of the piston\u2019s cross section, several constraints need to be satisfied in the optimization. Multiple tools of the optimization, including the Sobol Sequence, the Support Vector Machine for regression, a variant of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, and the k-means clustering method, are integrated together to seek the optimal solutions for the design problem. The predicted results by the SVR models agree well with those obtained by the co-simulation method with a high determination coefficient greater than 0.91. A set of Pareto optimal solutions is obtained through the evolution of 100 generations on the basis of the SVR models. The results reveal that the Pareto optimal solutions are effective due to two thermal solutions out of the three representative solutions that are partitioned by k-means clustering. The design proposal selected from the three representative solutions indicates that the optimal position of the gallery cross section should be far away from the grooves and close to the bottom of the combustion chamber and the top region of the inner chamber. The cooling oil filling ratio should be increased to approximately 50% by increasing the mass flow rate of the cooling oil or the cooling oil capture capacity of the gallery in order to satisfy the design goal of reducing piston temperature.

To overcome this problem, in this research, the application of computational intelligence methods for data analysis named Support Vector Regression (SVR) optimized by differential evolution algorithm (DE) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to estimate of the required rotational torque to operate horizontal directional drilling is demonstrated.

Due to such capabilities, TWN have high security requirements as any security breach can lead to detrimental effects. Hence, securing such an environment is not only a requirement but also a virtual prerequisite to the network centric warfare operational (NCW) theory. One key to securing this environment is to promptly and accurately recognize information warfare attacks directed to the network and respond to them. This is achieved using intrusion detection systems (IDS). However, false detection of nodes in hostile environment remains a major problem that need to be addressed. Recently, machine learning methods and algorithms have shown applicability and are growing research area for cyber security and intrusion detection. Conversely, several decades of research in the field of machine learning have resulted in a multitude of different algorithms for solving a broad range of problems. The question then becomes, which one amongst these machine learning algorithms have the potential to enhance or address IDS issues in TWN. In this paper, seven machine learning classifiers are analyzed; Multi-Layer Perceptron, Bayesian Network, Support Vector Machine (SMO), Adaboost, Random Forest, Bootstrap Aggregation, and Decision Tree (J48). WEKA tool was used to implement and evaluate the classifiers.

We also thank all the discussants for their insight ful and stimulating comments. When we submitted the original manuscript in 2003, we were tempted to go for a more general paper on kernel methods. We decided to focus on support vector machines (SVMs), waiting for a mature development of the new and exciting ideas related to kernel methods, such as manifold learning and other related topics. We will refer to some of these methods below. Let us begin, first, with some general considerations. Regarding the question of the dimensionality in duced by the feature space, Hastie and Zhu remark in their comment that usual kernels do not automatically lead to infinite-dimensional feature spaces. They give a nice example that involves the radial (Gaussian) ker nel function. This agrees with results in Keerthi and Lin [8], where an explanation of the performance of the Gaussian kernel is given when, according to the notation in the comment by Hastie and Zhu, y -> 0 and X is chosen in the appropriate way. In this case, the SVM classifier converges to a linear SVM classi fier, and the effective dimension of the kernel is finite, agreeing with the empirical conclusion provided by the discussants. We also agree with the assertions of some of the discussants regarding the probabilistic interpretability of the SVM output (the sign of some estimated func tion). Our comment was rather along the line of Sollich [18], who proposed to make Bayesian methods avail able for the support vector methodology, while leaving as much as possible of the standard SVM framework intact. This is not an easy task. In fact, as Bartlett, Jor dan and McAuliffe remark, sparseness and the precise estimation of conditional probabilities are hard to rec oncile. Regarding the role of differentiability in SVMs (misplaced in the opinion of Bartlett, Jordan and McAuliffe), it is convenient to recall that the differ entiable formulation of the SVM problem allows its solution by the use of standard Newton-type methods for convex optimization. Under the availability of sec ond order derivatives (and this is the case for SVMs), these methods are known to be the most efficient ones", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": "math/0612825", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1214/088342306000000501", "venue": "Statistical Science 2006, Vol. 21, No. 3, 358-362", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1607411467,2963513325", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88524833"}

In other work, described in the supplementary material, we apply them to edge detection and image modeling. We apply shape epitomes to image labeling by using Conditional Random Field (CRF) Models. They are alternatives to the super pixel or pixel representations used in most CRFs. In our approach, the shape of an image patch is encoded by a shape epitome from the dictionary. Unlike the super pixel representation, our method avoids making early decisions which cannot be reversed.

Effective prediction of faults may improve the reliability and testability of software systems. As service-oriented architecture (SOA)-based systems become more and more complex, the interaction between participating services increases frequently. The component services may generate enormous reports and fault information. Although considerable research has stressed on developing fault-proneness prediction models in service-oriented systems (SOS) using machine learning (ML) techniques, there has been little work on assessing how effective the source code metrics are for fault prediction. The paper aims to discuss this issue.,In this paper, the authors have proposed a fault prediction framework to investigate fault prediction in SOS using metrics of web services. The effectiveness of the model has been explored by applying six ML techniques, namely, Naive Bayes, Artificial Networks (ANN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), decision tree, Random Forests and Support Vector Machine (SVM), along with five feature selection techniques to extract the essential metrics. The authors have explored accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure and receiver operating characteristic curves of the area under curve values as performance measures.,The experimental results show that the proposed system can classify the fault-proneness of web services, whether the service is faulty or non-faulty, as a binary-valued output automatically and effectively.,One possible threat to internal validity in the study is the unknown effects of undiscovered faults. Specifically, the authors have injected possible faults into the classes using Java C3.0 tool and only fixed faults are injected into the classes. However, considering the Java C3.0 community of development, testing and use, the authors can generalize that the undiscovered faults should be few and have less impact on the results presented in this study, and that the results may be limited to the investigated complexity metrics and the used ML techniques.,In the literature, only few studies have been observed to directly concentrate on metrics-based fault-proneness prediction of SOS using ML techniques. However, most of the contributions are regarding the fault prediction of the general systems rather than SOS. A majority of them have considered reliability, changeability, maintainability using a logging/history-based approach and mathematical modeling rather than fault prediction in SOS using metrics. Thus, the authors have extended the above contributions further by applying supervised ML techniques over web services metrics and measured their capability by employing fault injection methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1108/DTA-03-2019-0040", "venue": "Data Technol.

We have simulated daily, weekly, and monthly runoff and sediment yield from an Indian watershed (area= 7820 Sq.Km), with data from the monsoon period, using support vector machines (SVM), a statistical learning theory based pattern-learning algorithm.

Through our data analysis of micro-blog, we find that females show more positive and have richer sentiments than males in online social platform. This difference is very conducive to the distinction between genders. Therefore, we argue that sentiment context is important as well for user profiling. In this paper, we propose to predict one of the demographic labels: gender by exploring micro-blog user posts.

Lastly we combine sentiment representations with virtual document vectors to train a basic MLP network for gender classification.

In seam carving, this is done by assessing the importance of each pixel by an energy function and repeatedly removing a string of pixels avoiding pixels with high energy. However, there is no single energy function that is best for all images: the optimal energy function is itself a function of the image. In this paper, we present a method for predicting the quality of the results of resizing an image with different energy functions, so as to select the energy best suited for that particular image. We formulate the selection as a classification problem; i.e., we 'classify' the input into the class of images for which one of the energies works best. The standard approach would be to use a CNN for the classification. However, the existence of a fully connected layer forces us to resize the input to a fixed size, which obliterates useful information, especially lower-level features that more closely relate to the energies used for seam carving. Instead, we extract a feature from internal convolutional layers, which results in a fixed-length vector regardless of the input size, making it amenable to classification with a Support Vector Machine. This formulation of the algorithm selection as a classification problem can be used whenever there are multiple approaches for a specific image processing task.

Some existing authentication methods require additional depth sensors; however, they are still cheated by 2D or 3D printed faces sometimes. Although many researches aim at detecting fake faces, most of them only work well on specific situations, and they are unusable to master unseen spoofed scenarios. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose face liveliness detection methods using a conventional camera, which is capable of effectively performing both intra- and cross-dataset detection on sets of real faces mixed with spoofed ones. We adopt local binary patterns (LBP) and 2D image distortion analysis (IDA) to extract texture information of face images, which are used for developing our face liveness detection system against spoofing attack to distinguish fake faces from real ones by a deep neural network (DNN). In addition to verifying whether the deep learning method induces over-fitting of spoofed faces using specific datasets, we also employ a random forest classifier to compare the face liveliness detection results. In intra-dataset evaluation, 10-fold cross-validation is adopted, and the accuracy of spoofed face detection is more than 97% using a convolutional neural network architecture. In cross-dataset evaluation, under the condition of the Idiap Replay-Attack Database acting as the training dataset as well as the NUAA Photograph Imposter Database serving as the testing dataset, the accuracy achieves 81.85% when using the scheme of combining LBP, IDA, and DNN techniques.

With the proposal using a decision tree with C4.5 algorithm can predict failures and damage that occur so that it can determine more accurate maintenance actions. Decision tree is a prediction model using tree structure or hierarchical structure. The concept of a decision tree is to transform data into decision trees and decision rules.

One of the most popular BCI type is Electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI, where motor imagery is considered one of the most effective ways. Previously, to extract useful information, various filters are introduced, such as spatial, temporal, and spectral filtering. A spatial filtering algorithm called Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) was developed and known to have excellent performance, especially in motor imagery for BCI application. In general, there are several approaches in improving CSP such as regularization approach, analytic approach, and frequency band selection. In general, the existing techniques for band selection is either to select or reject the band by ignoring the importance of the band. For example, Binary Particle Search Optimization Common Spatial Pattern (BPSO-CSP) was proposed to choose multiple possible best bands to be used in processing the data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called Feature Scaling Common Spatial Pattern (FSc-CSP) to overcome the problem of feature selection. Instead of selecting features, the proposed algorithm employs a feature scaling system to scale the importance of each band by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) altogether with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as classifier, with 1 signifying the most important bands, declining until 0 for the unused bands, as opposed to the 1 and 0 selection system used in BPSO-CSP.

Practical issues are how to select the type of kernel including any parameters and how to deal with the computational issues caused by the fact that the kernel matrix grows quadratically with the data. Inspired by ensemble and boosting methods like MART, we propose the Multiple Additive Regression Kernels (MARK) algorithm to address these issues. MARK considers a large (potentially infinite) library of kernel matrices formed by different kernel functions and parameters. Using gradient boosting/column generation, MARK constructs columns of the heterogeneous kernel matrix (the base hypotheses) on the fly and then adds them into the kernel ensemble. Regularization methods such as used in SVM, kernel ridge regression, and MART, are used to prevent overfitting. We investigate how MARK is applied to heterogeneous kernel ridge regression. The resulting algorithm is simple to implement and efficient. Kernel parameter selection is handled within MARK. Sampling and \"weak\" kernels are used to further enhance the computational efficiency of the resulting additive algorithm. The user can incorporate and potentially extract domain knowledge by restricting the kernel library to interpretable kernels.

Breakup timing is directly related to emergency responses preparation and thus its early accurate forecasting is beneficial to ice-related flooding management. The stepwise cluster analysis (SCA) is a non-parameter regression method, which generates a classification tree in the sense of probability through cutting or merging operations according to certain statistic criteria. To enhance SCA\u2019s predictive performance, a SCA ensemble (SCAE) method is developed and applied to forecasting of annual river ice breakup dates (BDs). In detail, the SCA is employed as a base model at the lower level while the simple average method is selected as combining models at the upper level. The SCA base models are selected according to different performance selection criteria and searched for further combination. A site on a representative river prone to river ice flooding in Alberta, Canada is selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SCAE. The results mainly show that: the SCA base models with multiple combinations of inputs and internal parameters are able to predict the BDs with good performances (the highest average of correlation coefficients for training can be 0.958); the optimal SCA base model has three inputs, which indicates that the temperatures before breakup and just after freeze-up as well as the maximum of water flow in March are relatively important indicators of BD. The optimal SCAE, including base models from different performance selection criteria, has the lowest average of root mean squared error, which improves upon the optimal SCA base model by 25.3%. It indicates the different model selection criteria do improve the diversity and thus further help to improve the performance of ensemble models.

However, the subjectivity involved in their evaluation has favoured the development of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) Systems. It is proposed a novel combination of feature extraction techniques to improve the diagnosis of AD. Firstly, Regions of Interest (ROIs) are selected by means of a t-test carried out on 3D Normalised Mean Square Error (NMSE) features restricted to be located within a predefined brain activation mask. In order to address the small sample-size problem, the dimension of the feature space was further reduced by: Large Margin Nearest Neighbours using a rectangular matrix (LMNN-RECT), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Partial Least Squares (PLS) (the two latter also analysed with a LMNN transformation). Regarding the classifiers, kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and LMNN using Euclidean, Mahalanobis and Energy-based metrics were compared. Several experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the proposed LMNN-based feature extraction algorithms and its benefits as: i) linear transformation of the PLS or PCA reduced data, ii) feature reduction technique, and iii) classifier (with Euclidean, Mahalanobis or Energy-based methodology). The system was evaluated by means of k-fold cross-validation yielding accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values of 92.78%, 91.07% and 95.12% (for SPECT) and 90.67%, 88% and 93.33% (for PET), respectively, when a NMSE-PLS-LMNN feature extraction method was used in combination with a SVM classifier, thus outperforming recently reported baseline methods. All the proposed methods turned out to be a valid solution for the presented problem. One of the advances is the robustness of the LMNN algorithm that not only provides higher separation rate between the classes but it also makes (in combination with NMSE and PLS) this rate variation more stable. In addition, their generalization ability is another advance since several experiments were performed on two image modalities (SPECT and PET).", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3512495", "pubmed_id": "22849649", "doi": "10.1186/1472-6947-12-79", "venue": "BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "journal": "BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2138998329", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["35779638", "205454447", "43656795", "35745083", "15830960", "61031120", "26043080", "9901011", "142758566", "120436719", "14727192", "194951", "9981775", "47325215", "8616518", "2643381", "10315527", "15421102", "7011740", "376363", "18834970", "206853874", "7356809", "109263878", "16325834", "59790709", "17671150", "19247369", "18023982", "120545565", "14464623", "11893285", "850937", "5103649", "6188188", "11489285", "18340114", "117643475", "44986862", "84089124", "2619125", "2715867", "1768557", "2702042", "24101089", "8220362", "31679941", "120638419", "13967931", "4696268", "9260803"], "inbound_citations": ["49645985", "9260803"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9260803"}

Finally, a new cluster validity index called disagreement/agreement (DA) index (DAI) is designed to identify the number of classes in the dataset by considering the difference between the partition obtained from the original dataset and the partitions obtained from the perturbed datasets.

A key component behind the success of recent approaches is the self-consistency loss, which encourages a network to recover the original input image when the output generated for a desired attribute is itself passed through the same network, but with the target attribute inverted. While the self-consistency loss yields photo-realistic results, it can be shown that the input and target domains, supposed to be close, differ substantially. This is empirically found by observing that a network recovers the input image even if attributes other than the inversion of the original goal are set as target. This stops one combining networks for different tasks, or using a network to do progressive forward passes. In this paper, we show empirical evidence of this effect, and propose a new loss to bridge the gap between the distributions of the input and target domains. This \"triple consistency loss\", aims to minimise the distance between the outputs generated by the network for different routes to the target, independent of any intermediate steps. To show this is effective, we incorporate the triple consistency loss into the training of a new landmark-guided face to face synthesis, where, contrary to previous works, the generated images can simultaneously undergo a large transformation in both expression and pose. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to tackle the problem of mismatching distributions in self-domain synthesis, and to propose \"in-the-wild\" landmark-guided synthesis.

Traditional evapotranspiration (ET) partitioning dual source modeling requires an extensive array of ground-level parameters and needs model correction and calibration to attain model certainty. In response, a quick and low-cost method is described to predict T using artificial intelligence (AI) modeling based on meteorological factors, status of crop growth factors and soil parameters. This study compares Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) in building AI models using three years (2014\u20132017) of continuous high-resolution monitoring data in a cabbage farmland. Input data included air temperature (Ta), solar radiation (Ra), relative humidity (RH), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), wind speed (Ws), soil moisture (SM), vegetation height (H), and leaf area index (LAI). The results show that soil surface resistance calculations by Monte Carlo iterative method and vegetation stomatal resistance calculations and carbon dioxide concentration and emission, improve performance of the original Shuttleworth\u2013Wallace(S-W) model. In addition, the AI model indicates Ta and Ra are essential inputs for both model types. When there are sufficient observation data, or only lacking soil and vegetation data, the RF model is recommended for use. When there are only limited data or lack of critical Ta and Ra data, the SVR model is the preferred model. Scientific guidance is provided for agriculture precision irrigation, indicating which AI model can best estimate T and water demand for irrigation planning and water management.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105923", "venue": null, "journal": "Agricultural Water Management", "mag_id": "2990313384", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212935856"}

The amount of pollutant discharges and associated effects on the marine environment are important parameters in evaluating sea water quality. Satellite images can improve the possibilities for the detection of oil spills as they cover large areas and offer an economical and easier way of continuous coast areas patrolling. SAR images have been widely used for oil spill detection. The present paper gives an overview of the methodologies used to detect oil spills on the radar images. In particular we concentrate on the use of the manual and automatic approaches to distinguish oil spills from other natural phenomena. We discuss the most common techniques to detect dark formations on the SAR images, the features which are extracted from the detected dark formations and the most used classifiers.

Our model, SCIGAN, is flexible and capable of simultaneously estimating counterfactual outcomes for several different continuous interventions. The key idea is to use a significantly modified GAN model to learn to generate counterfactual outcomes, which can then be used to learn an inference model, using standard supervised methods, capable of estimating these counterfactuals for a new sample. To address the challenges presented by shifting to continuous interventions, we propose a novel architecture for our discriminator - we build a hierarchical discriminator that leverages the structure of the continuous intervention setting. Moreover, we provide theoretical results to support our use of the GAN framework and of the hierarchical discriminator.

SVR was applied to construct mathematical estimation functions between the input control factors and output responses of a product/process.

In the experiment, workload was considered as the performance metric, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN) were utilized as time-series prediction techniques. In addition, we used Amazon EC2 as the experimental infrastructure and TPC-W as the benchmark to generate different workload patterns.

Hence, the seminal sign of PD is a change in motor performance of affected individuals. As PD is a neurodegenerative disease, progression of disability in mobility is an inevitable consequence. Indeed, the major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with PD is the motor changes restricting their functional independence. Therefore, monitoring the manifestations of the disease is crucial to detect any worsening of symptoms timely, in order to maintain and improve the quality of life of these patients. Aim The changes in motion of patients with PD can be ascertained by the help of wearable sensors attached to the limbs of subjects. Then analysing the recorded data for variation of signals would make it possible to figure an individualized profile of the disease. Advancement of such tools would improve understanding of the disease evolution in the long term and simplify the detection of precipitous changes in gait on a daily basis in the short term. In both cases the apperception of such events would contribute to improve the clinical decision making process with reliable data. To this end, we offer here a computational solution for effective monitoring of PD patients from gait analysis via multiple foot-worn sensors. Methods We introduce a supervised model that is fed by ground reaction force (GRF) signals acquired from these gait sensors. We offer a hybrid model, called Locally Weighted Random Forest (LWRF), for regression analysis over the numerical features extracted from input signals to predict the severity of PD symptoms in terms of Universal Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. From GRF signals sixteen time-domain features and seven frequency-domain features were extracted and used. Results and conclusion An experimental analysis conducted on a real data acquired from PD patients and healthy controls has shown that the predictions are highly correlated with the clinical annotations. Proposed approach for severity detection has the best correlation coefficient (CC), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) values with 0.895, 4.462 and 7.382 respectively in terms of UPDRS. The regression results for H&Y Scale discerns that proposed model outperforms other models with CC, MAE and RMSE with values 0.960, 0.168 and 0.306 respectively. In classification setup, proposed approach achieves higher accuracy in comparison with other studies with accuracy and specificity of 99.0% and 99.5% respectively. Main novelty of this approach is the fact that an exact value of the symptom level can be inferred rather than a categorical result that defines the severity of motor disorders.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bbe.2018.06.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering", "mag_id": "2809789609", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204331211"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125727564"}

Although there are clear dependencies between how different mentions of the same caption should be grounded, previous structured prediction methods that aim to capture such dependencies need to resort to approximate inference or non-differentiable losses. In this paper, we formulate phrase grounding as a sequence labeling task where we treat candidate regions as potential labels, and use neural chain Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to model dependencies among regions for adjacent mentions. In contrast to standard sequence labeling tasks, the phrase grounding task is defined such that there may be multiple correct candidate regions. To address this multiplicity of gold labels, we define so-called Soft-Label Chain CRFs, and present an algorithm that enables convenient end-to-end training. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on phrase grounding on the Flickr30k Entities dataset. Analysis shows that our model benefits both from the entity dependencies captured by the CRF and from the soft-label training regime.

Since the processes of feature extraction on each view are separated, the multiple visual features of images may include overlap, noise, and redundancy. Thus, learning with all the derived views of the data could decrease the effectiveness. To address this, this paper simultaneously conducts a hierarchical feature selection and a multiview multilabel (MVML) learning for multiview image classification, via embedding a proposed a new block-row regularizer into the MVML framework. The block-row regularizer concatenating a Frobenius norm (F-norm) regularizer and an l(2,1)-norm regularizer is designed to conduct a hierarchical feature selection, in which the F-norm regularizer is used to conduct a high-level feature selection for selecting the informative views (i.e., discarding the uninformative views) and the l(2,1)-norm regularizer is then used to conduct a low-level feature selection on the informative views. The rationale of the use of a block-row regularizer is to avoid the issue of the over-fitting (via the block-row regularizer), to remove redundant views and to preserve the natural group structures of data (via the F-norm regularizer), and to remove noisy features (the l(2,1)-norm regularizer), respectively. We further devise a computationally efficient algorithm to optimize the derived objective function and also theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed optimization method.

Spatial distribution and characteristics of pig farming in Thailand were studied using time-series pig population data to describe the trend of pig productions in relation to pig numbers, holder numbers, and number of pigs per holder. In more detailed analyses, pig census data in 2010 were used to describe farming systems including type of pig (native, breeding, and fattening pigs), farm scales (extensive and intensive farming systems), type of farming systems (farrow-to-finish, nursery, and finishing systems) and to quantify the association between the geographical distribution of those and several predictor variables by using Random Forest models. The results show that over the last decades, the pig population has gradually increased over time, with a marked cyclical pattern corresponding to what has been termed the \u201cpork cycle\u201d. The spatial distribution of large-scale pig farms corresponds with that of commercial pig breeds, which are concentrated in lowland urban or peri-urban areas, and are close to means of transportation, facilitating supply to major markets such as provincial capitals and the Bangkok Metropolitan region. Conversely the smallholders are distributed throughout the country, with higher densities located in highland, remote, and rural areas, whence they supply local, rural markets. It is proposed that intensive pig production should be integrated with crop farming within a specific \u201cpig zone\u201d, designated for establishment of intensive farming, which includes the necessary input and output facilities and enhanced bio-security. For smallholder pig farmers, integration of pig-farming with crop production should be promoted and combined with capacity development for farm management, including enhancing the bio-security. Spatial epidemiology of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in Thailand was studied by providing a first description of the spatio-temporal pattern of PRRS in Thailand and to quantify the statistical relationship between the presence of PRRS at the sub-district level and a set of risk factors using two modelling approaches: autologistic multiple regression and boosted regression trees. An atypical and more virulent PRRS (HP-PRRS) emerged in China and spread to many countries, including Thailand, causing a lot of damage to pig production. The results indicated that farms with breeding sows may be an important group for targeted surveillance and control. However, these findings obtained at the sub-district level should be complemented by farm-level epidemiological investigations in order to obtain a more comprehensive view of the factors affecting PRRS presence. In this study, the outbreaks of PRRS could not be differentiated from the potential novel HP-PPRS form, which was recently discovered in the country.Spatial characterization of colonies of the flying fox bat, a carrier of Nipah Virus in Thailand was studied. We conducted field observation, remote sensing, and ecological niche modelling to characterize flying fox colonies and their ecological neighbourhoods. A Potential Surface Analysis was applied to map contact zones among local epizootic actors. Results showed that flying fox colonies were found mainly on Thailand\u2019s Central Plain, particularly in locations surrounded by bodies of water, vegetation, and safe havens such as Buddhist temples. High-risk areas for Nipah zoonosis in pigs include the agricultural ring around the Bangkok metropolitan region where the density of pig farms is high. It is suggested that passive and active surveillance programs should be prioritized around Bangkok, particularly on farms with low biosecurity, close to water, and/or on which orchards are concomitantly grown. Integration of human and animal health surveillance should be pursued in these same areas. Such proactive planning would help conserve flying fox colonies and should help prevent zoonotic transmission of Nipah and other pathogens.Using Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to identify suitability of pig farming in Thailand was studied. The suitability maps were generated according to the three objectives obtained from decision making process including; i) pig producers\u2019 profit is maximized, ii) public and environmental health are protected, and iii) pig health is protected and rural areas are developed. The maps showed that the areas surrounding the major consuming centres (Bangkok) were highly suitable for objective 1, the large areas in the Northeast were highly suitable for objective 2, and the areas with rather isolation including in the East and the South were highly suitable for objective 3. The final suitability maps were presented in 6 scenarios based on the level of trade-off and risk, which these can be applied for the appropriate situations. It is suggested that establishment of pig zoning, policy makers should take all aspects into consideration in order for sustainable development in all farm levels. The cost effectiveness should be further analyzed to evaluate the zoning plan before they are developed. Additionally, the plans to scale-up support to sustainable smallholder farmers and environmental management such as manure action plan should be developed.Bringing all these results together, this thesis are discussed into three parts, namely, 1) situation and distribution of pig farming, 2) epidemiology of major pig diseases, and 3) sustainable development of pig farming.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2262983768", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:130063810"}

The resulting network model is used for content-based recognition of videos. Relying on a 2-D convolutional neural network allows us to exploit a pretrained network as a descriptor that yielded the best results on the largest and challenging ILSVRC-2014 dataset. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarking video datasets demonstrate that our results are state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and computational time without requiring any preprocessing (e.g., optic flow) or a priori knowledge on data capture (e.g., camera motion estimation), which makes it more general and flexible than other approaches.

At first, by using the conception of local receptive filed (LRF), a spectral-spatial convolutional learning module with two branches is constructed for spectral and spatial feature extraction respectively. Specifically, the convolutional learning module is constructed by using random convolutional nodes but without back propagation, in which a spectral branch and a spatial branch are designed respectively. Then the extracted features are concatenated and fed to a fully connected stacked ELM network to further exploit spectral-spatial information for classification.

Support vector machine (SVM) is a novel general machine-learning tool based on the structural risk minimization principle that exhibits good generalization when fault samples are few; it is especially suitable for classification, forecasting, and estimation in cases where small amounts of samples are involved such as fault diagnosis; however, some parameters of SVM are selected based on the experience of the operator, which has led to decreased efficiency of SVM in practical application. The uniform design (UD) method was applied to optimize the running parameters of SVM. It was found that the average accuracy rate approached 73 % when the penalty factor was 0.01, the epsilon 0.2, the gamma 0.05, and the range 0.5. The results indicated that UD might be used as an effective method to optimize the parameters of SVM and SVM and could be used as an alternative powerful modeling tool for QSPR studies of the activity of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal crystal proteins.

This paper explores the connection between view-predictive representation learning and its role in the development of 3D visual recognition. We propose inverse graphics networks, which take as input 2.5D video streams captured by a moving camera, and map to stable 3D feature maps of the scene, by disentangling the scene content from the motion of the camera. The model can also project its 3D feature maps to novel viewpoints, to predict and match against target views. We propose contrastive prediction losses that can handle stochasticity of the visual input and can scale view-predictive learning to more photorealistic scenes than those considered in previous works. We show that the proposed model learns 3D visual representations useful for (1) semi-supervised learning of 3D object detectors, and (2) unsupervised learning of 3D moving object detectors, by estimating motion of the inferred 3D feature maps in videos of dynamic scenes.

By combining the consistency between final detection results of CNN and CRF based graphical models, our unified framework can effectively leverage the advantages of leading techniques i.e., CRF and CNN for these two tasks. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007/2012 data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for Scene Understanding tasks.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3019612.3019636", "venue": "SAC '17", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2620715809", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1996665", "206593096", "6161478", "3792560", "1241368", "6467749", "12225766", "9272368", "436933", "700906", "1799558", "277918", "56507745", "6371883", "8420864", "206594738", "10328909", "5919483", "7730246", "1318262"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8023246"}

Recently, metric learning-based methods have played important roles in addressing this task. However, metrics are mostly learned in supervised manners, of which the performance relies heavily on the quantity and quality of manual annotations. Meanwhile, metric learning-based algorithms generally project person features into a common subspace, in which the extracted features are shared by all views. However, it may result in information loss since these algorithms neglect the view-specific features. Besides, they assume person samples of different views are taken from the same distribution. Conversely, these samples are more likely to obey different distributions due to view condition changes. To this end, this paper proposes an unsupervised cross-view metric learning method based on the properties of data distributions. Specifically, person samples in each view are taken from a mixture of two distributions: one models common prosperities among camera views and the other focuses on view-specific properties. Based on this, we introduce a shared mapping to explore the shared features. Meanwhile, we construct view-specific mappings to extract and project view-related features into a common subspace. As a result, samples in the transformed subspace follow the same distribution and are equipped with comprehensive representations. In this paper, these mappings are learned in an unsupervised manner by clustering samples in the projected space.

First problem concerns the methodology of classification quality and stability estimation that is also known as classification reliability estimation. We consider general problem statement in classification algorithms design, classification reliability estimation and the modern methods solution of the problem. On the other hand we propose our methods for solution of such kind of a problem. In general this could be made by using of different kind of indicators of classification (classifier) quality and stability. All this should summarize everything made before with our latest results of solution of the problem. Second part of the chapter is devoted to new approach that gives the possibility to solve the problem of classifier design that is not sensitive to the learning set but belongs to some kind of learning algorithms. Let us consider recognition process, using the next main algorithms, as some parts of the some complicated recognition system: algorithm for feature generating, algorithms for feature selection and classification algorithms realizing procedure of decision making. It is really important to have good algorithms for feature generating and selection. Methods for feature generating and selection are developed a lot for many objects to be recognized. For facial images the most popular algorithms use 3D graph models, morphological models, the selection some geometrical features using special nets, etc. From other hand very popular algorithms for feature generating and selection are those which use Principle Component Analysis (PCA) or Independent Component Analysis (ICA). PCA and ICA are good enough for a number of practical cases. However there are a lot of different deficiencies in classifier building. For classifiers using learning the most essential gap is that all such classifiers can work pretty well on learning stage and really bad for some test cases. Also they can work well enough if classes are linearly separated e.g. Support Vector Machines (SVM) in linear case. For non-linear case they have a number of disadvantages. That is why it is important to develop some approaches for algorithms building that are not sensitive for the kind of sample or complexity in classification task. All classification algorithms built for the present could be divided almost into 5 groups: algorithms built on statistical principles, algorithms, built on the basis of potential functions and non-parametrical estimation, algorithms, using similarity functions (all kinds of metrical classifiers like 1NN and kNN classifiers) algorithms, using logical principles like decision lists, trees, etc, hierarchical and combined algorithms. A lot of recognition systems use a number of algorithms or algorithm compositions.

A significant complicating aspect in these analyses can be attributed to the presence of features that exhibit statistical interactions. Indeed, in several clinical investigations such as genetic studies of complex diseases, it is of interest to specifically identify such features. In this paper, we compare the performance of four commonly used classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Prediction Analysis for Microarrays, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines) in settings involving high dimensional datasets including statistically interacting feature subsets. We evaluate the performance of these classifiers under conditions of varying sample size, levels of signal-to-noise ratio and strength of statistical interactions among features. We summarize two datasets from studies in diabetes and cardiovascular disease involving gene expression, metabolomics and proteomics measurements and compare results obtained using the four classifiers. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Simulation studies revealed that the classifier Prediction Analysis of Microarrays had the highest classification accuracy in the absence of noise, statistical interactions and when feature distributions were multivariate Gaussian within each class. In the presence of statistical interactions, modest effect sizes and the absence of noise, Support Vector Machines achieved the best performance followed closely by Random Forests. Random Forests was optimal in settings that included both significant levels of high dimensional noise features and statistical interactions between biomarker pairs. The data applications revealed similar trends in the relative performances of each classifier. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Random Forests had the highest classification accuracy among the four classifiers and was successful in incorporating interaction effects between features in the presence of noise in high dimensional datasets.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "22752837", "doi": "10.1515/1557-4679.1373", "venue": null, "journal": "The International Journal of Biostatistics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2034030912", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["30937472", "22455640", "5246200", "206787478", "119479891", "1805285", "18364228", "2573797", "17355517", "46972397", "19593875", "13782609", "122987911", "23435141", "8811254", "62333196"], "inbound_citations": ["44270964"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24442735"}

AELP-WL offers several properties. First, our method seamlessly integrates the robust adaptive embedded label propagation with adaptive weight learning into a unified framework. By minimizing the reconstruction errors over embedded features and embedded soft labels jointly, our AELP-WL can explicitly ensure the learned weights to be joint optimal for representation and classification, which differs from most existing LP models that perform weight learning separately by an independent step before label prediction. Second, existing models usually precalculate the weights over the original samples that may contain unfavorable features and noise decreasing performance. To this end, our model adds a constraint that decomposes original data into a sparse component encoding embedded noise-removed sparse representations of samples and a sparse error part fitting noise, and then performs the adaptive weight learning over the embedded sparse representations. Third, our AELP-WL computes the projected soft labels by trading-off the manifold smoothness and label fitness errors over the adaptive weights and the embedded representations for enhancing the label estimation power. By including a regressive label approximation error for simultaneous minimization to correlate sample features with the embedded soft labels, the out-of-sample issue is naturally solved.

Our approach focuses on skin deformations around the eyes that occur when the wearer changes his or her facial expressions. With small photo-reflective sensors, we measure the distances between the skin surface on the face and the 17 sensors embedded in the eyewear frame. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is then applied to the information collected by the sensors. The sensors can cover various facial muscle movements. In addition, they are small and light enough to be integrated into daily-use glasses. Our evaluation of the device shows the robustness to the noises from the wearer\u2019s facial direction changes and the slight changes in the glasses\u2019 position, as well as the reliability of the device\u2019s recognition capacity. The main contributions of our work are as follows: (1) We evaluated the recognition accuracy in daily scenes, showing 92.8% accuracy regardless of facial direction and removal/remount. Our device can recognize facial expressions with 78.1% accuracy for repeatability and 87.7% accuracy in case of its positional drift.

In this paper we present a fast system named wavelet-SVM method to extract a wide range scales of faces from grey-scale images or color images with a preprocessing using a TSL color model. The system is not only accurate and effective, but also largely speeds the system up by applying a TSL B-G color model and multiresolution wavelet decomposition.", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/3-540-45665-1_29", "venue": "SVM", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1497166413", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["12663580"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13613167"}

Condition monitoring of rotating machinery is important to promptly detect early faults, identify potential problems, and prevent complete failure. Four direct classification methods were introduced to diagnose the regular condition, inner race defect, outer race defect, and rolling element defect of rolling bearings.

However, most existing metric learning methods overlook the inconsistency of feature distributions in multiple cameras. In this paper, we propose a multi-projection metric learning (MPML) method to overcome the inconsistency among multiple cameras in person re-identification. Our solution is to jointly learn multiple projection matrices using paired samples from different cameras to project features from different cameras into a common feature space. To make our method adaptive to newly added cameras without affecting the learned projection matrices, we further propose an adaptive MPML method, which can learn new camera projection matrices without having to update any of the obtained projection matrices.

We present memory packing techniques that reorganize learned forests to minimize cache misses during classification. The resulting layout is hierarchical. At low levels, we pack the nodes of multiple trees into contiguous memory blocks so that each memory access fetches data for multiple trees. At higher levels, we use leaf cardinality to identify the most popular paths through a tree and collocate those paths in cache lines. We extend this layout with out-of-order execution and cache-line prefetching to increase memory throughput.

One of the most popular ways to address incomplete data is to use imputation methods to fill missing fields with plausible values. Multiple imputation, which fills each missing field with a set of plausible values, is a powerful approach to dealing with incomplete data, but is mainly used for statistical analysis. Ensemble learning which constructs a set of classifiers instead of one classifier has proven capable of improving classification accuracy, but has been mainly applied to complete data. This paper proposes a combination of multiple imputation and ensemble learning to build an ensemble of classifiers for incomplete data classification tasks.

These synthetic MR images were assessed quantitively (SSIM=0.79) and qualitatively by a physician who found that the synthetic images seem stronger for delineation of structural boundaries but struggle more when gradient is significant, (e.g. edema signal in T2 modalities). Multiple 2D U-Nets were trained with original BraTS data and differing subsets of a quarter, half, three-quarters, and all synthetic MR images. There was not an obvious correlation between the improvement of values of the metrics in separate validation dataset for each structure and amount of synthetic data added, there is a strong correlation between the amount of synthetic data added and the number of best overall validation metrics.

A Random Forest model was established using reference data of 2004\u20132007 to generate annual crop maps in 2000\u20132009. A linear model was applied to assess the spatial distribution of the longest observed cotton sequence within the ten-year observation period. All cotton-growing sequences were compared to the national crop rotation recommendations. The classification achieved an overall accuracy of 82%. We found that cotton remains the major crop in the region. It was cultivated for more than five out of the ten years on 46.5% of the cropland. But \u201cSoviet cropping conditions\u201d on less than 20% and officially recommended cotton sequences on more than 50% of the cropland challenge the notion that cotton mono-crop dominates Central Asia.

In particular, proprioceptive cues in the ankle, hips, and trunk trigger automatic postural responses to perturbations. Generally, the robotics literature discusses the use of the Zero Moment Point to stabilise stance. Humans can not calculate this point from proprioceptive cues, instead joint velocity information is used. This paper proposes the use of proprioception on a humanoid robot, where joint velocities are used directly to detect and determine the direction of a perturbation during quiet stance. A weighted Manhattan norm of the joint velocity vector is used for perturbation detection and a Support Vector Machine is used to classify a perturbation as belonging to a set of directions and locations. On application to a 23 degree of freedom humanoid the average detection time is 120ms. The direction is classified with 100% accuracy and the location is classified with 99.9% accuracy.

The significant challenge in data stream mining is data distribution changes over a time period which is called concept drifts. So, learning model need to detect the changes and adapt according to that model. By nature, ensemble classifiers are adapting to changes very well and deal the concept drift very well.

Therefore, disease signals likely span multiple biological domains, including genes, proteins, cells, tissues, and organism-level physiological changes. Identification of these signals could aid in diagnostics, treatment decision-making, and risk evaluation. In the search for PTSD diagnostic biomarkers, we ascertained over one million molecular, cellular, physiological, and clinical features from three cohorts of male veterans. In a discovery cohort of 83 warzone-related PTSD cases and 82 warzone-exposed controls, we identified a set of 343 candidate biomarkers. These candidate biomarkers were selected from an integrated approach using (1) data-driven methods, including Support Vector Machine with Recursive Feature Elimination and other standard or published methodologies, and (2) hypothesis-driven approaches, using previous genetic studies for polygenic risk, or other PTSD-related literature. After reassessment of ~30% of these participants, we refined this set of markers from 343 to 28, based on their performance and ability to track changes in phenotype over time. The final diagnostic panel of 28 features was validated in an independent cohort (26 cases, 26 controls) with good performance (AUC = 0.80, 81% accuracy, 85% sensitivity, and 77% specificity).

This can be done within an anatomical region or even across regions. Central to the debate concerning the existence of a face module are two seemingly contradictory sets of findings from two fMRI studies. Both studies used MVPA techniques to analyze patterns of response that were recorded while subjects viewed photographs of faces and objects. Haxby et al. (2001) (hereafter referred to as H01), reported that information about the category membership of the object being viewed was distributed across visual cortex, rather than confined to regions that were maximally active in response to that category. In contrast, Spiridon and Kanwisher (2002) (hereafter referred to as SK02), carried out a different set of analyses on a similar set of fMRI data and reported evidence for specialized processing of faces in regions preferentially activated by faces. In this paper, we present a neurocomputational model of object processing in the ventral visual pathway, and analyze the activation patterns in the model using a method we have termed \u201cvirtual MVPA\u201d. We account for data from both H01 and SK02, providing an explanation for both sets of findings within a single framework. The model contains no specialized mechanism for the processing of faces, casting doubt on the interpretation of the findings in SK02 as evidence in favor of a \u201cface module\u201d. Object representations in the model are organized topographically, which can be related to the topographic organization of stimuli seen in much of visual cortex. Because of this property of the network, we are able to analyze model behavior with a method analogous to the analysis of activation patterns across voxels in MVPA of fMRI data. More specifically, we sort hidden layer units into those that are \u201cselective\u201d for faces, houses, chairs and so on, allowing breakdown of the activation patterns by region, as was carried out in H01 and SK02. Abstract We present a neurocomputational model of visual object processing, which takes photographic inputs and creates topographic stimulus representations on the hidden layer. We perform multi-voxel pattern analysis on the activations of hidden units and simulate contradictory findings from Haxby et al. (2001) and Spiridon and Kanwisher (2002) within a single model. With no special processing mechanism or architecture for faces in our model, we obtain the same results as Spiridon & Kanwisher, who interpreted their results as evidence for a \u201cface module\u201d \u2013 something our model does not possess. Keywords: MVPA; face processing; visual cortex; fMRI; visual expertise; visual perception; fusiform face area. Introduction A region in the fusiform gyrus of the temporal lobe, dubbed the \u201cFusiform Face Area\u201d (FFA), has been shown to be differentially activated when subjects in an fMRI scanner view faces compared to other classes of visual stimuli (Kanwisher et al. 1997). The FFA has been the subject of fierce debate. Opinions are divided between those who believe this area constitutes a specialized module for visual processing of faces as a unique class of visual stimuli (e.g., Kanwisher et al., 1997) and those who believe, instead, that the existence of a region in visual cortex dedicated to faces can be accounted for with alternative hypotheses, such as the \u201cvisual expertise\u201d hypothesis (Gauthier, et al., 1999; Tarr & Gauthier, 2000), or the \u201cobject form topography\u201d account (Haxby et al,. 2001). A number of studies attempting to resolve this debate have drawn upon multi-voxel pattern analysis techniques (MVPA) for analyzing fMRI data collected while subjects view images of objects and faces (Grill-Spector et al., 2004; Haxby et al., 2001; O\u2019Toole et al. 2005; Spiridon & Kanwisher, 2002). MVPA techniques typically use statistical or machine-learning techniques to draw inferences from fMRI data by comparing the patterns of activation across multiple voxels in different experimental conditions.

For high dimensional data, the performance of random forests degenerates because of the random sampling feature subspace for each node in the construction of decision trees. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose a new Principal Component Analysis and Stratified Sampling based method, called PCA-SS, for feature subspace selection in random forests with high dimensional data. For each decision tree in the forests, we firstly create the training data by bagging instances and partition the feature set into several feature subsets. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied on each feature subset to obtain transformed features. All the principal components are retained in order to preserve the variability information of the data. Secondly, depending on a certain principal components principle, the transformed features are partitioned into informative and less informative parts. When constructing each node of decision trees, a feature subspace is selected by stratified sampling method from the two parts. The PCA-SS based Random Forests algorithm, named PSRF, ensures enough informative features for each tree node, and it also increases the diversity between the trees to a certain extent. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PSRF significantly improves the performance of random forests when dealing with high dimensional data, compared with the state-of-the-art random forests algorithms.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727772", "venue": "2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "journal": "2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2556272640", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["89141", "62145540", "379259", "122725444", "6847493", "18099999", "57146809", "2047716", "18377491", "34235976", "8993541", "2093696", "60610932", "126402172", "5883609", "62574244", "12470146", "206420153", "12394453", "207738357", "60993494", "6441574", "18033580", "16431024", "10659969", "7553535"], "inbound_citations": ["23781221", "2745486", "49564862", "210698189"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4518689"}

The subjects filled in \"Scale of Clinical Symptoms of Chronic Fatigue\" to record the clinical data of symptoms,tongue,and pulse for the diagnosis of specific TCM symptoms. The random forest (RF) method was adopted to encode the 95 symptoms extracted from the above-mentioned scale to select the main symptoms of common syndromes of CF and to measure the contribution of symptoms to the syndromes. Results Symptom groups of 4 syndromes of CF were achieved. Spleen deficiency syndrome:abdominal distention after eating or in afternoon,loss of appetite,sallow completion,loose stools,and emaciation; Heart deficiency syndrome:palpitation,chest fullness,thready pulse,insomnia or dream-disturbed sleep,and forgetfulness; Liver stagnation syndrome:hot temper or depression,sighing,bitter taste,dry throat,and string-taut pulse; Qi deficiency syndrome:swollen tongue with toothprints,shortness of breath,abrupt breathing,inactive talking,and spontaneous sweating.

The following base classifiers were considered: Support Vector Machine (SVM), the k -Nearest Neighbor ( k -NN) method and two kinds of decision trees \u2014 CART and C4.5. Additionally, three fusion strategies were examined: majority voting, weight assignment based on the individual accuracy of the committee member and optimal weights combination found by the genetic algorithm. The MCSs performance was compared with the effectiveness of single classifiers which operated on the data set containing the response of the entire sensor array. The sensor signal compression by means of granulation was applied as the data pre-processing step. The classification problem consisted in recognizing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air, based on measurements performed by the array composed of fifteen semiconductor gas sensors.

However, predicting CPPs by wet laboratory experiments is both resource-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, the development of effective calculation method prediction has become an important topic in the study of CPPs. Recently, numerous methods developed for predicting CPPs use amino acid composition, alone and the accuracies of such methods have been limited. In this study, we proposed a new CPP prediction framework, which integrates four amino acid composition features, and utilizes these features to help train Support Vector Machine (SVM) model as a classifier to predict CPPs. When performing on the training dataset CPP924, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.3%, which is significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods.

The objective of this paper is to analyse the impact of refined feature selection on different classification algorithms to improve the prediction of classification accuracy for room occupancy. Subsets of the original features constructed by filter or information gain and wrapper techniques are compared in terms of the classification performance achieved with selected machine learning algorithms. Three feature selection algorithms are tested, specifically the Information Gain Attribute Evaluation (IGAE), Correlation Attribute Evaluation (CAE) and Wrapper Subset Evaluation (WSE) algorithms. Following a refined feature selection stage, three machine learning algorithms are then compared, consisting the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Logistic Model Trees (LMT) and Instance Based k (IBk).

Conventional approaches, although useful for different image types, are time consuming. Of late, deep learning (DL) based image registration methods have been proposed that outperform traditional methods in terms of accuracy and time. However, DL based methods are heavily dependent on training data and do not generalize well when presented with images of different scanners or anatomies. We present a DL based approach that can perform medical image registration of one image type despite being trained with images of a different type. This is achieved by unsupervised domain adaptation in the registration process and allows for easier application to different datasets without extensive retraining. To achieve our objective we train a network that transforms the given input image pair to a latent feature space vector using autoencoders. The resultant encoded feature space is used to generate the registered images with the help of generative adversarial networks (GANs). This feature transformation ensures greater invariance to the input image type. Experiments on chest X-ray, retinal and brain MR images show that our method, trained on one dataset gives better registration performance for other datasets, outperforming conventional methods that do not incorporate domain adaptation.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2019.107109", "venue": null, "journal": "Pattern Recognition", "mag_id": "2990245575", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["214728371"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214443079"}

SVM classifiers are focused on achieving more separation between classes than exploiting the structures in the training data within classes. However, the structural information, as an implicit prior knowledge, has recently been found to be vital for designing a good classifier in different real-world problems. Accordingly, using as much prior structural information in data as possible to help improve the generalization ability of a classifier has yielded a class of effective structural large margin classifiers, such as the structured large margin machine (SLMM) and the Laplacian support vector machine (LapSVM). In this paper, we unify these classifiers into a common framework from the concept of \u201cstructural granularity\u201d and the formulation for optimization problems. We exploit the quadratic programming (QP) and second-order cone programming (SOCP) methods, and derive a novel large margin classifier, we call the new classifier the structural regularized support vector machine (SRSVM). Unlike both SLMM at the cross of the cluster granularity and SOCP and LapSVM at the cross of the point granularity and QP, SRSVM is located at the cross of the cluster granularity and QP and thus follows the same optimization formulation as LapSVM to overcome large computational complexity and non-sparse solution in SLMM. In addition, it integrates the compactness within classes with the separability between classes simultaneously. Furthermore, it is possible to derive generalization bounds for these algorithms by using eigenvalue analysis of the kernel matrices. Experimental results demonstrate that SRSVM is often superior in classification and generalization performances to the state-of-the-art algorithms in the framework, both with the same and different structural granularities.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21385668", "doi": "10.1109/TNN.2011.2108315", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2058824296,2187345428", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["14727192", "35730151", "28637672", "2695159", "22608392", "19641543", "5896838", "14753350", "16895625", "14365487", "62375490", "2930283", "1211007", "215471", "17014258", "9949683", "1749436", "62120549", "7676164", "32863022", "29535089", "11354660", "60577818", "10481168", "5894296", "117850639", "42298083", "1188030", "7402494", "2426049", "14177817", "6636078", "207163669"], "inbound_citations": ["16252167", "174809067", "212645721", "7691181", "29017074", "18428920", "32342287", "215349991", "14457309", "115951", "12010921", "73555731", "13750870", "122827223", "8671531", "18990699", "9199684", "16799426", "207322281", "7834332", "12747437", "67871008", "202580235", "1766932", "19041764", "5060431", "6338270", "53015846", "23985564", "15660389", "201105280", "4048038", "214975111", "12186658", "53740027", "56051003", "17058081", "109932415", "14698112", "7669836", "15832270", "29649586", "210023423", "12876947", "60441965", "28960363", "3726314", "13085623", "20330427", "67465401", "2169590", "3240833", "8824586", "16568831"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16463733"}

This paper introduces the notion of psychology as the study of adaptive agency, outlines a hierarchy of adaptive processes underlying adaptive agency, and reviews the history of learning theory and the emergence of ecological and evolutionary approaches to learning.

Previous approaches utilize either a two-step procedure (visible feature estimation and visible image reconstruction) or an input-level fusion technique, where different Stokes images are concatenated and used as a multi-channel input to synthesize the visible image given the corresponding polarimetric signatures. Although these methods have yielded improvements, we argue that input-level fusion alone may not be sufficient to realize the full potential of the available Stokes images. We propose a generative adversarial networks based multi-stream feature-level fusion technique to synthesize high-quality visible images from polarimetric thermal images. The proposed network consists of a generator sub-network, constructed using an encoder\u2013decoder network based on dense residual blocks, and a multi-scale discriminator sub-network. The generator network is trained by optimizing an adversarial loss in addition to a perceptual loss and an identity preserving loss to enable photo realistic generation of visible images while preserving discriminative characteristics. An extended dataset consisting of polarimetric thermal facial signatures of 111 subjects is also introduced.

PARTICIPANTS: This gathering of participants from academia, government, and industry brought together experts in suicide prevention, clinical trial design, psychometrics, pharmacoepidemiology, and genetics, as well as research psychiatrists involved in studies of major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse/dependence, and other psychiatric disorders associated with elevated suicide risk across the life cycle. The process involved reviews of the relevant literature, and a series of 6 breakout sessions focused on specific questions of interest. EVIDENCE: Each of the participants at the meeting received references relevant to the formal presentations (as well as the slides for the presentations) for their review prior to the meeting. In addition, the assessment instruments of suicidal ideation/behavior were reviewed in relationship to standard measures of validity, reliability, and clinical utility, and these findings were discussed at length in relevant breakout groups, in the final plenary session, and in the preparation of the article. Consensus and dissenting views were noted. CONSENSUS PROCESS: Discussion and questions followed each formal presentation during the plenary sessions. Approximately 6 questions per breakout group were prepared in advance by members of the Steering Committee and each breakout group chair. Consensus in the breakout groups was achieved by nominal group process. Consensus recommendations and any dissent were reviewed for each breakout group at the final plenary session. All plenary sessions were recorded and transcribed by a court stenographer. Following the transcript, with input by each of the authors, the final paper went through 14 drafts. The output of the meeting was organized into this scholarly article, which has been developed by the authors with feedback from all participants at the meeting and represents a consensus view. Any areas of disagreement have been noted. CONCLUSIONS: The term suicidality is not as clinically useful as more specific terminology (ideation, behavior, attempts, and suicide). Most participants applauded the FDA's effort to promote standard definitions and definable expectations for investigators and industry sponsors by endorsing the terminology in the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA). Further research of available assessment instruments is needed to verify their utility, reliability, and validity in identifying suicide-associated treatment-emergent adverse effects and/or a signal of efficacy in suicide prevention trials. The FDA needs to build upon its new authority to systematically monitor postmarketing events by encouraging the development of a validated instrument for postmarketing surveillance of suicidal ideation, behavior, and risk within informative large health care-related databases in the United States and abroad. Over time, the FDA, industry, and clinical researchers should evaluate the impact of the current Agency requirement that all CNS clinical drug trials must include a C-CASA-compatible screening instrument for assessing and documenting the occurrence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behavior. Finally, patients at high risk for suicide can safely be included in clinical trials, if proper precautions are followed, and they need to be included to enable premarket assessments of the risks and benefits of medications related to suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and suicide in such patients.

No circulating biomarkers are available to date. Given their involvement in several cardiovascular diseases, plasma microRNAs warranted investigation as potential non-invasive diagnostic tools in ACM. We sought to identify circulating microRNAs differentially expressed in ACM with respect to Healthy Controls (HC) and Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia patients (IVT), often in differential diagnosis. ACM and HC subjects were screened for plasmatic expression of 377 microRNAs and validation was performed in 36 ACM, 53 HC, 21 IVT. Variable importance in data partition was estimated through Random Forest analysis and accuracy by Receiver Operating Curves. Plasmatic miR-320a showed 0.53 \u00b1 0.04 fold expression difference in ACM vs. HC (p < 0.01). A similar trend was observed when comparing ACM (n = 13) and HC (n = 17) with athletic lifestyle, a ACM precipitating factor. Importantly, ACM patients miR-320a showed 0.78 \u00b1 0.05 fold expression change vs. IVT (p = 0.03). When compared to non-invasive ACM diagnostic parameters, miR-320a ranked highly in discriminating ACM vs. IVT and it increased their accuracy.

At a given point in time many nodes (or routers) receive and forward an almost continuous stream of packets. The behavior of such a router is determined by its forwarding table. This table marks for every destination in the network which outgoing link to take to reach its destination. Because communication networks are not infallable, node or link failure occur. Upon such an event, the router node adjacent to the failure cannot any longer use the failed link for reaching the next hop. When a router detects such a failure, a reconfiguration process of the forwarding table is initiated. This affects all packets towards destinations which would be using the failed link. In a typical backbone router of an Internet Service Provider (ISP), the reconfiguration can take hundreds of milliseconds or even more than 1 second. As long as an entry in the forwarding table is configured to use a failed link, all network packets sent towards that link are lost. Because the reconfiguration happens in sets of entries corresponding to specific destinations, cleverly re-ordering these batches could significantly reduce the resulting packet loss. Indeed, ensuring that high traffic volume traffic volume would be reconfigured earlier than lower volume traffic, is the goal of the performed research. The reordering of forwarding entries is more difficult than it appears at first sight. While over sufficiently long periods in time (tens of minutes) the relative proportions of network traffic towards different destinations might be quite stable, this is not the case for periods less than a second. Therefore, we evaluate prediction methods to make predictions of network traffic in the very near future.

The sequence merging rules and algorithms are consequently proposed for time-domain electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance MIDS detection on rhythm waves and slow waves are very close to clinical visual detection. Secondly, the MIDS detection method is applied to IED fragments according to IED features in the time-domain. The results show that most IED fragments are recognized, although with some false detection of non-IED fragments. To reduce such false detection rate, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied with 17 characteristics and a training over 232 fragments from 3 patients' EEG recordings. With the SVM improvement, out-of-sample clinical EEG recordings of 32 suspected epilepsy patients were analyzed and 95.9% of the IED fragments marked by clinicians were successfully detected.

The sophisticated design of these detectors mitigates the effect of most types of noise. However, advanced LIGO data streams are contaminated by numerous artifacts known as glitches: non-Gaussian noise transients with complex morphologies. Given their high rate of occurrence, glitches can lead to false coincident detections, obscure and even mimic gravitational wave signals. Therefore, successfully characterizing and removing glitches from advanced LIGO data is of utmost importance. Here, we present the first application of Deep Transfer Learning for glitch classification, showing that knowledge from deep learning algorithms trained for real-world object recognition can be transferred for classifying glitches in time-series based on their spectrogram images. Using the Gravity Spy dataset, containing hand-labeled, multi-duration spectrograms obtained from real LIGO data, we demonstrate that this method enables optimal use of very deep convolutional neural networks for classification given small training datasets, significantly reduces the time for training the networks, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy above 98.8%, with perfect precision-recall on 8 out of 22 classes. Furthermore, new types of glitches can be classified accurately given few labeled examples with this technique. Once trained via transfer learning, we show that the convolutional neural networks can be truncated and used as excellent feature extractors for unsupervised clustering methods to identify new classes based on their morphology, without any labeled examples. Therefore, this provides a new framework for dynamic glitch classification for gravitational wave detectors, which are expected to encounter new types of noise as they undergo gradual improvements to attain design sensitivity.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1706.07446", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevD.97.101501", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2981230744", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["51929263", "13681876", "41398949", "209516154", "119040171", "4948854", "214761364", "7995455", "204509018", "31690678", "53786319", "1008639", "280657", "19075181", "208176067", "211126609", "4793579", "160022766", "199511490", "53971880", "195874336", "210043094", "21710827"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51982872"}

In real time, a DoI calculator must fulfill a suitable event processing rate, which requires low complexity DoI algorithms. The DoI is obtained when the crystal within a phoswich detector is identified based on the shape of the scintillation light distribution. The main idea of this paper is to enhance the performance of crystal identification by using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) feature extractor. Besides, the paper introduces a complexity reduction method by merging the SVM classification phase and DFT in order to comply with the real-time rate. A real-time FPGA-based merged DFT-SVM DoI method has been implemented and validated to discriminate pulse-shapes of LSO-LuYAP scintillation crystals events. A correct assignment of 92.2% at rate of 6.2 Mevents/s is achieved for a sample of \u223c 100 000 pulses from LSO-LuYAP crystals read out using vacuum photomultipliers.

Moreover, it needs to fulfil the real-time constraint to be useful, e.g. for consumer robotics or healthcare systems. To tackle this issue, Random Forests (RFs) are convenient predictors, as the hard decisions at each node allow non-linear subdivisions of the space with a very fast evaluation runtime. However RFs are non-differenciable predictors, making it impossible to back-propagate the error down to upstream feature extraction layers (e.g. CNN). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of deep Neural Forests (NFs) to FER. The latter allows to combine the best of the two worlds, \\textit{i.e.} a differentiable classification model that can be trained with backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent but has the runtime of a RF.

The chosen feature set in based on statistical texture features of images including gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Entropy, and additional statistical image features that can discriminate between clean and stego images. The guiding principle in choosing the feature set elements is that steganography techniques embed secret data in the right half-byte of an image's bytes, the least significant bits, to avoid perceptible visual distortion that can result from embedding in the left half-bytes. Therefore, the proposed features are applied to 2-LSB, 3-LSB and 4-LSB bit planes of a cover image as well as the full-bytes. For the experimental work, the grayscale single-channel image format was chosen for cover images, and we used the public BossBase1.01 dataset which consists of 10,000 PGM images. The selected classifier was the Support Vector Machine algorithm as implemented in MATLAB. Embedding of data in the cover images was based on 2LSB and 4LSB spatial domain schemes.

Like in conventional 2D mammography the breast is scanned in a compressed state. For orientation during surgical planning, e.g., during presurgical ultrasound-guided anchor-wire marking, as well as for improving communication between radiologists and surgeons it is desirable to estimate an uncompressed model of the acquired breast along with a spatial mapping that allows localizing lesions marked in DBT in the uncompressed model. We therefore propose a method for 3D breast decompression and associated lesion mapping from 3D DBT data. The method is entirely data-driven and employs machine learning methods to predict the shape of the uncompressed breast from a DBT input volume. For this purpose a shape space has been constructed from manually annotated uncompressed breast surfaces and shape parameters are predicted by multiple multi-variate Random Forest regression. By exploiting point correspondences between the compressed and uncompressed breasts, lesions identified in DBT can be mapped to approximately corresponding locations in the uncompressed breast model. To this end, a thin-plate spline mapping is employed. Our method features a novel completely data-driven approach to breast shape prediction that does not necessitate prior knowledge about biomechanical properties and parameters of the breast tissue. Instead, a particular deformation behavior (decompression) is learned from annotated shape pairs, compressed and uncompressed, which are obtained from DBT and magnetic resonance image volumes, respectively.

However, for retrospective habitat identification to be valid and reliable for any adult, irrespective of its age, significant differences in environmental conditions, and therefore otolith signatures, must be temporally stable within each habitat, otherwise connectivity studies have to be carried out by matching year-classes to the corresponding annual fingerprints. This study investigated how various different combinations of chemical elements in otoliths could distinguish, over three separate years, between four coastal lagoon habitats used annually as nurseries by gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) in the Gulf of Lions (NW Mediterranean). A series of nine elements were measured in otoliths of 301 S. aurata juveniles collected in the four lagoons in 2008, 2010 and 2011. Percentages of correct re-assignment of juveniles to their lagoon of origin were calculated with the Random Forest classification method, considering every possible combination of elements. This revealed both spatial and temporal variations in accuracy of habitat identification, with correct re-assignment to each lagoon ranging from 44 to 99% depending on the year and the lagoon. There were also annual differences in the combination of elements that provided the best discrimination among the lagoons. Despite this, when the data from the three years were pooled, a combination of eight elements (B, Ba, Cu, Li, Mg, Rb, Sr and Y) provided greater than 70% correct re-assignment to each single lagoon, with a multi-annual global accuracy of 79%. When considering the years separately, discrimination accuracy with these elemental fingerprints was above 90% for 2008 and 2010. It decreased to 61% in 2011, when unusually heavy rainfall occurred, which presumably reduced chemical differences among several of the lagoons.

Owing to the significant role of membrane proteins in living organisms, the identification of membrane proteins with substantial accuracy is essential. However, the annotation of membrane proteins through conventional methods is difficult, sometimes even impossible.Therefore, membrane proteins are predicted from topogenic sequences using computational intelligence techniques.In this study, we conducted our research in two phases regarding the prediction of membrane protein types and structures. In Phase-I, regarding the prediction of membrane protein types, four different ways are explored in order to enhance true prediction. ::: In the first part of phase-I, membrane protein types are predicted using Composite protein sequence representation followed by the application of principal component analysis in conjunction with individual classifiers.In the second part, the notion of ensemble classification is utilized.In part three, an error correction code is incorporated with Support Vector Machine using evolutionary profiles (Position Specific Scoring Matrix) and SAAC based features.Finally, in part four, a two-layer web predictor Mem- PHybrid is developed.Mem-PHybrid accomplishes the prediction in two steps.First, a protein query is identified as a membrane or a non-membrane protein. In case of membrane protein, then its type is predicted. In the second phase of this research, the structure of membrane protein is recognized as alpha-helix transmembrane or outer membrane proteins.In case of alphahelix transmembrane proteins, features are explored from protein sequences by two feature extraction schemes of distinct natures; including physicochemical properties and compositional index of amino acids.Singular value decomposition is employed to extract high variation features.A hybrid feature vector is formed by combining the different types of features.Weighted Random Forest is then used as a classification algorithm.On the other hand, in case of outer membrane proteins, protein sequences are represented by Amino acid composition, PseAA composition, and SAAC along with their hybrid models.Genetic programming, K-nearest neighbor, and fuzzy K-nearest neighbor are adopted as classification algorithms. ::: Through the simulation study, we observed that the prediction performance of our proposed approaches in case of both types and structures prediction is better compared to existing state of the arts/approaches.

The proposed integrated framework employs advanced machine learning algorithms to first model the non-linear and non-stationary relationship between market demand and product differentiation (thus the product design), which we refer as demand differentiation index (DDI) and then utilize this relationship for predicting the initial demand of the new product in early stages.

Also, we developed a real-time Health 4.0 (H4.0) architecture for Brain Controlled Internet of Things (IoT) enabled Environments (BCE), which uses the classified MI task to assist the disabled persons in controlling IoT enabled environments such as lighting, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), etc. The first method for classification involves a simple and low-complex classification framework using a combination of Regularized Riemannian Mean (RRM) and Linear SVM. Although this method performs better compared to state-of-the-art techniques, it still suffers from a non-negligible misclassification rate. Hence, to overcome this, the second method offers a persistent decision engine (PDE) for the MI classification, which improves the classification accuracy (CA) significantly. The proposed two methods are validated using: 1) in-house recorded four class MI dataset (Dataset-I collected over 14 subjects) and 2) four class MI dataset 2a of BCI Competition IV (Dataset-II collected over 9 subjects). The proposed RRM architecture obtained an average CAs of 74.30% and 67.60% when validated using Dataset-I and Dataset-II, respectively. When analyzed along with the proposed PDE classification framework, an average CA of 92.25% on 12 subjects of Dataset-I and 82.54% on 7 subjects of Dataset-II is obtained. The results show that the PDE algorithm is more reliable for the classification of four class MI and is also feasible for BCE applications. The proposed low-complex BCE architecture is implemented in real-time using Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ along with the Virgo EEG data acquisition system. The hardware implementation results show that the proposed system architecture is well suited for body wearable devices in the scenario of Health 4.0.

However, this sailing schedule historically appears to be unreliable: 20% of the orders that the LSP executed last 2.5 years, did not arrive on time. Since LSPs remain dependent on carriers from the container shipping industry, a platform capable of delivering and processing accurate information is essential for increasing efficiency, visibility and customer service. Not being able to exactly know when an order will arrive, negatively affects the businesses of both the LSP and the customer in terms of decreased efficiency and increased costs. We therefore propose a more proactive attitude towards arrival times by means of a predictive model based on historical order data. We applied the Random Forest technique to this end. The model is able to predict the deviation in the arrival time that is provided by the carrier in their sailing schedule in advance of actual shipment. Deployment of the actual prediction algorithm is expected to lead to improved business processes in terms of increased efficiency and decreased costs for both the LSP and the customer.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2958274161", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199019151"}

The deep CRF coupling model is proposed to fuse the generative and discriminative outputs from the dual GAN nets. As such, the model implicitly constructs mutual constraints on the two network branches and between the generator and discriminator.

The major aim of this research is to handle the feature subset selection (FSS) and weighted classification problem. In this paper, a hybrid FSS approach for F-ELM classifier (H-FELM) is designed for binary and multiclass classification on the clinical dataset. Experimental results illustrate that H-FELM has the capability to handle these problems with improved classification accuracy by selecting prominent features which are relevant and non-redundant. The selection of such features can reduce the computational overhead and hence minimize the learning time.

The method used to accurately classify P2P traffic remains a key problem for Internet Service Producers (ISPs) and network managers. This paper proposes a novel approach to the accurate classification of P2P traffic at a fine-grained level, which depends solely on the number of special flows during small time intervals. These special flows, named Clustering Flows (CFs), are defined as the most frequent and steady flows generated by P2P applications. Hence we are able to classify P2P applications by detecting the appearance of corresponding CFs. Compared to existing approaches, our classifier can realise high classification accuracy by exploiting only several generic properties of flows, instead of extracting sophisticated features from host behaviours or transport layer data. We validate our framework on a large set of P2P traffic traces using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The estimation of quality factors is important for minimizing the cost and improving the effectiveness of the software testing process. One of the quality factors is fault proneness, for which unfortunately there is no generalized technique available to effectively identify fault proneness. Many researchers have concentrated on how to select software metrics that are likely to indicate fault proneness. At the same time dimensionality reduction (feature selection of software metrics) also plays a vital role for the effectiveness of the model or best quality model. Feature selection is important for a variety of reasons such as generalization, performance, computational efficiency and feature interpretability. In this paper a new method for feature selection is proposed based on Decision Tree Induction. Relevant features are selected from the class level dataset based on decision tree classifiers used in the classification process. The attributes which form rules for the classifiers are taken as the relevant feature set or new feature set named Decision Tree Induction Rule based (DTIRB) feature set. Different classifiers are learned with this new data set obtained by decision tree induction process and achieved better performance. The performance of 18 classifiers is studied with the proposed method. Comparison is made with the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and RELIEF feature selection techniques. It is observed that the proposed method outperforms the other two for most of the classifiers considered. Overall improvement in classification process is also found with original feature set and reduced feature set. The proposed method has the advantage of easy interpretability and comprehensibility.

In this paper, we propose a framework for 3D point cloud generation based on a combination of auto-encoders and generative adversarial networks. The framework first trains auto-encoders to learn latent representations, and then trains generative adversarial networks in the learned latent space. We focus on improving the training method for auto-encoders in order to generate 3D point clouds with higher fidelity and coverage. We add parallel sub-decoders that reconstruct subsets of the input point cloud. In order to construct these subsets, we introduce a point sampling algorithm that imposes a method to sample spatially localized point sets. These local subsets are utilized to measure local reconstruction losses. We train auto-encoders to learn an effective latent representation for both global and local shape reconstruction based on the multi-task learning approach. Furthermore, we add global and local adversarial losses to generate more plausible point clouds.

INTRODUCTION effect The red eye effect has been a major problem in photographers since they first started including flash guns in their cameras; it happens when using a photographic flash very close to the camera lens (as with most compact cameras); the extent use of compact devices with built-in flash, involving cell phones and handheld computers, causes a large amount of digital photographs that are possibly affected with red eye. As shown in fig.1, an extreme flash enters the pupil from a direct angle, mirrors the blood vessels in the back of the eye, and leaves the pupil headed straight back to the camera. The light picks up most of its red color from blood in the choroid, a vascular part of the eye which supplies blood to the retina causes the exiting light red. To decrease these artifacts, most cameras have a red-eye flash mode which fires a series of pre-flashes prior to picture capturing [1]; despite detection and correction of red eye is a regular characteristic on most digital cameras today, the technology is not one-size-fits-all. Its efficiency changes based on many causes, including lighting conditions, topic and camera angle. Understanding what causes red eye effect is a good first step toward building a better camera for the makers. Fast pre-flashes make pupil contraction, thus, minimizing the area of reflection; such operation does not entirely remove the red-eye , but reduces it.

Protective antigens are the ones that can invoke specific and enhanced adaptive immune response to subsequent exposure to the specific pathogen or related organisms. Such proteins are therefore of immense importance in vaccine preparation and drug design. However, the laboratory experiments to isolate and identify antigens from a microbial pathogen are expensive, time consuming and often unsuccessful. This is why Reverse Vaccinology has become the modern trend of vaccine search, where computational methods are first applied to predict protective antigens or their determinants, known as epitopes. In this paper, we propose a novel, accurate computational model to identify protective antigens efficiently. Our model extracts features directly from the protein sequences, without any dependence on functional domain or structural information. After relevant features are extracted, we have used Random Forest algorithm to rank the features. Then Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) criterion were applied to extract an optimal set of features. The learning model was trained using Random Forest algorithm. Named as Antigenic , our proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art predictors on a benchmark dataset. Antigenic achieves accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values of 78.04%, 78.99% and 77.08% in 10-fold cross-validation testing respectively.

The image was first calibrated by detecting the corners of a checkerboard. After the preprocessing step, the image was transformed to CIELUV color space, removing the lightness from the chromatic coordinates. The U component showed markedly different textures between the plant and the background. Hence its standard derivation was calculated and thresholded. With this method, significant leaves of the plant were separated while some stalks were not. Therefore, Support Vector Machine was then used to train the LUV data to do further segmentation as a complement of texture analysis. With these two steps, the plant was completely identified and the shape features were then extracted, including the total area, the symmetry and the number of leaves. The real area of the plant was derived with the number of foreground pixels and the calibration result. The symmetries were represented with the degrees of bilateral symmetry in the direction of the major and minor axes. And the number of leaves was obtained by identifying the number of local maximum of the contour-based signature. Experiment result shows that this method is effective in segmentation and shape analysis of Arabidopsis plants. Copyright \u00a9 2014 IFSA Publishing, S.

An important current research question is how to develop robust video content analysis methods that produce satisfactory results for a large variety of video sources, distribution platforms, genres, and content. The work presented in this article exploits the observation that the appearance of objects and events is often related to a particular video sequence, episode, program, or broadcast. This motivates our idea of considering the content analysis task for a single video or episode as a transductive setting: the final classification model must be optimal for the given video only, and not in general, as expected for inductive learning. For this purpose, the unlabeled video test data have to be used in the learning process. In this article, a transductive learning framework for robust video content analysis based on feature selection and ensemble classification is presented. In contrast to related transductive approaches for video analysis (e.g., for concept detection), the framework is designed in a general manner and not only for a single task. The proposed framework is applied to the following video analysis tasks: shot boundary detection, face recognition, semantic video retrieval, and semantic indexing of computer game sequences. Experimental results for diverse video analysis tasks and large test sets demonstrate that the proposed transductive framework improves the robustness of the underlying state-of-the-art approaches, whereas transductive support vector machines do not solve particular tasks in a satisfactory manner.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2168752.2168755", "venue": "TIST", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2112933530", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3127674", "198120229", "31016085", "15781767", "194951", "961425", "5339134", "5599657", "16051768", "60678822", "20556383", "6644398", "62626221", "14591650", "16134811", "404529", "130535382", "2121536", "10598059", "686980", "15635625", "20202992", "27759096", "14133530", "6240352", "16288192", "15379808", "6046661", "24334726", "9593709", "8703121", "11667852", "42281583", "10021076", "8154251", "42531092", "140109802", "7753190", "3737429", "14054920", "9045232", "5978281", "12331515", "1147590", "508435"], "inbound_citations": ["15557035", "1100643", "35722356"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:301442"}

In this paper, an eye localization method has been proposed that can locate the eye centers more precisely in facial images captured under the above-mentioned complexities. The proposed method consists of three stages: eye candidate detection, eye candidate verification, and post-processing. In eye candidate detection, the possible eye candidates are extracted using two new features namely Semi-Circular Edge Shape (sCES) and Semi-Ellipse Edge Shape (sEES) features. These features take into consideration the semi-circular and semi-ellipse edges of iris and eyelid and hence are able to localize eye centers more precisely. In verification, the extracted eye candidates are verified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier. A scale-space framework is also included in the verification stage to handle the scale variations of images. In post-processing, the eye centers are paired using some geometrical constraints and then a modified gradient-based method is proposed to detect the required eye pair. The proposed system is evaluated on different databases to check its robustness to changes in head pose, scale, illumination etc. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method shows better accuracy in challenging environments and also outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.imavis.2019.05.002", "venue": "Image Vis.

Additionally, it should be considered desirable to discriminate between coding and non-coding conserved sequences without recourse to the use of sequence similarity searches of protein databases as such approaches exclude the identification of novel conserved proteins without characterized homologs and may be influenced by the presence in databases of sequences which are erroneously annotated as coding.ResultsHere we present a machine learning-based approach for the discrimination of conserved coding sequences. Our method calculates various statistics related to the evolutionary dynamics of two aligned sequences. These features are considered by a Support Vector Machine which designates the alignment coding or non-coding with an associated probability score.ConclusionWe show that our approach is both sensitive and accurate with respect to comparable methods and illustrate several situations in which it may be applied, including the identification of conserved coding regions in genome sequences and the discrimination of coding from non-coding cDNA sequences.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2758873", "pubmed_id": "19737408", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-10-282", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1974878944", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["3243833", "18690884", "7777003", "1677744", "3189433", "15141629", "18668327", "2771473", "16916596", "44613588", "14299601", "25045213", "37291538", "961425", "21877334", "11654243", "7824801", "17480237", "251692", "9369668"], "inbound_citations": ["9533661", "196612986", "10506251", "54820054", "13868659", "12148436"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15895702"}

Overexpression and/or genomic amplification of TP63 is commonly found in a large number of epithelial tumors, including the majority of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). In many tumors, p63 appears to function as an oncogene, contributing to both increased tumor cell proliferation and survival. To address the mechanisms of p63 function, we studied the interplay of p63 with the chromatin microenvironment at its genomic targets, under distinct physiological and pathological states. We generated transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) and epigenomic (ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq, and DNase-Seq) datasets in representative normal oral and epidermal keratinocytes (HGEP, NHEK) and HNSCC (SCC25, SCC13) cell-lines, to examine whether there exists a HNSCC-specific molecular pattern of p63 targeting. We utilized machine learning methods including Random Forests for classification and regression, to determine the contribution of epigenetic states, transcriptional co-factors and the p63 DNA binding motif in differential p63 binding between normal and cancer states. We found that a core epigenomic signature (H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 binding status and chromatin accessibility) is highly predictive of p63 binding. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that SCC25-specific p63 targets (corresponding to 1239 genomic regions) are inaccessible in normal cells, but in SCC25 they are marked by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marks, indicative of active regulatory regions. Our data suggests that the complex interplay between local chromatin microenvironment, presence and/or absence of distinct co-factors and potential cell-type specific p63 activity might be key drivers of the differential binding events between normal and cancer epithelial cells. Our investigation of SCC-specific p63 binding events also led to the identification of several oncogenic genes (for e.g. SOX2, TRIM32, HAS2, PRKCE) that are direct targets of p63. By performing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis we found that these p63 misregulated genes encompass both known (G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway) and novel cancer pathways thus providing a framework for the oncogenic function of p63. To further evaluate the importance of these findings in the tumor context, we derived a p63 target genes signature and used it to cluster RNA-Seq data of HNSCC patients (obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas). The gene signature could both classify normal samples away from tumors and importantly distinguish between different molecular subtypes of HNSCCs. Collectively our studies suggest that aberrant targeting of p63 leads to dynamic remodeling of the chromatin at its target sites, trigger the expression of a cascade of pro-tumorigenic genes, ultimately condemning the cell to an oncogenic fate. These novel insights potentially provide new avenues to be harnessed for tumor subtype classification, development of biomarkers and for targeted therapies.

Therefore, since inception, the type-II fuzzy set theory has been studied to address the weakness of type-I fuzzy set theory as the membership value itself is fuzzy in type-II fuzzy set theory. On the other hand, rough set based clustering method helps in great extend to handle the inherent uncertainty and vagueness of the data with the concept of lower and upper approximation. However, in rough clustering, rough points are not so certain to a particular cluster. In that case, machine learning technique such as Support Vector Machine can be used to assign the rough points into proper clusters in order to get the better clustering result. Hence, in this article, Support Vector Machine integrated Rough type-II Fuzzy C-Means clustering technique using both the rough set and type-II fuzzy set theories, is proposed.

Reliable cash flow prediction over the course of a construction project puts the project manager in a better position to identify potential problems and develop appropriate strategies to mitigate the negative effects of such on overall project success. Therefore, managers should monitor project progress using cash flow data, which has unique characteristics, as time series data. However, the complex, mutable nature of construction projects currently requires significant reliance on experience and expert opinions to predict cash flow on an ongoing basis. Recent studies have indicated good potential for using artificial intelligence to reduce reliance on human input in cash flow prediction processes.

Meanwhile, the current confrontation decision-making system suffers from difficulties in optimization and generalization. In this paper, a fuzzy reinforcement learning (RL) and the curriculum transfer learning are applied to the micromanagement for robot confrontation system. Firstly, an improved Q-learning in the semi-Markov decision-making process is designed to train the agent and an efficient RL model is defined to avoid the curse of dimensionality. Secondly, a multi-agent RL algorithm with parameter sharing is proposed to train the agents. We use a neural network with adaptive momentum acceleration as a function approximator to estimate the state-action function. Then, a method of fuzzy logic is used to regulate the learning rate of RL. Thirdly, a curriculum transfer learning method is used to extend the RL model to more difficult scenarios, which ensures the generalization of the decision-making system.

Therefore to make the National Airspace System run more efficiently, techniques to more effectively use the limited airport capacity must be developed Air Traffic Management has always been a tactical exercise, with decisions being made to counter near term problems. Since decisions are made quickly, limited time is available to plan out alternate options that may better alleviate arrival flow problems at airports. Extra time means nothing when there is no way to anticipate future operations, therefore predictive tools are required to provide advance notice of future air traffic delays. This research describes how to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict future airport capacity. The Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) is used as an independent variable within the SVM to predict Aircraft Arrival Rates (AAR) which depict airport capacity. Within a decision support tool, the AAR can be derived to determine Ground Delay Program (GDP) program rate and duration and passenger delay. Real world examples are included to highlight the usefulness of this research to airlines, air traffic managers, and the flying consumer.

The aims of this study were to 1) explore the characteristic spectrum of reclaimed soil of different landforms, 2) develop a key spectral-ratio index for evaluating SOM content, and 3) establish a SOM prediction model using the Partial Least Square Regression-Support Vector Machine (PLS-SVM) method. Based on comprehensive analysis of the relationship between SOM content and corresponding spectral reflectance in soils from different landforms, the results showed a new derived spectral index would be useful for estimating SOM. The ratio spectral index (R 2294 nm / R 2286 nm ), calculated using available wavebands in the 350\u20132500 nm region, was proposed for use in the reliable estimation of SOM from downslope and midslope. The PLS-SVM calibration model for the raw spectrum, showed a high predictive accuracy for estimating the SOM content, with cross-validated R 2 of 0.95, and RMSE of 0.12. These outcomes provide a theoretical basis and technical support for estimations of SOM content using visible/near-infrared spectra in reclamation areas.

Secondly, the errors of different generic sub intelligent models are calculated. The weights of sub intelligent models can be obtained by these errors. Then the temperature prediction model is presented by aggregating these sub intelligent models. Finally, when new production data accumulate enough, they will be used to train a new sub intelligent model and the sub model's weight will be obtained according to the errors of training.

Previous studies have sought to identify the best mapping of brain MRI to a low-dimensional manifold, but have been limited by assumptions of explicit similarity measures. In this work, we use deep learning techniques to investigate implicit manifolds of normal brains and generate new, high-quality images. We explore implicit manifolds by addressing the problems of image synthesis and image denoising as important tools in manifold learning. First, we propose the unsupervised synthesis of T1-weighted brain MRI using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) by learning from 528 examples of 2D axial slices of brain MRI. Synthesized images were first shown to be unique by performing a cross-correlation with the training set. Real and synthesized images were then assessed in a blinded manner by two imaging experts providing an image quality score of 1-5. The quality score of the synthetic image showed substantial overlap with that of the real images. Moreover, we use an autoencoder with skip connections for image denoising, showing that the proposed method results in higher PSNR than FSL SUSAN after denoising.

The suggested approach is based on two key concepts; class-based term weighting and changing the orthogonality of vector space. A class-based term weighting methodology is used for transformation of documents from the original space to the feature space. This class-based weighting basically groups terms based on their importance for each class and consequently smooths the representation of documents. This is accomplished by changing the orthogonality of the Vector Space Model (VSM) with introducing class-based dependencies between terms. As a result, on the extreme case, two documents can be seen as similar even if they do not share any terms but their terms are similarly weighted for a particular class. The resulting semantic kernel can directly make use of class information in extracting semantic information between terms, therefore it can be considered as a supervised kernel. For our experimental evaluation, we analyze the performance of the suggested kernel with a large number of experiments on benchmark textual datasets and present results with respect to varying experimental conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use class-based term weighting in order to build a supervised semantic kernel for SVM. We compare our results with kernels that are commonly used in SVM such as linear kernel, polynomial kernel, Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and with several corpus-based semantic kernels.

Injection of MLL-AF9 expressing cells into sublethally-irradiated NOD/SCID mice produced an aggressive FAB-M5-like leukemia that infiltrated the spleen and liver and induced death with an average latency of 8 weeks. Serial transplantation of leukemic cells recapitulated the disease with a similar latency. MLL-AF9 expression conferred the ability to grow indefinitely in culture, promoted an accumulation of cells resembling monoblasts and was associated with an increase in telomerase activity. Mono- or oligoclonal outgrowth arose in vitro as well as in vivo. Numeric karyotypic changes or normal karyotypes, in the absence of structural rearrangements, additions or deletions were detected in cultured cells as well as samples from leukemic mice. Principal Component Analysis of genome-wide gene expression data from MLL-AF9 expressing cultured cells revealed a gene expression signature that closely mirrors that observed in MLL-rearranged leukemic cells from patient samples. Furthermore, training of a (linear) Support Vector Machine with gene expression data from patient samples resulted in the correct classification of all MLL-AF9-expressing cell cultures as MLL-rearranged leukemia. We conclude that expression of MLL-AF9 in a normal human hematopoietic progenitor is sufficient to recapitulate many key aspects of the clinical disease.

Terrestrial biosphere models show large differences when simulating carbon and water cycles, and reducing these differences is a priority for developing more accurate estimates of the condition of terrestrial ecosystems and future climate change. To reduce uncertainties and improve the understanding of their carbon budgets, we investigated the utility of the eddy flux datasets to improve model simulations and reduce variabilities among multi-model outputs of terrestrial biosphere models in Japan. Using 9 terrestrial biosphere models (Support Vector Machine \u2013 based regressions, TOPS, CASA, VISIT, Biome-BGC, DAYCENT, SEIB, LPJ, and TRIFFID), we conducted two simulations: (1) point simulations at four eddy flux sites in Japan and (2) spatial simulations for Japan with a default model (based on original settings) and a modified model (based on model parameter tuning using eddy flux data). Generally, models using default model settings showed large deviations in model outputs from observation with large model-by-model variability. However, after we calibrated the model parameters using eddy flux data (GPP, RE and NEP), most models successfully simulated seasonal variations in the carbon cycle, with less variability among models. We also found that interannual variations in the carbon cycle are mostly consistent among models and observations. Spatial analysis also showed a large reduction in the variability among model outputs. This study demonstrated that careful validation and calibration of models with available eddy flux data reduced model-by-model differences. Yet, site history, analysis of model structure changes, and more objective procedure of model calibration should be included in the further analysis.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/bg-7-2061-2010", "venue": null, "journal": "Biogeosciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2117751997", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["126980368", "36026796", "961425", "15345159", "2689847", "52214847", "67842973", "14727192", "132319806", "11557095", "19369008", "55225191", "54718589", "168942", "129330257", "96666445", "84368302", "84422450", "84681992", "16299915", "84259718", "37485910", "84398968", "98340396", "53610366", "124135431", "85166774", "86689141", "17600741", "35258946", "85157343", "133317934", "131473237", "2292224", "85926151", "84063342", "83747503", "85742875", "54956208", "43079244", "43875001", "16895913", "128837373", "130182350", "25010", "13923247", "102487336"], "inbound_citations": ["4685370", "15592339", "54605543", "52864494", "160017816", "56300818", "10710265", "197675144"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15799594"}
