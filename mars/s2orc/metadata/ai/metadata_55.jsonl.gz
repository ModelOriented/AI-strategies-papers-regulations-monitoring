Meta-heuristic feature selection algorithms, used as a solution to this problem, need to have a good trade-off between exploitation and exploration of the search space. Genetic Algorithm (GA), a popular meta-heuristic algorithm, lacks exploitation capability, which in turn affects the local search ability of the algorithm. Basically, GA uses mutation operation to take care of exploitation which has certain limitations. As a result, GA gets stuck in local optima. To encounter this problem, in the present work, we have intelligently blended the Great Deluge Algorithm (GDA), a local search algorithm, with GA. Here GDA is used in place of mutation operation of the GA. Application of GDA yields a high degree of exploitation through the use of perturbation of candidate solutions. The proposed method is named as Deluge based Genetic Algorithm (DGA). We have applied the DGA on 15 publicly available standard datasets taken from the UCI dataset repository. To show the classifier independent nature of the proposed feature selection method, we have used 3 different classifiers namely K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Comparison of DGA has been performed with other contemporary algorithms like the basic version of GA, Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA) and Histogram based Multi-Objective GA (HMOGA). From the comparison results, it has been observed that DGA performs much better than others in most of the cases. Thus, our main contributions in this paper are introduction of a new variant of GA for FS which uses GDA to strengthen its exploitational ability and application of the proposed method on 15 well-known UCI datasets using KNN, MLP and SVM classifiers.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12065-019-00218-5", "venue": null, "journal": "Evolutionary Intelligence", "mag_id": "2921715603", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208880563", "203708947"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88480828"}

We present a new approach to stratifying multi-label data for classification purposes based on the iterative stratification approach proposed by Sechidis et. al. in an ECML PKDD 2011 paper. Our method extends the iterative approach to take into account second-order relationships between labels. Obtained results are evaluated using statistical properties of obtained strata as presented by Sechidis. We also propose new statistical measures relevant to second-order quality: label pairs distribution, the percentage of label pairs without positive evidence in folds and label pair - fold pairs that have no positive evidence for the label pair. We verify the impact of new methods on classification performance of Binary Relevance, Label Powerset and a fast greedy community detection based label space partitioning classifier. Random Forests serve as base classifiers. We check the variation of the number of communities obtained per fold, and the stability of their modularity score. Second-Order Iterative Stratification is compared to standard k-fold, label set, and iterative stratification.

In the proposed model, the convolutional layer becomes a bidirectional recurrent neural network by utilizing the intra-layer recurrent connection within the convolutional layer. Each neuron within convolutional layer receives feedforward and recurrent inputs from the previous unit and neighborhood, respectively. In addition to step-by-step recurrent operation, the region of context capture increases, thereby facilitating fine-grain feature extraction. Furthermore, we use a data parallelism approach over multimodel data during training and testing of the proposed model. Results show that the data parallelism approach leads to fast conversion speed. The RCNN-based model works differently from the traditional convolutional neural network and other typical methods. The proposed model exhibits a prediction accuracy of 96.02%, which is higher than those of typical existing methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879158", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2899792733", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3309638", "207218223", "57599565", "3451200", "6862491", "3486444", "351666", "52197351", "639755", "10804988", "15453764", "17159318", "10201625", "6127271", "17127188", "37265536", "21569706", "3911812", "10045150", "22634647", "44685561", "22981843", "14748465", "22008557", "2744692", "20729396", "9491093", "24859912", "9856627", "16604512", "109426504", "206456781", "21861208", "11698674", "244721", "17808371", "578710", "206858901", "17213651", "3098890", "12630207", "14421545", "20743702", "448134", "323924", "3409192", "19057660", "4987276", "14402068", "11058599", "14907134", "32808721", "5742734", "205641728", "10955557", "3471209", "42232853", "8979512", "7703214", "11881004", "9635134", "1423391", "1306065", "2407601", "6075369", "6613124", "15453764", "28989443", "13448854", "18166574", "16636683", "9381935", "206592484", "3960646"], "inbound_citations": ["214675257", "203655693", "203171877", "211209061"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54436123"}

The processing consists of separation of the MIMO streams followed by modulation classification of the separated signals. While in general, blind separation of signals over frequency selective channels is a difficult problem, the non-frequency selective nature of the channel experienced by individual symbols in a MIMO-OFDM system enables the application of well-known ICA algorithms. Modulation classification is implemented by maximum likelihood and by an SVM-based modulation classification method relying on pre-selected modulation-dependent features. To improve performance in time varying channels, the invariance of the channel is exploited across the coherence bandwidth and the time coherence.

To show the efficacy of the CCA assisted LSSVM methodology, we have tested it on several benchmark examples.

These ML classifiers are frequently trained with huge numbers of patients\u2019 data to keep updated with new diseases and changes in current disease patterns. To increase the accuracy in prediction process, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) learning systems have been explored by many studies by which medical institutions can share their data with others: the more data are available, the more accurate the predictions. However, the traditional P2P network system requires much time in which the training data are shared among the nodes in the network. The system also spends much time on learning from samples where the data labels are unknown. Moreover, some nodes may perform certain computations which had already been computed by other nodes, resulting in redundant computations. In this paper, in order to deal with samples having unknown data labels, we propose a Collaborative Extreme Learning Machine (CELM) with a Confidence Interval (CI), which is an enhanced version of the traditional Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Our proposed model eliminates redundant calculations of the network nodes (the e-healthcare institutions) to improve the learning efficiency, and improves the prediction accuracy by considering where plausible predictions lie.

In some cases, changes in landscape patterns affect LST, even more than the contribution of greenhouse gases. Although much work has been done with respect to the correlations between urban development and thermal environment dynamics, the related questions regarding relationships between LST and landscape patterns in arid regions are not thoroughly considered. Understanding these questions is important in climate change and land planning. The objective of this study was to explore the spatiotemporal variations of LST by distribution index (DI) and Mann-Kendall mutation analysis method and to quantify the relationships between landscape patterns, climatic factors, topographic factors, and the land surface thermal environment (LSTE) by the ordinary linear regressions (OLS) model. The landscape patterns dataset, which was validated by a field trip, was extracted from the Land satellite (Landsat) TM/OLI images by the Random Forest methodology in ArcGIS software. The MODIS/LST product was validated by the \u201cMonthly dataset of China's surface climate\u201d and a field trip. Annual LST increased by 0.54 \u00b0C (23.15 \u00b0C in 2000 and 23.79 \u00b0C in 2015). In different landscape patterns, the percentage of areas with a high level of LST showed a significant difference. In barren land, the highest area proportion for the high LST level was larger than in other landscape patterns. Meanwhile, the area of low LST was mainly concentrated in water bodies. Considerable changes have occurred in landscape patterns, in which the most noteworthy was cultivated land encroaching on grass land (3708.44 km2). The composition of landscape patterns was more important than distribution in determining the region's LST.

Compared with other single hidden layer feedforward neural network algorithms, ELM is characterized by simpler parameter selection rules, faster convergence speed, and less human intervention. The multiple hidden layer regularized extreme learning machine (MRELM) inherits these advantages of ELM and has higher prediction accuracy. In the MRELM model, the number of hidden layers is randomly initiated and fixed, and there is no iterative tuning process. However, the optimal number of hidden layers is the key factor to determine the generalization ability of MRELM. Given this situation, it is obviously unreasonable to determine this number by trial and random initialization. In this paper, an incremental MRELM training algorithm (FC-IMRELM) based on forced positive-definite Cholesky factorization is put forward to solve the network structure design problem of MRELM. First, an MRELM-based prediction model with one hidden layer is constructed, and then a new hidden layer is added to the prediction model in each training step until the generalization performance of the prediction model reaches its peak value. Thus, the optimal network structure of the prediction model is determined. In the training procedure, forced positive-definite Cholesky factorization is used to calculate the output weights of MRELM, which avoids the calculation of the inverse matrix and Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of matrix involved in the training process of hidden layer parameters. Therefore, FC-IMRELM prediction model can effectively reduce the computational cost brought by the process of increasing the number of hidden layers. Experiments on classification and regression problems indicate that the algorithm can be effectively used to determine the optimal network structure of MRELM, and the prediction model training by the algorithm has excellent performance in prediction accuracy and computational cost.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2019/6740523", "venue": null, "journal": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2941564432", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["116134052", "52111154", "125439316", "15589402", "116858", "49678952", "26206241", "117571189", "133291479", "46893585", "17128241", "15037168", "16897933", "19002875", "207111829", "41371223", "56070566", "13687484", "13681435", "14070159", "7129417", "917229", "122701364", "3570420", "128148477", "127566681", "125414183"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149819980"}

Metabolic pathways are a series of biochemical reactions, in which the product (output) from one reaction serves as the substrate (input) to another reaction. Many pathways remain incompletely characterized. One of the major challenges of computational biology is to obtain better models of metabolic pathways. Existing models are dependent on the annotation of the genes. This propagates error accumulation when the pathways are predicted by incorrectly annotated genes. Pairwise classification methods are supervised learning methods used to classify new pair of entities. Some of these classification methods, e.g., Pairwise Support Vector Machines (SVMs), use pairwise kernels. Pairwise kernels describe similarity measures between two pairs of entities. Using pairwise kernels to handle sequence data requires long processing times and large storage. Rational kernels are kernels based on weighted finite-state transducers that represent similarity measures between sequences or automata. They have been effectively used in problems that handle large amount of sequence information such as protein essentiality, natural language processing and machine translations. We create a new family of pairwise kernels using weighted finite-state transducers (called Pairwise Rational Kernel (PRK)) to predict metabolic pathways from a variety of biological data. PRKs take advantage of the simpler representations and faster algorithms of transducers. Because raw sequence data can be used, the predictor model avoids the errors introduced by incorrect gene annotations. We then developed several experiments with PRKs and Pairwise SVM to validate our methods using the metabolic network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As a result, when PRKs are used, our method executes faster in comparison with other pairwise kernels. Also, when we use PRKs combined with other simple kernels that include evolutionary information, the accuracy values have been improved, while maintaining lower construction and execution times. The power of using kernels is that almost any sort of data can be represented using kernels. Therefore, completely disparate types of data can be combined to add power to kernel-based machine learning methods. When we compared our proposal using PRKs with other similar kernel, the execution times were decreased, with no compromise of accuracy. We also proved that by combining PRKs with other kernels that include evolutionary information, the accuracy can also also be improved. As our proposal can use any type of sequence data, genes do not need to be properly annotated, avoiding accumulation errors because of incorrect previous annotations.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4261252", "pubmed_id": "25260372", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-15-318", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1986157690", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["45855997", "8800449", "6003320", "3494225", "34742445", "32076196", "87512094", "59810311", "117802109", "10335772", "6146371", "2990825", "337903", "2288778", "5666499", "2838855", "15399016", "9087670", "5548799", "14566237", "4470709", "7923324", "6707129", "61984647", "88516979", "1192563", "16921375", "15865414", "5246854", "14135196", "13148615", "52874011", "15093291", "43188859", "9565525", "18868540", "10869889", "961425", "21791419", "2702042", "118635", "46226024", "4486432", "206951248", "5520466", "2341548"], "inbound_citations": ["17518166", "2341548", "91928009", "204960606"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2341548"}
{"paper_id": "171058587", "title": "Adaptive systems for hidden Markov model-based pattern recognition systems", "authors": [{"first": "Paulo", "middle": ["Rodrigo"], "last": "Cavalin", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This thesis focuses on the design of adaptive systems (AS) for dealing with complex pattern recognition problems. Pattern recognition systems usually rely on static knowledge to define a configuration to be used during their entire lifespan. However, some systems need to adapt to knowledge that may not have been available in the design phase. For this reason, AS are designed to tailor a baseline pattern recognition system as required, and in an automated fashion, in both the learning and generalization phases. These AS are defined here, using hidden Markov model (HMM)-based classifiers as a case study. ::: ::: We first evaluate incremental learning algorithms for the estimation of HMM parameters. The main goal is to find incremental learning algorithms that perform as well as the traditional batch learning techniques, but incorporate the advantages of incremental learning for designing complex pattern recognition systems. Experiments on handwritten characters have shown that a proposed variant of the Ensemble Training algorithm, which employs ensembles of HMMs, can lead to very promising results. Furthermore, the use of a validation dataset demonstrates that it is possible to achieve better performances than those of batch learning. ::: ::: We then propose a new approach for the dynamic selection of ensembles of classifiers. Based on the concept called \u201cmultistage organizations\u201d, the main objective of which is to define a multi-layer fusion function that adapts to individual recognition problems, we propose dynamic multistage organization (DMO), which defines the best multistage structure for each test sample. By extending Dos Santos et al\u2019s approach, we propose two implementations for DMO, namely DSAm and DSAc. DSAm considers a set of dynamic selection functions to generalize a DMO structure, and DSAc uses contextual information, represented by the output profiles computed from the validation dataset. The experimental evaluation, considering both small and large datasets, demonstrates that DSAc outperforms DSAm on most problems. This shows that the use of contextual information can result in better performance than other methods. The performance of DSAc can also be enhanced in incremental learning. However, the most important observation, supported by additional experiments, is that dynamic selection is generally preferred over static approaches when the recognition problem presents a high level of uncertainty. ::: ::: Finally, we propose the LoGID (Local and Global Incremental Learning for Dynamic Selection) framework, the main goal of which is to adapt hidden Markov model-based pattern recognition systems in both the learning and generalization phases. Given that the baseline system is composed of a pool of base classifiers, adaptation during generalization is conducted by dynamically selecting the best members of this pool to recognize each test sample. Dynamic selection is performed by the proposed K-nearest output profiles algorithm, while adaptation during learning consists of gradually updating the knowledge embedded in the base classifiers by processing previously unobserved data. This phase employs two types of incremental learning: local and global. Local incremental learning involves updating the pool of base classifiers by adding new members to this set. These new members are created with the Learn++ algorithm. In contrast, global incremental learning consists of updating the set of output profiles used during generalization. The proposed framework has been evaluated on a diversified set of databases. The results indicate that LoGID is promising. In most databases, the recognition rates achieved by the proposed method are higher than those achieved by other state-of-the-art approaches, such as batch learning. Furthermore, the simulated incremental learning setting demonstrates that LoGID can effectively improve the performance of systems created with small training sets as more data are observed over time.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2200774174", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:171058587"}

However, due to data imbalance, a single object may not reflect the performance of a predictive model. Therefore, we developed a multi-objective radiomics model which considers both sensitivity and specificity as the objective functions simultaneously. The new model is used to predict distant failure in lung SBRT using 52 patients treated at our institute. Quantitative imaging features of PET and CT as well as clinical parameters are utilized to build the predictive model. Image features include intensity features (9), textural features (12) and geometric features (8). Clinical parameters for each patient include demographic parameters (4), tumor characteristics (8), treatment faction schemes (4) and pretreatment medicines (6). The modelling procedure consists of two steps: extracting features from segmented tumors in PET and CT; and selecting features and training model parameters based on multi-objective. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as the predictive model, while a nondominated sorting-based multi-objective evolutionary computation algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used for solving the multi-objective optimization. ::: ::: Results: ::: The accuracy for PET, clinical, CT, PET+clinical, PET+CT, CT+clinical, PET+CT+clinical are 71.15%, 84.62%, 84.62%, 85.54%, 82.69%, 84.62%, 86.54%, respectively.

Pattern search (PS) is a derivative-free optimization method suitable for low-dimensional optimization problems for which it is difficult or impossible to calculate derivatives. This methodology was motivated by an application in drug design in which regression models are constructed based on a few high-dimensional exemplars. Automatic model selection in such underdetermined problems is essential to avoid overfitting and overestimates of generalization capability caused by selecting parameters based on testing results. We focus on SVM model selection for regression based on leave-one-out (LOO) and cross-validated estimates of mean squared error, but the search strategy is applicable to any model criterion. Because the resulting error surface produces an extremely noisy map of the model quality with many local minima, the resulting generalization capacity of any single local optimal model illustrates high variance. Thus several locally optimal SVMmodels are generated and then bagged or averaged to produce the final SVM. This strategy of pattern search combined with model averaging has proven to be very effective on benchmark tests and in high-variance drug design domains with high potential of overfitting. \u2217This work is supported by the NSF Grants IIS-9979860 and IRI-97092306. \u2020Dept. of Decision Sciences and Engineering Systems, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180, mommam@rpi.edu \u2021Dept. of Mathematical Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180, bennek@rpi.edu", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1137/1.9781611972726.16", "venue": "In Proceedings of the SIAM International Conference on Data Mining", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1588486985", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["793899", "115770925", "58113852", "2856196", "743542", "9988056", "59883315", "60287558", "403298", "43677071", "280279", "118468304", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": ["15265843", "187118", "16182476", "43512711", "13893592", "15273900", "59337558", "111087869", "174768462", "3248302", "110287979", "4977127", "14473645", "16311949", "133394581", "1975245", "4358577", "10646465", "3422104", "25607215", "1860821", "55954867", "29092169", "14694741", "16543864", "20761071", "18125719", "16728559", "13616519", "9317594", "2323042", "926207", "39000602", "9089632", "11424924", "1862873", "14490303", "15720484", "1150982", "16901436", "15787913", "30612443", "6751385", "18963112", "14832008", "13071381", "2243881", "54058403", "7291147", "214619411", "9550029", "20384862", "2629565", "2131662", "13386529", "17987993", "2480872", "17883353", "8758280", "17675131", "17734364", "51998406", "729000", "41544097", "8543457", "2606853", "16759139", "18821954", "1320116", "17165734", "15523794", "9682761", "109907320", "12675836", "16319014", "41358102", "10836915", "17609842", "122882757", "3423183", "439947", "16050075"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44945"}

The problem consists of grasping an article from a random point, recognizing it and then bringing it into an unfolded state. We propose a data-driven method for clothes recognition from depth images using Random Decision Forests. We also propose a method for unfolding an article of clothing after estimating and grasping two key-points, using Hough forests. Both methods are implemented into a POMDP framework allowing the robot to interact optimally with the garments, taking into account uncertainty in the recognition and point estimation process. This active recognition and unfolding makes our system very robust to noisy observations. Our methods were tested on regular-sized clothes using a dual- arm manipulator and an Xtion depth sensor. We achieved 100% accuracy in active recognition and 93.3% unfolding success rate, while our system operates faster compared to the state of the art. I. INTRODUCTION Robots doing the housework have recently attracted the attention of scientists. Our interest is focused in the task of folding clothes and particularly in the first part of the proce- dure, which is the unfolding of an article of clothing. Starting from a crumbled initial configuration, we want to recognize the article and then bring it into an unfolded state so that it is ready for folding. One of the key challenges in clothes perception and manipulation is handling the variabilities in geometry and appearance. These variabilities are due to the large number of different configurations of a garment, self- occlusions and the wide range of cloth textures and colors. Research on clothes perception and manipulation started in the middle 90s (1), presenting some first clothes recogni- tion techniques with the help of a dual manipulator. Later, research has been made in garment modelling and feature extraction (2) (3), while only recently scientists were able to completely fold an article of clothing starting from a crum- pled initial configuration (4) (5) (2). The main limitations in the state-of-the-art are a) slow performance and b) difficulty to generalize to a variety of shapes and materials. This stems mainly from the model-driven approaches used and associated simplifying assumptions made. To address these limitations we propose a data-driven approach for clothes recognition and unfolding. We first recognize the type of the article from raw depth data using Random Forests. Based on the recognition result, a pair of key-points are identified such that the article will naturally unfold when held by these two points (Fig. 1). Point estimation is based on Hough Forests, a random forest framework with Hough voting. An active manipulation (perception-action) approach based on POMDPs is also proposed that accounts for uncertainty in (a) Random Initial Configura- tion, grasping lowest point (b) Recognizing garment, then grasping 1 st estimated point", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICRA.2014.6906974", "venue": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)", "journal": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2052461980", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9266397", "872257", "307718", "12738332", "43603659", "110527566", "2508883", "18269255", "8431446", "71167862", "661287", "5826454", "16998606", "61962167", "7286062", "89141", "4649510", "17921764", "16546527", "2032632", "9130208", "56424981", "34324943"], "inbound_citations": ["59222269", "2265977", "4632898", "5599155", "1603342", "17604856", "25997442", "204401687", "201813145", "53080768", "14269932", "16956648", "38195651", "18916705", "49432211", "1247865", "3347774", "69621899", "201743392", "201743392", "88500112", "29941789", "13199421", "15705074", "16749889", "3934984", "6598626", "31478879", "2557612", "214667209", "38720677", "4664967", "12226162", "202583522", "8181187", "39469659", "27865308", "3917449", "11935738", "13367255", "34707119", "14410370", "11369227", "54450271", "64920949", "18515445", "2539338", "14382667", "58014100", "51874767", "20443928", "56596872", "77387492", "189628987", "214605751", "67856008", "196178717", "52966970", "214714285", "18067452", "64967336", "20230363", "21290524", "38980726", "52227265", "155106038"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4643910"}

We used three algorithms, namely: Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine Algorithm (SVM) and MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP). From the results, it was possible to identify greater precision in the models generated by MLPs, with a MAPE of 1% in 2015, 6% in 2016, 6% in 2017 and 8% in 2018, this model had an average accuracy of 30% higher if compared to the model that makes use of SVM (SMOreg), and in average it is 60% more accurate than the linear regression model. It is believed that increasingly refined adjustments in the MLP algorithm may further increase its accuracy and that the usage of other non-absolute quality measurements could demonstrate to which direction the prediction error is moving to.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2894861143", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126012495"}

First, a deep asymmetric auto-encoder is constructed, in which nonlinear activation functions are used in the encoder hidden layers and linear activation functions are utilized in the decoder layers. Second, the encoder hidden layers are connected in a cascade way, so that outputs of a hidden layer are considered as the inputs to the succeeding hidden layer. Third, the optimal weights of connections between the layers of the decoder are solved analytically. Lastly, the AE-ELMs are stacked to create the complete encoder/decoder. The extreme learning machine (ELM) is selected due to its analytical calculation of weights efficient training that is suitable for practical implementation. In this neural network, data compression is achieved by transforming the original data through the encoder layers where the size of outputs from the last encoder hidden layer is smaller than the original data size.

Prior work in multiagent learning has often been focussed on homogeneous groups of agents, meaning that all agents were identical and a priori aware of this fact. Also, those algorithms that are specifically designed for ad hoc team problems are typically evaluated in teams of agents with fixed behaviours, as opposed to agents which are adapting their behaviours. In this work, we empirically evaluate five MAL algorithms, representing major approaches to multiagent learning but originally developed with the homogeneous setting in mind, to understand their behaviour in a set of ad hoc team problems. All teams consist of agents which are continuously adapting their behaviours. The algorithms are evaluated with respect to a comprehensive characterisation of repeated matrix games, using performance criteria that include considerations such as attainment of equilibrium, social welfare and fairness. Our main conclusion is that there is no clear winner.

Implicated factors include correlations among, and distinctiveness of, semantic features, semantic richness, and the structural organization of features into cortical regions (by modality and/or object domain). Event- related potentials and connectionist attractor networks are well suited for this problem because they provide near- continuous measurement during word meaning computation. We explored the dynamics of a recurrent attractor network trained with verbal feature-based representations of concepts and show how feature-based statistical structure (e.g., correlations among features) affects concept settling dynamically through time. We also analyzed ERPs during a mental image-generation task using the identical items, incorporating measures of feature-based statistical structure, semantic richness (e.g., imageability), and modality-specific knowledge types (e.g., number of visual features). Using polynomial mixed-effects models, we demonstrate overlapping dynamic spatiotemporal effects of these measures, and discuss implications for theories of knowledge representation.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2624906183", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64638408"}

We present a method to identify ambulatory phases and distinguish stair ascent and descent from level walking in daily activity recordings of stroke survivors. A realistic dataset was captured with inertial and barometric pressure sensors worn at 5 anatomical locations. Statistical and wavelet based acceleration features fed into a Support Vector Machine were used to identify walking phases, while a k-Nearest-Neighbor classifier was used to discriminate between level walking, stair ascent and descent based on barometric pressure and acceleration features. Combining data from multiple sensor modules resulted in walking classification sensitivities and specificities of up to 96%.

The particular characteristics of the considered low-amplitude signals (a self-induced emotion produces a signal whose amplitude is about 15% of a really experienced emotion) require exploring and adapting strategies like the Wavelet Transform, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) for signal processing, analysis and classification. Moreover, the method is thought to be used in a multi-emotions based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) and, for this reason, an ad hoc shrewdness is assumed. MethodThe peculiarity of the brain activation requires ad-hoc signal processing by wavelet decomposition, and the definition of a set of features for signal characterization in order to discriminate different self-induced emotions. The proposed method is a two stages algorithm, completely parameterized, aiming at a multi-class classification and may be considered in the framework of machine learning. The first stage, the calibration, is off-line and is devoted at the signal processing, the determination of the features and at the training of a classifier. The second stage, the real-time one, is the test on new data. The PCA theory is applied to avoid redundancy in the set of features whereas the classification of the selected features, and therefore of the signals, is obtained by the SVM. ResultsSome experimental tests have been conducted on EEG signals proposing a binary BCI, based on the self-induced disgust produced by remembering an unpleasant odor. Since in literature it has been shown that this emotion mainly involves the right hemisphere and in particular the T8 channel, the classification procedure is tested by using just T8, though the average accuracy is calculated and reported also for the whole set of the measured channels. ConclusionsThe obtained classification results are encouraging with percentage of success that is, in the average for the whole set of the examined subjects, above 90%. An ongoing work is the application of the proposed procedure to map a large set of emotions with EEG and to establish the EEG headset with the minimal number of channels to allow the recognition of a significant range of emotions both in the field of affective computing and in the development of auxiliary communication tools for subjects affected by severe disabilities.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26358282", "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2015.08.011", "venue": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "mag_id": "1560157848", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52940990", "53769507", "195776914", "212639462", "1511245", "33571980", "31263508", "64737741", "90932684", "46889493", "215276994", "52957121", "13558805", "35138613", "52046919", "17263595", "34264190", "53962533", "3778555", "11539188", "32023371", "214596365", "163164599", "49186074"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206858519"}

In order to provide a better fit to the target data distribution when the dataset includes many different classes, we propose a variant of the basic GAN model, called Gaussian Mixture GAN (GM-GAN), where the probability distribution over the latent space is a mixture of Gaussians. We also propose a supervised variant which is capable of conditional sample synthesis. In order to evaluate the model's performance, we propose a new scoring method which separately takes into account two (typically conflicting) measures - diversity vs. quality of the generated data. Through a series of empirical experiments, using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we quantitatively show that GM-GANs outperform baselines, both when evaluated using the commonly used Inception Score, and when evaluated using our own alternative scoring method. In addition, we qualitatively demonstrate how the \\textit{unsupervised} variant of GM-GAN tends to map latent vectors sampled from different Gaussians in the latent space to samples of different classes in the data space. We show how this phenomenon can be exploited for the task of unsupervised clustering, and provide quantitative evaluation showing the superiority of our method for the unsupervised clustering of image datasets. Finally, we demonstrate a feature which further sets our model apart from other GAN models: the option to control the quality-diversity trade-off by altering, post-training, the probability distribution of the latent space.

However, before this can be done, disruptions must first be predicted with sufficient warning time to actuate a response. The established field of survival analysis provides a convenient statistical framework for time-to-event (i.e. time-to-disruption) studies. This paper demonstrates the integration of an existing disruption prediction machine learning algorithm with the Kaplan-Meier estimator of survival probability. Specifically discussed are the implied warning times from binary classification of disruption databases and the interpretation of output signals from Random Forest algorithms trained and tested on these databases. This survival analysis approach is applied to both smooth and noisy test data to highlight important features of the survival and hazard functions. In addition, this method is applied to three Alcator C-Mod plasma discharges and compared to a threshold-based scheme for triggering alarms. In one case, both techniques successfully predict the disruption; although, in another, neither warns of the impending disruption with enough time to mitigate. For the final discharge, the survival analysis approach could avoid the false alarm triggered by the threshold method.

As engineering properties of aggregates are to a great extent determined by the petrological composition of the rock aggregates, the question is, whether a statistical classification rule for identification of rock aggregates can be developed. However, the classification of rocks is complicated by the fact that the optical behavior of minerals forming the rock often appears muted. In addition, minor constituents may dominate the spectrum. Furthermore, the relevant spectra form high dimensional data that are extremely difficult to analyze statistically, especially when curves are very similar.

The analyses are often performed on a large number of highly correlated measurements using a relatively smaller number of samples. Despite the correlation structure, the most widely used approach is to analyze the data using univariate methods followed by post-hoc corrections that try to account for the data's multivariate nature. Although widely used, this approach may fail to recover from the adverse effects of the initial analysis when local effects are not strong. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is a powerful alternative to the univariate approach for identifying relevant variations. Jointly analyzing all the measures, MVPA techniques can detect global effects even when individual local effects are too weak to detect with univariate analysis. Current approaches are successful in identifying variations that yield highly predictive and compact models. However, they suffer from lessened sensitivity and instabilities in identification of relevant variations. Furthermore, current methods' user-defined parameters are often unintuitive and difficult to determine. In this article, we propose a novel MVPA method for group analysis of high-dimensional data that overcomes the drawbacks of the current techniques. Our approach explicitly aims to identify all relevant variations using a \u201cknock-out\u201d strategy and the Random Forest algorithm. In evaluations with synthetic datasets the proposed method achieved substantially higher sensitivity and accuracy than the state-of-the-art MVPA methods, and outperformed the univariate approach when the effect size is low. In experiments with real datasets the proposed method identified regions beyond the univariate approach, while other MVPA methods failed to replicate the univariate results. More importantly, in a reproducibility study with the well-known ADNI dataset the proposed method yielded higher stability and power than the univariate approach.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4618061", "pubmed_id": "26272728", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.08.006", "venue": "NeuroImage", "journal": "NeuroImage", "mag_id": "1165298439", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["1381548", "207514454", "52039977", "4043733", "51728162", "52271458", "20025294", "5891294"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207195189"}

SVM were successfully applied and the final susceptibility map was interpreted via success and prediction rate curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, to support the modeling results and assess the robustness of the model. SVM appeared to be very specific learners, able to discriminate between the informative input and random noise. About 78% of occurrences was identified within the 20% of the most susceptible study area for the cross-validation set. Then the final susceptibility map was compared with other maps, addressed by different statistical approaches, commonly used in susceptibility mapping, such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and naive Bayes classifier. The SVM procedure was found feasible and able to outperform other techniques in terms of accuracy and generalization capacity. The over-performance of SVM against the other techniques was around 18% for the cross-validation set, considering the 20% of the most susceptible area. Moreover, by analyzing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, SVM appeared to be less prone to false positives than the other models.

A comparison with the traditional SVM shows a significant improvement in terms of computational costs while maintaining similar accuracy, which can contribute to develop more sustainable systems for AmI.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-35395-6_30", "venue": "IWAAL", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1857382374", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["46024593", "17249812", "20489448", "6721504", "3258484", "3348287", "17781344", "5846219", "36506142", "15954035", "13391792", "1536643", "7138354", "56563878", "14494237", "9767785"], "inbound_citations": ["201044949", "18587981", "210890353", "4526284", "28266868", "207110862", "53543041", "209853179", "28970935", "57362998", "209495846", "23778016", "209393377", "7870225", "150373798", "208040497", "54064988", "96432448", "36546540", "12187399", "53241647", "14299701", "202707961", "18860568", "20669816", "199529776", "5423074", "53240610", "6342182", "46889402", "28805200", "18217533", "201900134", "6975432", "67856455", "14468581", "37914644", "195752176", "59235021", "28404", "4566445", "8291039", "199391220", "17841759", "209853898", "208637293", "28826744", "204908029", "18081518", "23028636", "13131779", "59251010", "530880", "58669774", "201692859", "53083283", "2847275", "863309", "15498321", "32564238", "150374171", "58673043", "204089944", "6907811", "197642766", "30490647", "17341208", "29381016", "56198836", "18607499", "4118997", "29099413", "51876990", "203622488", "32425418", "49557195", "40482254", "6829006", "59554540", "70245417", "202122923", "20534976", "85517900", "215450039", "54435637", "204942686", "203593730", "51808012", "204776058", "1630741", "39727179", "149456248", "19360526", "73467380", "68152956", "9007545", "16064133", "18268656", "4971675", "2359212", "7189595", "18187566", "11974234", "195761912", "49733789", "40854503", "6398515", "10406003", "204231276", "11322436", "6366297", "43932699", "207757756", "15241964", "211016154", "9852647", "17812734", "2276436", "43291944", "189825128", "7296004", "121800068", "199490156", "201070094", "9128751", "30384846", "199366991", "3081702", "52930674", "211069143", "11265862", "204796932", "475337", "53681688", "3233658", "203734625", "13970372", "5046726", "4332680", "207970287", "8761857", "29163100", "202687269", "209169177", "5159069", "52821990", "7380840", "53279303", "10086997", "14356846", "52309268", "4566847", "14122416", "69841578", "115052251", "44107610", "26471755", "57596192", "99500", "181632595", "13729948", "96431870", "54451086", "33250088", "73506489", "210695776", "11724782", "14400143", "18552949", "49189927", "53345288", "16465383", "85206", "27683831", "1657671", "15972228", "16589267", "34738095", "3337092", "46926378", "195676576", "3141124", "211119867", "4113028", "3878922", "209459718", "52985194", "48836", "49338806", "5605546", "445682", "54135097", "14016596", "10104545", "32793970", "17502591", "22170329", "15845550", "29571506", "209497545", "199581634", "7468180", "78091068", "20373336", "203848526", "27173761", "10513894", "199064201", "6421030", "14556375", "174802544", "56487650", "198988132", "13611798", "14737031", "214676718", "67874606", "210023360", "192529920", "201645087", "5137814", "4865692", "4045141", "212705757", "202625105", "208513021", "14674501", "56175121", "210994989", "18303304", "198229609", "56596352", "67855942", "10335515", "67494851", "1421296", "15342776", "52927917", "195775476", "110911731", "15369812", "4143109", "210181099", "139105327", "52929379", "195737161", "41250130", "8982533", "53235695", "208207478", "41393645", "46928987", "17490602", "174818289", "86580640", "22234009", "211572619", "204246833", "252824"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13178535"}

However, as the number of new malware increases, the task of identifying the correct family becomes more challenging. Two prominent approaches tackle this problem, either using dynamic analysis that captures the runtime behavior of the malware or using static analysis methods that can reveal malicious behavior by analyzing the underlying logic and code patterns. A third emerging way is to use the various sources of identification features to analyze the architectural and external attributes of a malicious app. For example, two malicious apps can have different behavioral patterns but share common attributes. We hypothesize that this malware can belong to the same family but attempt to mislead dynamic and code-level static analysis tools by randomizing their behavior. In this work, we utilize a promising set of Android-oriented code metrics that guide a supervised classification learning process for identifying malware families in Android. Our empirical results on 2,869 malware apps, across 35 different malware families, show that these metrics are very effective to identify malware families.

Real-world networks often consist of nodes with informative attributes as well as links. To properly model these networks, it is necessary to learn how attributes of the nodes relate to the connectivity structure. Metric learning is a natural framework for transforming the raw node features to match the structural properties of a graph. Traditional metric learning algorithms primarily model the similarity between nodes and not structural properties, such as degree distributions. Degree distributions play a central role in graph structure analysis [1]. The degree distribution for some nodes may be non-stationary and depend on their attributes, particularly if some attributes naturally relate to connectedness. For example, in the LinkedIn network, an individual whose job area is \u201cSoftware Sales\u201d is likely to have more connections than an individual whose area is \u201cSoftware Programmer\u201d.

In contrast to other approaches, the size and shape of the receptive field of each locally linear model, as well as the parameters of the locally linear model itself, are learned independently, that is, without the need for competition or any other kind of communication. Independent learning is accomplished by incrementally minimizing a weighted local cross-validation error. As a result, we obtain a learning system that can allocate resources as needed while dealing with the bias-variance dilemma in a principled way. The spatial localization of the linear models increases robustness toward negative interference. Our learning system can be interpreted as a nonparametric adaptive bandwidth smoother, as a mixture of experts where the experts are trained in isolation, and as a learning system that profits from combining independent expert knowledge on the same problem.

In short, anomalies are abnormal or unlikely things. In financial networks, thieves and illegal activities are often anomalous in nature. Members of a network want to detect anomalies as soon as possible to prevent them from harming the network's community and integrity. Many Machine Learning techniques have been proposed to deal with this problem; some results appear to be quite promising but there is no obvious superior method. In this paper, we consider anomaly detection particular to the Bitcoin transaction network. Our goal is to detect which users and transactions are the most suspicious; in this case, anomalous behavior is a proxy for suspicious behavior. To this end, we use three unsupervised learning methods including k-means clustering, Mahalanobis distance, and Unsupervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) on two graphs generated by the Bitcoin transaction network: one graph has users as nodes, and the other has transactions as nodes.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1611.03941", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2185744359", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["15898284", "57368876", "10654182", "2110475", "31120973"], "inbound_citations": ["204575672", "49897074", "208826428", "201067641", "195848840", "18992166", "209499159", "69675850", "10654182", "62878972", "201103686", "198144838", "212647101", "51878416", "201125253", "85499963", "50777610", "53714227", "52445915", "52164961", "3681681", "212704977", "54453166", "212704322", "204780630", "203576042", "202236511", "17735450"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16069399"}

PEF (Prediction Error Frame) is then chosen to suppress the temporal redundancy of the video content. Differential filtering between adjacent samples in PEFs is employed to further suppress the spatial redundancy. Finally, Dependencies between adjacent samples in a PEF are modeled by a first-order Markov chain, and subsets of the empirical matrices are then employed as features for a steganalyzer with classifier of SVM (Support Vector Machine).

This study is based on linear and nonlinear analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) to design a classifier for mortality prediction of cardio vascular patients admitted to ICU. Methods: In this study we evaluated 90 cardiovascular ICU patients (45 males and 45 females). Linear and nonlinear features of HRV include SDNN, NN50, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), correlation dimension, approximate entropy; detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and Poincare plot were analyzed. Paired sample t-test was used for statistical comparison. Finally, we fed these features to the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to find a robust classification method to classify the patients with low risk and high risk of death. Results: Almost all HRV features measuring heart rate complexity were significantly decreased in the episode of half-hour before death.

Extensions of these algorithms, such as Time-Windowed forgetting (TWF), can permit learning of time-varying mappings by deleting older exemplars, but have decreased classification accuracy when the input-space sampling distribution of the learning set is time-varying. Additionally, TWF suffers from lower asymptotic classification accuracy than equivalent non-forgetting algorithms when the input sampling distributions are stationary. Other shift-sensitive algorithms, such as Locally-Weighted forgetting (LWF) avoid the negative effects of time-varying sampling distributions, but still have lower asymptotic classification in non-varying cases. We introduce Prediction Error Context Switching (PECS) which allows lazy-learning algorithms to have good classification accuracy in conditions having a time-varying function mapping and input sampling distributions, while still maintaining their asymptotic classification accuracy in static tasks.

Building detection and footprint extraction are highly demanded for many remote sensing applications. Though most previous works have shown promising results, the automatic extraction of building footprints still remains a nontrivial topic, especially in complex urban areas. Recently developed extensions of the CNN framework made it possible to perform dense pixel-wise classification of input images. Based on these abilities we propose a methodology, which automatically generates a full resolution binary building mask out of a Digital Surface Model (DSM) using a Fully Convolution Network (FCN) architecture. The advantage of using the depth information is that it provides geometrical silhouettes and allows a better separation of buildings from background as well as through its invariance to illumination and color variations. The proposed framework has mainly two steps. Firstly, the FCN is trained on a large set of patches consisting of normalized DSM (nDSM) as inputs and available ground truth building mask as target outputs. Secondly, the generated predictions from FCN are viewed as unary terms for a Fully connected Conditional Random Fields (FCRF), which enables us to create a final binary building mask. A series of experiments demonstrate that our methodology is able to extract accurate building footprints which are close to the buildings original shapes to a high degree. The quantitative and qualitative analysis show the significant improvements of the results in contrast to the multy-layer fully connected network from our previous work.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-1-W1-481-2017", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2620689612", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1996665", "30814784", "206597351", "15997505", "17648036", "6206021", "39185707", "121522070", "5574079", "122884188", "20194260", "2334790", "26848942", "56507745", "23216142", "15080757", "140176244", "2878645", "12003849", "242941", "6629776", "3133678", "6713258"], "inbound_citations": ["43919692", "54438942", "211076162", "149453624", "19235777", "139090110", "204976603", "51957241", "215044222", "76665674", "208126670", "52148734", "126161342", "56481660", "54435639", "189959773", "69845494", "149723344", "85509092", "26814155", "58013585", "201803741"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27043551"}

As the researches has reached an advanced grade accuracy, these algorithms have been proved and the embedding is necessary for the realization of prosthetic devices. The aim of this work is to provide engineering tools and indications on how to choose the most suitable classifier, and its specific internal settings for an embedded control of multigrip hand prostheses.MethodsBy means of an innovative statistical analysis, we compare 4 different classifiers: Nonlinear Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine and Linear Discriminant Analysis, which was considered as ground truth. Experimental tests have been performed on sEMG data collected from 30 people with trans-radial amputation, in which the algorithms were evaluated for both performance and computational burden, then the statistical analysis has been based on the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05.ResultsThe comparative analysis among NLR, MLP and SVM shows that, for either classification performance and for the number of classification parameters, SVM attains the highest values followed by MLP, and then by NLR. However, using as unique constraint to evaluate the maximum acceptable complexity of each classifier one of the typically available memory of a high performance microcontroller, the comparison pointed out that for people with trans-radial amputation the algorithm that produces the best compromise is NLR closely followed by MLP.

The approach utilizes spatio-temporal support vector regression (SVR), within which the intrinsic spatio-temporal autocorrelations in fMRI data are reflected. The novel formulation of the problem allows merging model-driven with data-driven methods, and therefore unifies these two currently separate modes of fMRI analysis.

We present BIANCA (Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm), a fully automated, supervised method for WMH detection, based on the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm. Relative to previous k-NN based segmentation methods, BIANCA offers different options for weighting the spatial information, local spatial intensity averaging, and different options for the choice of the number and location of the training points. BIANCA is multimodal and highly flexible so that the user can adapt the tool to their protocol and specific needs. We optimised and validated BIANCA on two datasets with different MRI protocols and patient populations (a \u201cpredominantly neurodegenerative\u201d and a \u201cpredominantly vascular\u201d cohort). BIANCA was first optimised on a subset of images for each dataset in terms of overlap and volumetric agreement with a manually segmented WMH mask. The correlation between the volumes extracted with BIANCA (using the optimised set of options), the volumes extracted from the manual masks and visual ratings showed that BIANCA is a valid alternative to manual segmentation. The optimised set of options was then applied to the whole cohorts and the resulting WMH volume estimates showed good correlations with visual ratings and with age. Finally, we performed a reproducibility test, to evaluate the robustness of BIANCA, and compared BIANCA performance against existing methods.

The device conductance reflects the configuration of synapses which can be modulated via voltage stimulus. By controlling Relative Humidity (RH) and oxygen partial-pressure during NP deposition we obtain stochastic conductance switching that is stable over several months. Detailed characterization reveals signatures of electric-field induced atomic-wire formation within the tunnel-gaps of the oxidized percolating network. Finally we show that the synaptic structure can be reconfigured by stimulating at different repetition rates, which can be utilized as short-term to long-term memory conversion. This demonstration of stable stochastic switching in ASNs provides a promising route to hardware implementation of biological neuronal models and, as an example, we highlight possible applications in Reservoir Computing (RC).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1712.09497", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TED.2017.2766063", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices ( Volume: 64, Page: 5194, 2017)", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2964129985,2949760885,2767939831", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16338391", "145490400", "26513788", "8980558", "6992498", "41387919", "3928456", "11416263", "14249791", "16646344", "1169506", "45896947", "51830668", "13256660", "14416573", "20208878", "25230265", "21887443", "16350026", "2357756", "205414264", "37201300", "12301928", "85425616", "14265094", "8691025", "22832321", "21592724", "38147194", "14350758", "43505773", "63567452", "15073928", "215555006", "113977965", "41876835", "43268963", "121485108", "54418912", "136915941", "123644339", "22028949", "139928371", "17584864", "42998189", "33812503", "10213127", "5332215", "98440382", "95066336", "121769643", "205503972", "11111144", "123653288", "119409385", "19983680", "95447187", "10836082", "17162693"], "inbound_citations": ["59526884", "210921291", "61810389", "204741727"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6910036"}

In this paper, a novel high-level feature detection framework using the ARM technique together with the correlations among the feature-value pairs is proposed. A new association rule mining (ARM) algorithm has been developed, where the N-feature-value pairs are generated using a combined measure based on (1) the existence of the (N-1)-feature-value pairs (where N is larger than 1), (2) the correlation between different N-feature-value pairs and the concept classes through Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), and (3) the similarity representing the harmonic mean of the inter-similarity and intra-similarity. The final association classification rules are selected by using the calculated harmonic mean of the similarity values. The proposed framework enables the automatic discovery and generation of the N-feature-value pair association rules from the $1$-feature-value pairs for classification.

Recently, deep-learning-based models have proved to be a powerful feature extractor to perform high-accuracy prediction. However, the effectiveness of models still suffers from two issues in PWL prediction: the correlations shifting over time between PWL and other feature parameters, and the example imbalance between fluctuation examples (minority) and stable examples (majority). To address these problems, we propose a cost-sensitive mechanism to facilitate the model to learn the feature representation of later examples and fluctuation examples. By weighting the standard mean square error loss with a cost-sensitive factor, we develop a Cost-Sensitive Long Short-Term Memory (CSLSTM) model to predict the PWL of PWRs. The overall performance of the CSLSTM is assessed by a variety of evaluation metrics with the experimental data collected from a marine PWR simulator. The comparisons with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model demonstrate the effectiveness of the CSLSTM.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.net.2019.12.025", "venue": null, "journal": "Nuclear Engineering and Technology", "mag_id": "2998637666", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214279842"}

Supervised classification of hyperspectral image data sets is a challenging problem due to the limited availability of training samples (which are very difficult and costly to obtain in practice) and the extremely high dimensionality of the data. In this paper, we explore the use of multi-channel morphological profiles for feature extraction prior to classification of remotely sensed hyperspectral data sets using support vector machines (SVMs). In order to introduce multi-channel morphological transformations, which rely on ordering of pixel vectors in multidimensional space, several vector ordering strategies are investigated. A reduced implementation which builds the multi-channel morphological profile based on the first components resulting from a dimensional reduction transformation applied to the input data is also proposed. Our experimental results, conducted using three representative hyperspectral data sets collected by NASA's Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) sensor and the German Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (DAIS 7915), reveal that multi-channel morphological profiles can improve single-channel morphological profiles in the task of extracting relevant features for classification of hyperspectral data using small training sets.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3280741", "pubmed_id": "22389595", "doi": "10.3390/s90100196", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2122301197", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["20845360", "117710212", "60139616", "28637672", "62066269", "60452913", "7443466", "128848964", "7993309", "10533950", "37843000", "5718819", "24190361", "37876387", "56390210", "52996602", "30615834", "13284902", "837097", "61817300", "14495716", "38318009", "15480403", "207100144", "206687235", "27314433", "26985497", "2853017"], "inbound_citations": ["203606176", "5090290", "23894483", "3173526", "55199050", "131871733", "3811786", "215184327", "195772436", "12208116", "3544458", "43491097", "211024912", "52860135", "19706161", "14173829", "59396541", "8888907", "5578419", "124835178", "1372244", "134621707", "10877291", "10637290"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11049457"}

Several statistical downscaling approaches have been developed to map precipitation at a high spatial resolution, which are mainly based on the valid conjugations between satellite-driven precipitation data and geospatial predictors. Performance of the existing approaches should be first evaluated before applying them to larger spatial extents with a complex terrain across different climate zones. In this paper, we investigate the statistical downscaling algorithms to derive the high spatial resolution maps of precipitation over continental China using satellite datasets, including the Normalized Distribution Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and the rainfall product from the Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM). We compare three statistical techniques (multiple linear regression, exponential regression, and Random Forest regression trees) for modeling precipitation to better understand how the selected model types affect the prediction accuracy. Then, those models are implemented to downscale the original TRMM product (3B43; 0.25\u00b0 resolution) onto the finer grids (1 \u00d7 1 km2) of precipitation. Finally we validate the downscaled annual precipitation (a wet year 2001 and a dry year 2010) against the ground rainfall observations from 596 rain gauge stations over continental China. The result indicates that the downscaling algorithm based on the Random Forest regression outperforms, when compared to the linear regression and the exponential regression. It also shows that the addition of the residual terms does not significantly improve the accuracy of results for the RF model. The analysis of the variable importance reveals the NDVI related predictors, latitude, and longitude, elevation are key elements for statistical downscaling, and their weights vary across different climate zones.

We, first, select the \u201cmost discriminative\u201d voxels using the state-of-the-art feature selection methods, namely, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Mutual Information (MI). After we select the most informative voxels, we form a star mesh around each selected voxel with their functional neighbors. Then, we estimate the mesh arc weights, which represent the relationship among the voxels within a neighborhood. We further prune the estimated arc weights using ANOVA to get rid of redundant relationships among the voxels. By doing so, we obtain a sparse representation of information in the brain to discriminate cognitive states. Finally, we train k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers by the feature vectors of sparse mesh arc weights. We test STMM architecture on a visual object recognition experiment. Our results show that forming meshes around the selected voxels leads to a substantial increase in the classification accuracy, compared to forming meshes around all the voxels in the brain. Furthermore, pruning the mesh arc weights by ANOVA solves the dimensionality curse problem and leads to a slight increase in the classification performance. We also discover that, the resulting network of sparse temporal meshes are quite similar in all three voxel selection methods, namely, RFE, ANOVA or MI.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCI-CC.2016.7862035", "venue": "2016 IEEE 15th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC)", "journal": "2016 IEEE 15th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2590618176", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["19682056", "6403660", "1909790", "1563437", "122956", "5277499", "35887920", "10786459", "796893", "6403660", "2209189", "20859544", "62250740", "491175", "10675761", "7542583", "21023929", "8933777", "28637672", "54489176"], "inbound_citations": ["52965221", "49655647"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15563114"}

However, the archetypal electrolarynx suffers from a monotonous tone and the inconvenience of requiring manual control. This paper presents the potential of pattern recognition to support electrolarynx use by predicting fundamental frequency (F0) and voicing state (VS) from surface EMG of the infrahyoid and suprahyoid muscles, as well as from a respiratory trace. In this study, surface EMG signals from the infrahyoid and suprahyoid muscle groups and respiratory trace were collected from 10 able-bodied, adult males (18\u201360 years old). Participants performed three kinds of vocal tasks \u2013 tones, legatos and phrases. Signal features were extracted from the EMG and respiratory trace, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with radial basis function kernels was employed to predict F0 and voicing state. An average root mean squared error of 2.81 \u00b1 0.6 semitones was achieved for the estimation of vocal frequency in the range of 90\u2013360 Hz. An average cross-validation (CV) accuracy of 78.05 \u00b1 6.3% was achieved for the prediction of voicing state from EMG and 65.24 \u00b1 7.8% from the respiratory trace. The proposed method has the advantage of being non-invasive compared with studies that relied on intramuscular electrodes (invasive), while still maintaining an accuracy above chance.

Metabolomics has been used to clarify mode of action in drug-induced liver injury but has not been performed following VC exposures. Methods Plasma samples from 17 highly exposed VC workers without liver cancer and 27 unexposed healthy volunteers were obtained for metabolite extraction and GC/MS and LC/MS 2 analysis. Following ion identification/quantification, Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed. Results 613 unique named metabolites were identified. Of these, 189 metabolites were increased in the VC exposure group while 94 metabolites were decreased. Random Forest analysis indicated that the metabolite signature could separate the groups with 94% accuracy. VC exposures were associated with increased long chain (including arachidonic acid) and essential (including linoleic acid) fatty acids. Occupational exposure increased lipid peroxidation products including monohydroxy fatty acids (including 13-HODE); fatty acid dicarboxylates; and oxidized arachidonic acid products (including 5,9, and 15-HETE). Carnitine and carnitine esters were decreased, suggesting peroxisomal/mitochondrial dysfunction and alternate modes of lipid oxidation. Differentially regulated metabolites were shown to interact with extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), Akt, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the N-Methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The top canonical pathways affected by occupational exposure included tRNA charging, nucleotide degradation, amino acid synthesis/degradation and urea cycle.

As the number of studies investigating these associations increases and the number of subjects in each study increases, a meta-analysis to identify the associations that are the most predictive of disease progression is warranted. We analyzed previously published 16S rRNA gene sequencing data collected from feces and colon tissue. We quantified the odds ratios (ORs) for individual bacterial taxa that were associated with an individual having tumors relative to a normal colon. Among the fecal samples, there were no taxa that had significant ORs associated with adenoma and there were 8 taxa with significant ORs associated with carcinoma. Similarly, among the tissue samples, there were no taxa that had a significant OR associated with adenoma and there were 3 taxa with significant ORs associated with carcinoma. Among the significant ORs, the association between individual taxa and tumor diagnosis was equal or below 7.11. Because individual taxa had limited association with tumor diagnosis, we trained Random Forest classification models using only the taxa that had significant ORs, using the entire collection of taxa found in each study, and using operational taxonomic units defined based on a 97% similarity threshold. All training approaches yielded similar classification success as measured using the Area Under the Curve. The ability to correctly classify individuals with adenomas was poor and the ability to classify individuals with carcinomas was considerably better using sequences from fecal or tissue. Importance Colorectal cancer is a significant and growing health problem in which animal models and epidemiological data suggest that the colonic microbiota have a role in tumorigenesis. These observations indicate that the colonic microbiota is a reservoir of biomarkers that may improve our ability to detect colonic tumors using non-invasive approaches. This meta-analysis identifies and validates a set of 8 bacterial taxa that can be used within a Random Forest modeling framework to differentiate individuals as having normal colons or carcinomas. When models trained using one dataset were tested on other datasets, the models performed well. These results lend support to the use of fecal biomarkers for the detection of tumors.

As BSCs are considered one of the most important components of semiarid ecosystems, accurate characterisation of their spatial distribution is increasingly in demand. This paper describes a novel methodology for identifying the areas dominated by different types of BSCs and quantifying their relative cover at subpixel scale in a semiarid ecosystem of SE Spain. The approach consists of two consecutive steps: (i) First, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to identify the main ground units, dominated by homogenous surface cover (bare soil, cyanobacteria BSC, lichen BSC, green and dry vegetation), which are of strong ecological relevance. (ii) Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) of the ground units to quantify the proportion of each type of surface cover within each pixel, to correctly characterize the complex spatial heterogeneity inherent to semiarid ecosystems. SVM classification showed very good results with a Kappa coefficient of 0.93%, discriminating among areas dominated by bare soil, cyanobacteria BSC, lichen BSC, green and dry vegetation. Subpixel relative abundance images achieved relatively high accuracy for both types of BSCs (about 80%), whereas general overestimation of vegetation was observed.

Support vector machines, a type of machine learning, utilize optimization theory and supervised learning algorithms to construct predictive models based on the information content of data in a way that can treat different input features symmetrically. Methods: The custom support vector machine package we have developed is designated SPIDERz and made available to the community. As test data for evaluating performance and comparison with other methods, we apply SPIDERz to four distinct data sets: 1) the publicly available portion of the PHAT-1 catalog based on the GOODS-N field with spectroscopic redshifts in the range $z<3.6$, 2) 14365 galaxies from the COSMOS bright survey with photometric band magnitudes, morphology, and spectroscopic redshifts inside $z<1.4$, 3) 3048 galaxies from the overlap of COSMOS photometry and morphology with 3D-HST spectroscopy extending to $z<3.9$, and 4) 2612 galaxies with five-band photometric magnitudes and morphology from the All-wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey and $z<1.57$. Results: We find that SPIDER-z achieves results competitive with other empirical packages on the PHAT-1 data, and performs quite well in estimating redshifts with the COSMOS and AEGIS data, including in the cases of a large redshift range ($0<z<3.9$).

However, it is challenging to learn such similarity, as medical data are usually high dimensional, heterogeneous, and complex. In addition, a desirable patient similarity is dependent on particular clinical settings, which implies supervised learning scheme is more useful in medical domains. To address these, in this paper we present a novel similarity learning approach formulated as the generalized Mahalanobis similarity function with pairwise constraints. Considering there always exists some features non-discriminative and contains redundant information, we encode a low-rank structure to our similarity function to perform feature selection.

In this paper, we propose a new learning scheme with mean Fourier parameters using the perceptual content of voice quality for speaker-independent speech emotion recognition. The dimension of the acoustic feature is greatly reduced and the computational performance is improved with big extent. Two speech databases (German emotional corpus, Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture) are used in the experiment, and the combination of different features with different classifiers are implemented in the recognition for performance comparison. The recognition results show that the proposed scheme with mean Fourier Parameters combined with the Random Forest classifier is efficient in classifying various emotional states in speech signals and is excellent than other features and classifiers.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICACI.2019.8778548", "venue": "2019 Eleventh International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)", "journal": "2019 Eleventh International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2966733016", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3878439", "53015774", "3786425", "4613208", "3489485", "20792164", "36610026", "5504667", "17784788", "577580", "123476171", "11820063", "15139710", "8147085", "2706021", "28874114", "119637286", "60883381", "63339016", "35035318", "40061009", "13895685", "120761646", "12710581", "44143094", "33953071", "11600630", "9107831", "13920681", "12710581", "5887210", "7703947"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199057688"}

While traditional classification models often assume patterns are living in a fixed-dimensional vector space, MOL focuses on the tasks involving multiple representations or outlooks (e.g., biometrics based on face, fingerprint and iris); samples belonging to different outlooks may have varying feature dimensionalities and distributions. Current MOL methods attempted to first map each outlook heuristically to a common space, where samples from all the outlooks are assumed to share the same dimensionality and distribution after mapping. Traditional off-the-shelf classifiers can then be applied in the common space. The performance of these approaches is however often limited due to the independence of mapping functions learning and classifier learning. Different from existing approaches, in this paper, we proposed a novel MOL framework capable of learning jointly the mapping functions and the classifier in the common latent space. In particular, we coupled our novel framework with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and proposed a new model called MOL-SVM. MOL-SVM only needs to solve a sequence of standard linear SVM problems and converges rather rapidly within only a few steps.

In addition, input data were subjected to different normalization methods to determine their effects on the performances of both ANN and SVM models. The feedforward and the cascade forward algorithms yielded the lowest MSE values among the various ANN model configurations. No distinct disparity was found in the performances of the various solvers of regression SVM in the estimations. For the regression SVM kernel functions, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) and the Gaussian kernel functions resulted in the lowest MSE values. Both the ANN and regression SVM have comparable abilities in predicting the levels of the faecal indicator organisms in the raw water.

Specifically, the effects of dimensional uncertainties on the behavior of a system are considered. The proposed reliability-based optimization method addresses difficulties such as high computational effort and non-smoothness of the system\u2019s responses, for example, as a result of contact events. The approach is based on decomposition of the design space into regions, corresponding to either acceptable or non-acceptable system performance. The boundaries of these regions are defined using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which are explicit in terms of the design parameters. A SVM can be trained based on a limited number of samples, obtained from a design of experiments, and allows a very efficient estimation of probability of failure, even when Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is used. A modularly structured tolerance analysis scheme for automatic estimation of system production cost and probability of system failure is presented. In this scheme, detection of failure is based on multibody system simulation, yielding high computational demand. A SVM-based replication of the failure detection process is derived, which ultimately allows for automatic optimization of tolerance assignments. A simple multibody system, whose performance usually shows high tolerance sensitivity, is chosen as an exemplary system for illustration of the proposed approach. The system is optimally designed for minimum manufacturing cost while satisfying a target performance level with a given probability.Copyright \u00a9 2007 by ASME", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/DETC2007-35706", "venue": "Volume 4: ASME/IEEE International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications and the 19th Reliability, Stress Analysis, and Failure Prevention Conference", "journal": "Volume 4: ASME/IEEE International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications and the 19th Reliability, Stress Analysis, and Failure Prevention Conference", "mag_id": "2065755742", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["776032", "18304607"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111328042"}

The key contribution of this method is to learn the representation of error as high-level features, while current representation learning methods interpret error by loss functions which are obtained as a function of differences between the true labels and the predicted ones. One advantage of such learning method is that the learned features for each class are independent of learned features for other classes; therefore, this method can learn simultaneously meaning that it can learn new classes without retraining. Error representation learning can also help with generalization and reduce the chance of over-fitting by adding a set of impactful features to the original data set which capture the relationships between each instance and different classes through an error generation and analysis process. This method can be particularly effective in data sets, where the instances of each class have diverse feature representations or the ones with imbalanced classes. The experimental results show that the proposed method results in significantly better performance compared to the state-of-the-art classification techniques for several popular data sets.

Various computational approaches have been proposed for the prediction of compound toxicity ranging from quantitative structure activity relationship modeling to molecular similarity-based methods and machine learning. Within the \u201cToxicology in the 21st Century\u201d screening initiative, a crowd-sourcing platform was established for the development and validation of computational models to predict the interference of chemical compounds with nuclear receptor and stress response pathways based on a training set containing more than 10,000 compounds tested in high-throughput screening assays. Here, we present the results of various molecular similarity-based and machine-learning based methods over an independent evaluation set containing 647 compounds as provided by the Tox21 Data Challenge 2014. It was observed that the Random Forest approach based on MACCS molecular fingerprints and a subset of 13 molecular descriptors selected based on statistical and literature analysis performed best in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values. Further, we compared the individual and combined performance of different methods. In retrospect, we also discuss the reasons behind the superior performance of an ensemble approach, combining a similarity search method with the Random Forest algorithm, compared to individual methods while explaining the intrinsic limitations of the latter.

In this work, we attempt to use data from 10 BABEL languages to build a multi-lingual seq2seq model as a prior model, and then port them towards 4 other BABEL languages using transfer learning approach. We also explore different architectures for improving the prior multilingual seq2seq model. The paper also discusses the effect of integrating a recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) with a seq2seq model during decoding. Experimental results show that the transfer learning approach from the multilingual model shows substantial gains over monolingual models across all 4 BABEL languages.

The aim of this paper was to estimate the importance of 32 explanatory variables in predicting the distribution of the major invasive alien plant species (IAPS) of South Africa, through the use of Species Distribution Models. We used data from the National Invasive Alien Plants Survey, delineated at a quaternary catchment level, coupled with climatic, land cover, edaphic, and anthropogenic variables. Using two-part generalized linear models, we compared the accuracy of two different sets of variables in predicting the spatial distribution of IAPS; the first included environmental correlates alone, and the second included both environmental and anthropogenic variables. Using Random Forest, we explored the relative importance of the variables in producing a map of potential distribution of IAPS. Results showed that the inclusion of anthropogenic variables did not significantly improve model predictions. The most important variables influencing the distribution of IAPS appeared to be the climatic ones.

We trained four Probabilistic Support Vector Machines separately using four different categories of training samples extracted from urban/suburban areas. Dominant Singular Measure is used to detect locally linear edge segments as potential trajectories for roads. This complimentary information is integrated using an optimization framework to obtain potential targets for roads. This provides decent results in situations only when the roads have few obstacles (trees, large vehicles, and tall buildings). Linking of disjoint segments uses the local gradient functions at the adjacent pair of road endings. Region part segmentation uses curvature information to remove stray nonroad structures.

In this paper, a multi-sensor fusion method based on variants of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is presented to improve the recognition performance in terms of speed and accuracy. The Kernel ELM, Weighted ELM, Regularized ELM are tasked directly to handle the multi-activity classification problem using the real-world test data with 46 test subjects. Their performance has been evaluated against previously published methods based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) using a two-step subject-wise cross validation scheme. The multi-sensor fusion based Kernel ELM has shown favorable performance with 88.4% average testing accuracy, outperforming SVM by 1.1%.

The goal of the study is to achieve the level of performance comparable to one of multi-sensor HAR systems by using fewer or even single sensor. Such performance is achieved by learning relations between these sensors at training time and utilizing them at test time. These relations are learned by supervised deep models which use multi-sensor data during training only. The absence of need for having multiple sensors during test time allows turning these sensors off and replacing them with a single sensor coupled with learned across-sensor relations. These across-sensor relations make up for the information lost from the turned-off sensors. Using fewer sensors reduces energy consumption of HAR systems deployed on a smartphone. Moreover, it allows building HAR systems for situations when collection of multi-sensor data is possible only during training.

The algorithms are based upon the analytical redundancy between different measurements, given in form of a mathematical model of the process to be controlled. On the assumption that this model is exact, a basic instrument fault diagnosis scheme is designed which uses statistical hypothesis tests and recursive least-squares algorithms to detect, estimate, and to classify sensor faults. However, the most significant problem of such a model-based fault detection scheme is the separation of the interesting sensor faults from unavoidable modelling errors and from process parameter variations. To overcome this problem, we use state-augmented and hypothesis-conditioned Kalman filters to track time-varying process parameters, and de-correlation filters to suppress dynamic modelling errors. It is shown that the detectability and separability of different sensor faults, described by some figures of merit, depend highly on the number of measurements to be supervised and the number of tracked process parameters.

Structure from Motion (SfM) methods provide a robust approach for the generation of textured 3D models in the visible range. Still, automatic generation of 3D models from the infrared imagery is challenging due to an absence of the feature points and low sensor resolution. Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have proved that they can perform complex image-to-image transformations such as a transformation of day to night and generation of imagery in a different spectral range. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generation of realistic 3D models with thermal textures using the SfM pipeline and GAN. The proposed method uses visible range images as an input. The images are processed in two ways. Firstly, they are used for point matching and dense point cloud generation. Secondly, the images are fed into a GAN that performs the transformation from the visible range to the thermal range. We evaluate the proposed method using real infrared imagery captured with a FLIR ONE PRO camera. We generated a dataset with 2000 pairs of real images captured in thermal and visible range. The dataset is used to train the GAN network and to generate 3D models using SfM. The evaluation of the generated 3D models and infrared textures proved that they are similar to the ground truth model in both thermal emissivity and geometrical shape.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-519-2018", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2806229202", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9455111", "14964868", "14162452", "2123767", "67334069", "4815907", "8927323", "974911", "18781152", "12986049", "15135212", "3719281", "8355130", "28274478", "50698", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:73686271"}

The main advantage of this approach is that it learns the hypothesis from labeled data meanwhile adapt to the large unlabeled data. Our method could not only be applied to SVM-based approaches, but also is applicable with the other nonmachine learning algorithms.

The entity describes the individuals, events or topics. That topics generally c ould be the review of diverse datasets, one of which is a product review. By reading the review of products based on the experiences of other consumers, it will be recognized the quality of a product. It goes without saying, as cosmetic products on the market today are very diverse, both in terms of type and brand. However, not all cosmetics have good quality in line with the needs of consumers and it is to be noticed by the consumer. Lately consumers who are writing their opinions, reviews and experiences through online is increasing. So, reexamination of the cosmetic product review by classifying these reviews into positive and negative class is an excellent way to determine the response of other consumers about the product quickly and accurately. Among of the techniques for classification mostly used by data classification is Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM has the advantage of being able to identify the separated hyper plane that maximizes the margin between two different classes. However, SVM has a weakness for parameter selection or suitable features. Feature selection set up the parameters in SVM that significantly affects the results of classification accuracy. Feature selection also can be used to reduce the attributes that are less relevant to the dataset. To improve the previous research, this research uses the combined method of feature selection in Algorithm Support Vector Machine by comparing two-feature selection, namely Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm. It is in order to improve the accuracy of the classification of Support Vector Machine. Furthermore the research found the text classification in a positive or negative format from the cosmetic products review. Measurement is based on Support Vector Machine accuracy before and after adding the feature selection method. The evaluation was done by using 10 Fold Cross Validation. While the accuracy measurement is done by using the Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve. The results of integrated Support Vector Machine Algorithm and Feature Selection Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization indicate the best results with average accuracy 97.00% and the average AUC 0.988. While Genetic Algorithm show the best results with average accuracy 94.00% and average of AUC 0.984.

A smart city must facilitate such databases in its hospitals. However, handling this big data requires new strategies for filtering and processing such high volumes of patient data. In this regard, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly applied to support bedside decisions on patient treatment, preprocess medical data and help to choose adequate medications. Consequently, the choice of the ML modeling scheme is imperative. In contrast to conventional classification representation methodologies used in ML such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), we present a novel concept based on stochastic models. Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) are a powerful modeling scheme that is used to describe the dynamic behavior of biochemical kinetics. This chapter presents a framework for building stochastic models based on the sampled sequences from observed SPNs by means of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC). Apart from its theoretical interest, we expect the framework to be useful for the classification of different stochastic processes and identifying the differences between them in big data context. An important application of the newly developed framework is disease diagnoses especially in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). To test the framework, we conducted simulations using SPNs with different structure and using Gillespie algorithm to generate data.

Its use is motivated by the fact that the EMD combined with the Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO) gives an efficient time-frequency analysis of the non-stationary signals. In this method, each signal is decomposed using EMD into oscillating components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). TKEO is used for estimating the time-varying amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency of a signal that is supposed to be Amplitude Modulation-Frequency Modulation (AM-FM) signal. A subset of the IMFs was selected and used to extract features from speech signal to recognize different emotions. The main contribution of our work is to extract novel features named modulation spectral (MS) features and modulation frequency features (MFF) based on AM-FM modulation model and combined them with cepstral features. It is believed that the combination of all features will improve the performance of the emotion recognition system. Furthermore, we examine the effect of feature selection on SER system performance. For classification task, Support Vecto Machine (SVM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are used to distinguish seven basic emotions. Two databases- the Berlin corpus, and the Spanish corpus- are used for the experiments. The results evaluated on the Spanish emotional database, using RNN classifier and a combination of all features extracted from the IMFs enhances the performance of the SER system and achieving 91.16% recognition rate.

To perform the landslide assessment for a large-scale slope, this study proposes to use the method of small watershed that is integrated with Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) to enhance the prediction accuracy. Effect of physiographic and hydrological factors such as slope steepness, dip slope ratio, landslide ratio, and cumulative rainfall are investigated. To estimate the occurrence of landslide, RVM first maps the aforementioned factors into a feature space using Gaussian radial basis function. A linear boundary, distinguishing landslide or not, is then obtained through the search of the optimal weights. To find these weights, a Bayesian theory-based optimization problem is formulated and solved by iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm and the Laplace approximation procedure. The proposed model is validated by the data collected from Kaoping River Basin. Results indicate that the proposed RVM-based small watershed approach possesses a prediction accuracy of 87.5%, which is better than those of using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Least-Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), and logistic regression, providing authorities in their hazard alert system to minimize the life or property losses caused by the landslide.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12145-019-00419-7", "venue": "Earth Science Informatics", "journal": "Earth Science Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2993176215", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["134547172", "129842317", "107680519", "129180247", "132380264", "128906787", "125954614", "135274114", "134515952", "196155416", "116787281", "182333170", "135452085", "33876058", "17054045", "33974143", "14209424", "7596571", "18224413", "12126728", "140138549", "3624080"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208648729"}

Unlike the prevalent one-versus-one strategy (the bottom-up one-versus-one strategy is called tournament method) that separates only two classes at each classification, the binary classifiers in our method have to separate two groups of multiple classes. As a result, the probability of generalization error increases. This problem is alleviated by utilizing error correcting codes, which results only in a marginal increase in the required number of classifications. However, in comparison to the tournament method, our method requires only 50% of the classifications and still similar performance can be attained.

A new semi-supervised learning framework is proposed by combing manifold regularization and data representation methods such as Non negative matrix factorization and sparse coding. We adopt unsupervised data representation methods as the learning machines because they do not depend on the labeled data, which can improve machine's generation ability as much as possible. The proposed framework forms the Laplacian regularizer through learning the affinity graph. We incorporate the new Laplacian regularizer into the unsupervised data representation to smooth the low dimensional representation of data and make use of label information.

The aim of this paper is to present a classifier system based on Probabilistic Neural Networks in order to detect and classify abnormal heart rates, where besides its simplicity, has high resolution capability. The proposed algorithm has three stages. At first, the electrocardiogram signals impose into preprocessing block. After preprocessing and noise elimination, the exact position of R peak is detected by multi resolution wavelet analysis. In the next step, the extracted linear predictive coefficients (LPC) of QRS complex will enter in to the classification block as an input. A Support Vector Machine classifier is developed in parallel to verify and measure the PNN classifier\u2019s success. The experiments were conducted on the ECG data from the MIT-BIH database to classify four kinds of abnormal waveforms and normal beats such as Normal sinus rhythm, Atrial premature contraction (APC), Right bundle branch block (RBBB) and Left bundle branch block (LBBB).

The Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) is used to simulate the different stress conditions, including both mental stress and psychosocial stress factors that are relevant at the workplace. A sensor-based wearable device is used to acquire the electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration (RSP) signals from 39 participants. We extract stress-related features from ECG and RSP, and the Random Forest is used to select the optimal feature combination, which is later fed to the classifier. Four classifiers are investigated about their ability to predict the three stress levels. Finally, the combination of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieve the best performance.

The proposed framework improves the accuracy and efficiency of surrogate-based optimization. A surrogate model is an approximation to a costly black-box function that can be used for more efficient search of optimal points. When design specifications change, the objective function changes too. Therefore, there is a need for a new surrogate model. However, the concept of transfer learning can be applied to refit the new surrogate more efficiently. In other words insights from previous experiences can be applied to learning and optimizing the new function. We use the proposed method in a particular problem pertaining to the design of \u201cthin film multilayer solar cells\u201d, where the goal is to maximize the external quantum efficiency of photoelectric conversion. The results show that the accuracy of the surrogate model is improved by 2\u20133 times using the transfer learning approach, using only half as many training data points as the original model. In addition, by transferring the design knowledge from one particular set of materials to another similar set of materials in the thin film structure, the surrogate-based optimization is improved, and is it obtained with far less computational time.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6430788", "pubmed_id": "30902999", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-41316-9", "venue": "Scientific Reports", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2925202119", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["11510470", "2381155", "6692382", "7079167", "8153773", "5015776", "8016865", "1407171", "10500293", "14563054", "5844313", "206705553", "9865873", "84768574", "57786072", "362467", "109371070", "6747781", "13079847", "1689250", "4962395", "319311", "2757382", "119190", "14863760", "17531565", "13765888", "11673665", "15160240", "122040522", "121891309", "101448505", "126372104", "126120310", "44066365", "16543854", "109850084", "205939", "740063", "114796176"], "inbound_citations": ["215503103", "204681303", "211058995"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85448795"}

Therefore, the detection of this arrhythmia becomes crucial in the early diagnosis and the prevention of possible life threatening cardiac diseases. Most methods for detecting arrhythmia require pp interval, or the diversity of P wave morphology, but they are difficult to detect the p wave signal because of various noise types. Thus, it is necessary to use noise-free R wave. So, the new approach for the detection of PVC is presented based on the rhythm analysis and the beat matching in this paper. For this purpose, we removed baseline wandering of low frequency band and made summed signals that are composed of two high frequency bands including the frequency component of QRS complex using the wavelet filter.

In this paper, a new interval prediction method based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks is proposed. This method has two assumptions. One is to assume that the residuals and the sample have similar distributions, and the other is to assume that the closer the samples are, the more similar the distribution of their obedience is. Therefore, the fuzzy C-means clustering method is used to cluster the data, and the calculated residuals are used for interval prediction. The proposed method is applied to predict the three factors mentioned above, and compared with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

Modeled distributions were used to quantify their potential distribution under current and future climate scenarios.

Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy images provide an important method to study the cell cycle process under different conditions of perturbation. Existing methods are limited in dealing with such time-lapse data sets while manual analysis is not feasible. This paper presents statistical data analysis and statistical pattern recognition to perform this task.ResultsThe data is generated from Hela H2B GFP cells imaged during a 2-day period with images acquired 15 minutes apart using an automated time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. The patterns are described with four kinds of features, including twelve general features, Haralick texture features, Zernike moment features, and wavelet features. To generate a new set of features with more discriminate power, the commonly used feature reduction techniques are used, which include Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Maximum Margin Criterion (MMC), Stepwise Discriminate Analysis based Feature Selection (SDAFS), and Genetic Algorithm based Feature Selection (GAFS). Then, we propose a Context Based Mixture Model (CBMM) for dealing with the time-series cell sequence information and compare it to other traditional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Being a standard practice in machine learning, we systematically compare the performance of a number of common feature reduction techniques and classifiers to select an optimal combination of a feature reduction technique and a classifier. A cellular database containing 100 manually labelled subsequence is built for evaluating the performance of the classifiers. The generalization error is estimated using the cross validation technique. The experimental results show that CBMM outperforms all other classifies in identifying prophase and has the best overall performance.ConclusionThe application of feature reduction techniques can improve the prediction accuracy significantly.

Prior to FLLs classification an automated lesion segmentation algorithm based on Marcov Random Fields was employed in order to acquire each FLL Region of Interest. 42 texture features derived from the gray-level histogram, co-occurrence and run-length matrices and 12 morphological features were obtained from each lesion. Stepwise multi-linear regression analysis was utilized to avoid feature redundancy leading to a feature subset that fed the multiclass SVM classifier designed for lesion classification. SVM System evaluation was performed by means of leave-one-out method and ROC analysis. Results: Maximum accuracy for all three classes (90.0%) was obtained by means of the Radial Basis Kernel Function and three textural features (Inverse- Different-Moment, Sum-Variance and Long-Run-Emphasis) that describe lesion's contrast, variability and shape complexity. Sensitivity values for the three classes were 92.5%, 81.5% and 96.2% respectively, whereas specificity values were 94.2%, 95.3% and 95.5%. The AUC value achieved for the selected subset was 0.89 with 0.81 - 0.94 confidence interval. Conclusion: The proposed SVM system exhibit promising results that could be utilized as a second opinion tool to the radiologist in order to decrease the time/cost of diagnosis and the need for patients to undergo invasive examination.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-6596/633/1/012116", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "journal": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "mag_id": "2519656470", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["29651196", "214624097"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64447375"}

However, images generated by various MRI scanners (e.g. GE Healthcare vs Siemens) differ both in intensity and noise distribution, preventing algorithms trained on MRIs from one scanner to generalize to data from other scanners successfully. We propose a method for image normalization to solve this problem. MRI normalization is challenging because it requires both normalizing intensity values and mapping between the noise distributions of different scanners. We utilize a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network to learn a bidirectional mapping between MRIs produced by GE Healthcare and Siemens scanners. This allows us learning the mapping between two different scanner types without matched data, which is not commonly available. To ensure the preservation of breast shape and structures within the breast, we propose two technical innovations. First, we incorporate a mutual information loss with the CycleGAN architecture to ensure that the structure of the breast is maintained. Second, we propose a modified discriminator architecture which utilizes a smaller field-of-view to ensure the preservation of finer details in the breast tissue. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that the second proposed method was able to consistently preserve a high level of detail in the breast structure while also performing the proper intensity normalization and noise mapping.

However, mutations, environmental stresses and aging can reduce efficiencies of these controls, leading to accumulation of protein aggregates, amyloid fibrils and plaques. In-vitro experiments have shown that even single amino acid substitutions can drastically enhance or mitigate protein aggregation kinetics. In this work, we have collected a dataset of 220 unique mutations in 25 proteins and classified them as enhancers or mitigators on the basis of their effect on protein aggregation rate. The data were analyzed via machine learning to identify features capable of distinguishing between aggregation rate enhancers and mitigators. Our initial Support Vector Machine (SVM) model separated such mutations with an overall accuracy of 69%. When local secondary structures at the mutation sites were considered, the accuracies further improved by 13-15%. The machine-learnt features are distinct for each secondary structure class at mutation sites. Protein stability and flexibility changes are important features for mutations in \u03b1-helices. \u03b2-strand propensity, polarity and charge become important when mutations occur in \u03b2-strands and ability to form secondary structure, helical tendency and aggregation propensity are important for mutations lying in coils. These results have been incorporated into a sequence-based algorithm (available at http://www.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo/aggrerate-disc/) capable of predicting whether a mutation will enhance or mitigate a protein's aggregation rate.

Even with the increase of technological sophistication of devices, incidents involving defibrillator malfunction are unfortunately not rare. To address this, we have developed an automated system based on machine learning algorithms that can predict performance of defibrillators and possible performance failures of the device which can affect performance. To develop an automated system, with high accuracy, overall dataset containing safety and performance measurements data was acquired from periodical safety and performance inspections of 1221 defibrillator. These inspections were carried out in period 2015\u20132017 in private and public healthcare institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina by ISO 17,020 accredited laboratory. Out of overall number of samples, 974 of them were used during system development and 247 samples were used for subsequent validation of system performance. During system development, 5 different machine learning algorithms were used, and resulting systems were compared by obtained performance. The results of this study demonstrate that clinical engineering and health technology management benefit from application of machine learning in terms of cost optimization and medical device management. Automated systems, based on machine learning algorithms, can predict defibrillator performance with high accuracy. Systems based on Random Forest classifier with Genetic Algorithm feature selection yielded highest accuracy among other machine learning systems. Adoption of such systems will help in overcoming challenges of adapting maintenance and medical device supervision mechanism protocols to rapid technological development of these devices.

Traditionally inventories have been carried out as field work, which makes them laborious and expensive. In recent years, the development of various remote sensing techniques to improve the cost-efficiency of the NFIs has accelerated. The goal of this study is to determine the usability of open and free multitemporal multispectral satellite images from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite constellation and to compare their usability in forest inventories against airborne laserscanning (ALS) and three-dimensional data obtained with high-resolution optical satellite images from WorldView-2 and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) stereo data from TerraSAR-X. Ground reference consisted of field data collected over 74 boreal forest plots in Southern Finland in 2014 and 2016. Features utilizing both single- and multiple-date information were designed and tested for Sentinel-2 data. Due to high cloud cover, only four Sentinel-2 images were available for the multitemporal feature analysis of all reference plots within the monitoring window. Random Forest technique was used to find the best descriptive feature sets to model five forest inventory parameters (mean height, mean diameter at breast height, basal area, volume, above-ground biomass) from all input remote sensing data. The results confirmed that the higher spatial resolution input data correlated with more accurate forest inventory parameter predictions, which is in line with other results presented in literature. The addition of temporal information to the Sentinel-2 results showed limited variation in prediction accuracy between the single and multidate cases ranging from 0.45 to 1.5 percentage points, whereof mean height, basal area and aboveground biomass are lower for single date with relative RMSEs of 14.07%, 20.66% and 24.71% respectively. Diameter at breast height and volume are lower for multi date feature combination with relative RMSEs of 18.38% and 27.21%.

Most of the IEEE 802.15.4 radios operate in the crowded 2.4 GHz frequency band, which is used by many technologies. Since IEEE 802.15.4 is a low power technology, the avoidance of interference is vital to conserve energy and to extend the lifetime of devices. A lightweight classification algorithm is ::: presented to detect the common external sources of interference in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, namely, IEEE 802.11-based wireless local area networks (WLANs), Bluetooth, and microwave ovens. This lightweight algorithm uses the energy detection (ED) feature (the feature behind received signal strength indication (RSSI)) of an IEEE 802.15.4-compliant radio. Therefore, it classifies the interferers without demodulation of their signals. As it relies on time patterns instead of spectral features, the algorithm has no need to change the channel. Thus, it allows the radio both to stay connected to the channel and to receive while scanning. Furthermore, it has a maximum runtime of merely one second. The algorithm is extensively tested in a radio frequency anechoic chamber and in real world scenarios.

This study aimed to compare the potential of representation learning models in extracting biomedical relations by using four different types of representation learning models, viz., TransE, PTransE, TransR, and TransH. For training and evaluating the models, we collected and utilized manually curated data from public databases, including relations among chemicals, genes, diseases, and symptoms. Overall, TransE, the most efficient translation-based monolingual knowledge graph embedding model, displayed the best performance with a higher learning speed for large-scale biomedical data. Using TransE, we inferred new relations among chemicals, genes, diseases, and symptoms, and evaluated the reliability of these inferred relations. Furthermore, TransE outperformed an existing statistical method used in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database for inferring new chemical-disease relations.

With the introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as a general framework for the image generation problem, there is a tremendous growth in the area of image-to-image transformation.

The performance of the proposed CSGAN is evaluated on two benchmark image-to-image transformation datasets, including CUHK Face dataset and CMP Facades dataset. The results are computed using the widely used evaluation metrics such as MSE, SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS. The experimental results of the proposed CSGAN approach are compared with the latest state-of-the-art approaches such as GAN, Pix2Pix, DualGAN, CycleGAN and PS2GAN.

Implementation of CITES necessitates the development of efficient forensic tools to identify wood species accurately, and ideally ones readily deployable in wood anatomy laboratories across the world. Herein, a method using quantitative wood anatomy data in combination with machine learning models to discriminate between three Swietenia species is presented, in addition to a second model focusing only on the two historically more important species S. mahagoni and S. macrophylla. The intra- and inter-specific variations in nine quantitative wood anatomical characters were measured and calculated based on 278 wood specimens, and four machine learning classifiers\u2014Decision Tree C5.0, Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)\u2014were used to discriminate between the species. Among these species, S. macrophylla exhibited the largest intraspecific variation, and all three species showed at least partly overlapping values for all nine characters. SVM performed the best of all the classifiers, with an overall accuracy of 91.4% and a per-species correct identification rate of 66.7%, 95.0%, and 80.0% for S. humilis, S. macrophylla, and S. mahagoni, respectively. The two-species model discriminated between S. macrophylla and S. mahagoni with accuracies of over 90.0% using SVM. These accuracies are lower than perfect forensic certainty but nonetheless demonstrate that quantitative wood anatomy data in combination with machine learning models can be applied as an efficient tool to discriminate anatomically between similar species in the wood anatomy laboratory.

We apply recent advances in computer science to estimate personality across each of the \"Big Five\" dimensions using speeches recorded in the Congressional Record. In particular, we use Support Vector Machines (SVM) models to connect linguistic cues in legislator speech with known personality correlates of those cues.

For the feature acquisition of the fetal heart rate (FHR) signal, the traditional feature-based classification methods need to manually read the morphological features from the FHR curve, which is time-consuming and costly and has a certain degree of calibration bias. This paper proposes a classification method of the FHR signal based on neural networks, which can avoid manual feature acquisition and reduce the error caused by human factors.

We transfer this approach to the neural gas algorithm. The magnification exponent can be calculated analytically for arbitrary dimension from a continuum theory, and the entropy of the resulting map is studied numerically confirming the theoretical prediction. The influence of a diagonal term, which can be added without impacting the magnification, is studied numerically.

Performance of different classifiers trained with and without visual stimulus yielded similar accuracies; however, the dataset with the absence of visual stimulus exhibit higher classification accuracies for all classifiers. In addition, all classifiers obtained high classification accuracies (>96%) for both datasets and the SVM performed best among the classifiers having accuracies of 97.5% and 99.5% for datasets with and without visual stimulus respectively.

Previous work analyzed how asker- and question-related features affect the question quality (QQ) regarding the amount of attention from users, the number of answers and the question solving latency, but neglect the correlation between QQ and AQ (measured by the rating of the best answer), which is critical to quality of service (QoS). We handle this problem from two aspects. First, we additionally use QQ in measuring AQ, and analyze the correlation between a comprehensive list of features (including answer-related features) and QQ. Second, we propose the first method that estimates the probability for a given question to obtain high AQ. Our analysis on the Yahoo!

For the correlation analysis, the previous classification algorithms cannot consider the mutual interactions between multiple ( $>$ 2) classes of features.

Our extensive experiments show that CSMRLP outperforms the Mutual Reinforcement-based Label Propagation (MRLP) and five other traditional classification algorithms in the accuracy of AQ classification, and the effectiveness of our proposed method in AQ prediction.

Various machine learning techniques including Naive Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machine, Decision trees, and ensemble learners are used with different feature extraction schemes to obtain a sentiment analysis model for positive or negative polarity in the movie review data sets. The performance of learners based sentiment analysis model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measures.

Especially the protection of pedestrians is supposed to be enhanced essentially by the European legislation. In spring 2003 the European Commission adopted a directive for pedestrian protection, defining limits of injury heaviness of the various body zones of pedestrians accidents with cars. One of the various ways to decrease pedestrian accident involvement is the development of pedestrian detection systems able to detect a pedestrian in front of the vehicle and warn the driver or actively intervene before an accident happens. This paper presents the feature extraction and classification modules of a vision-based pedestrian detection system. Similar to most systems for pedestrian detection, our system is based on a combination of features, namely overcomplete wavelet features and a combination of symmetry and edge density features. Other features used are Legendre Moments and Edge Orientation Histogram (EOH). This new constellation of feature representations leads to excellent test results in terms of run-time and classification performance, since classifiers can be cascaded in order to lower overall computation costs. As we will show, especially the combination of features is favorable. Support Vector Machines are used as classifier, since they are easy to handle and to implement (compared to Neural Networks). Based on theoretical facts, fast learning algorithms are available, and they have been proved to achieve very good experimental results. Classifiers have to be evaluated in order to measure and predict their performance. Evaluation must not be based on subjective impressions, but has to make use of a statistical analysis. But statistical measures alone do not necessarily reflect the performance of the classifier under real operating conditions. It is also important to correctly design the classifier training and its evaluation. These aspects will be discussed in detail.

To tackle this issue, we propose a new NRL framework, named HSRL, to help existing NRL methods capture both local and global topological information of a network. Specifically, HSRL recursively compresses an input network into a series of smaller networks using a community-awareness compressing strategy. Then, an existing NRL method is used to learn node embeddings for each compressed network. Finally, the node embeddings of the input network are obtained by concatenating the node embeddings resulting from all compressed networks.

It combines the high classification quality of the Support Vector Machine by margin maximization and the low effort of the Relevance Vector Machine caused by the special statistical approach.

Moreover it is shown that polarimetric features can improve the classification quality for hard targets. Among these the simple energy based features prove more favorable than complex ones. Especially the two coplanar polarizations embody the essential information, but a better generalizability is caused by using all four channels. ::: An important property of a classifier used in the ATR framework is the capability to reject objects not belonging to any of the trained classes.

{"paper_id": "15340257", "title": "Connectionist Model Accounting for Retardation of Cognitive-Dissonance Reduction Caused by Attention-Focus Switching", "authors": [{"first": "Takao", "middle": [], "last": "Matsumoto", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Connectionist Model Accounting for Retardation of Cognitive-Dissonance Reduction Caused by Attention-Focus Switching Takao Matsumoto (matsumoto@c.dendai.ac.jp) Tokyo Denki University 5 Senju-Asahi-cho, Adachi-ku, Tokyo 120-8551, Japan Abstract A novel connectionist model accounting for cognitive dissonance is described, in which the concepts of self and attention are considered. The model makes it possible to use mathematical formulas to represent the cognitive-dissonance process. Analysis reveals that the model fits experimental data of major paradigms in cognitive dissonance theory and that attention-focus switching causes building-up of cognitive dissonance and retardation of its reduction. Keywords: cognitive dissonance; connectionist model; attention; self-concept; mathematical analysis Introduction Cognitive dissonance theory insists that dissonance is a psychological state of tension that people are motivated to reduce (Festinger, 1957). Dissonance causes feelings of discomfort, unhappiness, or distress. Any two cognitions are dissonant when one of them follows from the obverse of the other. To reduce dissonance, people add consonant cognitions or change evaluations for one or both cognitions to make them more consistent. Cognitive dissonance theory makes a clear prediction when a firm expectancy is involved as one of the cognitions in question (Aronson, 1969). A well-known example of this is the famous Aesop\u2019s fable \u201cThe fox and the grapes.\u201d In the story, a fox wanted to get some grapes hanging high on vines and leaped with effort, but couldn\u2019t get them. Walking away, the fox said, \u201cThe grapes are surely sour, and I do not need them.\u201d Since the expectation and experience were inconsistent, the fox had cognitive dissonance, which he reduced by convincing himself that the expectation was not appropriate. Shultz and Lepper (1996) proposed a connectionist model accounting specifically for the mechanism of cognitive dissonance. A constraint satisfaction neural network model was used to simulate data from the several major cognitive dissonance paradigms (Shultz, Leveille, & Lepper, 1999). In it weights between nodes are fixed and activations of units are changed. Dissonance is defined by a formula that is a function of activations of units and weights applied to links in the network. Networks tend to settle into a less dissonant state as activations of units are changed according to update rules. Another connectionist model was proposed by Van Overwalle and colleagues (2002, 2005). They represented attitudes in a feed-forward neural network with the delta- learning rule in which weights are allowed to change. Input nodes represent the features of the environment and two output ports represent behavior and affect. Dissonance is defined as the discrepancy between expected and actual outcomes. They also simulated the experimental results of major cognitive dissonance paradigms. Several other computational models have been reported that deal with attitude phenomena through simulation using constraint- satisfaction or non-constraint-satisfaction networks (Mosler et al., 2001; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986; Read & Miller; 1994; Spellman, Ullman, & Holyoak, 1993). People are motivated to prioritize to protect their self- system. Self-consistency theory (Aronson, 1969; Thibodeau and Aronson, 1992) emphasizes that self is involved in dissonance arousal and that not only cognitions but also self-concept need to be considered in discussing dissonance. Judgment and assessment for cognitions performed by self possibly become motives for arousal of cognitive dissonance. On the other hand, attention is an important phenomenon of information processing in cognitive systems (Pisapia, Repovs, & Braver, 2008). It is a function for selecting and enhancing a limited area of information, while suppressing other areas. Cognitions are included in these areas of information. To the author\u2019s knowledge, connectionist models for cognitive dissonance taking the concepts of self and attention into account have not been presented. In this paper, a novel model considering these concepts is described and reduction of cognitive dissonance based on the model is discussed. Connectionist Model Figure 1 shows our connectionist model accounting for cognitive dissonance. In accordance with the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957), two cognitions are adopted in the model, which are depicted as units R and I. We assume that unit R is a reality-based cognition such as the cognition of behavior, experience, or actual situation, while unit I is an imagination-based cognition such as the cognition of expectancy, hope, or belief. In the case of the previously mentioned fable, the imagination-based cognition held by the fox is \u201cThe grapes can stave off my hunger\u201d and the reality-based cognition is \u201cThe grapes do not stave off my hunger.\u201d Attention plays an important role in cognitive systems. It selects and enhances limited cognitions and suppresses others. If we consider two cognitions alone, when one of them is selected and enhanced, the other is rejected and", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CogSci", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2403645966", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["144059692", "143006741", "17799138", "16577977", "151688665", "151933276", "15001270", "20941174", "143504019", "143518682", "143620055", "15561117"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15340257"}

Probabilistic models, such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), have been successfully applied to this end given their ability to exploit contextual and situation information, e.g. a bowl is typically found in a cabinet and not in a night-stand. In this work we propose to evolve CRFs into Ontology-based Conditional Random Fields (obCRFs ), which define a multi-level structure where each level assigns a category with different granularity to the same set of objects. For example, a level could assign to an object the category appliance or furniture, while the next one could categorize it into the tv, microwave, cabinet, or table types. In this way, general categorizations can guide the classification into more specialized ones (and vice versa), improving recognition success, and mitigating the CRFs limitations when modeling a high number of object categories (shared, in general, by Machine Learning techniques). To set the categories in each level we propose to mimic the hierarchical structure of ontologies, where categories are naturally codified following a subsumption ordering. This leads us to the second advantage of obCRFs : the multi-labeling of objects provides a richer understanding of the scene, which can be leveraged for accomplishing high-level tasks (e.g. object search or scheduling).

This process relies conventionally on manual or semi-automated segmentation, leading to inefficient solutions. Our novel framework addresses this challenge by proposing an unsupervised learning method to separate VAT from SAT in the abdominal region for the clinical quantification of central obesity. This step is followed by a context driven label fusion algorithm through sparse 3D Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for volumetric adiposity analysis. In the second module , we automatically detect, segment, and quantify brown adipose tissue (BAT) using PET scans because unlike WAT, BAT is metabolically active. After identifying BAT regions using PET, we perform a co-segmentation procedure utilizing asymmetric complementary information from PET and CT.

However, current word embedding methods have limitations to learn decent representations for low-frequency words. Medicine is a knowledge-extensive domain; existing medical knowledge has the potential to improve feature representations for less frequent yet important words. However, it is still not clear how existing medical knowledge can help deep learning models in clinical NER tasks. In this study, we integrated medical knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System with word embeddings trained from an unlabeled clinical corpus in RNNs for detection of problems, treatments and lab tests. We examined three different ways to generate medical knowledge features, including a dictionary lookup program, the KnowledgeMap system, and the MedLEE system. We also compared representing medical knowledge as one-hot vectors versus representing medical knowledge as embedding layers. The evaluation results showed that the RNN with medical knowledge as embedding layers achieved new state-of-the-art performance (a strict F1 score of 86.21% and a relaxed F1 score of 92.80%) on the 2010 i2b2 corpus, outperforming an RNN with only word embeddings and RNNs with medical knowledge as one-hot vectors.

However, subtle morphological differences between starch granules make their taxonomic identifications difficult. In order to improve the identification of these plant remains, we used an image analysis program that measures up to 123 different optical and morphological characters. With Random Forest tests we analyzed ~ 5000 starch granules extracted from underground storage organs (USO), seeds, and fruits of 20 different East African edible plant species. Our results show that correct identification rates are up to 74% for some species ( Echinochloa colona, Cyperus rodundus) , ~ 80% for some suprageneric taxa (Poaceae, Fabaceae), and 80% for underground storage organs. However, on average, success rates are just ~ 53% for species (up to 70% with a dataset reduced to herbaceous species), 60% for families, and 72% for plant parts. Yet, this automated system is not perfect, but it is still more powerful than the human eye, for which the average success rate is just of 25% for species level identifications. We evaluated the performance of our system and found that accuracy rates of identifications of starch granules are highly sensitive to the number of groups (species) to identify (r 2 = 0.83) and, to a lesser extent to the number of characters used by the identification system (r 2 = 0.87). It is therefore crucial to narrow down as much as possible the number of target species, by analyzing additional proxies. We conclude that better results can be achieved if the candidate field is narrowed.

To define the wrinkle regions more precisely, a template consisting of 10 regions constructed relatively to a set of automatically located facial landmarks is used. We extract the multi-scale wrinkles in each region and encode them into MWP. We use Support Vector Regression to estimate age from the combination of such patterns.

Emerging technologies in optical imaging sensors play an important role in PA. In maize fields, site-specific treatments, with chemical products or mechanical manipulations, are applied for weeds elimination. Maize is an irrigated crop, also unprotected from rainfall. After a strong rain, soil materials (particularly clays) mixed with water impregnate the vegetative cover. The green spectral component associated to the plants is masked by the dominant red spectral component coming from soil materials. This makes methods based on the greenness identification fail under such situations. We propose a new method based on Support Vector Machines for identifying plants with green spectral components masked and unmasked. The method is also valid for post-treatment evaluation, where loss of greenness in weeds is identified with the effectiveness of the treatment and in crops with damage or masking.

Besides, several conventional techniques for controlling and monitoring anarchic urban expansion have been initiated but they remain not sufficient to overcome this issue.This paper proposes an automatic method of detection and monitoring of anarchic urban expansions starting from multi-sources and multi-temporal data (VHR satellite images and geographic information data). First, the illegal urban areas are extracted using an original SVM based technique integrating expert knowledge and auxiliary data by means of ontology construction. This leads to the formalization of the expert semantic information and the urban construction rules (often in sentences form) and their confrontation with the classification results.Secondly, the SITS classified images are modeled using Spatial-Object Temporal Adjacency Graphs (SOTAG) constructed for each region of the first image.

We introduce a new meta-algorithm, the X-learner, that is provably efficient when the number of units in one treatment group is much larger than in the other, and can exploit structural properties of the CATE function. For example, if the CATE function is linear and the response functions in treatment and control are Lipschitz continuous, the X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under regularity conditions.

In extensive simulation studies, the X-learner performs favorably, although none of the meta-learners is uniformly the best.

To compensate for the hysteresis behavior, two feedforward control schemes according to different inputs of NARX model are proposed and analyzed separately. Then, a hybrid feedforward controller combining both the control schemes is put forward to revise the model input.

A reinforcement learning approach to decision tree building seems more suitable as it aims at maximizing the long-term return rather than optimizing a short-term goal. In this paper, a reinforcement learning approach is used to train a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which enables the creation of a short and highly accurate decision tree. Moreover, the use of reinforcement learning naturally enables additional functionality such as learning under concept drifts, feature importance weighting, inclusion of new features and forgetting of obsolete ones as well as classification with incomplete data. To deal with concept drifts, a reset operation is proposed that allows for local re-learning of outdated parts of the tree.

In order to overcome the defects live in the existent recognition methods based on fuzzy, neural network and support vector regression (SVR) theory, a novel flatness pattern recognition method based on least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) was proposed. On this basis, for the purpose of determining the hyper-parameters of LS-SVR effectively and enhancing the recognition accuracy and generalization performance of the model, particle swarm optimization algorithm with leave-one-out (LOO) error as fitness function was adopted. To overcome the disadvantage of high computational complexity of naive cross-validation algorithm, a novel fast cross-validation algorithm was introduced to calculate the LOO error of LS-SVR.

Moreover, occlusion results in the generation of unwanted keypoints which decreases accuracy. In general, more time is consumed for detection of keypoints. These challenges are addressed by Dense SIFT algorithm, as the number of keypoints and their locations are controlled.

The definition of most discriminative trajectory features and proper supervised trajectory-based classifier has remained a motivational challenge for scholars vis-a-vis real-time TSA. In addition, increase in the consumption of electrical energy along with constraints such as amortization of network equipment induces electric power system inadequacy risk. The retrieval of power system adequacy involves network expansion planning such as installing new power plants for the network. This policy affects the structure and electrical specification of the network significantly. Furthermore, due to sudden or the scheduled tripping of network equipment stemming from action of protection devices or maintenance procedures, the network must undergo shallow structural changes. The different level of changes in network specification is becoming a potential barrier for network analysis tools like real-time TSA platform. In fact, the lack of consideration of the incompatibility of TSA tool with expansion planning affects the performance of TSA learning model that is trained using the pre-expansion network. However, this paradoxical problem can be solved by generalized learning for power system size & type independent (PSs&tInd) real-time TSA. For this purpose, first, we used a set of PSs&tInd trajectory features. Next, we presented a trajectory-based deep neuro classifier to eliminate kernel functions weaknesses plugged into the hyperplane-based classifier.

Novel wearable devices with imaging capabilities will be uniquely positioned to assist visually impaired in activities such as grocery shopping. However, supporting such time-sensitive applications on embedded platforms requires an intelligent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. In order to maximize their utility in real-world scenarios, visual classifiers often need to recognize objects within large sets of object classes that are both diverse and deep. In a grocery market, simultaneously recognizing the appearance of people, shopping carts, and pasta is an example of a common diverse object classification task. Moreover, a useful visual-aid system would need deep classification capability to distinguish among the many styles and brands of pasta to direct attention to a particular box. Exemplar Support Vector Machines (ESVMs) provide a means of achieving this specificity, but are resource intensive as computation increases rapidly with the number of classes to be recognized.

Standard natural language processing (NLP) tools such as part-of-speech (POS) tagger and parsers perform poorly because such tools are generally trained with monolingual content. Thus there is a need for code-mixed NLP. This research focuses on creating a code-mixed corpus in English-Hindi-Bengali and using it to develop a world-level language identifier and a POS tagger for such code-mixed content. The first target of this research is word-level language identification. A data set of romanised and code-mixed content written in English, Hindi and Bengali was created and annotated. Word-level language identification (LID) was performed on this data using dictionaries and machine learn- ing techniques. We find that among a dictionary-based system, a character-n-gram based linear model, a character-n-gram based first order Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and a recurrent neural network in the form of a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) that consider words as well as characters, LSTM outperformed the other methods. We also took part in the First Workshop of Computational Approaches to Code-Switching, EMNLP, 2014 where we achieved the highest token-level accuracy in the word-level language identification task of Nepali-English. The second target of this research is part-of-speech (POS) tagging. POS tagging methods for code- mixed data (e.g. pipeline and stacked systems and LSTM-based neural models) have been implemented, among them, neural approach outperformed the other approach. Further, we investigate building a joint model to perform language identification and POS tagging jointly. We compare between a factorial CRF (FCRF) based joint model and three LSTM-based multi-task models for word-level language identification and POS tagging. The neural models achieve good accuracy in language ::: identification and POS tagging by outperforming the FCRF approach. Further- more, we found that it is better to go for a multi-task learning approach than to perform individual task (e.g. language identification and POS tagging) using neural approach.

The main challenge, however, remains realizing this approach in practice. Toward this aim, the recent work of Mittner et al. (2014), which explored the mechanisms of mind-wandering using a combination of brain imaging, pupillometry and cognitive modeling, serves as an important illustration of how this methodological amalgam can be effectively implemented. ::: ::: In a functional MRI (fMRI) experiment with concurrent eye-tracking, the authors used a standard stop-signal paradigm (142 \u201cstop-trials\u201d and 284 \u201cgo-trials\u201d). About 15% of the pseudorandom \u201cgo-trials\u201d were followed by thought probes, requiring participants to rate their level of mind-wandering during the preceding trial. Subsequently, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) multivariate classifier was trained and tested on the thought-probe trials data using activity levels and functional connectivity within and between regions of interest (ROIs) of the default mode network (DMN) and its anti-correlated network, and measures of pupil size. Having successfully decoded the level of mind-wandering on thought-probe trials, the authors were able to use the classifier to predict the likelihood of mind-wandering on all remaining trials. Thus, the main benefit of using a combination of brain imaging, pupillometry, and behavioral measures over a typical behavioral experiment (e.g., Mcvay and Kane, 2012) was that it provided an estimation of mind-wandering levels for hundreds of consecutive trials, without the added distraction of incessant thought probes. ::: ::: The authors' finding that pupils were informative for predicting the level of mind-wandering confirmed corresponding previous reports (Smallwood et al., 2012; Franklin et al., 2013), and anticipated an interesting recent study reporting a link between DMN activity and change of pupil size (Yellin et al., 2015). The results of Mittner et al. also accord well with brain stimulation (Axelrod et al., 2015) and fMRI imaging studies that implicated DMN in mind-wandering by using average activity level (for meta-analyses: Fox et al., 2015; Stawarczyk and D'Argembeau, 2015), multivariate (Tusche et al., 2014) and connectivity (Kucyi et al., 2013; Kucyi and Davis, 2014) patterns. Interestingly, while not discussed by the authors, the fact that the measures of functional connectivity, calculated using a sliding window of 40 s, contributed to successful prediction suggests that fluctuations in mind-wandering had a slow dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, slow fluctuations of mind-wandering have not been previously shown. Graphically, this phenomenon can be illustrated by plotting the predicted probability of mind-wandering across all trials as a function of time and by observing periodic oscillations. ::: ::: In the second part of the study, the predicted likelihood of mind-wandering of all experimental trials was used in cognitive modeling analysis. Behavioral choice and Response Time (RT) data were analyzed using an independent race model where each available course of action (right, left, refrain from response) was represented by an independent stochastic accumulator. The first accumulator to reach a predetermined threshold determined the elicited response (or lack thereof) and its latency. The distributions of accumulator termination time were parameterized by seven parameters: three drift-rates with one for each response alternative; one common threshold; and three non-decision time parameters (one for each accumulator) representing the duration of all non-decision processes, such as perceptual encoding and response execution. Only three parameters were allowed to play a role in the mechanisms underlying the behavioral difference between trials with high- and low-level mind-wandering: correct drift-rate, refrain drift-rate and threshold (i.e., modulation of response caution). All three parameters were found to play a role and were lower for the high mind-wandering trials, reflecting poorer information processing efficiency and lower response caution. ::: ::: Technical and theoretical assumptions are at the basis of every model and directly affect the interpretation of the fitting results (Teodorescu and Usher, 2013; Jones and Dzhafarov, 2014; Teodorescu et al., 2015). In this study a selective influence assumption (Ashby and Townsend, 1980) was made whereby mind-wandering influences only decision-related parameters (drift-rate and threshold). The grounds for this assumption, however, are not discussed. Importantly, mind-wandering might also affect non-decision processes. For example, by delaying initiation of perceptual encoding or habitual motor response (van Vugt et al., 2015). Thus, the selective influence assumption can hinder detection of any role that non-decision processes might play. To avoid potentially inaccurate estimates for the remaining (decision) parameters, the role of non-decision processes could be further tested by allowing this parameter to vary between conditions. ::: ::: It is noteworthy that modeling interpretations are dependent not only upon selective influence assumptions, but also upon the choice of parameters that are omitted entirely from the model. For example, in order to provide adequate simultaneous accounts of both correct and error RT distributions, choice-RT models often include parameters that represent the magnitude of between-trial fluctuations in the state of the organism (Ratcliff and Mckoon, 2008). Although mind-wandering constitutes a potential source for such fluctuations, between-trial drift-variability parameters are absent in the current study. Furthermore, high drift-variability is associated with high behavioral response variability, which was indeed found by Mittner et al. Crucially, higher levels of between-trial drift-variability have been successfully used in the past to account for the higher response variability associated with mind-wandering (Mcvay and Kane, 2012). Thus, the inclusion of a drift-variability parameter could potentially provide an alternative interpretation for the modeling results of Mittner et al. ::: ::: Finally, the stop signal paradigm used by the authors does not produce many error responses. The lack of error responses is a potential limitation since error-RT distributions are essential for constraining choice-RT models. Importantly, higher between-trial drift-rate variability, leads to slower errors compared to correct responses. Thus, the inclusion of error RT distributions could potentially disentangle the drift variability account of mind-wandering [higher between trial drift-rate variability] (Mcvay and Kane, 2012) from the [lower drift-rate + lower threshold] account adopted by Mittner and colleagues. The latter predicts increased error-rates, but a constant relation between correct and error RTs, whereas the former predicts increased error-rates and slower error RTs. In order to answer this question, future studies can consider using paradigms that generate more errors [e.g., Error Awareness Task (Allen et al., 2013)]. ::: ::: In sum, the study by Mittner and colleagues provides an inspiring example of combining cognitive modeling with neuroimaging\u2014an approach that has great potential for advancing our understanding of cognitive mechanisms. It is noteworthy that the approach by Mittner et al. was to some extent indirect, since the brain imaging and pupillometry data were only used to generate per trial mind-wandering ratings, which were subsequently used in the modeling. Thus, a natural advancement would constitute a move toward an approach that directly models the neuroimaging data (e.g., Jahn et al., 2014).", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4489150", "pubmed_id": "26190999", "doi": "10.3389/fncom.2015.00083", "venue": "Front.

The most common approach for multi-scale feature construction in DSM is to filter terrain attributes based on different neighborhood sizes, however results can be difficult to interpret because the approach is affected by outliers. Alternatively, one can derive the terrain attributes on decomposed elevation data, but the resulting maps can have artefacts rendering the approach undesirable. Here, we introduce 'mixed scaling' a new method that overcomes these issues and preserves the landscape features that are identifiable at different scales. The new method also extends the Gaussian pyramid by introducing additional intermediate scales. This minimizes the risk that the scales that are important for soil formation are not available in the model. In our extended implementation of the Gaussian pyramid, we tested four intermediate scales between any two consecutive octaves of the Gaussian pyramid and modelled the data with Deep Learning and Random Forests. We performed the experiments using three different datasets and show that mixed scaling with the extended Gaussian pyramid produced the best performing set of covariates and that modelling with Deep Learning produced the most accurate predictions, which on average were 4-7% more accurate compared to modelling with Random Forests.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6189054", "pubmed_id": "30323355", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-018-33516-6", "venue": "Scientific Reports", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2896139965", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["33300440", "17467751", "128550703", "129581358", "17605661", "26008521", "135156369", "1262186", "97520439", "10638212", "128912062", "93447440", "8018433", "26257653", "130535382", "14549799", "89141", "55920213", "128525030", "215033858", "13906259", "134069628", "53304118", "3074096", "515925", "33139394", "8407336", "110371387", "133920954", "14983214", "128984626", "11715509", "130679886", "95875004", "129686532", "130642375", "4399014", "207763512", "2239473", "129515912"], "inbound_citations": ["204542509", "215540625", "182927031", "197411143"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53040810"}

This paper explores the use of intermediate matching kernel (IMK) as a DK for classification of varying length patterns of long duration speech represented as sets of feature vectors. The main issue in construction of IMK is the choice for the set of virtual feature vectors used to select the local feature vectors for matching. This paper proposes to use components of class-independent Gaussian mixture model (CIGMM) as a representation for the set of virtual feature vectors. For every component of CIGMM, a local feature vector each from the two sets of local feature vectors that has the highest probability of belonging to that component is selected and a base kernel is computed between the selected local feature vectors. The IMK is computed as the sum of all the base kernels corresponding to different components of CIGMM. It is proposed to use the responsibility term weighted base kernels in computation of IMK to improve its discrimination ability. This paper also proposes the posterior probability weighted DKs (including the proposed IMKs) to improve their classification performance and reduce the number of support vectors.

The proposed method operates locally in neighborhoods and does not involve any global computations. It is based on information propagation among neighboring points implemented as a voting process. Unlike other local approaches for manifold learning, the quantity propagated from one point to another is not a scalar, but is in the form of a tensor that provides considerably richer information.

In other words, we use only the proportions of the churners in each group to predict the latent customer churn. The proportion information in each group can be estimated by the experience of the commercial bank's customer manager, so it can greatly reduce the costs caused by labeling sample churn labels.

Projection of high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional subspace is a powerful strategy in general for mining such big data. However, scRNA-seq suffers from higher noise and lower coverage than traditional bulk RNA-seq, hence bringing in new computational difficulties. One major challenge is how to deal with the frequent drop-out events. The events, usually caused by the stochastic burst effect in gene transcription and the technical failure of RNA transcript capture, often render traditional dimension reduction methods work inefficiently. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel Single Cell Representation Learning (SCRL) method based on network embedding. This method can efficiently implement data-driven non-linear projection and incorporate prior biological knowledge (such as pathway information) to learn more meaningful low-dimensional representations for both cells and genes.

Past satellite image analyses have had difficulty in differentiating between no-till (NT) and minimal tillage (MT) conservation classes due to similarities in surface residues, and may have been restricted by the availability of cloud-free satellite imagery. This study hypothesized that the inclusion of high temporal data into the classification process would increase conservation tillage accuracy due to the added likelihood of capturing spectral changes in MT fields following a tillage disturbance. Classification accuracies were evaluated for Random Forest models based on 250-m and 500-m MODIS, 30-m Landsat, and 30-m synthetic reflectance values. Synthetic (30-m) data derived from the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) were evaluated because high frequency Landsat image sets are often unavailable within a cropping season due to cloud issues. Classification results from a five-date Landsat model were substantially better than those reported by previous classification tillage studies, with 94% total and \u2265 88% class producer's accuracies. Landsat-derived models based on individual image scenes (May through August) yielded poor MT classifications, but a monthly increase in accuracy illustrated the importance of temporal sampling for capturing regional tillage disturbance signatures. MODIS-based model accuracies (90% total; \u2265 82% class) were lower than in the five-date Landsat model, but were higher than previous image-based and survey-based tillage classification results. Almost all the STARFM prediction-based models had classification accuracies higher than, or comparable to, the MODIS-based results (> 90% total; \u2265 84% class) but the resulting model accuracies were dependent on the MODIS/Landsat base pairs used to generate the STARFM predictions. Also evident within the STARFM prediction-based models was the ability for high frequency data series to compensate for degraded synthetic spectral values when classifying field-based tillage. The decision to use MODIS or STARFM-based data within conservation tillage analysis is likely situation dependent. A MODIS-based approach requires little data processing and could be more efficient for large-area mapping; however a STARFM-based analysis might be more appropriate in mixed-pixel situations that could potentially compromise classification accuracy.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2010.08.005", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2165954860", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["89141", "1533891", "40921612", "11961980", "86219373", "3626971", "131679871", "129366813", "4669731", "18127289", "23649872", "128559096", "7855757", "109146189", "28908841", "8574723", "11077516", "2203046", "129683235", "127893075", "33836185", "150527520", "130801286", "5021789", "27310602", "140711696", "40616571", "128622505", "67751995"], "inbound_citations": ["44195923", "208224410", "15207919", "120725502", "39322158", "3485545", "122077065", "39333659", "27908121", "4000132", "36320453", "18433816", "128816514", "11064448", "29084215", "20237348", "17693961", "134817190", "121492358", "10837187", "26433454", "210123677", "129954610", "133166246", "18146510", "17256852", "7584576", "13977594", "61806713"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9880629"}

The limited topological structure of models and pre-specified part shapes are two main factors preventing these detectors from fully capturing large deformations. To better capture the deformations, we propose a novel approach to integrate the detections from a family of part-based detectors with patches of objects that have irregular shape. This integration is formulated as MAP inference in a Conditional Random Field (CRF). The energy function defined over the CRF takes into account the information provided by an object patch classifier and the object detector, and the goal is to augment the partial detections with missing patches, and also to refine the detections that include background clutter.

Semi-Markov conditional random fields (semi-CRFs) are a generalization of CRFs and provide a full conditional distribution over all possible segmentation of a sequence. Semi-CRFs are particularly suitable for tasks that entail segment-level features such as match with existing dictionary of segments. Empirical results on real-life NER tasks show that they yield higher accuracy than CRFs, but the straightforward foreword\u2013backward inference algorithm requires 3\u201310 times the computation cost of CRFs.

A real time anomaly detection for flight data can identify safety issues as soon as anomalies occur and improve the safety of aviation system. However, existing anomaly detection methods for flight data either perform not very well on unknown issues or are limited in their capabilities of real time detection. This paper provides a method to detect real time flight data anomalies with comparable detection performance. Firstly it transforms discrete and continuous flight data into discrete sequences. And each sequence obtained from discrete and continuous data is segmented into several subsequences by sliding a window of the specified size. More importantly, the variable length n-grams are obtained from each subsequence. Then all of unique n-grams become the feature space of the training data set. In this way each subsequence is mapped to this feature space and becomes an input feature vector of one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM). Finally, anomalies in flight data can be detected in real time by the classifier learned on these feature vectors corresponding to subsequences. Experimental results show that it performs better to use linear kernel to train one-class SVM on our feature vectors than Gaussian kernel and the size of the sliding window takes a little effect on the performance of our detection method.

Being able to track the location of a Wi-Fi or Radio Frequency Identification device could improve the quality of services in various sectors, including security, warehouse, logistic management, and healthcare. As compared with outdoor environment, positioning systems face a greater challenge in indoor environment because wireless signal is significantly influenced by building layout and surrounding objects, for which a location fingerprinting approach is needed. Moreover, the signal strength of a wireless device may also change over time, which is known as temporal variation, and therefore a reliable location estimation system must have the ability to learn and adapt with temporal changes. However, if the learning process is highly complex and requires long processing time, deploying the system into a larger scale would not be feasible.

Given a discrete vector field, our approach extracts multi-valued features from the field by exploiting its streamline structures so that these features are mapped to a visual space through a multidimensional projection technique. From an easy-to-handle interface, the user can interact with the projected data so as to partition and explore the most relevant vector features in a guidance frame of the simulation. Besides navigating and visually mining structures of interest, the interactivity with the projected data also allows the user to progressively enhance the segmentation result according to his insights.

This paper focuses on the study of the application of the Morphology Analysis and the theory RFFSVM (MA-RFFSVM) to fault diagnosis on the bearing of ships.

The data collected by logging wells can have significant economic consequences in oil and gas exploration, not only because it has a direct impact on the following decisions, but also due to the subsequent costs inherent to drilling wells, and the potential return of oil deposits. These logs frequently present gaps of varied sizes in the sensor recordings, that happen for diverse reasons. These gaps result in less information used by the interpreter to build the stratigraphic models, and consequently larger uncertainty regarding what will be encountered when the next well is drilled. The main goal of this work is to compare Gradient Tree Boosting, Random Forests, Artificial Neural Networks, and three algorithms of Linear Regression on the prediction of the gaps in well log data. Given the logs from a specific well, we use the intervals with complete information as the training data to learn a regression model of one of the sensors for that well. The algorithms are compared with each other using a few individual example wells with complete information, on which we build artificial gaps to cross validate the results. We show that the ensemble algorithms tend to perform significantly better, and that the results hold when addressing the different examples individually.

The objective of this work is to perform automated segmentation and classification (i.e., normal and abnormal) of intervertebral discs, vertebrae, and neural foramen in MRIs in one shot, which is called semantic segmentation that is extremely urgent to assist spinal clinicians in diagnosing neural foraminal stenosis, disc degeneration, and vertebral deformity as well as discovering possible pathological factors. However, no work has simultaneously achieved the semantic segmentation of intervertebral discs, vertebrae, and neural foramen due to three-fold unusual challenges: 1) Multiple tasks, i.e., simultaneous semantic segmentation of multiple spinal structures, are more difficult than individual tasks; 2) Multiple targets: average 21 spinal structures per MRI require automated analysis yet have high variety and variability; 3) Weak spatial correlations and subtle differences between normal and abnormal structures generate dynamic complexity and indeterminacy. In this paper, we propose a Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network called Spine-GAN for resolving above-aforementioned challenges. Firstly, Spine-GAN explicitly solves the high variety and variability of complex spinal structures through an atrous convolution (i.e., convolution with holes) autoencoder module that is capable of obtaining semantic task-aware representation and preserving fine-grained structural information. Secondly, Spine-GAN dynamically models the spatial pathological correlations between both normal and abnormal structures thanks to a specially designed long short-term memory module. Thirdly, Spine-GAN obtains reliable performance and efficient generalization by leveraging a discriminative network that is capable of correcting predicted errors and global-level contiguity. Extensive experiments on MRIs of 253 patients have demonstrated that Spine-GAN achieves high pixel accuracy of 96.2%, Dice coefficient of 87.1%, Sensitivity of 89.1% and Specificity of 86.0%, which reveals its effectiveness and potential as a clinical tool.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30176546", "doi": "10.1016/j.media.2018.08.005", "venue": null, "journal": "Medical Image Analysis", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2888443510", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["5707386", "13895147", "206766608", "206766608", "15134598", "4427216", "3758037", "3429309", "22655199", "3638670", "2965036", "18278409", "9237654", "5575601", "1033682", "41720542", "34270607", "4341397", "4337215", "1915014", "60719890", "11292651", "5808102", "13731046", "14521054", "7359077", "13335520", "59606130", "7276930", "7586214", "6628106", "7564654", "9546541", "28315255", "14464447", "1647000", "7886345", "8543144", "10875471", "16991836", "6126495", "12640199", "19557823", "11121871", "6371883", "6761245", "377167", "24731556", "32071089", "6613124", "15650791", "11758569", "17489759", "3719281", "17427022", "4071727", "56507745", "18892282", "9775470", "35654168", "4965981", "18939716", "2808607", "1055111", "3671937", "4387480", "206943405", "17127188", "9893011", "11629792"], "inbound_citations": ["212635180", "146810759", "210692328", "88489478", "52916761", "211207465", "59232712"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52155996"}

First, two types of result classifications were obtained based on RF (Random Forest) using RGB images and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) with RGB images. Then, the result map was reclassified into vegetation and nonvegetation.

The Support Vector Machines are learning systems that use a hypothetical space of linear functions in a kernel induced higher dimensional feature space, and are trained with a learning algorithm from optimization theory. Support vector machines are the methods of supervised learning, which are commonly used for classification and regression purpose. A SVM constructs a separating hyper plane between the classes in the n-dimensional space of the inputs. The Support Vector Regression attempts to fit a curve with respect to the kernel used in SVM on data points such that the points lie between two marginal hyper planes which helps in minimizing the regression error. For non-linear regression problems Kernel functions are used to map the data into higher dimensional space where linear regression is performed.

We tested how strongly aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa richness and composition were associated with natural variation in both flow regime and stream temperatures across streams of the western United States. ::: ::: 2. We used long-term flow records from 543 minimally impacted gauged streams to quantify 12 streamflow variables thought to be ecologically important. A principal component analysis reduced the dimensionality of the data from 12 variables to seven principal component (PC) factors that characterised statistically independent aspects of streamflow: (1) zero flow days, (2) flow magnitude, (3) predictability, (4) flood duration, (5) seasonality, (6) flashiness and (7) base flow. K-means clustering was used to group streams into 4\u20138 hydrologically different classes based on these seven factors. ::: ::: 3. We also used empirical models to estimate mean annual, mean summer and mean winter stream temperatures at each stream site. We then used invertebrate data from 63 sites to develop Random Forest models to predict taxa richness and taxon-specific probabilities of capture at a site from flow and temperature. We used the predicted taxon-specific probabilities of capture to estimate how well predicted assemblages matched observed assemblages as measured by RIVPACS-type observed/expected (O/E) indices and Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarities. ::: ::: 4. Macroinvertebrate taxon richness was only weakly associated with streamflow and temperature variables, implying that other factors more strongly influenced taxa richness. ::: ::: 5. In contrast to taxa richness, taxa composition was strongly associated with streamflow and temperature. Predictions of taxa composition (O/E and Bray\u2013Curtis) were most precise when both temperature and streamflow PC factors were used, although predictions based on either streamflow PC factors or temperature alone were also better than null model predictions. Of the seven aspects of the streamflow regime we examined, variation in baseflow conditions appeared to be most directly associated with invertebrate biotic composition. We were also able to predict assemblage composition from the conditional probabilities of hydrological class membership nearly as well as Random Forests models that were based directly on continuous PC factors. ::: ::: 6.

Semi-autonomous grasping, for instance, consists of having a smart slave able to guess the master\u2019s intentions and initiating a grasping sequence whenever the master wants to grasp an object in the slave\u2019s workspace. In this paper we investigate the possibility of building such an intelligent robotic artifact by training a machine learning system on data gathered from several human subjects while trying to grasp objects in a teleoperation setup. In particular, we investigate the usefulness of gaze tracking in such a scenario. The resulting system must be light enough to be usable on-line and flexible enough to adapt to different masters, e.g., elderly and/or slow. The outcome of the experiment is that such a system, based upon Support Vector Machines, meets all the requirements, being (a) highly accurate, (b) compact and fast, and (c) largely unaffected by the subjects\u2019 diversity. It is also clearly shown that gaze tracking significantly improves both the accuracy and compactness of the obtained models, if compared with the use of the hand position alone.

This paper presents an application of an improved wavelet neural network structure to the classification of the ECG beats, because of the high precision and fast learning rate. Feature extraction method in this paper is wavelet transform. Our experimental data set is taken from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The correct detection rate of QRS wave is 95% by testing the data of MIT-BIH database. The proposed methods are applied to a large number of ECG signals consisting of 600 training samples and 120 test samples from the MIT-BIH database. The samples equally represent six different ECG signal types, including normal beat, atrial premature beat, ventricular premature beat, left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block and paced beat. In comparison with pattern recognition methods of BP neural networks, RBF neural networks and Support Vector Machines (SVM), the results in this experiment prove that the wavelet neural network method has a better recognition rate when classifying electrocardiogram signals.

However, all tags are treated as equally important in these systems, which may result in misalignment between visual and textual modalities during MIR training. This will further lead to degenerated retrieval performance at query time. To address this issue, we investigate the problem of tag importance prediction, where the goal is to automatically predict the tag importance and use it in image retrieval. To achieve this, we first propose a method to measure the relative importance of object and scene tags from image sentence descriptions. Using this as the ground truth, we present a tag importance prediction model to jointly exploit visual, semantic and context cues. The Structural Support Vector Machine (SSVM) formulation is adopted to ensure efficient training of the prediction model. Then, the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is employed to learn the relation between the image visual feature and tag importance to obtain robust retrieval performance.

Methods/Statistical Analysis: Processing the data procured by MODIS Aqua sensor, classification of seven species of algae is performed based only on the feature of Remote Sensing Reflectance (R rs ). In contrast to the existing algorithms like band-ratio and interpretation of water discoloration, classification of blooms is based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Regularized Least Squares (RLS) algorithms. Findings: Classification is executed using LIBSVM and GURLS library for fast and efficient performance. The classification accuracies achieved using both the classifiers are comparable; the overall accuracy using SVM classifier is 88.37%, whereas that obtained with RLS classifier is 89.98%.

In this study, 40 DP patients and 40 age- and sex-matched NCs were recruited from Guangzhou Brain Hospital and the local community, respectively. We calculated gray matter volume (GMV) and white matter volume (WMV) of 210 cortical and 36 subcortical regions, defined by the Human Brainnetome Atlas. The group differences between DP patients and NCs were compared. The method of SVM combined with RFE was applied into the discriminative analysis of DP patients from NCs, in which discriminative features were drawn from GMV and WMV. We found that the DP patients showed significant GMV reductions in eight brain regions and showed significant WMV reductions in ten brain regions. The classifier using GMV as input features achieved the best performance (an accuracy of 86.25%, a sensitivity of 85%, and a specificity of 87.5%) in the discriminative analyses between DP patients and NCs.

A hyperheuristic multi-objective evolutionary search method is used to find the best network hyperparameters. We then use this optimised topology of deep neural network to classify both EMG and EEG signals, attaining results of 84.76% and 62.37% accuracy, respectively.

When EEG pre-trained weights are used for initial weight distribution for EMG, 85.12% (+0.36) accuracy is achieved. When the EMG network attempts to classify EEG, it outperforms the EEG network even without any training (+30.25% to 82.39% at epoch 0), and similarly the EEG network attempting to classify EMG data outperforms the EMG network (+2.38% at epoch 0). All transfer networks achieve higher pre-training abilities, curves, and asymptotes, indicating that knowledge transfer is possible between the two signal domains. In a second experiment with CNN transfer learning, the same datasets are projected as 2D images and the same learning process is carried out. In the CNN experiment, EMG to EEG transfer learning is found to be successful but not vice-versa, although EEG to EMG transfer learning did exhibit a higher starting classification accuracy.

However, it is difficult to collect a standard frontal image in an uncontrolled environment. To get a clear frontal image from a large variety of profile images, there are many studies on face frontalization. Some researches need three-dimension face data or prior pose information while others do not take into account the effect of pose information. And there are restrictions on the number of poses of input face images. Because of the ill-consideration of pose information, the authenticity of generated frontal face images is not high when we input multi-poses profile images. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a Pose-weighted Generative Adversarial Network (PWGAN), which adds a pre-trained pose certification module to learn face pose information. For the single input image, PWGAN combines fusion features with pose features. And for multiple input images, PWGAN uses pose information to dynamic distribute weights when fusing feature maps. PWGAN makes full use of pose information to make the generation network learn more about facial features and get better-generating effect. Through contrastive experiments, this paper proves that PWGAN has a better effect on multi-poses face frontalization than the above methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ITNEC.2019.8729088", "venue": "2019 IEEE 3rd Information Technology, Networking, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (ITNEC)", "journal": "2019 IEEE 3rd Information Technology, Networking, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (ITNEC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2952898206", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["24962907", "6383512", "1033682", "13058841", "195666781", "52243869", "23042392", "3570089", "8785311", "3678585", "17188384", "21011865", "2806929"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:174816674"}

While the classification of modern coins has been researched successfully in the last few years, very few attempts have been taken to solve this problem for ancient coins. Due to their large inter-class variability and low intra-class variability owed to the manual production process and abrasions which occurred over the centuries, classifying them poses a far more challenging task to numismatics than the classification of modern coins. Thus, a system that automatically recommends the best matching classes for a given coin image could facilitate the work of numismatists and speed up the overall classification process. A robust classification system relies on discriminative features of the objects of interest. The legend, i.e., the textual inscription, of a coin is considered a highly discriminative feature in the manual classification process performed by numismatists today. Hence, a coin classification system could greatly benefit from automatic legend recognition. We propose a method for automatic legend recognition in 2D coin images that accounts for the challenging properties of ancient coins. Standard OCR algorithms rely on binarization to separate text from background. However, binarization is a very error-prone process for ancient coin legends due to the complex shading effects on the highly specular coin surfaces. Therefore, the proposed method employs local features for the description of characters which are used for the training of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for every character class. Legend recognition is then performed by shifting a sliding window across a coin image and computing the local descriptor for every location. These descriptors are then tested with every SVM to produce a probability map for each character and location. In combination with a lexicon containing the set of possible words, the best matching ones are computed using Pictorial Structures. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated on a set of ancient Roman coins.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2501732865", "mag_field_of_study": ["Art"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:193386014"}

The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is a biodiversity hotspot in the world, which has an important status in the zoogeographical realms. Here, we analyzed the diversity patterns of Hemipteran insects in the QTP, and tested whether the patterns can be jointly explained by modern environmental as well as historical factors. A comprehensive geographic distribution dataset consisting of 1166 Hemipteran species, which belong to 510 genera and 53 families, was compiled and used in our analyses. Patterns of richness were mapped into a grid-based map with a spatial resolution of 0.5\u00b0x 0.5\u00b0. An unbalanced diversity pattern of the Hemipteran insects in the QTP was presented, with more species in the eastern and southern parts of the plateau, while few species in the northern and main surface of the plateau. The northwestern Sichuan, the southern Gansu, the southeastern Tibet, the northwestern Yunnan and the eastern Qinghai were identified as diversity hotspots of species richness. Further analyses based on General linear models and Random Forest indicated that the diversity patterns of Hemipteran insects were influenced by both contemporary environmental factors and historical factors (e.g. habitat heterogeneity, climate stability, energy availability). Specifically, the species richness patterns of all Hemipteran insects in the QTP have been mainly affected by elevation range, temperature annual range, min temperature of coldest month, mean temperature of coldest quarter and the temperature change since the Last Glacial Maximum. In contrast, the water-related variables have relatively small effects on species richness. In addition, although habitat heterogeneity was indicated the most important factor for different suborders of Hemiptera, the climate stability was another dominate factor for Heteroptera and Auchenorrhyncha, while Sternorrhyncha was more affected by historical climate change.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3389/fevo.2019.00165", "venue": "Front.

Considering a set of image samples comprising humans expressing various expressions, this new approach computes the phase congruency map between the samples. The analysis is performed in the frequency space where the similarity (or dissimilarity) between sample phases is measured to form discriminant features. The experiments were run using samples from two facial expression databases. To assess the method's performance, the technique is compared to the state-of-the art techniques utilized for classifying facial expressions, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Gabor jets.

Ultrasound imaging is widely used during pregnancy and has become central in the management of the problems of early pregnancy, particularly in miscarriage diagnosis. Also ultrasound is considered as the most important imaging modality in the evaluation of different types of ovarian tumours. The early detection of ovarian carcinoma and miscarriage continues to be a challenging task. It mostly relies on manual examination, interpretation by gynaecologists, of the ultrasound scan images that may use morphology features extracted from the region of interest. Diagnosis depends on using certain scoring systems that have been devised over a long time. The manual diagnostic process involves multiple subjective decisions, with increased inter- and intra-observer variations which may lead to serious errors and health implications. ::: This thesis is devoted to developing computer-based tools that use ultrasound scan images for automatic classification of Ovarian Tumours (Benign or Malignant) and automatic detection of Miscarriage cases at early stages of pregnancy. Our intended computational tools are meant to help gynaecologists to improve accuracy of their diagnostic decisions, while serving as a tool for training radiology students/trainees on diagnosing gynaecological abnormalities. Ultimately, it is hoped that the developed techniques can be integrated into a specialised gynaecology Decision Support System. ::: Our approach is to deal with this problem by adopting a standard image-based pattern recognition research framework that involve the extraction of appropriate feature vector modelling of the investigated tumours, select appropriate classifiers, and test the performance of such schemes using sufficiently large and relevant datasets of ultrasound scan images. We aim to complement the automation of certain parameters that gynaecologist experts and radiologists manually determine, by image-content information attributes that may not be directly accessible without advanced image transformations. This is motivated by, and benefit from, advances in computer vision that led the emergence of a variety of image processing/analysis techniques together with recent advances in data mining and machine learning technologies. ::: An expert observer makes a diagnostic decision with a level of certainty, and if not entirely certain about their diagnostic decisions then often other experts\u2019 opinions are sought and may be essential for diagnosing difficult \u201cInconclusive cases\u201d. Here we define a quantitative measure of confidence in decisions made by automatic diagnostic schemes, independent of accuracy of decision. ::: In the rest of the thesis, we report on the development of a variety of innovative diagnostic schemes and demonstrate their performances using extensive experimental work. The following is a summary of the main contributions made in this thesis. ::: 1. Using a combination of spatial domain filters and operations as pre-processing procedures to enhance ultrasound images for both applications, namely miscarriage identification and ovarian tumour diagnosis. We show that the Non-local means filter is effective in reducing speckle noise from ultrasound images, and together with other filters we succeed in enhancing the inner border of malignant tumours and reliably segmenting the gestational sac. ::: 2. Developing reliable automated procedures to extract several types of features to model gestational sac dimensional measurements, few of which are manually determined by radiologist and used by gynaecologists to identify miscarriage cases. We demonstrate that the corresponding automatic diagnostic schemes yield excellent accuracy when classified by the k-Nearest Neighbours. ::: 3. Developing several local as well as global image-texture based features in the spatial as well as the frequency domains. The spatial domain features include the local versions of image histograms, first order statistical features and versions of local binary patterns. From the frequency domain, we propose a novel set of Fast Fourier Geometrical Features that encapsulates the image texture information that depends on all image pixel values. We demonstrate that each of these features define Ovarian Tumour diagnostic scheme that have relatively high power of discriminating Benign from Malignant tumours when classified by Support Vector Machine. We show that the Fast Fourier Geometrical Features are the best performing scheme achieving more than 85% accuracy. ::: 4. Introducing a simple measure of confidence to quantify the goodness of the automatic diagnostic decision, regardless of decision accuracy, to emulate real life medical diagnostics. Experimental work in this theis demonstrate a strong link between this measure and accuracy rate, so that low level of confidence could raise an alarm. ::: 5. Conducting sufficiently intensive investigations of fusion models of multi-feature schemes at different level. We show that feature level fusion yields degraded performance compared to all its single components, while score level fusion results in improved results and decision level fusion of three sets of features using majority rule is slightly less successful. Using the measure of confidence is useful in resolving conflicts when two sets of features are fused at the decision level. This leads to the emergence of a Not Sure decision which is common in medical practice. Considering the Not Sure label is a good practice and an incentive to conduct more tests, rather than misclassification, which leads to significantly improved accuracy. ::: The thesis concludes with an intensive discussion on future work that would go beyond improving performance of the developed scheme to deal with the corresponding multi-class diagnostics essential for a comprehensive gynaecology Decision Support System tool as the ultimate goal.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2948084191", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207376409"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195438780"}

In this work we discuss ways of confining the ILP hypothesis space by restricting the domain theory description language. Specifically we focus on the notion of generative clauses, which enable the construction of a restricted form of Horn clause program. In fact, the use of generative logic programs as description language allows for automatic transformation of the intensional expression of a domain theory into its extensional expression, as required by many existing ILP systems.

Anticipation denotes intelligence and is an inherent property of humans that make decisions by projecting in future. Likewise, intelligent systems equipped with predictive functions may be utilized for anticipating future states of complex systems, and therefore facilitate automated control decisions. Anticipatory control of complex energy systems is paramount to their normal and safe operation. In this paper a new intelligent methodology integrating fuzzy inference with support vector regression is introduced. The proposed methodology implements an anticipatory system aiming at controlling energy systems in a robust way. Initially, a set of support vector regressors is adopted for making predictions over critical system parameters. The predicted values are used as input to a two-stage fuzzy inference system that makes decisions regarding the state of the energy system. The inference system integrates the individual predictions at its first stage, and outputs a decision together with a certainty factor computed at its second stage. The certainty factor is an index of the significance of the decision. The proposed anticipatory control system is tested on a real-world set of data obtained from a complex energy system, describing the degradation of a turbine.

We consider the bipartite graph and formalize its representation learning problem as a statistical estimation problem of parameters in a semiparametric exponential family distribution. The bipartite graph is assumed to be generated by a semiparametric exponential family distribution, whose parametric component is given by the proximity of outputs of two one-layer neural networks, while nonparametric (nuisance) component is the base measure. Neural networks take high-dimensional features as inputs and output embedding vectors. In this setting, the representation learning problem is equivalent to recovering the weight matrices. The main challenges of estimation arise from the nonlinearity of activation functions and the nonparametric nuisance component of the distribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a pseudo-likelihood objective based on the rank-order decomposition technique and focus on its local geometry. We show that the proposed objective is strongly convex in a neighborhood around the ground truth, so that a gradient descent-based method achieves linear convergence rate. Moreover, we prove that the sample complexity of the problem is linear in dimensions (up to logarithmic factors), which is consistent with parametric Gaussian models. However, our estimator is robust to any model misspecification within the exponential family, which is validated in extensive experiments.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.01013", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "mag_id": "3007969445", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211677532"}

First, the discourse segmenter, which is based on a binary classifier, identifies the elementary discourse units in a given text.

Regorafenib is approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy, and, if RAS wild-type, an anti-EGFR therapy or with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who have been previously treated with imatinib mesylate and sunitinib malate. Recently an overall survival benefit has been shown in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had previously been treated with sorafenib (RESORCE). OncoTrack is an Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) sponsored project with the goal to improve the basis for identification of biomarkers based on the mechanisms of action of therapies approved for this indication. For this purpose, a panel of CRC-PDX xenografts was generated by the OncoTrack project. At the time of the analysis reported here fifty xenografts had been treated with regorafenib at a dose of 10 mg/kg/d or with vehicle for 24 days. The analysis of tumor growth rates (TGR) showed pronounced differences between different tumors and between vehicle and regorafenib treated models. The relative antitumor activity (relative TGR) of regorafenib varied between -0,13 (good response) and 0.0 (no response). Investigations of relative TGR in relationship to (non-) clinical parameters of the primary tumor such as age, gender, sidedness and tumor histology identified a marginally significant (p= 0.04) better response in tumors from younger patients. No other correlations were detected to this end, which may be due to the small sample number. To correlate antitumor activity of regorafenib with gene expression, RNA was isolated from sections of selected vehicle and regorafenib treated xenografts and hybrized on Affymetrix HuGene-2.1_st human transcriptome arrays. Expression profiles were subsequently analyzed using the Random Forests algorithm to identify gene expression signatures predicting response to regorafenib. The best signatures did not perform better than signatures derived after randomizing responses, i.e. no predictive signature could be identified. Further studies with larger samples sizes are necessary to improve the outcome of such an approach; however one should acknowledge that to date no predictive gene signatures could be identified for multikinase inhibitors, which may be intrinsic to their complex mechanism of action.

Most of existing works focus on the recognition of emotional states using audio signals alone, visual signals alone, or both. Here we propose empirical methods for feature extraction and classifier optimization that consider the temporal aspects of audio signals and introduce our framework to efficiently recognize human emotional states from audio signals. The framework is based on the prediction of input audio clips that are described using representative low-level features. In the experiments, seven (7) discrete emotional states (anger, fear, boredom, disgust, happiness, sadness, and neutral) from EmoDB dataset, are recognized and tested based on nineteen (19) audio features (15 standalone, 4 joint) by using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

This study investigates the object-based classification of urban trees at taxonomic family level, using full-waveform airborne laser scanning data captured in the city centre of Vienna (Austria). The data set is characterised by a variety of taxa, including deciduous trees (beeches, mallows, plane trees and soapberries) and the coniferous pine species. A workflow for tree object classification is presented using geometric and radiometric features. The derived features are related to point density, crown shape and radiometric characteristics. For the derivation of crown features, a prior detection of the crown base is performed. The effects of interfering objects (e.g. fences and cars which are typical in urban areas) on the feature characteristics and the subsequent classification accuracy are investigated. The applicability of the features is evaluated by Random Forest classification and exploratory analysis. The most reliable classification is achieved by using the combination of geometric and radiometric features, resulting in 87.5% overall accuracy. By using radiometric features only, a reliable classification with accuracy of 86.3% can be achieved. The influence of interfering objects on feature characteristics is identified, in particular for the radiometric features.

For the CTC training, however, it is required to unroll (or unfold) the RNN by the length of an input sequence. This unrolling requires a lot of memory and hinders a small footprint implementation of online learning or adaptation. Furthermore, the length of training sequences is usually not uniform, which makes parallel training with multiple sequences inefficient on shared memory models such as graphics processing units (GPUs). In this work, we introduce an expectation-maximization (EM) based online CTC algorithm that enables unidirectional RNNs to learn sequences that are longer than the amount of unrolling. The RNNs can also be trained to process an infinitely long input sequence without pre-segmentation or external reset. Moreover, the proposed approach allows efficient parallel training on GPUs.

In NSA + EWMA, the object trajectories are retrieved based on the query specific distance. This work extends the previous work by developing a novel path equalization scheme for equalizing the path length of the query and the tracked object. Initially, a hybrid model based on Support Vector Regression and NSA tracks the position of the object in the video. The proposed density measure scheme equalizes the path length of the query and the object. Then, the identified path length related to the query is given to extended nearest neighbor classifier for retrieving the video.

Providing early warnings of new poultry disease outbreaks is essential in poultry breeding. With the rise of digital image processing technology and machine learning algorithms, real-time monitoring of poultry health status through cameras is an effective way to prevent large-scale outbreaks of disease. To analyze the postures of healthy and sick broilers, bird flu virus was inoculated intranasally into healthy broilers manually. The broilers were then placed in isolator cages for comparative experiments. The methods of observing the posture changes of broilers and extracting the key features are used to realize the automatic classification of healthy and sick broilers. In this research, broiler images are obtained, and two kinds of segmentation algorithms are proposed to separate the broilers from the background to obtain the outlines and skeleton information of the broilers. According to the preset feature extraction algorithm, the posture features of healthy and sick chickens are extracted, the eigenvectors are established, the postures of the broilers are analyzed by machine learning algorithms, and the diseased broilers are predicted. A series of experiments have been done. Data for each feature acquired by the algorithms are analyzed, and the effect of each feature on the recognition accuracy is obtained. Using some of the features proposed in this research, accuracy rates of 84.248%, 60.531% and 91.504% are obtained, but using all the features can yield an accuracy rate of 99.469%. Then, the recognition effects of several commonly used machine learning algorithms are compared.

The experimental results show that the algorithms proposed in this research can effectively separate broilers from the background, extract the posture information of broilers, and accurately and quickly identify the health status of broilers by means of SVM.

We add a prediction process of percolation transition in label propagation to delay the occurrence of trivial solutions, which makes small communities easier to be found.

The improvements arise from deactivating networks in the lower layer which indicate large dissimilarities between the input structure and the corresponding prototypes.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Proceedings Fachgruppentreffen Maschinelles Lernen", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "437520397", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5798849", "207056183", "36483354", "10096429", "1218527", "35689684", "198168767", "10896462", "16100016", "7037576", "54131454"], "inbound_citations": ["34422171", "18851054"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17418071"}

The experiment was carried out in Yolo County, California, which has a very diverse irrigated agricultural system dominated by economic crops. For the challenging task of classifying summer crops using Landsat Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series, two types of deep learning models were designed: one is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the other is based on one-dimensional convolutional (Conv1D) layers. Three widely-used classifiers were also tested for comparison, including a gradient boosting machine called XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Although LSTM is widely used for sequential data representation, in this study its accuracy (82.41%) and F1 score (0.67) were the lowest among all the classifiers. Among non-deep-learning classifiers, XGBoost achieved the best result with 84.17% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.69. The highest accuracy (85.54%) and F1 score (0.73) were achieved by the Conv1D-based model, which mainly consists of a stack of Conv1D layers and an inception module. The behavior of the Conv1D-based model was inspected by visualizing the activation on different layers. The model employs EVI time series by examining shapes at various scales in a hierarchical manner. Lower Conv1D layers of the optimized model capture small scale temporal variations, while upper layers focus on overall seasonal patterns. Conv1D layers were used as an embedded multi-level feature extractor in the classification model which automatically extracts features from input time series during training. The automated feature extraction reduces the dependency on manual feature engineering and pre-defined equations of crop growing cycles. This study shows that the Conv1D-based deep learning framework provides an effective and efficient method of time series representation in multi-temporal classification tasks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2018.11.032", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2903282641", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202584646", "208175971", "211535305", "209900545", "202539922", "211057499", "208247993", "202193793", "203093801", "212414434", "213887431", "202179231"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135122712"}

Griffiths (tom griffiths@berkeley.edu) Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley Berkeley CA 94720-1650 USA Abstract Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices (Raven, Raven, & Court, 1998) is one of the most prevalent assays of fluid intelligence; how- ever, most theoretical accounts of Raven\u2019s focus on producing models which can generate the correct answer but do not fit hu- man performance data. We provide a computational-level the- ory which interprets rule induction in Raven\u2019s as Bayesian in- ference. The model computes the posterior probability of each rule in the set of possible rule hypotheses based on whether those rules could have generated the features of the objects in the matrix and the prior probability of each rule. Based on fits to both correct and incorrect response options across both the Standard and Advanced Progressive Matrices, we propose sev- eral novel mechanisms that may drive responding to Raven\u2019s items. Keywords: Rule induction, Bayesian inference, Raven\u2019s Pro- gressive Matrices Introduction Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices (Raven et al., 1998; Raven\u2019s from here on) is one of the most widely used assays of fluid intelligence, and much attention has focused on the under- lying elemental cognitive processes. Raven\u2019s has arguably gathered more attention in the cognitive literature than any other psychometric measure of fluid intelligence, largely be- cause it is an induction task par excellence that can be mod- eled computationally (see e.g., Carpenter, Just, & Shell, 1990; Verguts, De Boeck, & Maris, 2000). For example, Carpenter et al. (1990) presented a production-system model of Raven\u2019s to support a two-factor theory of Raven\u2019s with working mem- ory capacity (WMC) as the first factor and a second factor related to the ability to abstract relations. This latter ability has been associated with several attributes including rule gen- eration speed (Verguts & De Boeck, 2002), inference speed (Rasmussen & Eliasmith, 2011), and analogical comparison (Lovett, Forbus, & Usher, 2010; McGreggor, Kunda, & Goel, These extant models of Raven\u2019s have focused on cognitive processes and mechanisms that underlie the inference of rules from the objects in the matrix. Further insight can be gained by exploring a computational-level analysis (Marr, 1982). As performance in Raven\u2019s relies primarily on rule induction, the task is conducive to instantiation within a Bayesian frame- work. For instance, Bayesian models of rule induction have been successfully applied to similar tasks, such as numerical sequence prediction (i.e., which number follows in the se- quence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11?; Austerweil & Griffiths, 2011) and rule-based categorization (Goodman, Tenenbaum, Feldman, & Griffiths, 2008). Examining Raven\u2019s within the context of a Bayesian model allows exploration of questions about what people\u2019s priors (or in non-Bayesian terms, inductive bi- ases) might be like for rules of the variety used in the Raven\u2019s test. Finally, the Bayesian formalism provides an extensible framework for using standard extensions to Bayesian models to capture other, more process-based interpretations of fac- tors known to be relevant to performance on Raven\u2019s, such as memory and learning. Here we present a Bayesian model of Raven\u2019s which in- terprets rule induction as Bayesian inference in which a set of rules with some prior probability are evaluated based on their ability to have plausibly generated the features of the items shown in the matrix. Rules are then sampled based on their posterior probability and Bayesian model averaging is used to predict which answers are most likely given the pos- terior distribution. Unlike extant models, which examine how successful the model is at predicting correct responses (e.g., Carpenter et al., 1990; Lovett et al., 2010; McGreggor et al., 2010), our model also makes predictions about the proportion of responses involving the various incorrect options. Bayesian Model of Raven\u2019s Solving a Raven\u2019s problem can be conceptualized as a three- stage process involving feature extraction, rule-inference and prediction. 1 As illustrated in Figure 1, Raven\u2019s items have the following composition: O 11 O 21 O 31 O 12 O 22 O 32 O 13 O 23 where O i j is the object in the i th row and j th column. As- suming the features of each object are extracted successfully, 1 In the present model, we follow Carpenter et al. (1990) by hand- coding the features of the items. Several methods for extracting the features of Raven\u2019s items have been proposed (Lovett et al., 2010; McGreggor et al., 2010; Rasmussen & Eliasmith, 2011).", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CogSci", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2401462633", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["590342", "8883911", "144835380", "8662046", "122970610", "6957154", "9768803", "2601595", "15126236", "143601466", "776855", "5839957", "13990311", "18929495"], "inbound_citations": ["202786068", "15654769", "19186777", "205469133", "13897898", "202770171", "211132742", "71148268"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:92136"}

To optimally make use of the valuable porosity data, a semi-supervised machine learning method was proposed, Transductive Conditional Random Field Regression (TCRFR), showing good performance (Gornitz et al., 2017). TCRFR, however, still requires more labeled data than those usually available, which creates a gap when applying the method to the porosity estimation problem in realistic situations. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by introducing two graph-based preprocessing techniques, which adapt the original TCRFR for extremely weakly supervised scenarios. Our new method outperforms the previous automatic estimation methods on synthetic data and provides a comparable result to the manual labored, time-consuming geostatistics approach on real data, proving its potential as a practical industrial tool.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cageo.2017.05.004", "venue": "Comput.

Good generalization capability, fast learling speed, simple architechture and the direct connection between input and output nodes along with non linear enhancement nodes with random weights of traditional Random Vector Functional Link Network (RVFLN) are very essential to industrial applications. To avoid the selection of the number of hidden nodes and hidden mapping function, kernal function has been used in this paper to increase the stability. The input is extended using trigonometric expansion which increases the accuracy of the algorithm when ever there is a sudden randon change. In case of KERVFLN the number of enhencement nodes and its corresponding activation function need not to be known if its corresponding kernel function is given. To verify the accuracy of the proposed model, some benchmark Monte Carlo simulations and one SISO system are carried out through simulation study and the obtained results are compared with some established techniques such as original RVFLN, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Least Mean Square (LMS).

We observe that if backgrounds in the training and testing datasets are very different, it dramatically introduces difficulties to extract robust pedestrian features, and thus compromises the cross-domain person re-ID performance. In this paper, we formulate such problems as a background shift problem. A Suppression of Background Shift Generative Adversarial Network (SBSGAN) is proposed to generate images with suppressed backgrounds. Unlike simply removing backgrounds using binary masks, SBSGAN allows the generator to decide whether pixels should be preserved or suppressed to reduce segmentation errors caused by noisy foreground masks. Additionally, we take ID-related cues, such as vehicles and companions into consideration. With high-quality generated images, a Densely Associated 2-Stream (DA-2S) network is introduced with Inter Stream Densely Connection (ISDC) modules to strengthen the complementarity of the generated data and ID-related cues.

To investigate the effect of the different data selection methods, three models are adopted: Logistic regression model, Neural Networks (NNET), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), which have recently gained some popularity in the applications. A Monte Carlo simulation study and an empirical analysis on an updated bankruptcy database are conducted to explore the effect of different data sample selection methods. By comparing the out-of-sample predictive performances, we conclude that if forecasting the probability of bankruptcy is of interest, complete data sampling technique provides more accurate results. However, if a binary bankruptcy decision or classification is desired, choice based sampling technique may still be suitable. In particular, choice-based data samples validated by NNET and SVM can capture more correct predictions of bankruptcy observations, and provide lower asymmetric misclassification rate. In addition, for different choice-based data samples, it is essential to adjust the cut-off probability. An appropriate choice of cut-off probability depends on the specification of the cost ratio between the Type I error and Type II error.

In this paper, we present a method to find and select texture features of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) detected by computed tomography (CT) and evaluate the performance of support vector machine (SVM)-based classifiers in differentiating benign from malignant SPNs. Seventy-seven biopsy-confirmed CT cases of SPNs were included in this study. A total of 67 features were extracted by a feature extraction procedure, and around 25 features were finally selected after 300 genetic generations. We constructed the SVM-based classifier with the selected features and evaluated the performance of the classifier by comparing the classification results of the SVM-based classifier with six senior radiologists\u2032 observations. The evaluation results not only showed that most of the selected features are characteristics frequently considered by radiologists and used in CAD analyses previously reported in classifying SPNs, but also indicated that some newly found features have important contribution in differentiating benign from malignant SPNs in SVM-based feature space.

Then, monthly time series of BOD index was used in Karun River in Mollasani station and also, covariates like Dissolved Oxygen (DO), monthly temperature, and river flow were used from 2002 to 2014. The results indicated that the SVR model with RMSE = 0.0338 mg/l and R2 = 0.843 has better performance than the ANFIS model with R2 = 0.828. Also, applying the wavelet transform on input data of the SVR model improved the results to R2 = 0.937 and RMSE = 0.0210 mg/l. Therefore, combining the SVR with the wavelet transform (WSVR) was a good idea to improve the prediction of the BOD value in Karun River. Finally, the combination was recognized as a suitable method and the BOD was predicted in six months.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecohyd.2017.02.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecohydrology and Hydrobiology", "mag_id": "2594837422", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["47006243", "209900572", "134139650", "201982220"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:89719858"}

Complications arise when data used to train the models have been collected in stratified designs that involve different sampling intensity per stratum. The modeling process is further complicated if some of the target species are relatively rare on the landscape leading to an unbalanced number of presences and absences in the training data. We explored means to accommodate unequal sampling intensity across strata as well as the unbalanced species prevalence in Random Forest models for tree and shrub species distributions in the state of Nevada. For the unequal sampling intensity issue, we tested three modeling strategies: fitting models using all the data, down-sampling the intensified stratum; and building separate models for each stratum. We explored unbalanced species prevalence by investigating the effects of down-sampling the more prevalent response (presence or absence), and by optimizing the cutoff thresholds for declaring a species present. When modeling species presence with stratified data that was collected with different sampling intensities per stratum, we found that neither down-sampling the intensified stratum, nor fitting individual strata models, improved model performance.

However, the confusing appearance of some normal tissues that visually look like masses results in a large proportion of marked ROIs with normal tissues. This paper copes with this problem and proposes a framework to reduce false positive masses detected by CAD. Methods To avoid the error induced by the segmentation step, we proposed a segmentation-free framework with particular attention to improve feature extraction and classification steps. We investigated for the first time in mammogram analysis, Hilbert\u2019s image representation, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov distance and maximum subregion descriptors. Then, a feature selection step is performed to select the most discriminative features. Moreover, we considered several classifiers such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree to distinguish between normal tissues and masses. Our experiments were carried out on a large dataset of 10168 ROIs (8254 normal tissues and 1914 masses) constructed from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). To simulate practical scenario, our normal regions are false positives asserted by a CAD system from healthy cases. Results The combination of all the descriptors yields better results than each feature set used alone, and the difference is statistically significant. Besides, the feature selection steps yields a statistically significant increase in the accuracy values for the three classifiers. Finally, the random forest achieves the highest accuracy (81.09%), outperforming the SVM classifier (80.01%)) and decision tree (79.12%), but the difference is not statistically significant. Conclusions The accuracy of discrimination between normal and abnormal ROIs in mammograms obtained with the proposed gray level texture features sets are encouraging and comparable to these obtained with multiresolution features. Combination of several features as well as feature selection steps improve the results. To improve false positives reduction in CAD systems for breast cancer diagnosis, these features could be combined with multiresolution features.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29728249", "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.03.026", "venue": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "mag_id": "2795244616", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201646061", "213196502", "199488941", "52973670"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19203650"}

Accurate vessel re-identification improves onshore closed-circuit television monitoring in a vessel traffic services system as well as onboard surveillance of surrounding vessels.

We describe a marine vessel-re-identification framework, Global-and-Local Fusion-based Multi-view Feature Learning (GLF-MVFL), which is based on a combination of global and fine-grained local features. GLF-MVFL combines cross-entropy loss with our newly-developed orientation-guided quintuplet loss. We exploit intrinsic features of marine vessels to optimize multi-view representation learning for re-identification. GLF-MVFL uses ResNet-50 as the backbone network to extract features for simultaneous quintuple input. It detects and discriminates between features and estimates viewpoints to form a comprehensive re-identification framework. We created an annotated large-scale vessel retrieval dataset, VesselID-539, which contains images from viewpoints similar to those of an autonomous surface vessel, to use in evaluating the performance of the model.

The goal is to automatically classify lung cancer patients into groups based on clinically measurable disease-specific variables in order to estimate survival. Variables selected as inputs for machine learning include Number of Primaries, Age, Grade, Tumor Size, Stage, and TNM, which are numeric or can readily be converted to numeric type. Minimal up-front processing of the data enables exploring the out-of-the-box capabilities of established unsupervised learning techniques, with little human intervention through the entire process. The output of the techniques is used to predict survival time, with the efficacy of the prediction representing a proxy for the usefulness of the classification. A basic single variable linear regression against each unsupervised output is applied, and the associated Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value is calculated as a metric to compare between the outputs. The results show that self-ordering maps exhibit the best performance, while k-Means performs the best of the simpler classification techniques. Predicting against the full data set, it is found that their respective RMSE values (15.591 for self-ordering maps and 16.193 for k-Means) are comparable to supervised regression techniques, such as Gradient Boosting Machine (RMSE of 15.048).

We used the active learning method with an integrated feature selection to train the Support Vector Machine algorithm. We wanted to study the effect of different types of features on the classification accuracy of the model generated by the classifier algorithm. We considered mainly three different types of features for 5 runs submitted. Feature types include bag-of-words features, seed-words as features and statistical features. Bag-ofwords features are generated from the actual blog data. Seed-words were manually generated specific to the domain of interest. Statistical features studied included the ratio of linguistic features to total number of words. We built models using an iterative process and studied accuracy as well as coverage of each model. Study of different features is important in order to build a better model. Feature selection algorithms can choose the best features among the available ones but different features have costs associated with them. We need features that not only predict class labels or contribute towards prediction but the feature should also be representative of the entire dataset, especially test data. Training the classifier on such features will yield better coverage and training accuracy for the model. We compared the three different models generated by three different feature generation strategies. Our preliminary results indicate that seed-words that are specific to a particular domain or particular type of classification achieve better accuracy and coverage. In general, bag-of-words features are tightly coupled with the data they represent. On the other hand, statistical features are independent of the actual words used. Statistical features are more useful in building robust models that can be used with different languages and for different tasks.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "TREC", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "144526751", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["961425", "2824061"], "inbound_citations": ["7025829", "67012399", "7370139", "12202858"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19024982"}

We realize that the Lp-SVMs do not comprehensively consider irrelevant and redundant features, because the Lp-SVMs consider all n full-set features be important for training while skipping other 2n\u22121 possible feature subsets at the same time. In previous work, we have studied the L1-norm SVM and applied it to the feature selection problem. In this paper, we extend our research to the L2-norm SVM and propose to generalize the Lp-SVMs into one general Lp-norm Support Vector Machine (GLp-SVM) that takes into account all 2n possible feature subsets. We represent the GLp-SVM as a mixed 0-1 nonlinear programming problem (M01NLP). We prove that solving the new proposed M01NLP optimization problem results in a smaller error penalty and enlarges the margin between two support vector hyper-planes, thus possibly giving a better generalization capability of SVMs than solving the traditional Lp-SVMs. Moreover, by following the new formulation we can easily control the sparsity of the GLp-SVM by adding a linear constraint to the proposed M01NLP optimization problem. In order to reduce the computational complexity of directly solving the M01NLP problem, we propose to equivalently transform it into a mixed 0-1 linear programming (M01LP) problem if p=1 or into a mixed 0-1 quadratic programming (M01QP) problem if p=2. The M01LP and M01QP problems are then solved by using the branch and bound algorithm.

The current efforts point to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based models due they synthesize new quite realistic samples across different domains by learning critical features from their latent spaces. Nonetheless, domain exploration is not explicit supervision; thereby most GANs based models do not achieve to learn the key features. In consequence, the correspondence function overfits and fails in reverse or loses translation quality. In this paper, we propose a guided learning model through manifold bi-directional translation loops between the source and the target domains considering the Wasserstein distance between their probability distributions. The bi-directional translation is CycleGAN-based but considering the latent space Z as an intermediate domain which guides the learning process and reduces the inducted error from loops.

The current climate\u2013canopy cover relationship was quantified using Random Forest modelling, and the future climate projections were provided by three dynamically downscaled general circulation model (GCM) simulations. Three GCMs were used to show a range of projections for the selected scenario. We also explored the sensitivity of key endemic and non-endemic Tasmanian eucalypts to climate change. All GCMs suggested that canopy cover should remain stable (proportional cover change <10 %) across ~70 % of the Tasmanian eucalypt forests. However, there were geographic areas where all models projected a decline in canopy cover due to increased summer temperatures and lower precipitation, and in addition, all models projected an increase in canopy cover in the coldest part of the state. The model projections differed substantially for other areas.

The proxy model is made to model the history match objective function (mismatch values) based on the history data of the field. This model is then used to minimize the objective function through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA). In automatic history matching, sensitive analysis is often performed on full simulation model. In this work, to get new range of the uncertain parameters (matching parameters) in which the objective function has a minimum value, sensitivity analysis is also performed on the proxy model. By applying the modified ranges to the optimization methods, optimization of the objective function will be faster and outputs of the optimization methods (matching parameters) are produced in less time and with high precision. This procedure leads to matching of history of the field in which a set of reservoir parameters is used. The final sets of parameters are then applied for the full simulation model to validate the technique. The obtained results show that the present procedure in this work is effective for history matching process due to its robust dependability and fast convergence speed. Due to high speed and need for small data sets, LSSVM is the best tool to build a proxy model. Also the comparison of PSO and ICA shows that PSO is less time-consuming and more effective.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.petlm.2016.09.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Petroleum", "mag_id": "2519728484", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199512240"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114145498"}

Our framework based on transfer learning and active learning techniques is effective within a competitive range of accuracy, i.e., $3 \\times -10 \\times $ reduction on the amount of training data with comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art learning approach.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1807.03257", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCAD.2018.2864251", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2964309037,2951442449,2842482802", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["110706379", "9409523", "125910357", "46882985", "121432778", "124010821", "2391599", "4786807", "125990844", "125119222", "67719120", "206577025", "3285425", "41024679", "51877720", "16723563", "121586832", "120508309", "124735272", "46893299", "120959297", "5324838", "11536130", "15350923", "740063", "3383786", "14404795", "84591", "15830134", "9098359", "1805990", "15620846", "13811483", "206594692", "206457500", "5575601", "14368997", "1782131", "10659969", "6628106", "174793748"], "inbound_citations": ["214590528", "147702781", "58027709", "150368626", "59233695", "160019094"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49650875"}

This electrocardiogram is employed as a crucial source to gather the diagnostic information of a patient's cardiopathy. The monitoring function of cardiac disease is diagnosed by documenting and handling the electrocardiogram (ECG) impulses. In the recent years many research has been done and developing an enhanced method to identify the risk in the patient's body condition by processing and analysing the ECG signal. This analysis of the signal helps to find the cardiac abnormalities, arrhythmias, and many other heart problems. ECG signal is processed to detect the variability in heart rhythm; heart rate variability is calculated based on the time interval between heart beats. Heart Rate Variability HRV is measured by the variation in the beat to beat interval. The Heart rate Variability (HRV) is an essential aspect to diagnose the properties of the heart. Recent development enhances the potential with the aid of non-linear metrics in reference point with feature selection. In this paper, the fundamental elements are taken from the ECG signal for feature selection process where Bat algorithm is employed for feature selection to predict the best feature and presented to the classifier for accurate classification. The popular machine learning algorithm ELM is taken for classification, integrated with evolutionary algorithm named Self- Adaptive Differential Evolution Extreme Learning Machine SADEELM to improve the reliability of classification.
