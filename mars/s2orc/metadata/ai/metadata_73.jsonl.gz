The basic idea is to find a hyperplane which separates the d-dimensional data perfectly into its two classes. However, since example data is often not linearly separable, SVM\u2019s introduce the notion of a \u201ckernel induced feature space\u201d which casts the data into a higher dimensional space where the data is separable. Typically, casting into such a space would cause problems computationally, and with overfitting. The key insight used in SVM\u2019s is that the higher-dimensional space doesn\u2019t need to be dealt with directly (as it turns out, only the formula for the dot-product in that space is needed), which eliminates the above concerns. Furthermore, the VC-dimension (a measure of a system\u2019s likelihood to perform well on unseen data) of SVM\u2019s can be explicitly calculated, unlike other learning methods like neural networks, for which there is no measure. Overall, SVM\u2019s are intuitive, theoretically wellfounded, and have shown to be practically successful. SVM\u2019s have also been extended to solve regression tasks (where the system is trained to output a numerical value, rather than \u201cyes/no\u201d classification).", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "137193333", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207165665", "117915688", "2845602", "5667586", "2427083", "118035271", "14393104", "1536643", "80868", "7138354", "206787478"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18986102"}

Primary tooth enamel and dentin from girls with TS were analysed and compared with the enamel and dentin of primary teeth from healthy girls. Qualitative and quantitative changes in the composition of TS enamel were found, in addition to morphological differences. Higher frequencies of subsurface lesions and rod-free zones were seen in TS enamel using polarized light microscopy.

Using X-ray microanalysis, high levels of calcium and phosphorus, and low levels of carbon, were found in both TS enamel and dentin. Using microradiography, a lower degree of mineralization was found in TS enamel. Rule induction analysis was performed to identify characteristic element patterns for TS.

The novel RBAIL algorithm performs regression on the vital parameters such as Heart Rate, Blood Pressure and Saturated Oxygen Level to predict the abnormality.

To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct objective and subjective evaluations.

The aim of this work is to transparently present an adjustable physical activity classification algorithm that discriminates between dynamic, standing, and sedentary behavior. By means of easily adjustable parameters, the algorithm performance can be optimized for applications using different target populations and locations for tracker wear. Concerning an elderly target population with a tracker worn on the upper leg, the algorithm is optimized and validated under simulated free-living conditions. The fixed activity protocol (FAP) is performed by 20 participants; the simulated free-living protocol (SFP) involves another 20. Data segmentation window size and amount of physical activity threshold are optimized. The sensor orientation threshold does not vary. The validation of the algorithm is performed on 10 participants who perform the FAP and on 10 participants who perform the SFP. Percentage error (PE) and absolute percentage error (APE) are used to assess the algorithm performance. Standing and sedentary behavior are classified within acceptable limits (\u00b110% error) both under fixed and simulated free-living conditions. Dynamic behavior is within acceptable limits under fixed conditions but has some limitations under simulated free-living conditions.

A review of previous studies demonstrates that Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks and hybrid techniques show promise for suitable temporal PM10 prediction. A review of the spatial predictions of PM10 shows that the LUR (Land Use Regression) approach has been successfully utilized for spatial prediction of PM10 in urban areas. Of the six introduced approaches for spatio-temporal prediction of PM10, only one approach is suitable for high-resolved prediction (Spatial resolution < 100 m; Temporal resolution \u2264 24 h).

Unfortunately, in order to handle the non-convexity induced by ramp loss in RSVM, existing RSVM solvers often adopt the DC programming framework which is computationally inefficient for running multiple outer loops. This hinders the application of RSVM to large-scale problems. Safe sample screening that allows for the exclusion of training samples prior to or early in the training process is an effective method to greatly reduce computational time. However, existing safe sample screening algorithms are limited to convex optimization problems while RSVM is a non-convex problem. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose two safe sample screening rules for RSVM based on the framework of concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Specifically, we provide screening rule for the inner solver of CCCP and another rule for propagating screened samples between two successive solvers of CCCP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of safe sample screening to a non-convex optimization problem. More importantly, we provide the security guarantee to our sample screening rules to RSVM.

The algorithm uses SVR to construct the nonlinear mapping relation between received signal strength indication (RSSI) and distance between the tags and the readers. Based on nonlinear mapping relation, the nonlinear equation set is constructed. In addition, through applying PSO to optimize the objective function converted by nonlinear equation set, the coordinate position of target tag can be estimated. Finally, the simulation of this algorithm and some other algorithms is conducted. The experimental results show that SVR-PSO algorithm is more efficient than the previous algorithms in terms of positioning accuracy and positioning stability.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/VTCFall.2018.8690994", "venue": "2018 IEEE 88th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)", "journal": "2018 IEEE 88th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2936122274", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["112313598", "23400710", "29770886", "24030341", "29961571", "9177878", "1659595", "38771597", "32225464"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117729320"}

In this paper, we present a novel transfer learning framework called TPTSVM (Transfer Progressive Transductive Support Vector Machine), which combines transfer learning and semi-supervised learning. TPTSVM makes use of the limited labeled data in target domain to leverage a large amount of labeled data in source domain and queries the most confident instances in target domain.

Moreover, the so-called attention technique has been adopted in neural networks learning, aiming at considering alignments between different parts of the source training data. This article proposes the model Move, Attend and Predict (MAP) to predict a person\u2019s future location based on his/her mobility pattern collected by a mobile device. This is achieved by means of a computationally efficient trainable deep neural network model. Our model essentially learns which time interval in the trajectory sequences are relevant regarding a specific location. In order to extract the meaningful representation from trajectories and time sequences, the embedding representation learning technique is used.

Directly using raw cortical thickness measures as features with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for clinical group classification only yields modest results since brain areas are not equally atrophied during AD progression. Therefore, feature reduction is generally required to retain only the most relevant features for the final classification. In this paper, a spherical sparse coding and dictionary learning method is proposed and it achieves relatively high classification results on publicly available data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 2 dataset (N = 201) which contains structural MRI data of four clinical groups: cognitive unimpaired (CU), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), later MCI (LMCI) and AD. The proposed framework takes the estimated cortical thickness and the spherical parameterization computed by FreeSurfer as inputs and constructs weighted patches in the spherical parameter domain of the cortical surface. Then sparse coding is applied to the resulting surface patch features, followed by max-pooling to extract the final feature sets. Finally, SVM is employed for binary group classifications.

Neurofuzzy ia a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, namely neural network and fuzzy logic. Neural networks were originally developed to mimic human information processing, learning and decision making. The name neural network arises from the fact that the human brain can be viewed as networks of interconnected neurons or information processing units. On the other hand, fuzzy logic is introduced to deal with a problem by providing the systematic calculus that can make the information linguistically but lacks of adaptability to deal with changing external environments. Diabetes is a chronic condition associated with abnormally high levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. The classification of diabetes woman with history of pregnancy is important in determining the most appropriate form of treatment for these patients and the early detection of diabetes is important because the diabetes disease can cause serious health complications like heart disease, blindness and kidney failure. The purpose of this study is to develop of neurofuzzy system prototype system will classify whether the woman having diabetes, suspected to have diabetes or does not have diabetes. The development of the prototype system involves four phases of system development. The first phase is fuzzification in order to fuzzily the real data. The second phase, concentrates on the development of neural network engine using backpropagation for network training and testing. The third phase is defuzzification in order to convert the fuzzy output to real data. The final phase is to develop a web based classifying system for classification on new patient's data. The system has been developed using Microsoft's Visual Basic and Coldfusion 4.5. The data used to train and test the network was obtained from well-known repository that is UCI repository. The combination of neural network with fuzzy technique or neurofuzzy obtains 96.1% from the best network model. However, only 88.31% of classifying accurary was obtained when the neural network model was used. The finding indicates that the combination of fuzzy process with neural model increase the performance of the net.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "98898291", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107690175"}

The learning hypothesis is plausible because chil- dren\u2019s di\ufb00erential categorizations of animates, objects and substances emerge only after they have learned some number of names for these di\ufb00erent kinds (Samuelson & Smith 1999), The present paper provides a simulation model of how this might be learned. Abstract Past research on children\u2019s categorizations has suggested that children use perceptual and conceptual knowledge to generalize object names. Especially, some researches suggested that the relation between ontological cate- gories and linguistic categories is a critical cue to cate- gorize objects. However, this mechanism has not been specified. This paper reports new insights to reveal chil- dren\u2019s categorizations based on the survey of adults\u2019 knowledge. We estimated the English and Japanese on- tological spaces from data and used these results to sim- ulate behavioral experiment of previous research. The results show a possibility that linguistic cues help chil- dren to attend specific perceptual properties. Linguistic categories and ontological categories The fact that children distinguish animal, object, and substance categories in noun learning is also interesting because these ontological categories are often related to linguistic individuation, to how di\ufb00erent languages quan- tify nouns. Most of the world\u2019s languages treat animates as countable discrete things. Others, like English, also treat inanimate objects as discrete and countable. Few (if any languages) individuate substances in these ways. (Lucy, 1992) Some have suggested a deep relation between onto- logical categories and their learning how their language quanti\ufb01es entities. For example, Quine (1960) hypothe- sized that children learning English learn to distinguish objects and substances by learning the count-mass dis- tinction. In English, nouns such as \u201cdog\u201d and \u201ccup\u201d that label individuated things are count nouns and mandato- rily take the plural if there are more than one instance; in contrast, nouns such as \u201csand\u201d that label a substance are mass nouns and are not pluralized. Thus this lin- guistic distinction could teach children that there are two di\ufb00erent kinds of categories. Soja, Carey and Spelke (1991) criticized this idea, be- cause their experiments indicated that 2-year-old chil- dren who do not use count-mass syntax nonetheless clas- sify objects by shape and substances by material. Imai & Gentner (1997) reported supporting results in a study comparing English and Japanese speakers. Japanese makes no distinction comparable to the count-mass dis- tinction in its quanti\ufb01cation system. Yet Imai and Gen- tner found that both Japanese- and English-speaking children categorized objects by shape and substances by material. Introduction Categorization is a form of information compression, one solution to handle an almost in\ufb01nite number of entities e\ufb03ciently. Where do these categories come from and how do children know which words to map to which cat- egories? Quine (1960) pointed to the di\ufb03culty of word learn- ing without prior category knowledge. If we hear a novel word in an unknown language, how do we infer its mean- ing ? For example, suppose we heard \u2018gavagai\u2019 while looking at a rabbit in a \ufb01eld. \u2018Gavagai\u2019 might mean rab- bit, but it could also mean rabbit\u2019s color or an in\ufb01nite variety of other possibilities. By Quine\u2019s analysis, word learning should be highly problematic for \ufb01rst language learners. Constraints to acquire word meanings Markman & Hutchinson (1984) among others proposed that children learn nouns easily because they do have prior knowledge about kinds of categories. Research over the past 20 years has indicated that this knowl- edge is considerable. Children know, for example, that animal categories are organized by multiple similarities, that artifact categories are organized by shape, and that substance categories are organized by material. Given a single thing of each of these kinds and told its name, children systematically generalize that name to new in- stances in ways speci\ufb01c to the kind of thing it is (Landau, Smith & Jones, 1988; Soja, Carey & Spelke, 1991, etc.) One hypothesis is that this knowledge is learned, that as children learn common nouns, they learn the correla- tions between properties speci\ufb01c to di\ufb00erent kinds and the similarities relevant to categorizing those kinds - that A boundary shift Imai and Genter also found dif- ferences in the range of things treated as objects versus substances by speakers of the two languages.

This is due to new forms of mutual information analysis that have been proven to be more suitable to highlight direct coupling between pairs of residues in protein structures and to the large number of protein chains that are currently available for statistical validation. It was previously discussed that disulfide bond topology in proteins is also constrained by correlated mutations.ResultsIn this paper we exploit information derived from a corrected mutual information analysis and from the inverse of the covariance matrix to address the problem of the prediction of the topology of disulfide bonds in Eukaryotes. Recently, we have shown that Support Vector Regression (SVR) can improve the prediction for the disulfide connectivity patterns. Here we show that the inclusion of the correlated mutation information increases of 5 percentage points the SVR performance (from 54% to 59%). When this approach is used in combination with a method previously developed by us and scoring at the state of art in predicting both location and topology of disulfide bonds in Eukaryotes (DisLocate), the per-protein accuracy is 38%, 2 percentage points higher than that previously obtained.ConclusionsIn this paper we show that the inclusion of information derived from correlated mutations can improve the performance of the state of the art methods for predicting disulfide connectivity patterns in Eukaryotic proteins.

Yet, no automated segmentation method is readily and widely used, especially in patients with extensive WMH where lesions are close to the cerebral cortex. BIANCA (Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm) is a new fully automated, supervised method for WMH segmentation. In this study, we optimized and compared BIANCA against a reference method with manual editing in a cohort of patients with extensive WMH. This was achieved in two datasets: a clinical protocol with 90 patients having 2-dimensional FLAIR and an advanced protocol with 66 patients having 3-dimensional FLAIR. We first determined simultaneously which input modalities (FLAIR alone or FLAIR + T1) and which training sets were better compared to the reference. Three strategies for the selection of the threshold that is applied to the probabilistic output of BIANCA were then evaluated: chosen at the group level, based on Fazekas score or determined individually. Accuracy of the segmentation was assessed through measures of spatial agreement and volumetric correspondence with respect to reference segmentation. Based on all our tests, we identified multimodal inputs (FLAIR + T1), mixed WMH load training set and individual threshold selection as the best conditions to automatically segment WMH in our cohort. A median Dice similarity index of 0.80 (0.80) and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.97 (0.98) were obtained for the clinical (advanced) protocol. However, Bland-Altman plots identified a difference with the reference method that was linearly related to the total burden of WMH.

Machine learning classifiers have been utilized to assist the development of neuroimaging-based biomarkers for objective diagnosis of ADHD. However, the existing basic model-based studies in ADHD reported suboptimal classification performances and inconclusive results, mainly due to the limited flexibility for each type of basic classifiers to appropriately handle multi-dimensional source features with various properties. In this study, we proposed to apply ensemble learning techniques (ELTs) in multimodal neuroimaging data collected from 72 young adults, including 36 probands (18 remitters and 18 persisters of childhood ADHD) and 36 group-matched controls. All the currently available optimization strategies for ELTs (i.e., voting, bagging, boosting and stacking techniques) were tested in a pool of semi-final classification results generated by seven basic classifiers. The high-dimensional neuroimaging features for classification included regional cortical gray matter (GM) thickness and surface area, GM volume of subcortical structures, volume and fractional anisotropy of major white matter fiber tracts, pair-wise regional connectivity and global/nodal topological properties of the functional brain network for cue-evoked attention process. As a result, the bagging-based ELT with the base model of support vector machine achieved the best results, with the most significant improvement of the area under the receiver of operating characteristic curve (0.89 for ADHD vs. controls, and 0.9 for ADHD persisters vs. remitters). We found that features of nodal efficiency in right inferior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal (MFG)-inferior parietal (IPL) functional connectivity, and right amygdala volume significantly contributed to accurate discrimination between ADHD probands and controls; higher nodal efficiency of right MFG greatly contributed to inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptom remission, while higher right MFG-IPL functional connectivity strongly linked to symptom persistence in adults with childhood ADHD.

Following the Sago mine disaster in January 2006, federal legislation (The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response {MINER} Act of 2006) tightened regulations and sought to strengthen the authority and safety inspection practices of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). While penalties and inspection frequency have increased, understanding of what types of inspection findings are most indicative of serious future incidents is limited. The most effective safety management and oversight could be accomplished by a thorough understanding of what types of infractions or safety inspection findings are most indicative of serious future personnel injuries. However, given the large number of potentially different and unique inspection findings, varied mine characteristics, and types of specific safety incidents, this question is complex in terms of the large number of potentially relevant input parameters. New regulations rely on increasing the frequency and severity of infraction penalties to encourage mining operations to improve worker safety, but without the knowledge of which specific infractions may truly be signaling a dangerous work environment. This paper seeks to inform the question, what types of inspection findings are most indicative of serious future incidents for specific types of mining operations? This analysis utilizes publicly available MSHA databases of cited infractions and reportable incidents. These inspection results are used to train machine learning Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest (RF) models that divide the groups of mines into peer groups based on their recent infractions and other defining characteristics with the aim of predicting whether or not a fatal or serious disabling injury is more likely to occur in the following 12-month period. With these characteristics available, additional scrutiny may be appropriately directed at those mining operations at greatest risk of experiencing a worker fatality or disabling injury in the near future. Increased oversight and attention on these mines where workers are at greatest risk may more effectively reduce the likelihood of worker deaths and injuries than increased penalties and inspection frequency alone.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/1.4032929", "venue": null, "journal": "ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems, Part B: Mechanical Engineering", "mag_id": "2293319279", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208829229"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:112510366"}

Speaker adaptation is an important technique to build a robust acoustic model. For a zero-resource language, however, conventional model-dependent speaker adaptation methods such as constrained maximum likelihood linear regression are insufficient because the acoustic model of the target language is not accessible. Therefore, we introduce a model-independent feature extraction based on a neural network. Specifically, we introduce a multi-task learning to a bottleneck feature-based approach to make bottleneck feature invariant to a change of speakers. The proposed network simultaneously tackles two tasks: phoneme and speaker classifications. This network trains a feature extractor in an adversarial manner to allow it to map input data into a discriminative representation to predict phonemes, whereas it is difficult to predict speakers. We conduct phone discriminant experiments in Zero Resource Speech Challenge 2017.

In this paper, we show how accurate and ubiquitous tracking of a pedestrian can be performed using only the inertial sensors embedded in his/her mobile phone. Our work depends on performing dead reckoning to track the user's movement. The main challenge that needs to be addressed is handling the noise of the low cost low quality inertial sensors in cell phones. Our proposed system combines two novel contributions: a novel step count estimation technique and a gait-based accurate variable step size detection algorithm. The step count estimation technique is based on a lightweight finite state machine approach that leverages orientation-independent features. In order to capture the varying stride length of the user, based on his changing gait, we employ a multi-class hierarchical Support Vector Machine classifier. Combining the estimated number of steps with the an accurate estimate of the individual stride length, we achieve ubiquitous and accurate tracking of a person in indoor environments. We implement our system on different Android-based phones and compare it to the state-of-the-art techniques in indoor and outdoor testbeds with arbitrary phone orientation. Our results in two different testbeds show that we can provide an accurate step count estimation with an error of 5.72%. In addition, our gait type classifier has an accuracy of 97.74%. This leads to a combined tracking error of 6.9% while depending only on the inertial sensors and turning off the GPS sensor completely. This highlights the ability of the system to provide ubiquitous, accurate, and energy efficient tracking.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214359", "venue": "2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)", "journal": "2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1993248935", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2861496", "1894555", "10695957", "14082174", "14523441", "14082174", "42179506", "1666517", "16746422", "8043383"], "inbound_citations": ["4011449", "33198174", "3494790", "51920526", "67869536", "9929537", "3270730", "85464288", "3299751", "11738741", "40294447", "14293037", "1610111", "57764167", "43246346", "53032806", "3447624", "3328858", "8410358", "207195806", "34746232", "8618631", "10261552", "43055228", "59606177", "14041819", "210693118", "8723945", "1917803", "202159106", "34652649", "45086524", "211048295", "67857495", "18804368", "21510071", "7821448", "13740738", "195068870", "16456187", "4335461", "8292689", "41223526", "23970271", "13975299", "3646086", "151596766", "46857039", "54456277", "10890423", "818406", "67874873", "43629340", "5960608", "15831538", "21420930", "18140784", "4768189", "4710119", "36377345", "12380382", "28817570", "2531063", "10661872", "3474519", "43700965", "2605772", "26271665", "13385220", "155093283", "59336214", "26891159", "1017685", "211118693", "18721224", "52931094", "208222566", "14867967", "53711844", "7552154", "9941003", "14568629", "69489938", "409273", "24414817", "1485076", "52300094", "3921235", "26385547", "54449782", "22231680", "5670374", "17972887", "17526872", "47258411", "215195403", "31789172", "209055469", "903059", "52118134", "10925341", "20928777", "24462981", "4020535", "26048497", "9382615", "198958238", "17869694", "662761", "8038305", "18095177", "9090940", "13201559", "242548", "9508408", "2140661", "52295250", "1510980", "56137287", "54196820", "20004139", "3989404", "215298408", "17738635", "4786834", "15550525", "36263207", "19166047", "22920196", "32350038", "19666072"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12866510"}

In computer vision, many tasks combine elements of both pattern recognition and graph reasoning. In this paper, we study how to connect deep networks with graph decomposition into an end-to-end trainable framework. More specifically, the minimum cost multicut problem is first converted to an unconstrained binary cubic formulation where cycle consistency constraints are incorporated into the objective function. The new optimization problem can be viewed as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) in which the random variables are associated with the binary edge labels.

Biometrics includes human face, fingerprint, iris and others. In this project, human face recognition has been chosen to be used in the system. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been selected to be the algorithm working with the system. However, due to the fact that PCA itself is not a good classifier so a classifier is picked to classify the data which is Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Basically, the main idea of PCA is to reduce the high dimensional image space to a lower one, as known as dimensionality reduction. During the process of reducing dimension, each of the images is being treated as an n*n matrix and the algorithm will calculate the mean face of all the individuals; subsequently create a lower dimensional face space. When a sample test image is feed into the system to perform matching, the test image will be projected onto the face space and perform matching. Then, SVM classifier will classify which class the individual belongs to. In order to test the system, an Adaboost classifier has been picked to compare the accuracy. As a result, SVM classifier outperforms the Adaboost classifier. In general, the graphical user interface is user friendly and user just need to train the system, browse a test image and then perform recognition. Although there are some weaknesses of this system, it can still be improved by hybrid with other efficient algorithm to achieve a more accurate result.

Prec-DWARF sets up a nonlinear relationship between precipitation at fine resolution and covariates at coarse/fine resolution, based on the advanced binary tree method known as Random Forests (RF). In addition to a single RF, we also consider a more advanced implementation based on two independent RFs which yield better results for extreme precipitation. Hourly gauge-radar precipitation data at 0.125\u00b0 from NLDAS-2 are used to conduct synthetic experiments with different spatial resolutions (0.25\u00b0, 0.5\u00b0 and 1\u00b0). Quantitative evaluation of these experiments demonstrates that Prec-DWARF consistently outperforms the baseline (i.e., bi-linear interpolation in this case) and can reasonably reproduce the spatial and temporal patterns, occurrence and distribution of observed precipitation fields. However, Prec-DWARF with a single RF significantly underestimates precipitation extremes and often cannot correctly recover the fine-scale spatial structure, especially for the 1\u00b0 experiments. Prec-DWARF with a double RF exhibits improvement in the simulation of extreme precipitation as well as its spatial and temporal structures, but variogram analyses show that the spatial and temporal variability of the downscaled fields are still strongly underestimated. Covariate feature importance analysis shows that the most important predictors for the downscaling are the coarse scale precipitation values over adjacent grid cells as well as the distance to the closest dry grid cell (i.e., the dry drift). The encouraging results demonstrate the potential of Prec-DWARF and machine-learning based techniques in general for the statistical downscaling of precipitation.

We need to increase wheat productivity at a faster pace and manage these challenges to meet the growing demand. Development of cultivars with durable disease resistance and enhancing the rate of genetic gain in wheat are the major goals in wheat breeding programs. Bacterial Leaf Streak (BLS) is one of the most threatening bacterial diseases to wheat in the US Northern Great Plains. Unlike fungal diseases, bacterial diseases cannot be effectively managed using chemicals and thus developing disease resistant cultivars would be the most economical control for BLS. Identification and characterization of genomic regions in wheat that confer resistance to BLS can be an effective way to mobilize resistance genes in wheat breeding. Here we performed Genome \u2013 wide association mapping on a Hard Winter Wheat Association Panel (HWWMP) to identify genomic regions that confer resistance to BLS. The genotyped data for this panel of 300 winter wheat lines from the major breeding programs across the Midwestern region of the US was obtained from T3 Triticale Toolbox (under the GPL license). The responses of all these lines against Xanthomonas campestris pv. translucens in the greenhouse and field conditions were evaluated. Association Mapping (AM) was used to detect marker \u2013 trait associations using ECMLM, and we identified five QTL regions (Q.bls.sdsu.1AL, Q.bls.sdsu.1BS, Q.bls.sdsu.3AL, Q.bls.sdsu.4AL and Q.bls.sdsu.7AS) conferring BLS resistance. In total, these five QTLs explained 42% of the variation. Eleven genotypes were identified, which could be used as a source of resistance against BLS. Comparative analysis of three of the identified QTLs (Q.bls.sdsu.1AL, Q.bls.sdsu.3AL and Q.bls.sdsu.4AL) with rice showed BLS resistance genes in rice (qBLSr5d, qBLSr1, and qBLSr3d) located on syntenic regions in rice chromosomes 5R, 1R and 3R respectively. The 11 BLS resistant genotypes and SNP markers linked to QTLs identified in our study could facilitate breeding BLS resistance in wheat. For grain yield improvement, we assessed the robustness for genomic selection (GS) in the South Dakota State Winter Wheat Breeding program (SDSWWBP). We performed GS with a set of 434 advanced breeding lines (AYT and PYT nurseries) between the years 2014 \u2013 2017. These lines were genotyped by sequencing GBS and the yield data from 34 years \u00d7 location combinations were used as a phenotype. We developed training and validation datasets for testing the genomic prediction accuracies. Single and multiyear analysis were done using several GS models (rrBLUP, PLSR, ELNET and Random Forest). The average predictions accuracies within a single year across locations were 0.62. However, with the multi-year-location analysis, the average genomic prediction accuracies were 0.26 for two-year combination, 0.32 for three-year combination and 0.36 for the four-year combination.

The DSMd algorithm can derive the magnitudes of building height change, but it produces a high level of noise in the result and influences the change detection reliability. Therefore, an integration of DSMd and SVM was applied to determine the magnitudes of change and significantly reduce the noise in the results. Among point-based algorithms, M3C2 algorithm is able to show the magnitudes of building height changes and differentiate between new and demolished objects, while C2C can not fully satisfy the evaluation criteria.

The healthcare industry needs some way to accommodate for the increasing healthcare needs of the elderly. This research proposes the idea of using classifiers in combination with wearable sensor data to monitor the well-being of the elderly. This will allow healthcare professionals to focus on those whom the algorithm has already identified as being unwell, thereby sparing them the time it would have taken to manually determine which patients need medical attention and which currently do not. After looking at literature on which factors influence health and cross-referencing that with which sensor data are feasible to measure within the scope of this research, the research aims to answer the question: Can classifiers be used to make predictions of well-being on the basis of sleep, physical activity, time away from home, and the circadian rhythm? To answer this question, an observational study of ten days was done for twenty participants in which a wearable measured the necessary health data. The participant well-being was assessed in three ways: through diagnoses from health professionals, through participant self-report, and through the sensor data itself. A K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) classifier were trained that used the sensor data to make predictions of well-being as assessed through the data. The RF classifier gave the best results and showed an accuracy of 89%. However, the well-being assessed through sensor data was ultimately found to be unrepresentative of well-being, and the RF classifier performance was considerably worse when compared against the well-being assessed through health professionals and through self-report.

In these approaches, the saliency values of image elements are ranked by the similarity of image elements with foreground or background cues via graph-based ranking. However, in previous methods, the similarity between any two image elements on the affinity graph is computed by manually set functions which are sensitive to function parameters, and the constructed graph may not reveal the essentially relevance between feature vectors extracted from different image elements. In addition, during the saliency ranking process, all the initial labels contribute equally to the ranking function while the global saliency confidence of each image element is not taken into consideration. In order to address these two issues, we propose a bottom-up saliency detection approach by affinity graph learning and weighted manifold ranking. An unsupervised learning approach is introduced to learn the affinity graph based on image data self-representation. By setting image boundary superpixels as background seeds, the global saliency confidence prior implied in the affinity matrix is utilized to weight the saliency ranking. In such a manner, the superpixels with higher saliency confidences will be assigned higher saliency values in the final saliency map and the background superpixels can be efficiently suppressed. Comprehensive evaluations on three challenge datasets indicate that our algorithm universally surpasses other unsupervised graph based saliency detection methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2018.05.106", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2807798246", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["214802458", "155100124", "202687737", "199489934", "209459212", "57240856"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51881034"}

Recent major achievements in rule extraction for kernelized classifiers left some reasonable and unresolved problems in knowledge discovery from nonlinear SVMs. The most comprehensible methods imply constraints that strictly enforce convexity of the searched-through half-space of inducted SVM classifier [2].

In this study, lung X-ray images that are available for the diagnosis of pneumonia were used.

In this paper, a new label propagation algorithm, Node Ability based Label Propagation Algorithm (NALPA), is proposed to discover communities in networks.

SOP-SRL embeds band selection into a scalable self-representation learning, which is formulated as an adaptive linear combination of regression-based loss functions, with the row-sparsity constraint. To further enhance the representativeness of bands, the local similarity between samples constructed by the selected bands is dynamically measured by means of graph-based regularization term in the embedded space. Moreover, a cache with memory function that reflects the quality of bands in the historical data is designed to keep the consistency between data coming at different times and guide subsequent band selection.

Copy Number Variants (CNVs) targeting a diversity of genes have been implicated in ASD, however correlations with clinical patterns are unclear. Methods In this study, we developed a novel machine learning integrative approach that seeks to delineate associations between ASD clinical profiles and disrupted biological processes inferred from CNVs spanning brain-expressed genes. Results Clustering analysis of relevant clinical measures from 2446 ASD cases, retrieved from the Autism Genome Project (AGP) database, identified two distinct phenotypic subgroups, with a milder and a more severe phenotype. Patients in the two clusters differed significantly in verbal status, ADOS-defined severity, adaptive behaviour profiles and intellectual ability, with verbal status contributing the most for cluster stability and cohesion. In the clustered ASD cases, functional enrichment analysis of brain-expressed genes disrupted by rare CNVs identified 15 statistically significant biological processes. These biological processes included cell adhesion, nervous system development, cognition and protein polyubiquitination and were in line with previous ASD findings. Random Forest feature importance analysis showed a positive contribution of all disrupted biological processes to the classification of ASD cases in the identified clusters. A Naive Bayes classifier was generated to predict the ASD phenotype from the identified disrupted biological processes. For a subset of patients with higher Information Content scores calculated for the disrupted biological processes, the classifier achieved predictions with a high precision but low recall (Precision: 0.82, Recall: 0.39). Conclusions This study highlights the usefulness of machine learning approaches to reduce clinical heterogeneity by taking advantage of multidimensional clinical measures. Furthermore, it shows that phenotype-genotype correlations can be established in ASD, and that milder and more severe clinical presentations have distinct underlying biological mechanisms. However, precise predictions of the phenotype from genetic data were only achieved for the subset of patients with higher biological information content. These findings are therefore a first step towards the translation of genetic information into clinically useful applications, while emphasizing the need for larger datasets with complete clinical and biological information.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/470757", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2773163793", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["31306311", "9186422", "17879613", "22947139", "14356892", "1410747", "16168106", "8798477", "14145078", "45958738", "37424610", "10841065", "9678008"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:90230819"}

From the analysis, we identify issues of SS tasks which allow a severely mode-collapsed generator to excel the SS tasks.

The success of SVMs is mainly due to a number of attractive features, including a) applicability to the processing of high dimensional data, b) ability to achieve a global optimum, and c) the ability to deal with nonlinear data. One potential application for SVMs is High Range Resolution (HRR) radar signatures, typically used for HRR-based Automatic Target Recognition (ATR). HRR signatures are problematic for many traditional ATR algorithms because of the unique characteristics of HRR signatures. For example, HRR signatures are generally high dimensional, linearly inseparable, and extremely sensitive to aspect changes. In this paper we demonstrate that SVMs are a promising alternative in dealing with the challenges of HRR signatures. The studies presented in this paper represent an initial attempt at applying SVMs to HRR data. The most straightforward application of SVMs to HRR-based ATR is to use SVMs as classifiers. We experimentally compare the performance of SVM-based classifiers with several conventional classifiers, such as k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) classifiers and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Classifiers. Experimental results suggest that SVM classifiers possess a number of advantages. For example, a) applying SVM classifiers to HRR data requires little prior knowledge of the target data, b) SVM classifiers require much less computation than kNN classifiers during testing, and c) the structure of a trained SVM classifier can reveal a number of important properties of the target data.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.445367", "venue": "SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2166004558,3012687075,3012920353", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["124756676", "121216002", "129509787", "110788058", "121030218", "61648490", "119892007", "129509787", "109472978", "207165665", "194951", "28637672", "63540818", "368033", "207673395", "9756494", "855426", "2845602", "59639035", "14895712", "23544307"], "inbound_citations": ["120188328", "53484486", "110062604", "10784121", "13543064", "125449152", "14381029", "9381229", "129780864"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123477201"}

The problem of missing data is commonly handled by imputation (i.e., replacing missing values with substituted values according to available information).

We use this procedure to assess the performance of several modern generative adversarial network architectures.

CTR prediction is a problem of binary classification with imbalanced data. Many existing approaches for imbalance learning only focus on over-sampling and under-sampling, but these methods definitely ignore some vital information of the original data. In this paper, we first propose a weighted output extreme learning machine (WO-ELM) to learn the imbalanced data. A hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-C-ELM) is proposed based on the proposed WO-ELM and the weighted extreme learning machine (W-ELM). The H-C-ELM has two levels in its structure. In the first level, the WO-ELM and the W-ELM are trained on different combined fields of the CTR (each field has some attributes). The two extreme learning machines (ELMs) output their predicted scores of the corresponding combined fields of the CTR. The WO-ELM and the W-ELM have different predicted results on the same combined fields because of the difference of the two ELMs. Therefore, in the second level, another ELM is applied based on the outputs of the two ELMs in the first level and the actual outputs in order to improve the prediction accuracy.

However, it is still challenging to identify LMCI from EMCI because of the subtle changes in imaging which are not noticeable. In addition, there were relatively few studies to make inferences about the brain dynamic changes in the cognitive progression from EMCI to LMCI to AD. Inspired by the above problems, we proposed an advanced approach of evolutionary weighted random support vector machine cluster (EWRSVMC) where the predictions of numerous weighted SVM classifiers are aggregated for improving the generalization performance. We validated our method in multiple binary classifications using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. As a result, the encouraging accuracy of 90% for EMCI/LMCI and 88.89% for LMCI/AD were achieved respectively, demonstrating the excellent discriminating ability.

The assumption that a location information would improve semantic segmentation performance emerges from the idea that some elements of urban scenes are located in a predictable manner. This assumption is confronted to realistic data on the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, which is used to create our own synthetic dataset with images, depth maps and bird-eye-view cartographic images. Simulators circumvent the difficulties due to the scarcity of publicly available synchronous labeled images and location information. We encode the location information as a cartographic image to process it as a camera image. We assess the relevance of injecting the cartographic information in three different manners: as a Conditional Random Field potential, as an additional task and as an additional encoder input of a CNN. The three methods are evaluated and compared with a state of the art CNN with regards to the pixel-wise accuracy, mean intersection over union and intersection over union of some important classes. The multi-encoder approach improves the intersection over union of the pedestrians, vehicles and traffic signs classes by respectively 4%, 1.6% and 9%.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICARCV.2018.8581165", "venue": "2018 15th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV)", "journal": "2018 15th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2897064445", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5550767", "195908774", "1629541", "436933", "17127188", "9455111", "502946", "3943983", "5574079", "4800342", "178063", "206590944", "9779450", "939179", "13201717", "20999239", "6790389", "3429309", "11091110", "6628106"], "inbound_citations": ["214691821"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56598088"}

The accessible diagnosing methods and the current effects of cancer treatment are unsatisfactory. For that reason, we introduce innovative diagnostic techniques which classify cancer affected portion from the lung image at an early stage. In the study, an excellent image classification system is proposed to detect and classify the lung images as normal and abnormal. In the initial phase of our work, the lung images are fed to the preprocessing module using Histogram Equalization to remove noise and gain the clarity of the image. In addition to this, feature extraction techniques are applied and then it is reduced to the best subset of features using Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA). Here, the lung image classification is done by four different classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Neural Network (NN) and Random Forest (RF). The performance measures of these classifiers are analyzed and compared with one another.

With the wealth and huge amount of data generated from road traffic accidents, the issue of traffic accident prediction has become a central challenge in the field of transportation data analysis. This has led to the application of many well-established supervised learning algorithms in an attempt to provide more accurate and injury severity accident class (fatal/serious/slight/property damage with no injury) prediction. Virtually all research on SL addresses the task of learning to classify complete domain instances. However, in some research situations we often have to classify incomplete vectors, which can affect the predictive accuracy of learned classifiers. The task of learning an accurate incomplete data classifier from instances raises a number of new issues some of which have not been properly addressed by transportation research. Thus, an effective missing value estimation method is required for improving predictive accuracy. The essence of the approach is the proposal that prediction using supervised learning can be improved by \u2018doing more\u2019 with the missing data rather than discarding it, i.e. adding missingness as a further category (for categorical attributes) and incorporating missingness directly in decision tree splits (for continuous attributes). The approach can be expected to be particularly useful when missingness is not random but informative. We evaluate our approach with other supervised learning techniques including C4.5, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), k-Nearest neighbour (k-NN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), from the point of view of their effect or tolerance of incomplete test data.

Building high accuracy speech recognition systems with limited language resources is a highly challenging task. Although the use of multi-language data for acoustic models yields improvements, performance is often unsatisfactory with highly limited acoustic training data. In these situations, it is possible to consider using multiple well trained acoustic models and combine the system outputs together. Unfortunately, the computational cost associated with these approaches is high as multiple decoding runs are required. To address this problem, this paper examines schemes based on log-linear score combination. This has a number of advantages over standard combination schemes. Even with limited acoustic training data, it is possible to train, for example, phone-specific combination weights, allowing detailed relationships between the available well trained models to be obtained. To ensure robust parameter estimation, this paper casts log-linear score combination into a structured support vector machine (SSVM) learning task. This yields a method to train model parameters with good generalisation properties. Here the SSVM feature space is a set of scores from well-trained individual systems. The SSVM approach is compared to lattice rescoring and confusion network combination using language packs released within the IARPA Babel program.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.21437/Interspeech.2016-377", "venue": "INTERSPEECH", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2514764748", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["19022413", "6906401", "1473186", "7230302", "16992423", "18806400", "18751160", "16725919", "7439227", "6206305", "5807992", "14825215", "9461302", "124495422", "2602082", "11204110", "32618020", "204341", "7550319", "8357703", "52874011", "16632620", "14036493", "1406894", "58576075", "14211670", "1437897", "1744924", "61490367", "59789023", "16480999"], "inbound_citations": ["39213535"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16146027"}

Methods supporting these tasks must understand both the pathway model representations and the natural language in the literature. These methods should identify and order documents by relevance to any given pathway reaction. No existing system has addressed all aspects of this challenge. Method: We present novel methods for associating pathway model reactions with relevant publications. Our approach extracts the reactions directly from the models and then turns them into queries for three text mining-based MEDLINE literature search systems. These queries are executed, and the resulting documents are combined and ranked according to their relevance to the reactions of interest. We manually annotate document-reaction pairs with the relevance of the document to the reaction and use this annotation to study several ranking methods, using various heuristic and machine-learning approaches. Results: Our evaluation shows that the annotated document-reaction pairs can be used to create a rule-based document ranking system, and that machine learning can be used to rank documents by their relevance to pathway reactions. We find that a Support Vector Machine-based system outperforms several baselines and matches the performance of the rule-based system.

At times, however, uncertainties in the numerical simulation model due to uncertain aquifer parameters are not incorporated into the management model. The present study explicitly incorporated aquifer parameter uncertainty into a multi-objective management model for the optimal design of groundwater pumping strategies from the unconfined Bonriki aquifer situated in a small Pacific island country. The objective of the multi-objective management model was to maximise pumping from production wells and minimize pumping from the barrier wells (hydraulic barriers) to ensure that the water quality at different monitoring locations (MLs) were within pre-specified sustainable limits. To achieve the targeted management goal, a coupled flow and transport numerical simulation model of the Bonriki aquifer was developed using the FEMWATER numerical code. The developed three-dimensional numerical model was calibrated and validated using limited available hydrological data. To achieve computational efficiency and feasibility of the management model, the numerical simulation model in the S/O model was replaced with ensembles of Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR) surrogate models. Each SVMR standalone surrogate model in the ensemble was constructed using datasets from different numerical simulation models with different hydraulic conductivity and porosity values. These ensemble SVMR models were coupled to the multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization model to solve the Bonriki aquifer management problem. The executed optimization model presented a Pareto-front with 600 non-dominated optimal trade-off pumping solutions. The reliability of the management model established after validation of the optimal solution results suggests that the implemented constraints of the optimization problem were satisfied, i.e., the salinity concentrations at respective MLs were within the pre-specified limits.

In the method, the problem of solving the SVR soft-sensor model is converted into the problem of finding the nearest points between two convex hulls (CHs) or reduced convex hulls (RCHs) in geometry. Then a geometric algorithm is adopted to generate soft-sensor models of fermentation process efficiently. Furthermore, a swarm energy conservation particle swarm optimization (SEC-PSO) algorithm is proposed to seek the optimal parameters of the augmented training sample sets, the RCH size, and the kernel function which are involved in geometric SVR modeling. The method is applied to the soft-sensor modeling for a penicillin fermentation process.

Apart from higher efficiency, complexity has also been reduced as it is not required to find key frames for all the shots. The system is evaluated using a database of 1000 videos consisting of 20 different categories.

Unfortunately, in medical imaging, most available datasets are small/fragmented. To tackle this, as a Data Augmentation (DA) method, 3D conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can synthesize desired realistic/diverse 3D images as additional training data. However, no 3D conditional GAN-based DA approach exists for general bounding box-based 3D object detection, while it can locate disease areas with physicians' minimum annotation cost, unlike rigorous 3D segmentation. Moreover, since lesions vary in position/size/attenuation, further GAN-based DA performance requires multiple conditions. Therefore, we propose 3D Multi-Conditional GAN (MCGAN) to generate realistic/diverse 32 X 32 X 32 nodules placed naturally on lung Computed Tomography images to boost sensitivity in 3D object detection. Our MCGAN adopts two discriminators for conditioning: the context discriminator learns to classify real vs synthetic nodule/surrounding pairs with noise box-centered surroundings; the nodule discriminator attempts to classify real vs synthetic nodules with size/attenuation conditions. The results show that 3D Convolutional Neural Network-based detection can achieve higher sensitivity under any nodule size/attenuation at fixed False Positive rates and overcome the medical data paucity with the MCGAN-generated realistic nodules---even expert physicians fail to distinguish them from the real ones in Visual Turing Test.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1906.04962", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/3DV.2019.00085", "venue": "2019 International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV)", "journal": "2019 International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2982587597,2951339437", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["4117071", "21883326", "58029038", "13290575", "2164893", "23714201", "54445067", "3686035", "88495537", "1033682", "10894094", "26657811", "43939347", "67856728", "88523526", "173188390", "6200260", "47019328", "211227", "206771128", "605416", "206429151", "4880564", "11758569", "10328909", "3719281", "1687220", "8313962", "50786007", "8229065", "80828621", "72940796", "3248075", "3162051", "52286863"], "inbound_citations": ["210165005", "211118399", "189898273", "212633517", "211852152"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:186206719"}

The existence of bird nests in overhead catenary system (OCS) can hazard to the safety of the high-speed rails, which will potentially result in long time delays and expensive damages. A vision-based intelligent inspection system capable of automatic detection of bird nests built on overhead catenary would avoid the damages and increase the reliability and punctuality, and therefore is attractive for a high-speed railway system. However, OCS images exhibit great variations with lighting changes, illumination conditions and complex backgrounds, which pose great difficulty for automatic recognition. This paper addresses the problem of automatic recognition of bird nests for OCS images. Based on the unique properties of bird nests, we propose a novel framework, which is composed of five steps: adaptive binarization, trunk/branch detection, hovering point detection, streak extraction and pattern learning, for bird nest detection.

What made the study quite difficult was the non-stationary component of the signals along with a very low signal to noise ratio. Reduction in the noise content was achieved through a threshold technique based on Steins Unbiased Risk Estimate. To reduce the non-stationary content, the trend and seasonality components of the signals were examined and removed when necessary. This was done in accordance with the Classical Decomposition Theory. In order to find the best features to determine the calls of whales, wavelet packet decomposition technique was used using Daubechies 2 (db2) as mother wavelet. Wavelets were used as they provide a good frequency resolution over other formats like Fourier Transform. This led to the decomposition of the signals into separate filter banks whose energy contents were used as features. A backward sequential feature selection approach then found out the best subset of features to be used for classification.

Any expert system that makes use of natural language in its core, can be affected by a weak semantic representation of text, resulting in inaccurate outcomes based on poor decisions. To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel approach called Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA) , that disambiguates and annotates each word by its specific sense, considering the semantic effects of its context. Our approach brings three main contributions to the semantic representation scenario: (i) an unsupervised technique that disambiguates and annotates words by their senses, (ii) a multi-sense embeddings model that can be extended to any traditional word embeddings algorithm, and (iii) a recurrent methodology that allows our models to be re-used and their representations refined.

Among them, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods have been recently applied and showed successful performance compared with other machine learning schemes. However, despite the high performance, the SVM approaches suffer from the problem of understandability since it is a black-box model; the predictions made by SVM cannot be interpreted as biologically meaningful way. To overcome this limitation, a new association rule based classifier PCPAR was devised based on the existing classifier, CPAR to handle the sequential data. The performance of the PCPAR was improved more by designing the following two hybrid schemes. The PCPAR/SVM method is a parallel combination of the PCPAR and the SVM and the PCPAR_SVM method is a sequential combination of the PCPAR and the SVM. To understand the SVM prediction, the SVM_PCPAR scheme was developed. The experimental result presents that the PCPAR scheme shows better performance with respect to the accuracy and the number of generated patterns than CPAR method. The PCPAR/SVM scheme presents better performance than the PCPAR, PCPAR_SVM or the SVM_PCPAR and almost equal performance to the SVM. The generated patterns are easily understandable and biologically meaningful. The system sturdiness evaluation and the ROC curve analysis proved that this new scheme is robust and competent. ::: Index words.

ABSTRACT In this work the Reservoir Computing (RC) technique; specifically the Liquid State Machine (LSM) was chosen to simulate a Movement Predictor system at minimum cost, experiencing both short and long term prediction. Also in this work shows the possibility to simulate the LSM without the need to event based simulation (i.e. proving that it is not urgent to interface the MATLAB programming language with other programming languages like C and C to simulate the LSM). The encoding from spiking to analog domain was avoided in this work. This means there is no waste in the input information due to the encoding process. Also this will result in simpler LSM scheme.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5120/11862-7646", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Computer Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2102029578", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1045112", "46987333", "10545728", "121579860", "60602644", "10545728", "195717560", "9829593", "15424085", "7958742", "46987333", "9152903", "120490098", "134804732", "64543020", "9448547", "18072366", "16538082", "2046662"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:492631"}

Aiming at these series of problems, we introduce the partial least squares (PLS) and cluster analysis (CA) into Elman neural network algorithm, by the PLS for dimension reduction which can eliminate the correlative and repetitive factors of the features. Using CA eliminates the correlative and repetitive factors of the sample. If some subclass becomes small sample, with high-dimensional feature and fewer numbers, PLS shows a unique advantage. Each subclass is regarded as one training sample to train the different precise neural network models. Then simulation samples are discriminated and classified into different subclasses, using the corresponding neural network to recognize it. An optimized Elman neural network classification algorithm based on PLS and CA (PLS-CA-Elman algorithm) is established.

Most of the existing work is built on a single-window-based mechanism to detect concept drifts. Due to the inherent limitation of the single- window-based mechanism, it is a challenge to handle different types of drifts. Motivated by this, a new classification algorithm based on a double-window mechanism for handling various concept drifting data streams (DWCDS) is proposed in this paper. In terms of an ensemble classifier in random decision trees, a double-window-based mechanism is presented to detect concept drifts periodically, and the model is updated dynamically to adapt to concept drifts. Extensive studies on both synthetic and real-word data demonstrate that DWCDS could quickly and efficiently detect concept drifts from streaming data, and the performance on the robustness to noise and the accuracy of classification is also improved significantly.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Acta Automatica Sinica", "mag_id": "2385591031", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3097107", "38001589", "18934009", "35678397", "18034287", "18641022"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63344929"}

Its challenges also include small training sample and large intra-class variations. Considering the limitations, we suggest a novel transfer learning approach from Persian handwriting domain to multi-language OSV domain. We train two Residual CNNs on the source domain separately based on two different tasks of word classification and writer identification. Since identifying a person's signature resembles identifying one's handwriting, it seems perfectly convenient to use handwriting for the feature learning phase. The learned representation on the more varied and plentiful handwriting dataset can compensate for the lack of training data in the original task, i.e. OSV, without sacrificing the generalizability. Our proposed OSV system includes two steps: learning representation and verification of the input signature. For the first step, the signature images are fed into the trained Residual CNNs. The output representations are then used to train SVMs for the verification. We test our OSV system on three different signature datasets, including MCYT (a Spanish signature dataset), UTSig (a Persian one) and GPDS-Synthetic (an artificial dataset). On UTSIG, we achieved 9.80% Equal Error Rate (EER) which showed substantial improvement over the best EER in the literature, 17.45%.

However, the computing of kernel function of SVM may be dominated by trivial relevant or irrelevant features.

Secondly, we utilize the weighted features to compute the kernel functions and train the SVM. Finally, the trained SVM has been used to the new images automatic classification task.

There exists a trade-off between accuracy and the number of feature sets. Hence the focus in this study is to implement Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) on the brain tumor images for various classes.

Rothbart, 1981) and subtyping (M. B. Brewer, V. Dull, & L. Lui, 1981; S. E. Taylor, 1981) effects. The finding traditionally regarded as demonstrating subtyping is that exposure to moderate (compared with extreme) disconfirmers leads to subsequent ratings of the group that are less stereotypic. Despite learning that is incremental and analogous to bookkeeping, the simulations replicate this finding and suggest that the \u201csubtyping\u201d pattern of results will be drastically reduced if disconfirmers are encountered before the stereotype is well-established. This novel prediction holds with human participants and offers a tantalizing suggestion: Although moderate disconfirmers may produce more stereotype change, stereotype development might be discouraged by exposure to either extreme or moderate disconfirmers. Negative stereotypes about social groups (defined by race, gender, religion, occupation, or other characteristics) frequently go hand in hand with prejudiced feelings and overt discrimination against members of those groups, ranging from mild social sanctions up through pogroms, campaigns of \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d and genocide. The interlinked issues of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination thus constitute major social problems, and social scientists have been active in searching for remedies. A natural assumption embodied in many suggested remedies is that negative stereotypes will weaken and change when people encounter positive (or, more generally, stereotype-inconsistent) information about members of the stereotyped group. If firsthand experience or reliable reports indicate that group stereotypes are incorrect or at least are not universally applicable, it makes sense that the stereotypes should be weakened or ultimately even set aside. Unfortunately, anecdotal reports and everyday experience, as well as the accumulated results of much social psychological research, suggest that this happy outcome is rare. One White woman from Chicago, for example, was quoted in a newspaper report as saying that she thought most blacks were violent and criminally inclined (Wilkerson, 1992). At the same time, she emphasized that the few black people she knew personally were \u201clovely people.\u201d How could this woman maintain her general stereotype in the face of disconfirming evidence from personal encounters? More generally, how and when will stereotypes change in response to stereotype-inconsistent information?", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1037/0022-3514.82.3.300", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Personality and Social Psychology", "mag_id": "2100442982", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210221354"}

The identification of the tumors with worst prognoses is important to achieve better clinical management of pathology. Aims of this study were the analysis of 18F-FDG PET radiometric features with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and correlation with prognostic clinical-pathological parameters. Methods The PET-CT scans of 51 women (age \u2a7e 18 years) with invasive ductal mammary carcinoma selected for chirurgical resection were considered. Images were corrected voxel-by-voxel for Partial Volume Effect using an iterative post-reconstruction method based on measured system Point Spread Function. Mean Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmean) was extracted for segmented Regions Of Interest (ROIs) representing tumor lesions (L) and background mammary healthy tissue (BK). Pearson correlations of tumor proliferative index with SUVmean(L) and SUVmean(L) normalized to SUVmean(BK) (SUVmean(L)-norm) were computed. The relevance of SUVmean(L)-norm and SUVmean(BK) to discriminate tumor luminal subtypes (A, B, B2, HER2, TN) [1] was investigated implementing linear-kernel SVM classification [2] . Performance was evaluated computing the Area (AUC) Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve [3] , estimated in leave-one-out cross-validation to ensure an unbiased estimate of the classifier performance. Results Significant positive correlations of SUVmean(L) (p = 0.007) and SUVmean(L)-norm (p = 0.003) with proliferative index were found. Considering the features SUVmean(L)-norm and SUVmean(BK), multiclass classification was not able to discriminate between all luminal categories with performances significantly different from the chance level. By contrast, considering two-class classification, AUC was enhanced to 81% when considering luminal TN vs others and 89% for luminal A vs others. Conclusions Quantitative features extracted from PET images were correlated with prognostic clinical and histopathological factors in mammary carcinoma. Moreover, the SVM-based classification demonstrated a predictive value of PET images.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ejmp.2018.04.311", "venue": null, "journal": "Physica Medica", "mag_id": "2910775394", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:81394505"}

Physical rehabilitation is the main treatment for hemiparesis recovery, and physiotherapists agree that using the impaired arm in the activities of daily living (ADLs)is crucial for a complete recovery. Currently, rehabilitation is assessed through diaries and self-questionnaires, which are subjective and do not tell the real condition of the patients throughout the day. Assistive devices can objectively evaluate the functional improvement of the impaired arm monitoring its activity. This work aimed to identify the purposeful arm movements during patient's ADLs. We consider arm's swing while walking as a non-purposeful movement. Firstly, the event-based approach was applied to separate movement and non-movement segments. Secondly, movement segments were used to detect the change-point (events)and their locations in time series signal. Two machine learning classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM)and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were trained using 10-fold cross validation for the classification of purposeful and non-purposeful movements. Data from 10 healthy and 12 post-strokes volunteers from Institute Guttmann (Barcelona)were collected using the SensHand device. The volunteers, wearing one SensHand on each wrist, performed the following activities: resting, eating, pouring water, drinking, brushing, folding towel, grasp towel, grasp brush, grasp glass, continuous and walking. Developing a model based on the healthy subjects, the overall classification accuracy obtained from SVM classifier and ANN was 81.21 % and 97.06% respectively. Similarly, with poststroke subjects obtained accuracy with the SVM and ANN was 84.18% and 99.74% respectively.

This study investigates and optimizes a Random Forest algorithm for automated organ segmentation; explores the limitations of a Random Forest algorithm applied to the CT environment; and demonstrates segmentation accuracy in a feasibility study of pediatric and adult patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate a trainable Weka segmentation (TWS) implementation using Random Forest machine-learning as a means to develop a fully automated tissue segmentation tool developed specifically for pediatric and adult examinations in a diagnostic CT environment. Current innovation in computed tomography (CT) is focused on radiomics, patient-specific radiation dose calculation, and image quality improvement using iterative reconstruction, all of which require specific knowledge of tissue and organ systems within a CT image. The purpose of this study was to develop a fully automated Random Forest classifier algorithm for segmentation of neck\u2013chest\u2013abdomen\u2013pelvis CT examinations based on pediatric and adult CT protocols. Seven materials were classified: background, lung/internal air or gas, fat, muscle, solid organ parenchyma, blood/contrast enhanced fluid, and bone tissue using Matlab and the TWS plugin of FIJI. The following classifier feature filters of TWS were investigated: minimum, maximum, mean, and variance evaluated over a voxel radius of 2 n , (n from 0 to 4), along with noise reduction and edge preserving filters: Gaussian, bilateral, Kuwahara, and anisotropic diffusion. The Random Forest algorithm used 200 trees with 2 features randomly selected per node. The optimized auto-segmentation algorithm resulted in 16 image features including features derived from maximum, mean, variance Gaussian and Kuwahara filters. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) calculations between manually segmented and Random Forest algorithm segmented images from 21 patient image sections, were analyzed. The automated algorithm produced segmentation of seven material classes with a median DSC of 0.86 \u00b1 0.03 for pediatric patient protocols, and 0.85 \u00b1 0.04 for adult patient protocols. Additionally, 100 randomly selected patient examinations were segmented and analyzed, and a mean sensitivity of 0.91 (range: 0.82\u20130.98), specificity of 0.89 (range: 0.70\u20130.98), and accuracy of 0.90 (range: 0.76\u20130.98) were demonstrated.

The relationships between the horizontal and vertical urban growth and three major socioeconomic factors during the studied period were analysed. Results indicate that both the total area of built-up areas and the total area of detected MTBs are significantly correlated with population density, real gross domestic product, and fixed investment i.e. investment in fixed assets such as land, buildings, respectively.

However, most of the existing hashing methods for CF solely focus on modeling the user-item similarity (a.k.a. preference) but omit the user\u2013user and item\u2013item similarities, which cannot well preserve the original geometry in the vector space. Another tough issue is how to effectively tackle the encoding loss from the continuous vector space to the discrete Hamming space. In this paper, we propose a neural binary representation (NBR) learning approach by combining hashing with a neural network for the large-scale CF tasks. Our NBR problem is formulated as a Hamming similarity loss plus two anchor smoothing terms, which jointly preserve the intrinsic user\u2013item, user\u2013user, and item\u2013item similarities. To compensate the encoding loss introduced by hashing, the anchors for users and items are pre-learned using both user\u2013item interactions and the side-information of users and items through an AutoEncoder model. In particular, to solve the NBR problem, we develop a computationally efficient algorithm, which learns the binary codes in a fast bit-by-bit way and achieves less quantization deviation than the conventional CF hashing schemes.

Often, these controllers are explicitly transferred from a human via programmatic description or physical instantiation. Alternatively, Robot Learning from Demonstration (RLfD) can enable a robot to learn a policy from observing only demonstrations of the task itself. We focus on interactive, teleoperative teaching, where the user manually controls the robot and provides demonstrations while receiving learner feedback. With regression, the collected perception-actuation pairs are used to directly estimate the underlying policy mapping. ::: This dissertation contributes an RLfD methodology for interactive, mixed-initiative learning of unknown tasks. The goal of the technique is to enable users to implicitly instantiate autonomous robot controllers that perform desired tasks as well as the demonstrator, as measured by task-specific metrics. With standard regression techniques, we show that such \u201con-par\u201d learning is restricted to policies typified by a many-to-one mapping (a unimap) from perception to actuation. Thus, controllers representable as multi-state Finite State Machines (FSMs) and that exhibit a one-to-many mapping (a multimap) cannot be learnt. To be able to do so we must address the three issues of model selection (how many subtasks or FSM states), policy learning (for each subtask), and transitioning (between subtasks). Previous work in RLfD has assumed knowledge of the task decomposition and learned the subtask policies or the transitions between them in isolation. ::: We instead address both model selection and policy learning simultaneously. Our presented technique uses an infinite mixture of experts and treats the multimap data from an FSM controller as being generated from overlapping unimaps. The algorithm automatically determines the number of unimap experts (model selection) and learns a unimap for each one (policy learning). On data from both synthetic and robot soccer multimaps we show that the discovered subtasks can be used (switched between) to reperform the original task. While not at the same level of skill as the demonstrator, the resulting approximations represent significant improvement over ones for the same tasks learned with unimap regression.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2293604824", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["2790301", "53879343", "8045064", "6921887", "6717653", "14217035"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38596627"}

Obtaining accurate predictions becomes more complicated as the number of classes increases. Most families of classification techniques generate models that define decision boundaries trying to separate the classes as well as possible. As an alternative, in this paper, we propose to hierarchically decompose the original multiclass problem by reducing the number of classes involved in each local subproblem. This is done by deriving a similarity matrix from the misclassification errors given by a first classifier that is learned for this, and then, using the similarity matrix to build a tree-like hierarchy of specialized classifiers. Then, we present two approaches to solve the multiclass problem: the first one traverses the tree of classifiers in a top-down manner similar to the way some hierarchical classification methods do for dealing with hierarchical domains; the second one is inspired in the way probabilistic decision trees compute class membership probabilities. To improve the efficiency of our methods, we propose a criterion to reduce the size of the hierarchy. We experimentally evaluate all of the proposals on a collection of multiclass datasets showing that, in general, the generated classifier hierarchies outperform the original (flat) multiclass classification.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jocs.2018.01.006", "venue": "J.

Pre-programming a robot to acquire a wide variety of skills in an ever changing environment is unfeasible. Robot learning provides a promising alternative. Two well-established learning techniques are Programming by Demonstration (PbD) and Learning from Exploration (LfE). PbD and LfE are often combined to strengthen each other. PbD is used because it allows fast learning: with only a few demonstrations, robots are able to reproduce tasks with reasonable performance. After these demonstrations, LfE is used to improve the robot's task performance or to adjust this skills to changing environments. Robots often use continuous mappings between states and actions to represent a skill. Such mappings are called policies and are represented by function approximators. The shape of the policy is determined by the parameters. During learning the robot tries to find optimal parameters for the policy. As the complexity of the skill increases, the number of parameters required to accurately describe the policy for this skill also increases. As the number of parameters increases, the complexity of the solution space increases as well. It is most likely that the LfE algorithm requires more trials to converge for these complex search spaces than simpler search spaces, thus the LfE performance decreases as the complexity of the search space increases. In this thesis a novel multi-resolution policy representation is investigated. The method, called Tree-based policy representation, creates a multi-resolution model based on demonstration data. After this initialization, LfE can use the structure of the Multi-resolution policy to increase learning performance. The method is tested in multiple experimental scenarios. The Tree-based policy representation achieves better learning performance compared to conventional `flat' policy representations, when learning motions that clearly have a multi-resolution aspect. In other cases, the Tree-based movement representation performs equally well or worse compared to standard `flat' policy representations.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "81458052", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59716453"}

We generalize the propagation strategies of current GCNs as a \\emph{\"Sink$\\to$Source\"} mode, which seems to be an underlying cause of the two challenges. To address these issues intrinsically, in this paper, we study the information propagation mechanism in a \\emph{\"Source$\\to$Sink\"} mode. We introduce a new concept \"information flow path\" that explicitly defines where information originates and how it diffuses. Then a novel framework, namely Flow Graph Network (FlowGN), is proposed to learn node representations. FlowGN is computationally efficient and flexible in propagation strategies. Moreover, FlowGN decouples the layer structure from the information propagation process, removing the interior constraint of applying deep structures in traditional GCNs.

The EGIL classification, adopted by the WHO classification, defines 4 different subtypes of both B-precursor and T-precursor ALL as well as detailed criteria for BAL. Specific cytogenetic features useful for classificationare found in some cases only. We analyzed gene expression profiles in 173 such patients (Pro-B-ALL n=25, c-ALL/Pre-B-ALL n=65 (with t(9;22) n=35, without t(9;22) n=30), mature B-ALL n=13, Pro-T-ALL n=6, Pre-T-ALL n=13, cortical T-ALL n=20, BAL (myeloid and T-lineage) n=17, AML M0 n=14). All cases were assessed by cytomorphology, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and molecular genetics. All cases with Pro-B-ALL had t(4;11)/MLL-AF4, all cases with mature B-ALL had t(8;14). Samples were hybridized to both U133A and U133B microarrays (Affymetrix). Top 300 differentially expressed genes were identified for each group in comparison to all other groups and individual other groups and used for classification by various Support Vector Machines (SVM) with 10-fold cross validation (CV). Prediction accuracy for discriminating T- from B-precursor ALL was 100%. Accordingly, principal component analysis (PCA) yielded a complete separation of both groups. PCA of B-precursor ALL cases showed distinct clusters for Pro-B-ALL, c-ALL/Pre-B-ALL, and mature B-ALL, however, c-ALL/Pre-B-ALL with t(9;22) were not completely discriminated from those without. Accordingly, classifying B-precursor ALL with SVM resulted in a 87.4% accuracy. Pre-T-ALL cases clustered distinct from cortical T-ALL with hte exception of two cases. The other Pre-T-ALLs clustered together with Pro-T-ALL. Analyzing T-precusor ALL with SVM and 10-fold CV resulted in an accuracy of only 56.4%. Including BAL and AML M0 into these analyses revealed significant overlaps between samples from these entities and T-ALL cases in PCA; prediction accuracy using SVM and 10-fold CV was 79.8%. This accuracy was confirmed applying 100 runs of SVM with 2/3 of samples being randomly selected as training set and 1/3 as test set which resulted in a median accuracy of 77.2% (range, 67.5% to 85.1%). A 100% prediction accuracy was achieved in Pro-B-ALL and mature B-ALL. Misclassifications were: c-ALL/Pre-B-ALL with t(9;22) as c-ALL/Pre-B-ALL without t(9;22) (6/35) and vice versa (6/30). Of the 13 Pre-T-ALL cases 4 were classified as BAL and 3 as cortical T-ALL. Of the 6 Pro-T-ALL cases 2 were classified as AML M0, 3 as BAL, and 1 as Pre-T-ALL. Of the 17 BAL cases 2 were classified as AML M0, 1 as c-ALL/Pre-B-ALL, 2 as Pre-T-ALL, and 1 as Pro-T-ALL. These analyses confirm that gene expression profiles allow the identification of Pro-B-ALL with t(4;11) and mature B-ALL with t(8;14) but do not unequivocally identify the presence of t(9;22) in c-ALL/Pre-B-ALL. Cortical T-ALL are characterized by a specific gene expression profile which is, however, shared by few cases currently diagnosed as Pre-T-ALL. Thus, diagnostic criteria (surface expression of CD1a only) should be optimized. The same applies to diagnostic criteria for more immature T-ALL, BAL, and AML M0.

The core of the proposed framework is a neural network model, also called HIN2Vec, designed to capture the rich semantics embedded in HINs by exploiting different types of relationships among nodes. Given a set of relationships specified in forms of meta-paths in an HIN, HIN2Vec carries out multiple prediction training tasks jointly based on a target set of relationships to learn latent vectors of nodes and meta-paths in the HIN. In addition to model design, several issues unique to HIN2Vec, including regularization of meta-path vectors, node type selection in negative sampling, and cycles in random walks, are examined. To validate our ideas, we learn latent vectors of nodes using four large-scale real HIN datasets, including Blogcatalog, Yelp, DBLP and U.S. Patents, and use them as features for multi-label node classification and link prediction applications on those networks. Empirical results show that HIN2Vec soundly outperforms the state-of-the-art representation learning models for network data, including DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec, PTE, HINE and ESim, by 6.6% to 23.8% of $micro$-$f_1$ in multi-label node classification and 5% to 70.8% of $MAP$ in link prediction.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3132847.3132953", "venue": "CIKM '17", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2767774008", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["524106", "393948", "16689401", "2161592", "207238980", "8833697", "5451979", "3941626", "4425543", "195908774", "122765824", "10811631", "10811631", "207557742", "16447573", "9530137", "8822670", "3051291", "3964926", "17145594", "35493", "8399404", "4429113"], "inbound_citations": ["196173843", "51880378", "57366462", "211227454", "202540679", "209392526", "21744376", "160022807", "214765461", "50772365", "54459229", "13686675", "21694229", "53062184", "86574862", "199509475", "211297422", "207758921", "203605270", "70136038", "53034706", "119185084", "59604418", "201696410", "203579261", "59317056", "49648969", "196173887", "167217292", "49729190", "81978964", "214791315", "211690746", "202539799", "197644889", "207757883", "210993993", "202541326", "207809162", "210715229", "214693579", "52840299", "71152863", "44141976", "198334086", "2409634", "208076828", "209862313", "202723990", "215480977", "211227238", "208175960", "50774691", "53036565", "53219978", "54438859", "207758394", "212420038", "1479507", "202570075", "210993760", "210715191", "204788875", "214743464", "171096919", "52229472", "59336168", "61811105", "209458118", "53669669", "59231675", "174820552", "211298040", "213205625", "197661682", "204734292", "174797971", "209428418", "212645245", "58024156", "153312917", "211297847", "59235363", "53037515", "201879789", "204782951", "207759014", "212647862", "86697693", "203605419"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3958144"}

One reason for this is that previous studies did not factor out variation due to the different rules tested. To examine this issue, we reanalyzed grammaticality judgment scores in Flege, Yeni-Komshian, and Liu's (1999) study of L2 learners using rule-related predictors and found that, in addition to the overall drop in performance due to a sensitive period, L2 knowledge increased with years of input. Knowledge of different grammar rules was negatively associated with input frequency of those rules. To better understand these effects, we modeled the results using a connectionist model that was trained using Korean as a first language (L1) and then English as an L2. To explain the sensitive period in L2 learning, the model's learning rate was reduced in an age-related manner. By assigning different learning rates for syntax and lexical learning, we were able to model the difference between early and late L2 learners in input sensitivity. The model's learning mechanism allowed transfer between the L1 and L2, and this helped to explain the differences between different rules in the grammaticality judgment task. This work demonstrates that an L1 model of learning and processing can be adapted to provide an explicit account of how the input and the sensitive period interact in L2 learning.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6001481", "pubmed_id": "28744901", "doi": "10.1111/cogs.12519", "venue": "Cognitive Science", "journal": "Cognitive Science", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2738053481", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["215586189", "14144332", "18789060", "6868055", "206864797", "142846971", "59261020", "143724903", "13572435", "9404771", "147233470", "60369411", "145157050", "144650572", "15428641", "1237448", "8713012", "17794039", "9640291", "152099429", "147499207", "61239592", "12940684", "144528275", "150507170", "150507170", "143523808", "65305239", "143758091", "6667873", "2105042", "27952456", "59055427", "17683933", "56111827", "145607116", "17923874", "35582087", "8903620", "15933380", "945823", "146181141", "23877291", "60130674", "142023056", "953977", "9869102", "42454629", "63555534", "52200586", "145256249", "142744096", "143631748", "1077092", "25707750", "207688505", "29196950", "145429434", "143346178", "77950237", "143450017", "6211281", "1098532", "144168661", "60849547", "61092674", "20501973", "143319486", "144063861", "26759117", "144005853", "7042846", "5077352", "18877407", "15389327", "10232677", "206317675", "142554037", "145634745", "2556627", "143364811", "122266405", "34022194", "6069106", "142870652", "3926621", "43394269", "117537081", "43782223", "15177593", "144872038", "151249879", "9086366", "144135727", "5084085", "142280601", "24031629", "12412486", "20589031", "209070515", "14684885", "22868846", "8030958"], "inbound_citations": ["85501792", "203927886", "201895183", "13817453"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37746514"}

During colonoscopy, the lesions of colorectal tumors on the colon surface are visually inspected by a Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) zoom-videoendoscope. By using the visual appearance of colorectal tumors in endoscopic images, histological diagnosis is presumed based on classification schemes for NBI magnification findings. In this paper, we report on the performance of a recognition system for classifying NBI images of colorectal tumors into three types (A, B, and C3) based on the NBI magnification findings. To deal with the problem of computer-aided classification of NBI images, we explore a local feature-based recognition method, bag-of-visual-words (BoW), and provide extensive experiments on a variety of technical aspects. The proposed prototype system, used in the experiments, consists of a bag-of-visual-words representation of local features followed by Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. A number of local features are extracted by using sampling schemes such as Difference-of-Gaussians and grid sampling. In addition, in this paper we propose a new combination of local features and sampling schemes. Extensive experiments with varying the parameters for each component are carried out, for the performance of the system is usually affected by those parameters, e.g. the sampling strategy for the local features, the representation of the local feature histograms, the kernel types of the SVM classifiers, the number of classes to be considered, etc. The recognition results are compared in terms of recognition rates, precision/recall, and F-measure for different numbers of visual words.

Previous studies proposed that a support vector machine (SVM) that adopted the inner product as the kernel function was efficient for estimating HR to a certain extent. However, these studies did not present the effectiveness of other kernel functions, such as the hyperbolic tangent function. Therefore, this study identified a combination of kernel functions of the kernel ridge regression (KRR). In addition, features of vocal frequency to effectively estimate HR were investigated. To evaluate the effectiveness, experiments were conducted with two subjects. In the experiment, 60 sets of HRs and voice data were measured per subject. To identify the most effective kernel function, four kernel functions (the inner function, Gaussian function, polynomial function, and hyperbolic tangent function) were compared. Moreover, effective features of vocal frequency were selected with the sequential feature selection (SFS) method. As a consequence, the hyperbolic tangent function worked best, and high-frequency components of voice were efficient.

The training times of traditional back propagation algorithms, mostly used to model such tire identification processes, are far slower than desired for implementation of an on-line control system. Use of slow gradient based learning methods and iterative tuning of all network parameters during the learning process are the two major causes for such slower learning speed.

The paper investigates the effect of combining data from accelerometers placed at various bodily locations on the accuracy of activity detection. Eight healthy males participated within the study. Data were collected from six wireless tri-axial accelerometers placed at the chest, wrist, lower back, hip, thigh and foot. Activities included walking, running on a motorized treadmill, sitting, lying, standing and walking up and down stairs. The Support Vector Machine provided the most accurate detection of activities of all the machine learning algorithms investigated. Although data from all locations provided similar levels of accuracy, the hip was the best single location to record data for activity detection using a Support Vector Machine, providing small but significantly better accuracy than the other investigated locations. Increasing the number of sensing locations from one to two or more statistically increased the accuracy of classification. There was no significant difference in accuracy when using two or more sensors. It was noted, however, that the difference in activity detection using single or multiple accelerometers may be more pronounced when trying to detect finer grain activities.

Geological priors are built using intelligent techniques like Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Regression. The data driven methods reveal the hidden relationships among the variables that form the priors and also allow handling the associated uncertainty. Furthermore, we used the intelligent prior models to predict realistic parameter combinations which may not have been observed in the available data but are still plausible and may exist in nature. The intelligent prior models were combined with multiple point statistics (MPS) simulation for a test synthetic reservoir case study. Multiple point statistics (MPS) was chosen to model channel facies because of its capability of modelling realistic geobodies and adaptability to well and seismic data.

There is a body of literature that uses machine learning classification algorithms to predict development of T2D among patients. The current study compares the performance of these classification algorithms to identify patients who are at risk of developing T2D in short, medium and long terms. In addition, the list of predictor variables important for prediction for T2D progression is provided. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: This study uses 10,911 records generated in 36 clinics from the 15th of November 2008-15th of November 2016. Syntactic minority oversampling and random under sampling were used to create a balanced dataset. The performance of Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tress and Logistic Regression to identify patients developing T2D in short, medium and long terms was compared. The measures were Area Under Curve, Sensitivity, Specificity, Matthew correlation coefficient and Mean Calibration Error. Through importance analysis and information fusion techniques the predictors of developing T2D were identified for short, medium and long-term risk analysis. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The findings show that the performance of analytics techniques depends on both period and purpose of prediction whether the prediction is to identify people who will not develop T2D or to determine at risk patients. Oversampling as opposed to under sampling improved performance. 16 predictors and their importance to determine patients at risk of T2D in short, medium and long terms were identified. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: This study provides guidelines for an automated system to prompt patients for screening.

The salinity of Karun River has been increasing due to some critical factors, e.g., severe climate condition and regional physiography, industrial sources, domestic and urban sewerage, irrigation of agricultural land, fish hatchery, hospital sewage, and high tide level of Persian Gulf. This study aimed at building regression models to ascertain the water salinity through the relationship between the reflectance of the Landsat-8 OLI and In situ measurements. Accordingly, 102 In situ measurements have been collected from June 2013 to July 2018 along the Karun River, subsequently measured data was divided into 70:30 for training and test purposes. Besides, the Sobol\u2019 sensitivity analysis was applied to determine the best bands combination from the performance standpoint. The results of the Sobol\u2019 sensitivity analysis revealed that band 1- Coastal/Aerosol (0.433\u20130.453 \u00b5m), band 2-Blue (0.450\u20130.515 \u00b5m) and band 3 \u2013 Green (0.525\u20130.600 \u00b5m) are the best combinations and showed that Landsat-8 OLI band 2 has the closest correlation with the salinity. Furthermore, to have a comprehensive investigation, the Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) methods were applied. The number of layers and nodes in the MLP neural network is optimized using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), and GA has selected four layers and thirty neurons per layer. The OLS, SVR and MLP + GA models resulted in values of R 2 and RMSE for test data, which are respectively obtained to be 0.68 and 411 \u03bc s c m - 1 , 0.72 and 376 \u03bc s c m - 1 and 0.78 and 363 \u03bc s c m - 1 . Therefore, MLP + GA has had the best performance and accuracy. However, the corresponding values are acceptable considering the fact that the range of field data extensively changes from 385 and 4310. Eventually, water salinity maps were prepared by OLS, SVR and MLP + GA methods to demonstrate the water salinity on 1 February 2015 and 5 September 2018, afterward change detection maps were prepared to assess the water salinity on 1 February 2015 and 5 September 2018. The change detection maps illustrate that the pertinent salinity on 5 September 2018 is lower as compared to the data obtained on 1 February 2015, because not only the rainfall has increased, but the cane sugar cultivation has also decreased which is one of the effective factors on the salinity of the water.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asr.2019.12.007", "venue": null, "journal": "Advances in Space Research", "mag_id": "2996656737", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214112405"}

Therefore, it is necessary to provide alternative methods for its evaluation and detection.

Recovering patients would benefit greatly from a device that can be worn at home, is simple to use, and is relatively inexpensive. Using advances in information technology, the goal is to design a continuous, inexpensive, mobile and patient-centric mechanism for evaluation of a patient's pulmonary function. A light mobile mask is designed, fitted with CO2, O2, flow volume, and accelerometer sensors and tested on 18 subjects performing 15 minute exercises. The data collected from the device is stored in a cloud service and machine learning algorithms are used to train and predict a user's activity .Several classification techniques are compared - K Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Naive Bayes. One useful area of interest involves comparing a patient's predicted activity levels, especially using only breath data, to that of a normal person's, using the classification models.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1707.08169", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/HealthCom.2017.8210810", "venue": "2017 IEEE 19th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom)", "journal": "2017 IEEE 19th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2962894384,2950197719,2742026882", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["19054911", "8639112", "1041278", "4653178", "14508334", "6790862", "5040635", "3348287", "3258484"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19487768"}

Existing models have shown superior performance, but there are still several major issues that have not been fully taken into consideration. First, the historical variation pattern of the biomarker in diverse time scales plays a vital role in indicating the health status, but it has not been explicitly extracted by existing works. Second, key factors that strongly indicate the health risk are different among patients. It is still challenging to adaptively make use of the features for patients in diverse conditions. Third, using prediction models as the black box will limit the reliability in clinical practice. However, none of the existing works can provide satisfying interpretability and meanwhile achieve high prediction performance. In this work, we develop a general health status representation learning model, named AdaCare. It can capture the long and short-term variations of biomarkers as clinical features to depict the health status in multiple time scales. It also models the correlation between clinical features to enhance the ones which strongly indicate the health status and thus can maintain a state-of-the-art performance in terms of prediction accuracy while providing qualitative interpretability. We conduct a health risk prediction experiment on two real-world datasets.

For multimodal feature fusion, we present an Intra- and Inter-modal Multilinear pooling (IIM) model to effectively combine the multi-modal features with considering both the intra- and inter-modal feature interactions. Compared to existing multimodal fusion models, IIM can capture high-order interactions and is more capable for modeling temporal information of videos.

However, due to the limitations in hardware, scan time, and throughput, it is often clinically challenging to obtain high-quality MR images.

In this article, we propose an ensemble learning and deep learning framework for MR image super-resolution. In our study, we first enlarged low resolution images using five commonly used super-resolution algorithms and obtained differentially enlarged image datasets with complementary priors. Then, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is trained with each dataset to generate super-resolution MR images. Finally, another GAN is used for ensemble learning that synergizes the outputs of GANs into the final MR super-resolution images. According to our results, the ensemble learning results outperform any single GAN output component.

The dataset was taken from the Business Intelligence Cup organised by the University of Chile in 2004. Since it is a highly unbalanced dataset with 93% loyal and 7% churned customers, we employed (1) undersampling, (2) oversampling, (3) a combination of undersampling and oversampling and (4) the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for balancing it. Furthermore, tenfold cross-validation was employed. The results indicated that SMOTE achieved good overall accuracy. Also, SMOTE and a combination of undersampling and oversampling improved the sensitivity and overall accuracy in majority voting.

Despite a large number of DDoS detection and mitigation techniques exist in today, DDoS attacks continue to grow in attacks frequency, attacks volume and they are threatening the network security. There are two kinds of DDoS detection techniques; signature based and anomaly based detection. When the signature based detection technique uses network behaviors, the anomaly based detection uses machine learning techniques. In this paper, we propose the design of SDN based detection for DDoS attack. In this propose system design, we use Advanced Support Vector Machine (ASVM) algorithm in order to detect DDoS attack.

Pneumonitis thresholds were found for each feature individually using decision stumps. The performance of three different algorithms (Decision Trees, Random Forests, RUSBoost) was evaluated. Learning curves were developed and the training error analyzed and compared to the testing error in order to evaluate the factors needed to obtain a cross-validated error smaller than 0.1. These included the addition of new features, increasing the complexity of the algorithm and enlarging the sample size and number of events. In the univariate analysis, the most important feature selected was the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO adj%). On multivariate analysis, the three most important features selected were the dose to 15 cc of the heart, dose to 4 cc of the trachea or bronchus, and race. Higher accuracy could be achieved if the RUSBoost algorithm was used with regularization. To predict radiation pneumonitis within an error smaller than 10%, we estimate that a sample size of 800 patients is required. Clinically relevant thresholds that put patients at risk of developing radiation pneumonitis were determined in a cohort of 201 stage I NSCLC patients treated with SBRT. The consistency of these thresholds can provide radiation oncologists with an estimate of their reliability and may inform treatment planning and patient counseling.

However, it is still challenging to train powerful deep learning systems for lesion characterization, because there are often limited samples in different malignancy types and there exist considerable variabilities across images from multiple scanners in clinical practice. In this work, we propose a similarity steered generative adversarial network (SSGAN) coupled with pre-train and adaptive fine-turning of data from multiple scanners for lesion characterization. Specifically, SSGAN is based on adding a similarity discriminative measure in the conventional generative adversarial network to effectively generate more discrepant samples, while the adaptive fine-tune strategy is adopted to optimally make decisions on whether to use the pre-train layers or the fine-tune layers. Experimental results of pathologically confirmed malignancy of clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCCs) with MR images acquired by different scanners (GE, Philips and Siemens) demonstrate several intriguing characteristics of the proposed end-to-end framework for malignancy characterization of HCC as follows: (1) The proposed SSGAN remarkably improves the performance of lesion characterization and outperforms several recently proposed methods. (2) The adaptive fine-tuning combined with the proposed SSGAN can further improve the performance of lesion characterization in the context of limited data. (3) Clinical images acquired by one MR scanner for pre-train can be used to improve the characterization performance of images acquired by another MR scanner, outperforming the pre-train with ImageNet.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-32251-9_62", "venue": "MICCAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2980114376", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204027785"}

The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process.

{"paper_id": "64446450", "title": "Generalized Stacked Sequential Learning", "authors": [{"first": "Eloi", "middle": ["Puertas", "i"], "last": "Prats", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Over the past few decades, machine learning (ML) algorithms have become a very useful tool in tasks where designing and programming explicit, rule-based algorithms are infeasible. Some examples of applications where machine learning has been applied successfully are spam filtering, optical character recognition (OCR), search engines and computer vision. One of the most common tasks in ML is supervised learning, where the goal is to learn a general model able to predict the correct label of unseen examples from a set of known labeled input data. In supervised learning often it is assumed that data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d ). This means that each sample in the data set has the same probability distribution as the others and all are mutually independent. However, classification problems in real world databases can break this i.i.d. assumption. For example, consider the case of object recognition in image understanding. In this case, if one pixel belongs to a certain object category, it is very likely that neighboring pixels also belong to the same object, with the exception of the borders. Another example is the case of a laughter detection application from voice records. A laugh has a clear pattern alternating voice and non-voice segments. Thus, discriminant information comes from the alternating pattern, and not just by the samples on their own. Another example can be found in the case of signature section recognition in an e-mail. In this case, the signature is usually found at the end of the mail, thus important discriminant information is found in the context. Another case is part-of-speech tagging in which each example describes a word that is categorized as noun, verb, adjective, etc. In this case it is very unlikely that patterns such as [verb, verb, adjective, verb] occur. All these applications present a common feature: the sequence/context of the labels matters. Sequential learning (25) breaks the i.i.d. assumption and assumes that samples are not independently drawn from a joint distribution of the data samples X and their labels Y . In sequential learning the training data actually consists of sequences of pairs (x, y), so that neighboring examples exhibit some kind of correlation. Usually sequential learning applications consider one-dimensional relationship support, but these types of relationships appear very frequently in other domains, such as images, or video. Sequential learning should not be confused with time series prediction. The main difference between both problems lays in the fact that sequential learning has access to the whole data set before any prediction is made and the full set of labels is to be provided at the same time. On the other hand, time series prediction has access to real labels up to the current time t and the goal is to predict the label at t + 1. Another related but different problem is sequence classification. In this case, the problem is to predict a single label for an input sequence. If we consider the image domain, the sequential learning goal is to classify the pixels of the image taking into account their context, while sequence classification is equivalent to classify one full image as one class. Sequential learning has been addressed from different perspectives: from the point of view of meta-learning by means of sliding window techniques, recurrent sliding windows or stacked sequential learning where the method is formulated as a combination of classifiers; or from the point of view of graphical models, using for example Hidden Markov Models or Conditional Random Fields. In this thesis, we are concerned with meta-learning strategies. Cohen et al. (17) showed that stacked sequential learning (SSL from now on) performed better than CRF and HMM on a subset of problems called \u201csequential partitioning problems\u201d. These problems are characterized by long runs of identical labels. Moreover, SSL is computationally very efficient since it only needs to train two classifiers a constant number of times. Considering these benefits, we decided to explore in depth sequential learning using SSL and generalize the Cohen architecture to deal with a wider variety of problems.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2529025310", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64446450"}

Web service discovery allows a system to find services that meet the requirements of the users. One way to improve this type of discovery would consider not only the functional aspects of the required service, but also relevant aspects such as performance or availability to perform its functions. Moreover, this approach would allow a more efficient discovery process to obtain results closer to the user needs. In this paper we present an approach for Web service discovery through the use of machine learning algorithms for classification of Web services. For Web services matching our proposal takes into account quality of service (QoS) parameters, which include semantic information about each Web service. For semantic Web service specification we use the SAWSDL standard.

DaT density is commonly assessed by calculating the Striatum Binding Ratio (SBR).

While cycle consistency requires the simultaneous training of GXY and GY X, recent studies have shown that one-sided domain mapping can be achieved by preserving pairwise distances between images. Although cycle consistency and distance preservation successfully constrain the solution space, they overlook the special properties that simple geometric transformations do not change the semantic structure of images. Based on this special property, we develop a geometry-consistent generative adversarial network (GcGAN), which enables one-sided unsupervised domain mapping. GcGAN takes the original image and its counterpart image transformed by a predefined geometric transformation as inputs and generates two images in the new domain coupled with the corresponding geometry-consistency constraint.

The pre-defined category of the feed to be consumed by the aggregator does not always match the content being consumed and categorizing the content using the pre-defined category of the feed curtails user experience as users would not see all the contents belonging to their category of interest. A web aggregator was developed and this was integrated with the SVM classifier to automatically categorize feed content being consumed. The experimental results showed that the text classifier performs well in categorizing the content of feed being consumed and it also affirmed the disparity in the pre-defined category of the source feed and appropriate category of the consumed content. Keywords\u2014feed; aggregator; text classifier; svm I. INTRODUCTION Web feeds provide a way for websites especially those that are frequently updated to provide up to date information to their users. Feeds are provided in either RSS or Atom format. Users who are interested in consuming the content of feeds use an aggregator software called feed reader. Aggregator software can either be a windows or a web application and it collects feed contents from various sources in one view. With a feed reader, a user can have the latest content of his/her favourite website in one place; thereby reducing time spent checking different websites. A spin-off of feed readers is web aggregation sites. A web aggregation site is a website that has content from various feeds in one place. This makes it easier for users to view contents from various websites at once. It also removes the overhead of having to build the content of a feed aggregator by the user. Popular aggregation websites include newsnow.com, kicknews.com. When aggregators have to categorize the content consumed from feeds, they either use a predefined category that has been registered for the source of the feed or try to get the category from the meta-data supplied with the feed content. Using the predefined category of the source brings up scenario in which the category does not match the actual content being consumed. In some cases also, the category supplied in the meta-data would not match any of the categories set up in the aggregator. The categorization of content from feeds can be achieved via the use of Text Classifiers. Text Classifiers are algorithms that are used to carry out Text Categorization (TC). In formal terms, taking a document di from a set of documents D and categories {c1, c2, c3}, text categorization is assigning a category ci to document di (11). Example of text categorization algorithms include; K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM). In TC, documents may be classified in such a way that it can only belong to one category (single-label categorization) or can belong to multiple categories (multi-label categorization) (15). Multi-label categorization is better suited to aggregators because the content consumed from a feed can belong to multiple categories. Example, a story about a Nigerian footballer getting married to a Nollywood (Nigerian movie industry) actress can rightly belong to categories about sports, gossip and entertainment.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14569/IJACSA.2014.050915", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2101146914", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["458697", "17777178", "961425", "58506268", "2427083", "15407415", "11268594", "17494750", "3770261", "6795850", "8891283", "3091", "15739660"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1560404"}

Vapnik (1995) and a sparse approximation scheme that resembles the basis pursuit denoising algorithm (Chen, 1995; Chen, Donoho, and Saunders, 1995). SVM is a technique that can be derived from the structural risk minimization principle (Vapnik, 1982) and can be used to estimate the parameters of several different approximation schemes, including radial basis functions, algebraic and trigonometric polynomials, B-splines, and some forms of multilayer perceptrons. Basis pursuit denoising is a sparse approximation technique in which a function is reconstructed by using a small number of basis functions chosen from a large set (the dictionary). We show that if the data are noiseless, the modified version of basis pursuit denoising proposed in this article is equivalent to SVM in the following sense: if applied to the same data set, the two techniques give the same solution, which is obtained by solving the same quadratic programming problem.

To overcome this problem, several machine learning technique were proposed to classify P2P traffics. But in the real P2P network environment, new communities of peers often attend and old communities of peers often leave. It requires the identification methods to be capable of coping with concept drift, and updating the model incrementally. In this paper, we present a concept-adapting algorithm CluMC which is based on streaming data mining techniques to identify P2P applications in Internet traffic. The CluMC use micro-cluster structures which contain potential micro-cluster structures and outlier micro-cluster structures to classify the P2P traffic and discover the concept drift with limited memory. Our performance study over a number of real data sets that we captured at a main gateway router demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

Then, we train a classifier for detecting correct and incorrect pairs of questions and queries using kernel methods along with Support Vector Machines. ::: Experimental results on two different datasets show that our approach is viable to select the correct SQL query for a given natural language questions in two target domains. ::: ::: Given that preliminary results were encouraging we implemented an SQL query generator that creates the set of candidate SQL queries which we rerank with a SVM-ranker based on tree kernels. ::: In particular we exploit linguistic dependencies in the natural language question and the database metadata to build a set of plausible SELECT, WHERE and FROM clauses enriched with meaningful joins. Then, we combine all the clauses to get the set of all possible SQL queries, producing candidate queries to answer the question. This approach can be recursively applied to deal with complex questions, requiring nested sub-queries. ::: We sort the candidates in terms of scores of correctness using a weighting scheme applied to the query generation rules. ::: Then, we use a SVM ranker trained with structural kernels to reorder the list of question and query pairs, where both members are again represented as syntactic trees. ::: The f-measure of our model on standard benchmarks is in line with the best models (85% on the first question), which use external and expensive hand-crafted resources such as the semantic interpretation.

In this paper, we propose a modified LPA, called Spreading Activation Label Propagation Algorithm in order to solve the problem. This method assigns a property, called activation value, to each label, where pairs (label name, activation value) are propagated by spreading activation process and the LPA. Furthermore, this algorithm uses two weighting algorithms, where each of them corresponds to one variation of the proposed method.

In this regard, several studies make an effort to recognize individuals\u2019 stress using an Electroencephalogram (EEG). However, current EEG-based stress recognition frameworks have several drawbacks. First, they are mostly designed to recognize individuals\u2019 stress only in a controlled laboratory environment. Second, they do not take into account the changes in the EEG signals of different subjects under the same stressors. Third, most of the current stress recognition algorithms occur in an offline setting. To address these issues, this study proposes an EEG-based stress recognition framework that takes into account each subject's brainwave patterns to train the stress recognition classifier and continuously update its classifier based on new input signals in near real-time. The proposed framework first removes EEG signal artifacts, then extracts a broad range of EEG signal features, and finally applies different online multitask learning (OMTL) algorithms to recognize individuals\u2019 stress in near real time. The proposed framework was applied on the EEG collected in two environments\u2014first on the EEG collected in a controlled lab environment using a wired-EEG and second on the EEG collected at in the field using a wearable EEG device.

The proposed stress recognition framework continuously updates its classifier and therefore contributes to stress recognition for new stressful situations that are beyond the range of predefined stressful conditions in near real time both in a controlled lab environment and at real job sites.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30235150", "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2018.2870963", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2891457579", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["108510610", "11190438", "26032618", "12658769", "114323026", "29077606", "3303558", "25801294", "45619556", "14488719", "8076191", "22962095", "11334962", "142676880", "32066894", "647573", "27250610", "7560699", "115435445", "62036813", "10322718", "206791365", "117688100", "69839470", "1120458", "206597685", "11334962", "42793173", "7599491", "11636915", "14539870", "15321853", "23229428", "10035343", "16285681", "4640142", "1647039", "2409231", "17900996", "148094914", "16494240", "1013966", "18030083", "39153345", "205351511", "17702149", "55648129", "111718635", "148737411", "116127277", "69767838", "7520138", "1376989", "8396367", "15764546", "627438", "8514244", "10420876", "10436583", "1443517", "15173686", "117520153", "1101322", "14573187", "17002960", "14889684", "7095316", "16225011", "17630161", "145278842", "12905545", "4837807", "715932", "29133163", "206287627", "125829250", "286935", "144400673", "144000051", "26528026", "14886735", "54526444", "110039186"], "inbound_citations": ["195844855", "204968280"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52307902"}

Deriving an effective facial representation from original face images is a vital step for successful facial expression recognition. In this paper, we empirically evaluate facial representation based on statistical local features, Local Binary Patterns, for person-independent facial expression recognition. Different machine learning methods are systematically examined on several databases. Extensive experiments illustrate that LBP features are effective and efficient for facial expression recognition. We further formulate Boosted-LBP to extract the most discriminant LBP features, and the best recognition performance is obtained by using Support Vector Machine classifiers with Boosted-LBP features. Moreover, we investigate LBP features for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which is a critical problem but seldom addressed in the existing work. We observe in our experiments that LBP features perform stably and robustly over a useful range of low resolutions of face images, and yield promising performance in compressed low-resolution video sequences captured in real-world environments.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.imavis.2008.08.005", "venue": "Image Vis.

We observe that pragmatic reasoning helps primarily in the hardest cases: when the model must distinguish very similar colors, or when few utterances adequately express the target color. Our findings make use of a newly-collected corpus of human utterances in color reference games, which exhibit a variety of pragmatic behaviors.

Starting from these observations, several automated techniques have been developed in order to support learners in terms of efficiency and focus on the actual comprehension of the learning material. Our aim is to go one step further and determine how automatically identified reading strategies employed by pupils with age between 8 and 11 years can be related to their overall level of understanding.

Therefore, some variable selection procedure should be performed before the application of traditional data analysis methods, for reasons of both computational efficiency and problems related to overfitting. We describe here a \"wrapper\" strategy (SIZEFIT) for variable selection that uses a Random Forests classifier, coupled with various local search/optimization algorithms. We apply it to a large dataset consisting of 2,425 African-American and non-Hispanic white individuals genotyped for 4,869 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a coronary heart disease (CHD) case-cohort association study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities), using incident CHD and plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels as the dependent variables. We show that most SNPs can be safely removed from the dataset without compromising the predictive (classification) accuracy, with only a small number of SNPs (sometimes less than 100) containing any predictive signal. A statistical (SUMSTAT) approach is also applied to the dataset for comparison purposes. We describe a novel method for refining the subset of signal-containing SNPs (FIXFIT), based on an Extremal Optimization algorithm. Finally, we compare the top SNP rankings obtained by different methods and devise practical guidelines for researchers trying to generate a compact subset of predictive SNPs from genome-wide association datasets. Interestingly, there is a significant amount of overlap between seemingly very heterogeneous rankings. We conclude by constructing compact optimal predictive SNP subsets for CHD (less than 150 SNPs) and LDL (less than 300 SNPs) phenotypes, and by comparing various rankings for two well-known positive control SNPs for LDL in the apolipoprotein E gene.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2980837", "pubmed_id": "20047492", "doi": "10.1089/cmb.2008.0037", "venue": "Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology", "journal": "Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology", "mag_id": "2026136479", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52853324", "3060741", "145813518", "208557810", "36853263", "3321295", "9009614", "21029222", "12454277"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13683040"}

Our framework is based on a novel STacked Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (ST-CGAN), which is composed of two stacked CGANs, each with a generator and a discriminator. Specifically, a shadow image is fed into the first generator which produces a shadow detection mask. That shadow image, concatenated with its predicted mask, goes through the second generator in order to recover its shadow-free image consequently. In addition, the two corresponding discriminators are very likely to model higher level relationships and global scene characteristics for the detected shadow region and reconstruction via removing shadows, respectively.

However, the decision tree outperforms other classifiers with an accuracy rate of 99.0% followed by Random forest. That is the case because both of them have relatively same mechanism but the Random forest can build ensemble of decision tree. Although ensemble learning has been proved to produce superior results, but in our case the decision tree has outperformed its ensemble version.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1704.02799", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ISSN 1947-5500", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2613354317", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62429230", "15916359", "37971573", "2068950", "14538846", "5659983", "61959487", "8756558", "33239755", "110615307", "15916359", "15408185", "1054400", "12680685", "30236068", "16569965", "114227817", "30806637", "15555734", "57146809", "3519216", "14743614", "16525309"], "inbound_citations": ["4570740", "199018971"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4388147"}

Our sequence analysis confirms the great relevance of proline and reveals disproportionately high occurrences of glycine and serine at kink positions. The structural analysis shows significantly different solvent accessible surface area mean values for kinked and nonkinked helices. More important, we used this data set to validate string kernels for support vector machines as a new kink prediction method. Applying the new predictor, about 80% of all helices could be correctly predicted as kinked or nonkinked even when focusing on small helical fragments.

In this paper, we focus on automatically aligning faces in movies with their corresponding character names in scripts without requiring closed-captions/subtitles. We utilize the intuition that faces in a movie generally appear in the same sequential order as their names are mentioned in the script. We first apply standard techniques for face detection and tracking, and cluster similar face tracks together. Next, we apply a generative Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a discriminative Latent Conditional Random Field (LCRF) to align the clusters of face tracks with the corresponding character names.

Traditional network approaches to group identification encounter a variety of problems when the data to be analyzed involve two-mode networks, i.e., relations between two distinct sets of objects with no reflexive relation allowed within each set. In this paper we propose a relatively novel approach to the recognition and identification of social groups in data generated by network-based processes in the context of two-mode networks. Our approach is based on a family of learning algorithms called Support Vector Machines (SVM). The analytical framework provided by SVM provides a flexible statistical environment to solve classification tasks, and to reframe regression and density estimation problems. We explore the relative merits of our approach to the analysis of social networks in the context of the well known \u201cSouthern women\u201d (SW) data set collected by Davis Gardner and Gardner.

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves.

Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains.

CGCA has applied different methods for various applications, from glow curve deconvolution into isolated peaks, through semi-automatic software tools for detecting outliers, to software that discovers exceptional curves by using predefined rules. The method presented herein addresses the subject using a new approach in which a completely automatic algorithm is used for the accurate detection of anomalies in thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) glow curves. A Support Vector Machines (SVM) technique, which is a machine learning classification algorithm, is used for the first time for radiation dosimetry applications. The algorithm classifies glow curves into two categories: an acceptable i.e. 'regular' curve, or a curve that exhibits any kind of anomaly i.e. an 'anomalous' curve. The classification method treats the glow curves raw data as a large ensemble of statistical data, and tries to identify exceptional glow curve shapes by statistical means. This classification method is performed in three steps. First, a library of glow curves is manually classified by a human user of the system into the above two classes. Then an iterative training algorithm is applied to these glow curves. The final stage applies a method of comparison between an unidentified glow curve and these two pre-classified sets, and assesses a classification probability to each of the two classes. The results show between 96.2% and 97.7% accuracy of the correct classification to either one of the classes, depending on the admissible false negatives rate.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.radmeas.2018.07.014", "venue": null, "journal": "Radiation Measurements", "mag_id": "2884565271", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:105732390"}

To learn a metric without any constraint or class label information, most unsupervised metric learning algorithms appeal to projecting observed data onto a low-dimensional manifold, where geometric relationships such as local or global pairwise distances are preserved. However, the projection may not necessarily improve the separability of the data, which is the desirable outcome of clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised adaptive metric learning algorithm, called AML, which performs clustering and distance metric learning simultaneously. AML projects the data onto a low-dimensional manifold, where the separability of the data is maximized. We show that the joint clustering and distance metric learning can be formulated as a trace maximization problem, which can be solved via an iterative procedure in the EM framework.

Hence, early and accurate detection of AF is paramount. We present a matrix-and tensor-based method for AF detection in single-and multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. First, the recordings are compressed into one heartbeat via the singular value decomposition (SVD). These representative heartbeats, single-lead, are collected in a matrix with modes time and recordings. In the multi-lead case, we obtain a tensor with modes lead, time and recording. By modeling the matrix (tensor) with a (multilinear) SVD, each recording, as well as new recordings, can be expressed by a coefficient vector. The comparison of a new coefficient vector with those of the model set results in morphological features, which are combined with heart rate variability information in a Support Vector Machine classifier to detect AF. The SVD-based method is tested on the 2017 PhysioNet$/$CinC Challenge dataset, resulting in an F 1 -score of 0.77. The multilinear SVD-based method is applied on the MIT-BIH AF IB and AF TDB dataset, resulting in a perfect separation.

In this paper, we propose a novel discriminative Conditional Random Field (CRF) model for semantic context modeling in AIA, which is built over semantic concepts and treats an image as a whole observation without segmentation. Our model captures the interactions between semantic concepts from both semantic level and visual level in an integrated manner. Specifically, we employ graph structure to model contextual relationships between semantic concepts. The potential functions are designed based on linear discriminative models, which enables us to propose a novel decoupled hinge loss function for maximal margin parameter estimation. We train the model by solving a set of independent quadratic programming problems with our derived contextual kernel.

Hence, we propose a vehicle trajectory prediction approach that models the interaction among different types of vehicles with vastly different driving styles. These interactions are encapsulated in the form of a social context embedded in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to predict the trajectory of each vehicle at either a signalized or non-signalized intersection. The GAN model produces the most acceptable future trajectory among many choices that conform to past driving behavior as well as the trajectories of neighboring vehicles.

For the purpose of integrating the color information of PET with the anatomical structures of MRI to help doctors diagnose diseases better, a method for fusing brain PET and MRI images using tissue-aware conditional generative adversarial network (TA-cGAN) is proposed. Specifically, the process of fusing brain PET and MRI images is treated as an adversarial machine between retaining the color information of PET and preserving the anatomical information of MRI. More specifically, the fusion of PET and MRI images can be regarded as a min-max optimization problem with respect to the generator and the discriminator, where the generator attempts to minimize the objective function via generating a fused image mainly contains the color information of PET, whereas the discriminator tries to maximize the objective function through urging the fused image to include more structural information of MRI. Both the generator and the discriminator in TA-cGAN are conditioned on the tissue label map generated from MRI image, and are trained alternatively with joint loss.

On the other hand, it is also essential to ensure them to determine what they can not achieve in certain cases due to either anomalies or permanent failures during task execution. Robots need to identify these situations, and reveal the reasons behind these cases to overcome and recover from them. In this paper, we propose and analyze a Long Short-Term Memories-based (LSTM-based) awareness approach to reveal the reasons behind an anomaly case that occurs during a manipulation episode in an unstructured environment. The proposed method takes into account the real-time observations of the robot by fusing visual, auditory and proprioceptive sensory modalities to achieve this task. We also provide a comparative analysis of our method with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).

We developed and evaluated a data-driven approach for identifying clinical actions such as omissions of medication orders or laboratory orders in the intensive care unit (ICU) that are unusual with respect to past patient care. We generated 250 medication-omission alerts and 150 laboratory-omission alerts using a database of 24,658 ICU patient admissions. These alerts were evaluated by a group of intensive care physicians. Overall, the true positive alert rate was 0.52, which we view as quite promising. Introduction Medical errors remain a significant problem in healthcare. We developed an outlier-based monitoring and alerting method that relies on past patient data and on statistical methods for the identification of unusual clinical actions [1,2,3]. We evaluated our approach on EMR data for ICU patients. Our conjecture is that the detection of unusual clinical actions (e.g., medication orders and lab orders) will help identify medical errors. We believe outlier-based monitoring and alerting can complement the use of knowledge-based alerting systems that are currently deployed, thereby improving overall clinical coverage of current alerting systems. Methods We used electronic medical record (EMR) data from 24,658 ICU patient stays that included time-stamped data on medications, laboratory and physiological measurements. Each patient stay record was segmented into several timeseries of increasing lengths of time (in 24 hour increments), and each time-series was summarized by a vector of over 12,500 temporal features [3,4]; this vector represented a patient instance. The data was split into a training set of 225,894 patient instances and a test set of 104,698 patient instances. We built a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predicting each type of action (medication orders and laboratory orders) from the training set and applied the models to the test set for identifying omissions of medication orders and laboratory orders. We developed an alert score [2,3] computed from the SVM model predictions which measures how unusual the actions for the patients are. The alert score allows rank-ordering of alerts that are generated for each action and also allows the control of the rate at which alerts are raised for each clinical action by selecting an alert score threshold. We control the alert threshold as follows. Let A be a specific clinical action (e.g., aspirin order) and PosRate(A) be the average rate at which that clinical action is done (e.g., rate at which aspirin is prescribed in the ICU population). We limit the clinical action alert rate to AlertRate(A) = \u03b1 x PosRate(A) where PosRate(A) is estimated from the training set. With this method, the alert rate can be increased or decreased by changing the multiplier \u03b1. Results We built SVM models for 1075 different medication orders and 222 types of laboratory orders. Out of all the alert models, 99 laboratory and 156 medication omission models were strong alert models based on \u2265 0.75 AUC ROC and \u2265 0.3 positive predictive value thresholds. From the strong models we randomly selected 85 medications and 45 labs models and used them to generate 400 alerts that included 250 medication-omission alerts and 150 laboratoryomission alerts. The alerts were evaluated by 16 physicians from the Departments of Critical Care Medicine and Surgery. Based on the evaluations, the true positive alert rate (TPAR) using \u03b1=0.05 is 0.52, which we view as quite promising. The TPAR for medication-order alerts and the same threshold was 0.44 and the TPAR for laboratoryorder alerts was 0.66. Given \u03b1=0.05 and the strong alert models identified in the study, we estimate the outlier-based alerting system (if deployed) would raise in between 0.55 to 0.95 alerts per patient per day.

A lot of works have developed successful algorithms and empirically observed positive transfer effect that improves target generalization error using source knowledge. However, theoretical analysis of transfer learning is more challenging due to the nature of the problem and thus is less studied. In this report, we do a survey of theoretical works in transfer learning and summarize key theoretical guarantees that prove the effectiveness of transfer learning. The theoretical bounds are derived using model complexity and learning algorithm stability. As we should see, these works exhibit a trade-off between tight bounds and restrictive assumptions. Moreover, we also prove a new generalization bound for the multi-source transfer learning problem using the VC-theory, which is more informative than the one proved in previous work.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1810.05986", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2896374939", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["59566327", "888650", "14688775", "12757870", "38075267", "10014803", "207597853", "1157797", "6742009", "63308791", "2497886", "840925", "597779", "3518273"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53112936"}

We hypothesize that close range hyperspectral imaging is able to uncover stress related processes non-destructively in the early stages which are invisible to the human eye. We propose an approach which combines unsupervised and supervised methods in order to identify several stages of progressive stress development from series of hyperspectral images. Stress of an entire plant is detected by stress response levels at pixel scale. The focus is on drought stress in barley ( Hordeum vulgare ). Unsupervised learning is used to separate hyperspectral signatures into clusters related to different stages of stress response and progressive senescence. Whereas all such signatures may be found in both, well watered and drought stressed plants, their respective distributions differ. Ordinal classification with Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used to quantify and visualize the distribution of progressive stages of senescence and to separate well watered from drought stressed plants. For each senescence stage a distinctive set of most relevant Vegetation Indices (VIs) is identified.

To learn the parameters of the multi-component model, a transductive learning algorithm is leveraged to \"transfer\" the information of the labeled frames to the unlabeled frames in a tree-structured model, namely, temporal tree. Each branch of the temporal tree consists of the exemplars of a foreground component, and a transductive support vector regressor is capable of being trained.

They have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the image domain. However, GANs are limited in two ways.

In this paper, we develop the prescribed GAN (PresGAN) to address these shortcomings. PresGANs add noise to the output of a density network and optimize an entropy-regularized adversarial loss. The added noise renders tractable approximations of the predictive log-likelihood and stabilizes the training procedure. The entropy regularizer encourages PresGANs to capture all the modes of the data distribution. Fitting PresGANs involves computing the intractable gradients of the entropy regularization term; PresGANs sidestep this intractability using unbiased stochastic estimates. We evaluate PresGANs on several datasets and found they mitigate mode collapse and generate samples with high perceptual quality. We further found that PresGANs reduce the gap in performance in terms of predictive log-likelihood between traditional GANs and variational autoencoders (VAEs).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1910.04302", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2979776030", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2057420", "92998483", "53018855", "52947374", "3614357", "3554631", "748227", "52889459", "13669032", "188652742", "49742003", "189762123", "61164636", "84591", "6104263", "9127770", "6644398", "4879286", "1033682", "19115748", "326772", "6200260", "124371360", "60578841", "211022860", "6628106", "18268744", "59222790", "211227", "536962", "1482745", "459456", "122200499", "605416", "6610705", "7585417", "6875312", "14570343", "11112994", "107645", "11758569", "49526847", "16895865", "55855867", "34040907", "1687220", "59316651", "16046818", "6138149", "120143121", "9302801", "12977196", "51934350", "53857882", "9738695", "13583585", "29168097", "145035448", "3532229"], "inbound_citations": ["211532294"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204008419"}

Linear unmixing assumes that pixels are convex combinations of endmember spectra, hence endmember identification is required prior to unmixing processes. In our approach to non-linear unmixing by Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) regression ensembles, we do not need to perform endmember identification, which is implicit in the non-linear transformation. Instead we provide estimates of the fractional abundances of predefined material classes, which have been characterized by pure pixels extracted from the image according to available ground truth. In this paper, we introduce a formal discussion of the convergence properties of ELM regression ensembles that endorses the empirical results. The analysis shows them to converge to the exact regression value when the number of components of the ensemble grows, provided that the output is the average of the individual outputs. Besides, the proposed approach allows for a general validation procedure based on the reconstruction error over the entire hyperspectral image. Reconstruction error can be estimated using the mapping from fractional abundances to reconstructed spectra, also achieved by ELM regression ensembles.

To generate the content-aware masks with good visual consistency, we formulate it as a label propagation process from a semi-supervised learning perspective, where the intensity of the initialized masks are propagated to the whole masks based on the local visual similarity of the images. Then, we construct a content-aware face blending framework that consists of three stages. Firstly, the facial region of the reference and the target are aligned according to the detected facial landmarks. Secondly, a facial quotient image and a binary mask are obtained as the initialized masks, and the content-aware masks for illumination and region adjustment are generated using the label propagation model with different guided feature.

It is estimated that in 2019, only because of melanoma nearly 7,230 people will die, and 192,310 cases of malignant melanoma will be diagnosed. Nonetheless, nearly all types of skin lesions can be treatable if they can be diagnosed at an earlier stage. The accurate prediction of skin lesions is critically challenging task even for vastly experienced clinicians and dermatologist due to a little distinction between surrounding skin and lesions, visual resemblance between melanoma and other skin lesions, fuddled lesion border, etc. A well-grounded automated computer-aided skin lesions detection system can help clinicians vigorously to prognosis malignant skin lesion in the earliest possible time. From the past few years, the emergence of machine learning and deep learning in the medical imaging has produced several image-based classification systems in the medical field and these systems perform better than traditional image processing classification methods. In this paper, we proposed a popular deep learning technique namely atrous or, dilated convolution for skin lesions classification, which are known to be better as it enhances accuracy with the same amount of computational cost compared to tradition CNN. To implement atrous convolution we choose the transfer learning technique with several popular deep learning architectures such as VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet, and InceptionV3. To train, validation, and test our proposed models we utilize HAM10000 dataset which contains total 10015 dermoscopic images of seven different skin lesions (melanoma, melanocytic nevi, Basal cell carcinoma, Benign keratosis-like lesions, Dermatofibroma, Vascular lesions, and Actinic keratoses). Four of our proposed dilated convolutional frameworks show promising outcome on overall accuracy and per-class accuracy. For example, overall test accuracy achieved 87.42%, 85.02%, 88.22%, and 89.81% on dilated VGG19, dilated VGG16, dilated MobileNet, and dilated IncaptionV3 respectively.

However, the current SOGNN lacks effective and stable judgment indicators for the scale of network node growth, thereby failing to effectively evaluate and control the reasonable size of the output space. To this end, this paper proposes a judgment index, i.e., expected quantization error stability (EQES), to objectively judge the approximation degree of the output space to the input space. Based on the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) algorithm, an improved GNG algorithm, called GNG-EQES, is proposed, which introduces the EQES criterion to enable the GNG algorithm to generate an appropriate number of output network nodes autonomously without pre-determining the size of the output network. This not only improves the accuracy of feature extraction of the SOGNN, but also improves its adaptive ability and expands its application scope.

Despite this, also in the use of these techniques several aspects can be still considered open problems, including: 1) the trade-off between separation performance and training time; 2) the separation of handwriting from different types of freehand drawings.

We apply this vector encoding to the study of the relative importance of various amino acid physicochemical properties upon the substitution matrices. We also characterize and compare the PAM and BLOSUM series substitution matrices.ConclusionsThis vector encoding introduces a Euclidian metric in the amino acid space, consistent with substitution matrices. Such a numerical description of the amino acid is useful when intrinsic properties of amino acids are necessary, for instance, building sequence profiles or finding consensus sequences, using machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks algorithms.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3098074", "pubmed_id": "20047649", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-11-4", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2032574080", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17305572", "13389189", "13742100", "189884665", "84692404", "31805574", "344505", "115053", "46383987", "63491196", "29421114", "14290622", "9326944", "28248657", "26404821", "469600", "7270093", "2792220", "35664863"], "inbound_citations": ["9342625", "17726716", "206524601", "1154633", "208329574"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1504766"}

Among these, Cognitive Source Coding (CSC) schemes (defined in analogy with Cognitive Radio systems) make possible to improve the quality of the 3D QoE at the receiver by adapting the source coding strategy according to the state of the transmission channel and to the characteristics of the coded signal. This knowledge also permits an optimization of the computational complexity required at the encoder. The paper presents a CSC architecture that analyzes the 3D scene, identifies the different elements, and chooses the most appropriate coding strategy via a classification of the features of each element based on Support Vector Machine theory.

Especially in object localization, deep convolutional neural networks outperform traditional approaches based on extraction of data/task-driven features instead of hand-crafted features. Although location information of region-of-interests (ROIs) gives good prior for object localization, it requires heavy annotation efforts from human resources. Thus a weakly supervised framework for object localization is introduced. The term \"weakly\" means that this framework only uses image-level labeled datasets to train a network. With the help of transfer learning which adopts weight parameters of a pre-trained network, the weakly supervised learning framework for object localization performs well because the pre-trained network already has well-trained class-specific features. However, those approaches cannot be used for some applications which do not have pre-trained networks or well-localized large scale images. Medical image analysis is a representative among those applications because it is impossible to obtain such pre-trained networks. In this work, we present a \"fully\" weakly supervised framework for object localization (\"semi\"-weakly is the counterpart which uses pre-trained filters for weakly supervised localization) named as self-transfer learning (STL). It jointly optimizes both classification and localization networks simultaneously. By controlling a supervision level of the localization network, STL helps the localization network focus on correct ROIs without any types of priors. We evaluate the proposed STL framework using two medical image datasets, chest X-rays and mammograms, and achieve signiticantly better localization performance compared to previous weakly supervised approaches.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1602.01625", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2406842765", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14177182", "5232411", "206597351", "2972501", "8601873", "1241368", "9272368", "3334390", "68362967", "5561023", "14939174", "1799558", "206592218", "195908774", "206592664", "15916373", "7656505", "4071727", "14970392", "56649461", "206592484", "206592152", "9427281", "862667", "7788346", "4229525", "10848380", "17100949"], "inbound_citations": ["4903005", "4444760", "198316798", "13829819", "79788551", "198963361", "155106937", "204970703", "65521745", "52289754", "52889887", "52072500", "52891458", "53719413", "4940580", "213485852", "174798521", "3654898", "2088679"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18360974"}

It is a crucial variable of various economic and process-based models. Rice is grown under irrigated triple- and double-rice cropping systems and a rainfed single-rice cropping system in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). These rice cropping systems are adopted according to the geographical location and water infrastructure. However, little work has been done to map triple-cropping of rice using Sentinel-1 along with the effects of water infrastructure on the rice cropping intensity decision. This study is focused on monitoring rice cropping patterns in the An Giang province of the VMD from March 2017 to March 2018. The fieldwork was carried out on the dates close to the Sentinel-1A acquisition. The results of dual-polarized (VV and VH) Sentinel-1A data show a strong correlation with the spatial patterns of various rice growth stages and their association with the water infrastructure. The VH backscatter (\u03c3\u00b0) is strongly correlated with the three rice growth stages, especially the reproductive stage when the backscatter is less affected by soil moisture and water in the rice fields. In all three cropping patterns, \u03c3\u00b0VV and \u03c3\u00b0VH show the highest value in the maturity stage, often appearing 10 to 12 days before the harvesting of the rice. A rice cropping pattern map was generated using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification of Sentinel-1A data. The overall accuracy of the classification was 80.7% with a 0.78 Kappa coefficient.

These problems are generally more difficult than their binary counterparts. In this scenario, decomposition strategies usually improve the performance of classifiers. Hence, in this paper, we aim to improve the behavior of fuzzy association rule-based classification model for high-dimensional problems (FARC-HD) fuzzy classifier in multiclass classification problems using decomposition strategies, and more specifically One-versus-One (OVO) and One-versus-All (OVA) strategies. However, when these strategies are applied on FARC-HD, a problem emerges due to the low-confidence values provided by the fuzzy reasoning method. This undesirable condition comes from the application of the product t -norm when computing the matching and association degrees, obtaining low values, which are also dependent on the number of antecedents of the fuzzy rules. As a result, robust aggregation strategies in OVO, such as the weighted voting obtain poor results with this fuzzy classifier. In order to solve these problems, we propose to adapt the inference system of FARC-HD replacing the product t -norm with overlap functions . To do so, we define n-dimensional overlap functions . The usage of these new functions allows one to obtain more adequate outputs from the base classifiers for the subsequent aggregation in OVO and OVA schemes. Furthermore, we propose a new aggregation strategy for OVO to deal with the problem of the weighted voting derived from the inappropriate confidences provided by FARC-HD for this aggregation method. The quality of our new approach is analyzed using 20 datasets and the conclusions are supported by a proper statistical analysis. In order to check the usefulness of our proposal, we carry out a comparison against some of the state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers.

First, a classification approach is presented for water cut prediction in sweet oil wells with discontinuous salt production patterns.

In this paper, we propose to record depth video and audio of a patient using a Microsoft Kinect camera during his/her sleep, and extract relevant features to correlate with obstructive respiratory events scored manually by a scientific officer based on data collected by Philips system Alice6 LDxS that is commonly used in sleep clinics. Specifically, we first propose an alternating-frame H.264 video encoding scheme and bit recovery scheme at the decoder. Next, we perform depth video temporal denoising using a motion vector graph smoothness prior. Then, we build a dual-ellipse model and track a patient's chest and abdominal movements in the denoised videos. Finally, we extract features from both depth video and audio for classifier training and respiratory event detection. Experimental results show 1) that our depth video compression scheme outperforms a competitor that records only the 8 most significant bits, 2) our graph-based temporal denoising scheme reduces the flickering effect without over-smoothing, and 3) our trained classifiers can deduce respiratory events scored manually based on data collected by system Alice6 LDxS with high accuracy.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TMM.2016.2626969", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Multimedia", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Multimedia", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2544561741", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13666329", "16697920", "11655556", "118448307", "59766734", "121690164", "4428232", "2095855", "1652902", "202703868", "7076156", "7287973", "13927343", "18986511", "7240756", "12890729", "19717073", "3266048", "15714001", "51143574", "12204341", "21373857", "62100706", "2935401", "5230607", "61962167", "8886546", "1935370", "42785894", "14356204", "52806737", "17463440", "379327", "5616845", "12553643", "61601990", "15982848", "13987020", "280056", "9539186", "14308539", "37925315", "17657264", "10400192", "6519926", "53784552", "2208295", "12537772", "2387582", "379259", "15943670", "39907088", "12077254", "1034927", "15874442", "60076811", "1150626", "54124999", "800241"], "inbound_citations": ["204700772", "25291454", "52165892", "52940208", "196402811", "109941273", "211831772", "203704094"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206752882"}

Normally, many measured signals are required to design a detector with the desired level of performance as posited by pattern recognition studies. However, obtaining experimental data for the passing of a real ship over an upward-facing active sonar system in various situations is unrealistic. Therefore, this paper proposes a new bubble-wake detector using a pattern recognition technique such as the one-class kernel support vector machine that only uses the data obtained from an isolated situation in the absence of a ship's bubble wake. The proposed detector shows promising performance after being tested with an upward-facing sonar system in a real ocean environment and then artificially adds various noise levels to ship data to verify the robustness of the detector in a low signal-to-noise ratio.

Several data retrieving techniques including sentence segmentation, term weighting, and feature extraction are used in preprocess.

The traditional solution is to add misclassified documents to the training set in order to adjust classification rules.

A general approach is proposed to utilize decision values in SVM to identify indistinguishable documents.

Experiments report that indistinguishable documents are able to be identified in a high probability and are informative for learning strategies.

The proportion of the use of two algorithms is decided by a control parameter. In this way, HSOMA can increase the population diversity and improve the convergence speed. HSOMA is tested on several complex benchmark functions taken from literature and its efficiency is compared with SOMA, the continuous domain Population- Based Incremental Learning algorithm(PBILc) and hybrid migrating behavior based self-organizing migrating algorithm(HBSOMA).

However, prediction models derived from such repositories should maintain strict privacy of individuals. We propose a novel random forest algorithm under the framework of differential privacy. Unlike previous works that strictly follow differential privacy and keep the complete data distribution approximately invariant to change in one data instance, we only keep the necessary statistics (e.g. variance of the estimate) invariant. This relaxation results in significantly higher utility. To realize our approach, we propose a novel differentially private decision tree induction algorithm and use them to create an ensemble of decision trees. We also propose feasible adversary models to infer about the attribute and class label of unknown data in presence of the knowledge of all other data. Under these adversary models, we derive bounds on the maximum number of trees that are allowed in the ensemble while maintaining privacy. We focus on binary classification problem and demonstrate our approach on four real-world datasets. Compared to the existing privacy preserving approaches we achieve significantly higher utility.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2015.76", "venue": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining", "journal": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2242728483", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207676583", "9900194", "60993494", "1578541", "16445768", "10771856", "2565493", "2468323", "207181133", "16469351", "53882203", "1359101", "206785445", "14895450", "56953810", "5812674", "17809969", "29277911", "4593629", "13252401", "17482923", "15965667"], "inbound_citations": ["207847245", "13360461", "57365426", "1359799", "199508684", "208283172", "208283172", "11853471", "21698905", "208883033", "52023233", "3980623", "36354949", "53734015", "207830602", "211041711", "145909191", "29687673", "43966479"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17170526"}

The generated image shows the future location of the typhoon center, as well as the future cloud structures. The errors between predicted and real typhoon centers are measured quantitatively in kilometers. 42.4% of all typhoon center predictions have absolute errors of less than 80 km, 32.1% lie within a range of 80 - 120 km and the remaining 25.5% have accuracies above 120 km. The relative error sets the above mentioned absolute error in relation to the distance that has been traveled by a typhoon over the past 6 hours. High relative errors are found in three types of situations, when a typhoon moves on the open sea far away from land, when a typhoon changes its course suddenly and when a typhoon is about to hit the mainland. The cloud structure prediction is evaluated qualitatively. It is shown that the GAN is able to predict trends in cloud motion.

Human motion patterns are abstracted into a dynamic stochastic model, which can be used for both subsequent motion recognition and generation, analogous to the mirror neuron hypothesis in primates. The model size is adaptable based on the discrimination requirements in the associated region of the current knowledge base. A new algorithm for sequentially training the Markov chains is developed, to reduce the computation cost during model adaptation. As new motion patterns are observed, they are incrementally grouped together using hierarchical agglomerative clustering based on their relative distance in the model space. The clustering algorithm forms a tree structure, with specialized motions at the tree leaves, and generalized motions closer to the root. The generated tree structure will depend on the type of training data provided, so that the most specialized motions will be those for which the most training has been received. Tests with motion capture data for a variety of motion primitives demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1177/0278364908091153", "venue": null, "journal": "The International Journal of Robotics Research", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2043152589", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15410807", "13928830", "9521533", "2060194", "31180788", "16927686", "11810685", "5679082", "10992646", "1739670", "6632209", "519313", "15564406", "2570955", "14327674", "5754481", "12744045", "16201457", "9205119", "7814759", "768828", "15316730", "107798378", "15009135", "12012632", "175992", "60893379", "893812", "32729683", "13618539", "1729870", "6792943", "15148826", "16542114", "61917820", "12902938", "15993962", "14962437", "7280495"], "inbound_citations": ["3844453", "29170260", "1790934", "8386189", "64941894", "58838762", "18978252", "13818577", "14995216", "15648363", "14619155", "9576852", "2398678", "19224399", "14323762", "16703135", "16735011", "210889163", "1152751", "2436412", "864716", "202560586", "11523737", "15028711", "6752991", "15819639", "1796944", "16880658", "9880669", "209382438", "2476779", "18883987", "208508260", "56005683", "16800922", "14908965", "58209633", "54073545", "9605337", "718967", "201904600", "10276329", "14433339", "2401189", "208202216", "18867542", "11426523", "16278029", "1568185", "15302402", "2813178", "2257253", "4825965", "38895231", "36509943", "7253953", "55359601", "9363332", "11846390", "1275528", "125613136", "10746557", "8996856", "4899761", "12642596", "6566307", "111064844", "14694480", "18095377", "21248742", "201241992", "1867073", "1756230", "6871506", "13458563", "17359929", "1900090", "15376610", "2043069", "8553126", "7408071", "15656000", "12470710", "15299193", "206760655", "2996949", "7849486", "13533418", "14693728", "6959855", "932881", "10321622", "14315446", "8676573", "26231695", "201034741", "14412884", "77380058", "14206954", "3032303", "78092525", "312833", "1126078", "14075153", "30846768", "37874637", "10895196", "27137455", "2504470", "3041564", "8104326", "8377738", "17044754", "3439067", "7918902", "41564576", "11728002", "53718039", "16749256", "8577510", "52847129", "57757006", "117490481", "25847138", "15930717", "7685263", "5833723", "15269134", "9634113", "1471970", "11154506", "40116602", "51741140"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:40874680"}

With the huge number of formation of data, the data wants to be lectured in a limit to the charge of growth. But it is complex to get over the set of meaningful information from the continuous set of data. Data-stream mining is a method which can discover important information from a huge contract of prehistoric data. For identification of useful information, the classification of continuous data streams is done. Current approaches in classifying the data streams are processed using supervised learning algorithms, which can be qualified with tagged data. Usually, manual classification of data is both expensive and time consuming. As a result, where massive amount of data emerge at a high speed, tagged data might be very sparse. Therefore, only a restricted amount of training data might be accessible for constructing the classification models, tend to badly trained classifiers. To overcome the issue, in this work, a novel technique is presented to build a classification set having both unlabeled and a small amount of labeled instances. This model is built by using the Flow Classification Algorithm (FCA). The FC algorithm is able to judge internally on set of marked data. Before classification, the correlation set of attributes in the each record set are grouped using bucketization technique. The superiority of models updated from them is enough for utilization of unlabeled records, or whether more set of labeled records are needed for classification is processed. Experimental evalaution is conducted to the proposed FC technqiue over its counterparts to find a set of diverse solution in terms of execution time, classification accuracy and security. Performance metrics for evaluation of proposed FCA technique shows that the security level is 10-15% high against existing work.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5120/14063-2245", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Computer Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2145260648", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15512146", "1047282", "4570899", "5732144", "772046", "18060947", "16514880", "7553359", "13648731", "14751081", "16572110", "16984232"], "inbound_citations": ["58289067"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17152882"}

One of the more remarkable and least understood quality of SGD is that it generalizes relatively well on unseen data even when the neural network has millions of parameters. In this work, we show that SGD is an extreme case of deep gradient boosting (DGB) and as such is intrinsically regularized. The key idea of DGB is that back-propagated gradients calculated using the chain rule can be viewed as pseudo-residual targets. Thus at each layer the weight update is calculated by solving the corresponding gradient boosting problem. We hypothesize that some learning tasks can benefit from a more lax regularization requirement and this approach provides a way to control that. We tested this hypothesis on a number of benchmark data sets and show that indeed in a subset of cases DGB outperforms SGD and under-performs on tasks that are more prone to over-fitting, such as image recognition.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1907.12608", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2964524078", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["195953", "94886265", "7636159", "538820", "6644398", "7955044", "16190154", "1697424", "5808102", "6628106", "60282629", "6101385", "15539264", "6844431", "207975157", "3273477"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198985863"}

This study models groundwater level (GWL) of the Kabodarahang region using two novel techniques including Self-Adaptive Extreme Learning Machine (SAELM) and Wavelet-Self-Adaptive Extreme Learning Machine (WA-SAELM). Using the stepwise selection as different lags along with different input combinations, ten different SAELM and WA-SAELM models were developed. First, the best activation function is chosen for numerical models. After that, GWL values were normalized to equalize the values and enhance speed and accuracy of modeling. Then, an optimized mother wavelet is selected in order to simulate GWLs. Next, the best model was introduced as the superior model in which values of the correlation coefficient (R), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSC) were obtained 0.969, 0.358 and 0.939, respectively. In addition, the results of the superior model are compared with classical neural network models such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Wavelet-Artificial Neural Network (WA-ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Wavelet-Support Vector Machine (WA-SVM). Among all models, WA-SAELM approximated GWLs with higher accuracy. Furthermore, based on the results obtained from an uncertainty analysis, the superior model was identified as a model with an underestimated performance. Additionally, an explicit and practical matrix was proposed for computing GWLs.

The generator projects the image and the text features into an aligned representation space, while the discriminator ensures that the image and text features are not too far from each other, in a way which would maintain the semantic relation between the input samples. That is, ALWD reformulates the cross-modal retrieval as an image-text domain adaptation problem aiming at reducing domain discrepancy. To learn domain invariant representations, a domain critic network is adopted to estimate Wasserstein distance between different modal distributions and the feature extractor network is optimized to minimize the Wasserstein distance under an adversarial manner. Meanwhile, ALWD introduces additive margin softmax function to make sure the learned representations should also be discriminative in label prediction. Furthermore, a structure preservation constraint is imposed to keep local structure consistent during the learning process. Extensive comparison experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that ALWD outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-36708-4_2", "venue": "ICONIP", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2996235380", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209339134"}

This demands the ability to synthesize and reconstruct high-quality point-clouds. Current deep generative models for 3D data generally work on simplified representations (e.g., voxelized objects) and cannot deal with the inherent redundancy and irregularity in point-clouds. A few recent efforts on 3D point-cloud generation offer limited resolution and their complexity grows with the increase in output resolution. In this paper, we develop a principled approach to synthesize 3D point-clouds using a spectral-domain Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Our spectral representation is highly structured and allows us to disentangle various frequency bands such that the learning task is simplified for a GAN model. As compared to spatial-domain generative approaches, our formulation allows us to generate arbitrary number of points high-resolution point-clouds with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose a fully differentiable block to transform from {the} spectral to the spatial domain and back, thereby allowing us to integrate knowledge from well-established spatial models. We demonstrate that Spectral-GAN performs well for point-cloud generation task. Additionally, it can learn {a} highly discriminative representation in an unsupervised fashion and can be used to accurately reconstruct 3D objects.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1912.01800", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2992393483", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["395534", "1282515", "122817218", "6598262", "326772", "53585081", "53691187", "14803274", "182952853", "9597281", "3934562", "2475577", "5115938", "1009127", "145052179", "2782113", "17648673", "12072922", "53114248", "62775631", "41805341", "1541706", "3248075", "206592833", "1309931", "4564025", "195750453", "21706467", "2880712", "1277217", "285105"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208617590"}

In this chapter, we develop methods of applying Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a computational learning algorithm, in analyzing unstructured conversations of non-native English speakers, both schizophrenias and controls. In this case, the use of conventional language features, such as syntactic and semantic information, is limited because of the nature of participants: multi-cultural, non-native English speakers, and unstructured conversations. A two-level hierarchical classifier was developed that predicts specific SLD items (e.g., poverty of speech) and makes the final diagnostic decisions by combining the SLD assessment results to provide an overall assessment of the underlying mental condition. In particular, we evaluate the SVM classifiers as to their ability to predict SLD items on two mental health assessments: the Thought, Language and Communication Scale (TLC) and the Clinical Language Disorder Rating Scale (CLANG).", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-38550-6_5", "venue": "Studies in Computational Intelligence", "journal": "Studies in Computational Intelligence", "mag_id": "159487687", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["44180967", "143424026"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:140788921"}

One widely accepted such set of indicators is prescribed for habitat conservation status assessment within Natura 2000, a continental-scale conservation programme of the European Union. Essential Biodiversity Variables are a set of indicators designed to be relevant for biodiversity and suitable for global-scale operational monitoring. Here we revisit a study of Natura 2000 conservation status mapping via airbone LIDAR that develops individual remote sensing-derived proxies for every parameter required by the Natura 2000 manual, from the perspective of developing regional-scale Essential Biodiversity Variables. Based on leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds (10 pt/m2) collected in an alkali grassland area, a set of data products were calculated at 0.5 \u00d70.5 m resolution. These represent various aspects of radiometric and geometric texture. A Random Forest machine learning classifier was developed to create fuzzy vegetation maps of classes of interest based on these data products. In the next step, either classification results or LIDAR data products were selected as proxies for individual Natura 2000 conservation status variables, and fine-tuned based on field references. These proxies showed adequate performance and were summarized to deliver Natura 2000 conservation status with 80% overall accuracy compared to field references. This study draws attention to the potential of LIDAR for regional-scale Essential Biodiversity variables, and also holds implications for global-scale mapping.

The first dataset called \u201cCryotherapy\u201d consists of information about 90 patients and contains 7 features. The second dataset called \u201cImmunotherapy\u201d consists of information about 90 patients and contains 8 features. For presenting classification performance impacts each of Accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F-measure and confusion matrix for each kernel has been utilized. According to the results obtained, it was found that each of PUK and RBF performs best classification performance on \u201cCryotherapy\u201d dataset with 97.77% accuracy whereas each of PK and PUK performs best classification performance on \u201cImmunotherapy\u201d dataset with 81.11% accuracy.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/idap.2018.8620876", "venue": "2018 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Data Processing (IDAP)", "journal": "2018 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Data Processing (IDAP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2913102842", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["140109802", "14356173", "4967300", "42729512", "903102", "85843", "11820803", "11103223", "764191", "7378736"], "inbound_citations": ["204229854"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59232054"}

In this paper, we have: a) studied the effect of increasing the size of training data on the prediction performance of three classical ML models: Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR), and b) studied the effect of filtering based on prediction strength of LR model when the model is trained on very-small (10,000 cases) and very-large (450,000 cases) training sets. Method Data from Queensland Injury Surveillance Unit from years 2002\u20132012, which was categorized into 20 broad E-codes was used for this study. Eleven randomly chosen training sets of size ranging from 10,000 to 450,000 cases were used to train the ML models, and the prediction performance was analyzed on a prediction set of 50,150 cases. Filtering approach was tested on LR models trained on smallest and largest training datasets. Sensitivity was used as the performance measure for individual categories. Weighted average sensitivity (WAvg) and Unweighted average sensitivity (UAvg) were used as the measures of overall performance. Filtering approach was also tested for estimating category counts and was compared with approaches of summing prediction probabilities and counting direct predictions by ML model. Results The overall performance of all three ML models improved with increase in the size of training data. The overall sensitivities with maximum training size for LR and SVM models were similar (\u223c82%), and higher than MNB (76%). For all the ML models, the sensitivities of rare categories improved with increasing training data but they were considerably less than sensitivities of larger categories. With increasing training data size, LR and SVM exhibited diminishing improvement in UAvg whereas the improvement was relatively steady in case of MNB. Filtering based on prediction strength of LR model (and manual review of filtered cases) helped in improving the sensitivities of rare categories. A sizeable portion of cases still needed to be filtered even when the LR model was trained on very large training set. For estimating category counts, filtering approach provided best estimates for most E-codes and summing prediction probabilities approach provided better estimates for rare categories. Conclusions Increasing the size of training data alone cannot solve the problem of poor classification performance on rare categories by ML models.

With rapid developments in the field of artificial intelligence, machine learning approaches are increasingly being used for pattern recognition. In this study, an approach from machine learning perspectives is developed to automatically classify the solar wind at 1 AU into four types: coronal-hole-origin, streamer-belt-origin, sector-reversal-region-origin, and ejecta. By exhaustive enumeration, an eight-dimensional scheme (the magnetic field intensity, the proton number density and temperature, the solar wind speed, the number density ratio of proton and alpha, the temperature ratio, the proton-specific entropy, and the fast magneto-sonic Mach number) is found to perform the best among 8191 combinations of 13 solar wind parameters. 10 popular supervised machine learning models, namely k Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines with linear and Radial Basic Function kernels, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Neural Network, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, are applied to labeled solar wind data sets.

The aim of this study was to develop and test the applicability of geographic object-based image analysis including decision tree classification to classify WorldView-2 imagery and LiDAR-derived ancillary data to map the aquatic vegetation communities of the Magela Creek floodplain. Results of the decision tree classification were compared against a Random Forests classification. The resulting maps showed the 12 major vegetation communities that exist on the Magela Creek floodplain and their distribution for May 2010. The decision tree classification method provided an overall accuracy of 78% which was significantly higher than the overall accuracy of the Random Forests classification (67%). Most of the error in both classifications was associated with confusion between spectrally similar classes dominated by grasses, such as Hymenachne and Pseudoraphis. In addition, the extent of the sedge Eleocharis was under-estimated in both cases.

Recent studies have focused on improving the accuracy of BCP by including all of the features, neglecting to determine the best performing subset of features. However, for some problems, the number of features may reach thousands, which will cause too much computation power to be consumed during the feature evaluation and classification phases, also possibly reducing the accuracy of the results. Therefore, selecting the minimum number of features while preserving and/or increasing the accuracy of the results at a high level becomes an important issue for achieving fast and accurate binary classification. Our multiobjective evolutionary algorithm includes two phases, FSS using a GA and applying ML techniques for the BCP. Since exhaustively investigating all of the feature subsets is intractable, a GA is preferred for the first phase of the algorithm for intelligently detecting the most appropriate feature subset. The GA uses multiobjective crossover and mutation operators to improve a population of individuals (each representing a selected feature subset) and obtain (near-) optimal solutions through generations. In the second phase of the algorithms, the fitness of the selected subset is decided by using state-of-the-art ML techniques; Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Learning Machine, K-means, and Affinity Propagation. The performance of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (and the ML techniques) is evaluated with comprehensive experiments and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, Greedy Search, Particle Swarm Optimization, Tabu Search, and Scatter Search.

Wavelets are first applied to decompose the signal and to extract acoustical features such as sub-band power, brightness, band width and pitch information. The additional features, such as frequency cepstral coefficients also extracted to accomplish audio classification. This paper also proposes a different frame size computation strategy that uses 512 samples per frame. The overlap size between windowed frames of the proposed feature extraction algorithm is redesigned and a vector formation process is carried out after feature extraction. Finally, the proposed method uses a bottom-up support vector machine over these acoustical features and additional features. The bottom-up support vector machine categorization strategy uses an iterative procedure to match a given audio to progressively larger subsets or categories of classes. In addition, two support vector machine training parameters such as the upper bound and the variance of the exponential radial basis function are modified to improve the accuracy of classification.

It was extended to solve multi-class classification problem. A hierarchical SVM with clustering algorithm based on stepwise decomposition was established to intellectively classify 5 classes of fingerprints. The design principle was proposed and the classification algorithm was implemented. SVM not only has more solid theoretical foundation, it also has greater generalization ability as our experiment demonstrates. The experimental results show that SVM is effective and surpasses other classical classification techniques.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/WCICA.2006.1713144", "venue": "2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation", "journal": "2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2152169262", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "194951", "60486887", "3227698", "11669559", "14561315", "33213201"], "inbound_citations": ["18718468", "44036931", "924951", "46441010"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17129921"}

This type of learning mechanism presents classic learnability issues: there are aspects of language for which the input is thought to provide no evidence, and the evidence that does exist tends to be unreliable. We address these issues in the context of the speciec problem of learning to identify lexical units in speech. A simple recurrent network was trained on a phoneme prediction task. The model was explicitly provided with information about phonemes, relative lexical stress, and boundaries between utterances. Individually these sources of information provide relatively unreliable cues to word boundaries and no direct evidence about actual word boundaries.

Growing evidences suggest that protein O-GlcNAcylation is common and is analogous to phosphorylation in modulating broad ranges of biological processes. However, compared to phosphorylation, the amount of protein O-GlcNAcylation data is relatively limited and its annotation in databases is scarce. Furthermore, a bioinformatics resource for O-GlcNAcylation is lacking, and an O-GlcNAcylation site prediction tool is much needed.DescriptionWe developed a database of O-GlcNAcylated proteins and sites, dbOGAP, primarily based on literature published since O-GlcNAcylation was first described in 1984. The database currently contains ~800 proteins with experimental O-GlcNAcylation information, of which ~61% are of humans, and 172 proteins have a total of ~400 O-GlcNAcylation sites identified. The O-GlcNAcylated proteins are primarily nucleocytoplasmic, including membrane- and non-membrane bounded organelle-associated proteins. The known O-GlcNAcylated proteins exert a broad range of functions including transcriptional regulation, macromolecular complex assembly, intracellular transport, translation, and regulation of cell growth or death. The database also contains ~365 potential O-GlcNAcylated proteins inferred from known O-GlcNAcylated orthologs. Additional annotations, including other protein posttranslational modifications, biological pathways and disease information are integrated into the database. We developed an O-GlcNAcylation site prediction system, OGlcNAcScan, based on Support Vector Machine and trained using protein sequences with known O-GlcNAcylation sites from dbOGAP. The site prediction system achieved an area under ROC curve of 74.3% in five-fold cross-validation. The dbOGAP website was developed to allow for performing search and query on O-GlcNAcylated proteins and associated literature, as well as for browsing by gene names, organisms or pathways, and downloading of the database. Also available from the website, the OGlcNAcScan tool presents a list of predicted O-GlcNAcylation sites for given protein sequences.ConclusionsdbOGAP is the first public bioinformatics resource to allow systematic access to the O-GlcNAcylated proteins, and related functional information and bibliography, as well as to an O-GlcNAcylation site prediction tool.

The existing friction factor models for ungauged streams that do not require hydrometric survey data as input can have very large prediction errors. In this study, 415 streamflow events collected from 52 rivers across three continents were assembled to allow for the use of a suitable global dataset size/range to develop a robust model for the prediction of the friction factor in ungauged streams using two machine learning algorithms (Gene Expression Programing (GEP) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)). The new GEP and ELM models outperformed existing models with significantly improved R-squared values of 0.76 and 0.78, respectively. The combination of the two input parameters (relative smoothness and the friction slope) allowed the new models to more accurately predict the friction factor for a wider range of streams and flow conditions. The forecasting uncertainty of the developed GEP and ELM models were compared with past models and found to be the least uncertain, with Width Uncertainty Band (WUB) values of \u00b10.0536 and \u00b10.0504, respectively. For the first time in this field of research, partial derivative sensitivity analysis was applied to the trends of the friction factor estimation by GEP and ELM. It was found that GEP and ELM models are extremely sensitive to friction slope in comparison with relative smoothness.

Besides, being lack of validated negative samples in the drug-disease associations data, most methods simply select some unlabeled samples as negative ones, which may introduce noises. Herein, we propose a new method (TS-SVD) which only uses those known drug-protein, disease-protein and drug-disease interactions to predict the potential drug-disease associations.

The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model is a typical network of deep learning developed in recent years and the GAN model can also be used to classify HSIs. However, there are still some problems in the classification of HSIs. On the one hand, due to the existence of different objects with the same spectrum phenomenon, if only according to the original GAN model to generate samples from spectral samples, it will produce the wrong detailed characteristic information. On the other hand, the gradient disappears in the original GAN model and the scoring ability of a single discriminator limits the quality of the generated samples. In order to solve the above problems, we introduce the scoring mechanism of multi-discriminator collaboration and complete semi-supervised classification on three hyperspectral data sets.

In general, in order to achieve good performance of image classification, it is important to select high quality features for training classifiers. However, different instances of images would usually present very diverse features even if the instances belong to the same class. In other words, one types of features may better describe some instances, whereas other instances present more other types of features. The above description can indicate that the same learning algorithm may be capable of learning from some parts of a data set but show weaker ability to learn from other parts of a data set, given that different algorithms usually show different suitability for learning from instances that show various characteristics. On the other hand, image features are typically in the form of continuous attributes which can be handled by decision tree learning algorithms in various ways, leading to diverse classifiers being trained. In this paper, we investigate diversified adoption of the C4.5 and KNN algorithms from different perspectives, such as diversified use of instances and various ways of handling continuous attributes. In particular, we propose a multi-perspective approach of diversity creation for image classification in the setting of ensemble learning. We compare the proposed approach with those popular algorithms that are used to train classifiers on either a full set of original features or a subset of selected features for image classification. The experimental results show that the performance of image classification is encouraging through the adoption of our proposed approach of ensemble creation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC48188.2019.8949189", "venue": "2019 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC)", "journal": "2019 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2985206888", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["51688693", "5262555", "61568722", "5135008", "1292176", "60385584", "10355168", "207738357", "206420153", "1836349", "89141", "4158829", "3206647", "839773", "196091172", "145865571"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199371368"}

Two methods of learning imbalanced data based on Random Forests are proposed. We compare their prediction performance with existing methods on some benchmark data sets and show favorable results.

In every learning stage, an algorithmic learner takes as input one element of an information sequence for a target concept and its previously made hypothesis and outputs a new hypothesis. The sequence of hypotheses has to converge to a hypothesis describing the target concept correctly. ::: ::: We study the following refinements of this scenario. Bounded example-memory inference generalizes iterative inference by allowing an iterative learner to additionally store an a priori bounded number of carefully chosen data elements, while feedback learning generalizes it by allowing the iterative learner to additionally ask whether or not a particular data element did already appear in the data seen so far. ::: ::: For the case of learning from noise-free data, we show that, where both positive and negative data are available, restrictions on the accessibility of the input data do not limit the learning capabilities if and only if the relevant iterative learners are allowed to query the history of the learning process or to store at least one carefully selected data element. This insight nicely contrasts the fact that, in case only positive data are available, restrictions on the accessibility of the input data seriously affect the capabilities of all types of incremental learning (cf. [18]). ::: ::: For the case of learning from noisy data, we present characterizations of all kinds of incremental learning in terms being independent from learning theory.

Our results show that (i) NBBD is competitive with some of the state-of-the-art feature selection methods including Random Forest Feature Importance (RFFI) scores; and (ii) NBBD is especially effective in reliably identifying IBD biomarkers when the number of data samples available for biomarker discovery is small.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6874333", "pubmed_id": "31756219", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0225382", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2990715170", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52847522", "205491968", "23904374", "21196462", "3724792", "20341868", "23653672", "2099459", "3911116", "7633078", "1481014", "8376055", "379259", "9564054", "52097418", "18651067", "32940", "8416531", "215187519", "215605114", "89894159", "117610696", "16050699", "2298389", "116927101", "952763", "10659969", "16162039", "6923178", "214896476", "3606581", "206963091", "196689603", "2805055", "215554021", "41119317", "52273939", "3591729", "9026084", "15588516", "763778", "10216834", "217832", "321787", "1334898", "27543636", "2406202", "3596701", "38019145", "5704492", "3440515", "5310840", "3562477", "3359339", "6381842", "6117156", "49237226", "15647862", "52278448", "196634211", "53233637"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208233887"}

Existing algorithms tackle the problem in an asymmetric way, by either extracting vectorized summaries of the graph structure or adding hard constraints to feature-space algorithms. Following a different path, we define a metric regression scheme where we train metric-constrained linear combinations of dissimilarity matrices. The idea is that the input matrices can be pre-computed dissimilarity measures obtained from any kind of available data (e.g. node attributes or edge structure). As the model inputs are distance measures, we do not need to assume the existence of any underlying feature space. Main challenge is that metric constraints (especially positive-definiteness and sub-additivity), are not automatically respected if, for example, the coefficients of the linear combination are allowed to be negative. Both positive and sub-additive constraints are linear inequalities, but the computational complexity of imposing them scales as O(D3), where D is the size of the input matrices (i.e. the size of the data set). This becomes quickly prohibitive, even when D is relatively small. We propose a new graph-based technique for optimizing under such constraints and show that, in some cases, our approach may reduce the original computational complexity of the optimization process by one order of magnitude.

We allow subjects to position their hands freely above the sensor and they can move their hands during the acquisition process. In order to obtain clear image of the palm vascular pattern, we propose a novel image enhancement technique called local-ridge-enhancement (LRE). The proposed method removes illumination error while keeping good contrast between the print/vein pattern and the background image. Besides, we introduce a simple yet robust directional coding technique to encode the palm print and palm vein features in bit string representation. The bit string representation offers speedy template matching and enables more effective template storage and retrieval. The scores output by the palm print and palm vein experts are fused using Support Vector Machine. The fusion of these features yields promising result for practical implementation.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICARCV.2010.5707951", "venue": "2010 11th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision", "journal": "2010 11th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2136161853", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16511106", "197841", "9050379", "4913240", "12070134", "14731820", "27587373", "3046177", "17585299", "18494716", "17247826", "5103819", "14438318", "62685064", "6311330", "2309250", "36173218", "41270765", "18533339", "28637672"], "inbound_citations": ["19068922", "32178966", "1036715", "211242245"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195700976"}

The paper shows that with introduction of a set of tags, most of the annotation tasks can be performed within this approach.

Most previous research focused only on the accuracy rate of spam filters from the view point of the algorithm used, not on individual user\u2019s preferences. In terms of individual taste, the spam filters implemented on a mobile device have the advantage over spam filters on a network node, because it deals with only incoming messages on the users\u2019 phone and generates no additional traffic during the filtering process. However, a spam filter on a mobile phone has to consider the consumption of resources, because energy, memory and computing ability are limited. Moreover, as time passes an increasing number of feature words are likely to exhaust mobile resources. In this paper we propose a spam filter model distributed between a users\u2019 computer and smart phone. We expect the model to follow personal decision boundaries and use the uniform resources of smart phones. An authorized user\u2019s computer takes on the more complex and time consuming jobs, such as feature selection and training, while the smart phone performs only the minimum amount of work for filtering and utilizes the results of the information calculated on the desktop.

High resolution images are first transformed to small codes via the trained encoder and decoder networks. The code in latent space is times smaller than the original high resolution images. Then, we train a code generation network to learn the distribution of the latent codes. In this way, the generator only learns to generate small latent codes instead of large images. Finally, we decode the generated latent codes to image space via the decoder networks so as to output the synthesized high resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed method accelerates the training process significantly and increases the quality of the generated samples. The proposed acceleration framework makes it possible to generate high resolution images using less training time with limited hardware resource.

In this paper, we present a novel computer-aided prognosis (CAP) scheme that employs quantitatively derived image information to predict patient outcome analogous to the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS), with high RS implying poor outcome and vice versa. While digital pathology has made tissue specimens amenable to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for disease detection, our CAP scheme is the first of its kind for predicting disease outcome and patient survival. Since cancer grade is known to be correlated to disease outcome, low grade implying good outcome and vice versa, our CAP scheme captures quantitative image features that are reflective of BC grade. Our scheme involves first semi-automatically detecting BC nuclei via an Expectation Maximization driven algorithm. Using the nuclear centroids, two graphs (Delaunay Triangulation and Minimum Spanning Tree) are constructed and a total of 12 features are extracted from each image. A non-linear dimensionality reduction scheme, Graph Embedding, projects the image-derived features into a low-dimensional space, and a Support Vector Machine classifies the BC images in the reduced dimensional space. On a cohort of 37 samples, and for 100 trials of 3-fold randomized cross-validation, the SVM yielded a mean accuracy of 84.15% in distinguishing samples with low and high RS and 84.12% in distinguishing low and high grade BC. The projection of the high-dimensional image feature data to a 1D line for all BC samples via GE shows a clear separation between, low, intermediate, and high BC grades, which in turn shows high correlation with low, medium, and high RS.

This work is both novel and original because at present such approach to qualification testing and the associated capability for test time reduction (respectively cost reduction) it offers are non-existent in the electronics industry.

Currently, a number of machine learning based methods have been developed to predict new CPIs in the literature. However, as there is not yet any publicly available set of validated negative CPIs, most existing machine learning based approaches use the unknown interactions (not validated CPIs) selected randomly as the negative examples to train classifiers for predicting new CPIs. Obviously, this is not quite reasonable and unavoidably impacts the CPI prediction performance. In this paper, we simply take the unknown CPIs as unlabeled examples, and propose a new method called PUCPI (the abbreviation of PU learning for Compound-Protein Interaction identification) that employs biased-SVM (Support Vector Machine) to predict CPIs using only positive and unlabeled examples. PU learning is a class of learning methods that leans from positive and unlabeled (PU) samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that identifies CPIs using only positive and unlabeled examples. We first collect known CPIs as positive examples and then randomly select compound-protein pairs not in the positive set as unlabeled examples. For each CPI/compound-protein pair, we extract protein domains as protein features and compound substructures as chemical features, then take the tensor product of the corresponding compound features and protein features as the feature vector of the CPI/compound-protein pair. After that, biased-SVM is employed to train classifiers on different datasets of CPIs and compound-protein pairs. Experiments over various datasets show that our method outperforms six typical classifiers, including random forest, L1- and L2-regularized logistic regression, naive Bayes, SVM and k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and three types of existing CPI prediction models.

Driven by the needs of enhanced predictor that is effective for multiple time scales, this paper proposes a novel filtering strategy which integrates the statistical predictors and the NWP model outputs into one unified framework. Based on the proposed filtering strategy, a combined predictor SVR + SDA + UKF (Support Vector Regression + Stacked De-noising Auto-encoder + Unscented Kalman Filter) is proposed and validated. In the proposed predictor, the SVR term propagates the state vector of UKF and ensures short-term prediction accuracy. The SDA term fuses the NWP model outputs and mainly contributes to medium/long-term prediction accuracy. Consequently, the proposed method achieves improved accuracy in both short and medium/long-term WS prediction.

In this paper, we introduce a new Likelihood Ratio (LR) model based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) trained with features discovered via morphometric and spatial analyses of corresponding minutiae configurations for both match and close non-match populations often found in AFIS candidate lists. Computed LR values are derived from a probabilistic framework based on SVMs that discover the intrinsic spatial differences of match and close non-match populations. Lastly, experimentation performed on a set of over 120,000 publicly available fingerprint images (mostly sourced from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) datasets) and a distortion set of approximately 40,000 images, is presented, illustrating that the proposed LR model is reliably guiding towards the right proposition in the identification assessment of match and close non-match populations.

To further explore the gut microbiome variation in human populations, here we characterized the human DNA viral community from publicly available gut metagenome data sets from human populations with different geographical origin and lifestyle. In particular, such data sets encompass microbiome information from two western urban societies (USA and Italy), as well as two traditional hunter-gatherer communities (the Hadza from Tanzania and Matses from Peru) and one pre-agricultural tribe (Tunapuco from Peru). Our results allowed for the first taxonomic reconstruction of the complex viral metacommunities within the human gut. The core virome structure included herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, adenoviruses and anelloviruses. Using Random Forests and a co-occurrence analysis approach, we identified the viruses that distinguished populations according to their geographical origin and/or lifestyle.

Due to the low-contrast characteristic and noisy nature of ultrasound images, it might require expertise for non-expert users to recognize tongue gestures. Manual tongue segmentation is a cumbersome, subjective, and error-prone task. Furthermore, it is not a feasible solution for real-time applications. In the last few years, deep learning methods have been used for delineating and tracking tongue dorsum. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), which have shown to be successful in medical image analysis tasks, are typically weak for the same task on different domains. In many cases, DCNNs trained on data acquired with one ultrasound device, do not perform well on data of varying ultrasound device or acquisition protocol. Domain adaptation is an alternative solution for this difficulty by transferring the weights from the model trained on a large annotated legacy dataset to a new model for adapting on another different dataset using fine-tuning. In this study, after conducting extensive experiments, we addressed the problem of domain adaptation on small ultrasound datasets for tongue contour extraction. We trained a U-net network comprises of an encoder-decoder path from scratch, and then with several surrogate scenarios, some parts of the trained network were fine-tuned on another dataset as the domain-adapted networks.

Besides using existing spectral and geometrical features, we design a textural feature based on fractal theory to construct a point feature descriptor through linear combination.

This has led to the suggestion that psychopathological information could be used to make prognostic predictions in this population. However, because the current literature is based on inferences at group level, the translational value of the findings for everyday clinical practice is unclear. Here we examined whether psychopathological information could be used to make individualized predictions about clinical and functional outcomes in people at UHR. Participants included 416 people at UHR followed prospectively at the Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation (PACE) Clinic in Melbourne, Australia. The data were analysed using Support Vector Machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning technique that allows inferences at the individual level. SVM predicted transition to psychosis with a specificity of 60.6%, a sensitivity of 68.6% and an accuracy of 64.6% (p < 0.001). In addition, SVM predicted functioning with a specificity of 62.5%, a sensitivity of 62.5% and an accuracy of 62.5% (p = 0.008). Prediction of transition was driven by disorder of thought content, attenuated positive symptoms and functioning, whereas functioning was best predicted by attention disturbances, anhedonia\u2013asociality and disorder of thought content. These results indicate that psychopathological information allows individualized prognostic predictions with statistically significant accuracy. However, this level of accuracy may not be sufficient for clinical translation in real-world clinical practice. Accuracy might be improved by combining psychopathological information with other types of data using a multivariate machine learning framework.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5477095", "pubmed_id": "27923525", "doi": "10.1016/j.schres.2016.11.047", "venue": "Schizophrenia Research", "journal": "Schizophrenia Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2559603325", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["12727359", "13960664", "30951815", "24820641", "204985473", "21734984", "24485376", "33765587", "16274020", "479460", "13406749", "31929265", "25069618", "21378895", "25686241", "24830396", "10375386", "6203557", "25686241", "45102956", "12974477", "21221784", "20033426", "10681586", "46566976", "19852817", "21045824", "15480929", "6064865", "35171468", "14884976", "54257033", "27270968", "7517807", "31342026", "12738106", "15253300", "145477493", "10573248"], "inbound_citations": ["30661566", "203528743", "211138636", "209441436", "211200328", "56484077", "201062534", "211190061", "140517616"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4545641"}

In this new domain of unsupervised information extraction, we focus on the task of extracting and characterizing a priori unknown relations between a given set of entity types. One of the challenges of this task is to deal with the large amount of candidate relations when extracting them from a large corpus. We propose in this paper an approach for the filtering of such candidate relations based on heuristics and machine learning models. More precisely, we show that the best model for achieving this task is a Conditional Random Field model according to evaluations performed on a manually annotated corpus of about one thousand relations. We also tackle the problem of identifying semantically similar relations by clustering large sets of them. Such clustering is achieved by combining a classical clustering algorithm and a method for the efficient identification of highly similar relation pairs. Finally, we evaluate the impact of our filtering of relations on this semantic clustering with both internal measures and external measures.

Although theories involving distance scaling to achieve size constancy have flourished based on psychophysical studies, its underlying neural mechanisms remain unknown. Single cell recordings show that distance-dependent size tuned cells are common along the ventral stream, originating from V1, V2, and V4 leading to IT. In addition, recent research employing fMRI demonstrates that an object\u2019s perceived size, associated with its perceived egocentric distance, modulates its retinotopic representation in V1. These results suggest that V1 contributes to size constancy, and its activity is possibly regulated by feedback of distance information from other brain areas. Here, we propose a neural model based on these findings. First, we construct an egocentric distance map in LIP by integrating horizontal disparity and vergence through gain-modulated MT neurons. Second, LIP neurons send modulatory feedback of distance information to size tuned cells in V1, resulting in a spread of V1 cortical activity. This process provides V1 with distance-dependent size representations. The model supports that size constancy is preserved by scaling retinal image size to compensate for changes in perceived distance, and suggests a possible neural circuit capable of implementing this process.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4489391", "pubmed_id": "26132106", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0129377", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1477316274", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["144371415", "12188435", "6659403", "6485473", "146880599", "29529259", "24967431", "207686461", "31853397", "9768791", "10374964", "8391410", "15603154", "205434328", "11204938", "38895183", "8547918", "21098418", "119082511", "10884513", "19665011", "146388241", "1176561", "14017109", "11546860", "15596444", "43335583", "2563713", "21524796", "11538089", "4352940", "40363630", "13517187", "7189919", "61124075", "8367973", "25273017", "5712367", "13803846", "16809045", "23364863", "9271650", "10608687", "118539501", "37944276", "7847888", "2060849", "41472178", "2146837", "4419753", "16260241", "1695292", "8520926", "29483491", "6641957", "9123782", "29455763", "14124318", "1876622"], "inbound_citations": ["8125536", "210840321", "215418753", "1040089"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11927893"}

To understand the mechanism of succinylation profoundly, it is necessary to identify succinylation sites in proteins accurately. However, traditional methods, experimental approaches, are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Computational prediction methods have been proposed recent years, and they are popular because of their convenience and high speed. In this study, we developed a new method to predict succinylation sites in protein combining multiple features, including amino acid composition, binary encoding, physicochemical property and grey pseudo amino acid composition, with a feature selection scheme (information gain). And then, it was trained using SVM (Support Vector Machine) and an ensemble learning algorithm. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The performance of this method was measured with an accuracy of 89.14% and a MCC (Matthew Correlation Coefficient) of 0.79 using 10-fold cross validation on training dataset and an accuracy of 84.5% and a MCC of 0.2 on independent dataset. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The conclusions made from this study can help to understand more of the succinylation mechanism.

To estimate uncertainty in regression, one could modify a deep neural network to predict coverage intervals, such as by predicting the mean and standard deviation. Unfortunately, in our empirical evaluations the predicted coverage from existing approaches is either overconfident or lacks sharpness (gives imprecise intervals). To address this challenge, we propose a novel method to estimate uncertainty based on two distinct neural networks with two distinct loss functions in a similar vein to Generative Adversarial Networks. Specifically, one network tries to learn the cumulative distribution function, and the second network tries to learn its inverse. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the idealized solution is a fixed point and that under certain conditions the approach is asymptotically consistent to ground truth. We benchmark the approach on one synthetic and five real-world datasets, including forecasting A1c values in diabetic patients from electronic health records, where uncertainty is critical. In synthetic data, the proposed approach essentially matches the theoretically optimal solution in all aspects.

In this paper, we present a connectionist approach to cost-based abduction. We begin by reviewing high order recurrent networks (HORN) and their use in combinatorial optimization. We then formally define the cost-based abduction problem and describe previous work on this problem. This is followed by a description of how HORN's can be applied to the CBA problem and experimental results on a 60-hypothesis, 65-rule CBA problem. We conclude with some remarks on the potential advantages of the connectionist approach.

Then we propose a deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model consisting of 6 convolutional layers, 3 max pooling layers and 3 fully connected layers and optimize its structure. The model is used for automatically learning features of respiratory sounds and identifying them. Through time-frequency transformation, Log-scaled Mel-Frequency Spectral (LMFS) features of 60 bands are extracted frame by frame from the dataset and divided into segments in the size of 23 consecutive frames as inputs of the model. Finally, we test the model by 12 new subjects' dataset and compare it with mean performance of 5 respiratory physicians in both precision and recall. The testing result shows that our CNN model achieves the same of level of identifying accuracy as the respiratory physicians.

The idea, then, that I will press is that simple learning is not so simple after all and that, as a result, it represents a serious challenge to the explanatory adequacy of Connectionism. I most assuredly do not suppose that what I have to say counts as an a priori, straight from the armchair, refutation of Connectionism. No, that is not how science, good science, is waged.

To concretize the discussion, I use Hinton\u2019s kinship dataset as motivation throughout the paper. The standpoint taken in this paper is that the most compact theory that describes a set of examples is the preferred theory\u2014an explicit Occam\u2019s Razor. The kinship dataset is a good test-bed for thinking about relational concept learning because it contains interesting patterns that will undoubtedly be part of a compact theory describing the examples. To begin with, I describe a very simple computational level theory for inductive theory learning in first-order logic that precisely states that the most compact theory is preferred. In addition, I illustrate the obvious result that predicate invention is a necessary part of any system striving for compact theories. I present derivations within the Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) framework that show how the intuitive theories of family trees can be learned. These results suggest that encoding regular equivalence directly into the training sets of ILP systems can improve learning performance. To investigate theories resulting from optimization, I devise an algorithm that works with a very strict language bias allowing all consistent rules to be entertained and explicitly optimized over for small datasets. The algorithm, which can be viewed as a special case implementation of ILP, is capable of learning a theory of kinship comparable in compactness to the intuitive theories humans use regularly. However, this alternative approach falls short as it is incapable of inventing the unary predicate sex to learn a more compact theory. Finally, I comment on the philosophical position of extreme nativism in light of the ability of these systems to invent primitive concepts not present in the training data.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2135020796", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["1159878", "53796860", "9761328", "12434511", "11185350", "39666367", "14717875"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1733011"}

Experimental determination of reservoir oil viscosity is costly and time consuming. Hence, searching for quick and accurate determination of reservoir oil viscosity is inevitable. The objective of this study is to present a reliable, and predictive model namely, Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) to predict reservoir oil viscosity. To this end, three LSSVM models have been developed for prediction of reservoir oil viscosity in the three regions including, under-saturated, saturated and dead oil. These models have been developed and tested using more than 1000 series of experimental PVT data of Iranian oil reservoirs. These data include oil API gravity, reservoir temperature, solution gas oil ratio, and saturation pressure. The ranges of data used to develop these new models cover almost all Iranian oil reservoirs PVT data and consequently the developed models could be reliable for prediction of other Iranian oil reservoirs viscosities. In-depth comparative studies have been carried out between these new models and the most frequently used oil viscosity correlations for prediction of reservoir oil viscosity. The results show that the developed LSSVM models significantly outperform the existing correlations and provide predictions in acceptable agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed models are capable of simulating the actual physical trend of the oil viscosity with variation of oil API gravity, temperature, and pressure.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.fuel.2013.07.072", "venue": null, "journal": "Fuel", "mag_id": "2062913033", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["130248190", "215498458", "56419922", "15312340", "56337975", "111910135", "208355185", "153503187", "209514258", "139949012", "156193280", "44075437", "199580825", "18353531", "182040655"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:97454140"}

There are many previous studies shown that circRNAs can be regarded as the sponges of miRNAs. Thus, circRNA is also a key point for disease diagnosing, treating and inferring. However, traditional experimental approaches to verify the associations between the circRNA and disease are time-consuming and money-consuming. There are few computational models to predict potential circRNA-disease associations, which become our motivation to propose a new computational model. In this study, we propose a machine learning based computational model named Gradient Boosting Decision Tree with multiple biological data to predict circRNA-disease associations (GBDTCDA). The known circRNA-disease associations' data are downloaded from cricR2Disease database (http://bioinfo.snnu.edu.cn/CircR2Disease/). The feature vector of each circRNA-disease association pair is composed of four parts, which are the statistics information of different biological networks, the graph theory information of different biological networks, circRNA-disease associations' network information and circRNA nucleotide sequence information, respectively. Therefore, we use those feature vectors to train the gradient boosting decision tree regression model. Then, the leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) is adopted to evaluate the performance of our computational model. As for predicting some common diseases related circRNAs, our method GBDTCDA also obtains the better results. The Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) values of Basal cell carcinoma, Non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer are 95.8%, 88.3% and 93.5%, respectively. For further illustrating the performance of GBDTCDA, a case study of breast cancer is also supplemented in this study.

Quality of textile goods in fiber manufacturing process highly depends on control of let-off, take-up and tension which are essential for constant tension control of yarn and textile fabrics and correct length of them. The physical properties of textile fabrics are very sensitive to several factors(temperature, humidity, radius change of warp beam etc.) which result in tension change. Rapid development of fiber manufacture machine for higher productivity requires control system for let-off, take-up and tension for robustness to sharp tension-variation and quick response.

However, original SVM (C-SVM) only considers local information of data points on or over the margin. Therefore, C-SVM loses robustness. To solve this problem, one approach is to translate (i.e., to move without rotation or change of shape) the hyperplane according to the distribution of the entire data. But existing work can only be applied for 1-D case. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method called General Scaled SVM (GS-SVM) to extend the existing approach to multi-dimensional case. Our method translates the hyperplane according to the distribution of data projected on the normal vector of the hyperplane.
