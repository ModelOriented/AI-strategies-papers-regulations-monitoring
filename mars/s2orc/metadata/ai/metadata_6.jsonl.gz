We use kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for this classification task and compare their performance on different types of visual features. We also show that the result can be improved by combining the visual features using Multiple Kernel Learning approach.

Aim To develop a predictive model of metabolic syndrome for patients with schizophrenic or bipolar disorders, useful for both clinical practice and research. Methods Naturalistic, one-year follow-up study conducted in Asturias, Spain. A total of 172 patients with schizophrenic (Sch-P) or bipolar (BD-P) disorders (ICD-10 criteria), under maintenance treatment, who gave written informed consent were included. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the modified NCEP ATP-III criteria. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis were performed. Results Starting from a large set of demographic and clinical variables, and by means of intermediate MARS and GA models, an SVM model able to classify if a patient with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder suffers from metabolic syndrome with an accuracy of 98.68% (sensitivity 100%, specifity 94.4%) was obtained. The final model only needs 6 variables: Sch-P: (1) Low HDL-cholesterol, (2) Fasting glucose level, (3) Family history of obesity, (4) Triglyceride level, (5) Family history of dyslipidemia, and (6) Use of antidepressants; BD-P: (1), (2), (3), (7) Use of lipid-lowering medication, (8) Use of antipsychotics, and (9) Use of mood stabilizers.

The N-gram model contributes significantly to the model, because no other features account for short-distance relations between words.

Considering that there are many design and parameter choices, such as the number of neurons in each layer, the type of activation function, the choice of using drop out or not, it is very hard to cover every configuration, and find the optimal structure. In this paper, we propose a novel and systematic method that autonomously and simultaneously optimizes multiple parameters of any given deep neural network by using a generative adversarial network (GAN).

Our proposed approach can be used to autonomously refine the parameters, and improve the accuracy of different deep neural network architectures.

Ensemble based approaches such as Random Forests have been shown to perform well in both individual sensitivity prediction studies and team science based prediction challenges. However, Random Forests generate a deterministic predictive model for each drug based on the genetic characterization of the cell lines and ignores the relationship between different drug sensitivities during model generation. This application motivates the need for generation of multivariate ensemble learning techniques that can increase prediction accuracy and improve variable importance ranking by incorporating the relationships between different output responses. In this article, we propose a novel cost criterion that captures the dissimilarity in the output response structure between the training data and node samples as the difference in the two empirical copulas. We illustrate that copulas are suitable for capturing the multivariate structure of output responses independent of the marginal distributions and the copula based multivariate random forest framework can provide higher accuracy prediction and improved variable selection.

It is worth mentioning that even if time associated with the traffic data is not given explicitly, the proposed approach will strive to identify different trends by exploring distribution of data. Once the data corresponding trends are determined, Random Forest as prediction model is well aware of data context, and hence, it has less chance of getting stuck in local optima.

In this paper, we present a computational method for the delineation of the luminal border in IVUS B-mode images. The method is based in the minimization of a probabilistic cost function (that deforms a parametric curve) which defines a probability field that is regularized with respect to the given likelihoods of the pixels belonging to blood and non-blood. These likelihoods are obtained by a Support Vector Machine classifier trained using samples of the lumen and non-lumen regions provided by the user in the first frame of the sequence to be segmented. In addition, an optimization strategy is introduced in which the direction of the steepest descent and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno optimization methods are linearly combined to improve convergence. Our proposed method (MRK) is capable of segmenting IVUS B-mode images from different systems and transducer frequencies without the need of any parameter tuning, and it is robust with respect to changes of the B-mode reconstruction parameters which are subjectively adjusted by the interventionist. We validated the proposed method on six 20MHz and six 40MHz IVUS stationary sequences corresponding to regions with different degrees of stenosis, and evaluated its performance by comparing the segmentation results with manual segmentation by two observers. Furthermore, we compared our method with the segmentation results on the same sequences as provided by the authors of three other segmentation methods available in the literature. The performance of all methods was quantified using Dice and Jaccard similarity indexes, Hausdorff distance, linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis.

The benefit of this combination can be explained by bias-variance analysis, especially in the situation of inadequate training samples and high dimensionality. Furthermore, MBRF innately produces posterior probabilities inherited from AdaBoost, which are served as the unary potentials of the conditional random field (CRF) model to incorporate spatial context information.

This study is important because we processed the ALOS Palsar mosaic, which is made freely available within K&C initiatives project and will be updated regularly. We first used 38 sample plots collected on the ground during dry season in September 2004, to develop a tree diameter (dbh) \u2014 biomass model. The HH, HV, HV/HH and HH-HV backscatters of ALOS Palsar data allowed the empirical estimation of forest above ground biomass (AGB). Each band of Palsar data was separately used to estimate the biomass, and we found HV band resulted in better correlation with the AGB compared to other SAR bands. Validation of the prediction results was carried out by comparing the biomass estimates with those predicted from an existing allometric equation. Optical data are sensitive to the physical properties of the reflectors whereas SAR data are more influenced by the geometric properties of the scatterers. Therefore, the second part of this study concerned the integration of mosaic SAR textures and ETM data for land cover classification. The classification was conducted using ETM data and variations of ETM, SAR bands, and SAR textures calculated using GLC Matrix. The image classifications were carried out using a Machine Learning based classifier, so-called Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a conventional Maximum Likelihood method. An ensemble of neural networks method using Kalman Filter and scaled conjugate gradient algorithm was applied. The classification accuracy was assessed using confusion matrices and Kappa Statistics.

We propose a new method for automatic textual description of medical image findings, such as lesions in medical images.

We use a structured learning framework to model individual semantic descriptors and their relationships. The parameters of the model are efficiently learned using the Structured Support Vector Machine (SSVM). The proposed approach generates radiological lexicon descriptors used to make a diagnosis of various diseases.

Cyber criminals exploit this spur in user engagement levels to spread malicious content that compromises system reputation, causes financial losses and degrades user experience. In this paper, we collect and characterize a dataset of 4.4 million public posts generated on Facebook during 17 news-making events (natural calamities, sports, terror attacks, etc.) over a 16-month time period. From this dataset, we filter out two sets of malicious posts, one using URL blacklists and another using human annotations. Our observations reveal some characteristic differences between malicious posts obtained from the two methodologies, thus demanding a twofold filtering process for a more complete and robust filtering system. We empirically confirm the need for this twofold filtering approach by cross-validating supervised learning models obtained from the two sets of malicious posts. These supervised learning models include Naive Bayesian, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine-based models. Based on this learning, we implement Facebook Inspector, a REST API-based browser plug-in for identifying malicious Facebook posts in real time. Facebook Inspector uses class probabilities obtained from two independent supervised learning models based on a Random Forest classifier to identify malicious posts in real time. These supervised learning models are based on a feature set comprising of 44 features and achieve an accuracy of over 80% each, using only publicly available features.

Three evaluations were performed to test (1) algorithm validity and accuracy with exploring appropriate classifier settings, (2) capability to provide accuracy with reducing amount of instruction dataset, and (3) capability in classifying large dataset with minimized manual labeling. The results from the evaluation (1) showed that the algorithm is 99.5% reliable in song syllables classification. This accuracy was indeed maintained in evaluation (2), even when the instruction data classified by human were reduced to one-minute excerpt (corresponding to 300\u2013400 syllables) for classifying two-minute excerpt. The reliability remained comparable, 98.7% accuracy, when a large target dataset of whole day recordings (\u223c30,000 syllables) was used. Use of a linear-kernel support vector machine showed sufficient accuracies with minimized manually generated instruction data in bird song element classification. The methodology proposed would help reducing laborious processes in birdsong analysis without sacrificing reliability, and therefore can help accelerating behavior and studies using songbirds.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3962446", "pubmed_id": "24658578", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0092584", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1987774416", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["21327383", "6574258", "15935180", "15825786", "15771697", "206787478", "46279051", "13405268", "13296812", "5462806", "8186724", "3116168", "144565557", "1367568"], "inbound_citations": ["92507968", "34139139", "196668539", "284323", "4612456", "204827470", "16528077", "55451105", "13031937", "7294076", "215651125", "92117569", "58588770", "211078737", "16641521", "16368653", "24648567", "215703222"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17355112"}

The treatment of human diseases often requires the intake of several drugs, which can lead to undesirable drug-drug interactions (DDIs), thus causing an increase in the frequency and severity of ADEs. An evaluation of DDI-induced ADEs is a nontrivial task and requires numerous experimental and clinical studies. Therefore, we developed a computational approach to assess the cardiovascular ADEs of DDIs. This approach is based on the combined analysis of spontaneous reports (SRs) and predicted drug-target interactions to estimate the five cardiovascular ADEs that are induced by DDIs, namely, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac failure, and arterial hypertension. We applied a method based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression to SRs for the identification of interacting pairs of drugs causing corresponding ADEs, as well as noninteracting pairs of drugs. As a result, five datasets containing, on average, 3100 potentially ADE-causing and non-ADE-causing drug pairs were created. The obtained data, along with information on the interaction of drugs with 1553 human targets predicted by PASS Targets software, were used to create five classification models using the Random Forest method. The average area under the ROC curve of the obtained models, sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy were 0.837, 0.764, 0.754 and 0.759, respectively. The predicted drug targets were also used to hypothesize the potential mechanisms of DDI-induced ventricular tachycardia for the top-scoring drug pairs.

(1998)), which causes changes in behavior and personality but leaves syntax, phonology and semantics relatively intact, and a variant that causes impairments in the language processing system (Primary Progessive Aphasia, PPA (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2004). PPA can be subdivided into subtypes fluent (fluent but empty speech, comprehension of word meaning is affected / `semantic dementia') and non-fluent (agrammatism, hesitant or labored speech, word finding problems). Some identify logopenic aphasia as a FTD-variant: fluent aphasia with anomia but intact object recognition and underlying word meaning. Mild aphasia can be detected through transcriptions of spontaneous speech (Wolthuis et al., 2014). Spontaneous speech is laborious to transcribe; the use of software can reduce the associated costs, but off-the-shelf speech processing systems are not good enough yet to transcribe speech at the level of detail required in this domain. It is still an open research question which softwaredetectable features that are relevant for diagnosis can be easily obtained with a high degree of certainty. One example is the acoustic measure: distribution of silence (pause) in spontaneous speech. The difference in silence frequency and duration between a control and a severe patient is visible to the naked eye in visual representations of the sound. We study the usefulness of acoustic and basic textual transcriptions to distinguish the speech of German-speaking controls and patients with dementia caused by (a) Alzheimer's disease, or by (b) frontotemporal lobar generation, either in the form of PPA or of bvFTD. Our goal is to detect and quantify differences, ultimately scaling to more measurements and patients whose measurements are not obvious to casual hearers. Similar studies for English speakers have demonstrated that machine learning based on acoustic and text transcriptions, and richer models, can be used to discriminate between dementia variants and healthy speakers. Previous approaches were successful in discriminating between and controls and respectively: three FTLD-variants (Pakhomov et al., 2010a); four FTLD-variants (Peintner et al., 2008); MCI-patients Roark et al. (2011); fluent and non-fluent PPA (Fraser et al., 2013, 2014a,b); patients with dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease and FTLD-dementia Jarrold et al. (2014); Orimaye and Golden (2014). We focus in this study on those variables that can be measured with the least amount of linguistic transcription: acoustic and textual transcription variables. A realistic model should presumably be based on more transcription detail than just acoustic and textual variables. However, the cost of transcription rises more than linearly with the detail level required for richer models. Before the added costs vs. benefits of richer models can be evaluated, it is important to establish baseline results based on basic transcriptions. The key contributions of this study are as follows. We examine a small set of auditory and textual measures derived from spontaneous speech samples and use these to discriminate between healthy and dementia groups. We analyze German data and compare this to existing studies with English data. Although prosody plays a similar role in German and English, studies have shown that pitch variation and range are different for the two, and that language-specific cues may be used to indicate boundaries (O'Brien et al., 2014). This may influence the role of such variables in discriminators. We limit ourselves to variables that are easy to acquire with software only, to set a baseline for subsequent research with variables that are more costly to measure. Methods We compare the speech of a control group (n=8) to that of Alzheimer\u2019s patients (n=7) and FTD-patients diagnosed with either PPA (n=3) or bvFTD (n=4). Participant recruitment, data elicitation and manual CLAN-annotation are used from a larger study of processing of verbs and nouns in speakers with different types of dementia, currently performed by the second author. Participants All participants are native German speakers living in nursing homes in the North of Germany. Patients were selected based on psychologically tests, with a diagnosis made by clinicians according prior to the inception of this study. Controls were selected based on a review by a clinician to exclude those diagnosed with dementia. Spontaneous speech was elicited from each particpant; windows of 1-2 minutes are used for sampling and subsequent transcription and analysis. Participants are monolingual speakers. Controls were matched with patients for age and education. Text transcription The speech obtained from each participant was manually transcribed in CLAN by trained linguistics students as part of another longitudinal study. This yields measures of vocabulary at the level of shallow parsing from which variables can be determined, such as frequency of types/tokens, part-of-speech, and word length. Acoustic transcription Following the findings of Pakhomov et al. (2010b); Fraser et al. (2013), a statistical model is trained with a selected set of features. Kaldi (Povey et al., 2011), Audacity and Praat (Boersma and Weenink, 2016) were used to detect pauses, mean frequency and variance for F0-F3. Paired with transcriptions, these yielded variables: pause-to-word ratio, duration of speech, long/short pause count, pause duration, phonation rate, mean recurrence period density entropy (RPDE, Little et al. (2006)). Classification Features are selected based on their significance, determined by Welch's t-test. Different classifiers that each make different assumptions of the independence and distribution of variables (Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Random Forests) are trained on the selected features and evaluated for their accuracy using standard leave-one-out cross-validation.The speech obtained from each participant was manually transcribed in CLAN by trained linguistics students as part of another longitudinal study. This yields measures of vocabulary at the level of shallow parsing from which variables can be determined, such as frequency of types/tokens, part-of-speech, and word length.

The results indicate that some motifs are expected for the isolated group, while the interaction between the glycosylated sites and the relative proportion of the surrounding amino acids affect the glycosylation for the crowded group. Then, we also compare the statistics of amino acid sequences around the glycosylation sites of both groups. As the results, some amino acids (proline, valine, alanine etc.) have high existence probabilities at each specific positions relative to a glycosylation site, especially for the isolated glycosylation.

A typical intelligent recommendation engine usually consists of three major components, that is, data as the main input, algorithms for preference learning, and system for user interaction and high-performance computation. We observe that the data (e.g., users\u2019 behavior) are usually in different forms, such as examinations (e.g., browse and collection) and ratings, where the former are often much more abundant than the latter. Although the data are in different representations, they are both related to users\u2019 true preferences and are also deemed complementary to each other for preference learning. However, very few ranking or recommendation algorithms have been developed to exploit such two types of user behavior. In this article, we focus on jointly modeling the examination behavior and rating behavior and develop a novel and efficient ranking-oriented recommendation algorithm accordingly. First, we formally define a new recommendation problem termed behavior ranking, which aims to build a ranking-oriented model by exploiting both the examination behavior and rating behavior. Second, we develop a simple and generic transfer to rank (ToR) algorithm for behavior ranking, which transfers knowledge of candidate items from a global preference learning task to a local preference learning task. Compared with the previous work on integrating heterogeneous user behavior, our ToR algorithm is the first ranking-oriented solution, which can effectively generate recommendations in a more direct manner than those regression-oriented methods. Extensive empirical studies show that our ToR algorithm performs significantly more accurately than the state-of-the-art methods in most cases. Furthermore, our ToR algorithm is very efficient in terms of the time complexity, which is similar to those for homogeneous user behavior alone.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3057732", "venue": "TIST", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2724526379", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10260033", "207192911", "207172170", "2625350", "17638609", "9540398", "12611011", "18418684", "5652110", "10537313", "18603824", "207204749", "207168823", "3022077", "7982003", "14886100", "9024470", "5959482", "8987583", "7369746", "30564188", "49526828", "17773811", "5499886", "10795036", "14669618", "467086", "4108140", "9683534", "5048382", "3355517", "8540906", "14899273", "1822311", "15457521", "1822403", "1793216", "206608231"], "inbound_citations": ["3651991", "121292482", "59248919"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32893704"}

A mixed-subject-design experiment was conducted in a closed-loop test track, Mcity, with seven intersection maneuver scenarios. A generally high compliance rate to the recommended speed strategies was observed that during 72% of the events, drivers changed their intersection-approaching behavior to follow the recommendations. Mixed models were conducted to explore the impacting factors while Principal Component Analysis was used to classify subjective (i.e., self-reported) data into four categories. To predict drivers\u2019 reactions when offered a speed suggestion, Random Forests were built with 13 independent variables, derived from four categories: vehicle kinematic features, device information, driver characteristics, and subjective data. Using this model, drivers\u2019 reactions during each intersection maneuver could be predicted with a reasonably high accuracy about 87.4 m away from the intersection, where the vehicle started to receive signal phase and timing information.

Consequently, it is unknown if methods used to examine PA, such as machine learning models built on accelerometer data, are able to accurately detect PA in children with CP who use mobility aids for ambulation. ::: Objective: To develop and test machine learning models used for the automatic detection and classification of PA type in children with CP who use mobility aids for ambulation. ::: Methods: Eleven children and adolescents with CP, age 11\u00b13yrs (range 6-16yrs); six females; Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) III: n=5 and IV: n=6 participated. Participants completed six PA trials of increasing intensity while wearing an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer on the wrist, hip and thigh. PA trials included: supine rest, seated colouring, seated ball throwing, overground walking with a mobility aid, wheelchair propulsion and riding on a modified tricycle. Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers were trained on 40 features in the vector magnitude of raw acceleration signal using 5s non-overlapping windows. Performance was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross validation. Comparisons of performance were subsequently made between all single placement models, all combinations of two placement models, and models trained on data from all three placements. ::: Results: The best performing single-placement model was a RF classifier trained on wrist features, yielding an overall prediction accuracy of 79%. The best performing model built on a combination of two placements was a RF classifier trained on wrist and hip features, yielding an overall prediction accuracy of 92%. The combinations of multiple accelerometer placements were significantly more accurate than a single monitor alone. Models based on the combination of two placements were more accurate than those based on a combination of three placements; however, this difference was not significant. ::: Limitations: The PA protocol consisted of structured activity trials performed in a controlled, clinical environment. Thus, the performance of the models under free living conditions require further investigation. The sample size used may limit the generalisability and robustness of the findings given the variability in movement patterns of the population of interest. ::: Conclusions: Machine learning techniques afford robust and accurate classification of PA in children with CP who use mobility aids for ambulation (GMFCS III & IV) within a laboratory setting.

In such approaches, human detections are first extracted in every frame and person trajectories are then recovered by a procedure of data association (usually offline). However, their performances usually degenerate in presence of detection errors, mutual interactions and occlusions. In this paper, we present a deep learning based MPT approach that learns instance-aware representations of tracked persons and robustly online infers states of the tracked persons. Specifically, we design a multi-branch neural network (MBN), which predicts the classification confidences and locations of all targets by taking a batch of candidate regions as input. In our MBN architecture, each branch (instance-subnet) corresponds to an individual to be tracked and new branches can be dynamically created for handling newly appearing persons. Then based on the output of MBN, we construct a joint association matrix that represents meaningful states of tracked persons (e.g., being tracked or disappearing from the scene) and solve it by using the efficient Hungarian algorithm. Moreover, we allow the instance-subnets to be updated during tracking by online mining hard examples, accounting to person appearance variations over time.

(2) The user interactions among news comments can easily lead to inaccurate topic extraction and sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic generative model (DTSA) to extract topics and the specified sentiments from news streams and analyze their evolution over time simultaneously. In DTSA, three different timescale models are studied to account for the historical dependencies of sentiment-topic word distributions at current epoch, continuous, skip and multiple timescale models. Additionally, we further consider the links among news comments to avoid the error caused by user interactions. In order to mine more interpretable topics, a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model is adopted to label a set of meaningful phrases for augmenting the bag-of-word features.

We present a number of steps toward improving matching (correspondence) results. First, we analyze and reformulate a number of important matching constraints, including uniqueness, coarse-to-fine multiresolution, fine-to-coarse multiresolution, detailed match, figural continuity and the disparity gradient. This reformulation yields locally defined constraints, i.e. constraints are functions of individual matches or pairs of matches. Second, we define an algorithm that integrates the influence of these constraints cooperatively and in parallel using the General Support Principle. This principle states that except for uniqueness, only positive constraint influences are employed. Third, we implement this General Support Algorithm using a connectionist network. Such a network allows the constraints to be integrated naturally in a parallel, relaxation computation. The resulting connectionist network has been simulated and tested (including a simulation on a shared-memory multiprocessor). It generally produces a high percentage (93-99%) of correct matching decisions. In addition it usually requires a small number of network iterations to resolve most of the ambiguities. ::: In examining the results of the General Support Algorithm we find that the errors in matching were generally caused by circumstances that can not be explicitly addressed using locally defined and integrated constraints. These include incorrect matches near occlusions, ambiguous matches in occluded periodic regions of the images, and missing or erroneous matches due to significant structural variations between the images. We have developed two different approaches to overcoming these problems. The first incorporates additional information available from other image computations to identify problematic regions or to provide additional information that resolves these ambiguities. The second approach employs a third image in matching, and allows cooperative matching between two pairs of images. In addition to using the original General Support Algorithm, it employs new trinocular matching constraints.

To improve the scalability of knowledge inference, PRA exploits random walks to find Horn clauses with chain structures to predict new relations given existing facts.

In that context, we have developed a new approach to provide explanations and make SVMs results more actionable. The underlying idea is to produce explanations by applying symbolic Machine Learning models to SVM-produced ranking results. More precisely, we are contrasting SVM results from the top and bottom of rankings to detect the main discriminative properties between classes which can be quite useful for the practitioner to direct actions and understand the system.

Comparing to most existing state-of-the-art graph kernels, the proposed kernel has three theoretical advantages. First, it incorporates the locational correspondence information between graphs into the kernel computation, and thus overcomes the shortcoming of ignoring structural correspondences arising in most R-convolution kernels. Second, it guarantees the transitivity between the correspondence information that is not available for most existing matching kernels. Third, it incorporates the information of all graphs under comparisons into the kernel computation process, and thus encapsulates richer characteristics. By transductively training the C-SVM classifier, experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the new transitive-aligned kernel. The proposed kernel can outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels on standard graph-based datasets in terms of the classification accuracy.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2002.04425", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3005773342", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10239406", "5129873", "1550330", "16262476", "5909264", "207111403", "8790929", "140210845", "1504779", "17150665", "11162497", "1459319", "140109802", "779132", "506704", "6980404", "17988236", "1936094", "1458096", "10856944", "14949233", "1797579", "27931384", "1797579", "17557614", "2165870", "4770492", "1430801", "15483870", "207227372", "961425", "2374498"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211076269"}

Another, the lease square (LS) versions of SVM, called as LS-SVM, is also investigated for classification [3] and regression (LS-SVMR) [4]. In these LS-SVM formulations on works with equality instead of inequality constraints and a sum squared error cost function as it is frequently used in the training of traditional neural networks. This reformulation greatly simplifies the problem in such a way that the solution is characterized by a linear system, more precisely a KKT (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker) system [5], which takes a similar from as the linear system that one solves in every iteration step by the interior point method for the standard SVM [6]. This linear system can be efficiently solved by iterative methods such as conjugate gradient [7]. Then, a LS-SVM is computationally more effective than a SVM [8]. While a LS-SVM incorporates all training data in the network to produce the result, the traditional SVM selects some of SVs that are important in the regression. This sparseness of the traditional SVM can also be reached with the LS-SVM by applying a pruning method [8]. Besides, a radial basis function network is one of the SVM and it can be found in [2]. That is, the support vector algorithm can automatically determines cents, weights, and threshold that minimize an upper bound on the expected test error for the radial basis function network. In this study, two-stages support vector regression (TSSVR) approach is proposed to deal with training data set with outliers for fuzzy neural networks (FNNs). The proposed approach in the stage I, called as data preprocessing, the support vector machines for regression (SVMR) approach is used to filter out the outliers in the training data set and determine the number of fuzzy rule. Due to the outliers in the training data set are removed, the concept of robust statistic theory have no need to reduce the outlier\u2019s effect. Then, the training data set except for outliers, called as the reduced training data set, is directly used to training the sparse least squares support vector machines for regression (LS-SVMR) in the stage II. Consequently, the learning mechanism of the proposed approach for fuzzy neural network does not need iterated learning for simplified fuzzy inference systems.

Five-fold cross test was used to evaluate the results of c5.0, Random Forest, SVM and XGBOOST. Leave-one-out test was used to evaluate CRF.

In dynamic Internet environment, service providers rarely deliver the QoS as declared. Runtime adaptations of execution plans become necessary in order to recovery from web service failures, maintain SLAs, and/or continuously improve the overall QoS attributes. As QoS-aware service composition methods are mainly employed to fulfill runtime adaptations, the time efficiency usually becomes a challenge since the execution of a composite application is blocked until the new execution plan is found. Although existing works have provided high-quality methods to deal with QoS-aware service composition at design time, a suitable mechanism has not been established to utilize these methods coping with runtime adaptations in an efficient way. In this paper, we propose a novel empirical approach to accelerate QoS-aware runtime adaptation. Based on historical records, our approach uses Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to capture the relationship between candidate services and adaptation scenarios which are used at runtime to predict the probabilities that candidate services will be used for upcoming adaptation scenarios. Then candidate services are pruned based on these probability estimates to reduce the search space. The experimental results revealed the proposed approach can achieve significantly acceleration while satisfying considerable correctness.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICWS.2016.58", "venue": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)", "journal": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2515177249", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17977549", "7745989", "11021682", "10653976", "6353654", "18703453", "9573183", "15334766", "1243660", "181777", "15550387", "26274133", "16964276", "3271911", "2443646", "13784408", "18101835", "206787478", "7664224", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["58672915", "22112709"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55964"}

Contrary to most traditional ILP learning problems, biological sequences often have a high variation in their length. This variation in length is an important feature of biological sequences which should not be ignored by ILP systems. However we have identified that some ILP systems do not take into account the length of examples when evaluating their proposed hypotheses. During the learning process, many ILP systems use clause evaluation functions to assign a score to induced hypotheses, estimating their quality and effectively influencing the search. Traditionally, clause evaluation functions do not take into account the length of the examples which are covered by the clause. We propose L-modification, a way of modifying existing clause evaluation functions so that they take into account the length of the examples which they learn from. An empirical study was undertaken to investigate if significant improvements can be achieved by applying L-modification to a standard clause evaluation function. Furthermore, we generally investigated how ILP systems cope with the length of examples in training data. We show that our L-modified clause evaluation function outperforms our benchmark function in every experiment we conducted and thus we prove that L-modification is a useful concept. We also show that the length of the examples in the training data used by ILP systems does have an undeniable impact on the results.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "792171165", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57155108"}

{"paper_id": "36475526", "title": "Connectionist ideas and algorithms", "authors": [{"first": "Kevin", "middle": [], "last": "Knight", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "In our quest to build intelligent machines, we have but one naturally occurring model: the human brain. It follows that one natural idea for artificial intelligence (AI) is to simulate the functioning of the brain directly on a computer. Indeed, the idea of building an intelligent machine out of artificial neurons has been around for quite some time. Some early results on brain-line mechanisms were achieved by [18], and other researchers pursued this notion through the next two decades, e.g., [1, 4, 19, 21, 24]. Research in neural networks came to a virtual halt in the 1970s, however, when the networks under study were shown to be very weak computationally. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in neural networks. There are several reasons for this, including the appearance of faster digital computers on which to simulate larger networks, interest in building massively parallel computers, and most importantly, the discovery of powerful network learning algorithms. The new neural network architectures have been dubbed connectionist architectures. For the most part, these architectures are not meant to duplicate the operation of the human brain, but rather receive inspiration from known facts about how the brain works. They are characterized by Large numbers of very simple neuron-like processing elements; Large numbers of weighted connections between the elements\u2014the weights on the connections encode the knowledge of a network; Highly parallel, distributed control; and Emphasis on learning internal representations automatically. Connectionist researchers conjecture that thinking about computation in terms of the brain metaphor rather than the digital computer metaphor will lead to insights into the nature of intelligent behavior. Computers are capable of amazing feats. They can effortlessly store vast quantities of information. Their circuits operate in nanoseconds. They can perform extensive arithmetic calculations without error. Humans cannot approach these capabilities. On the other hand, humans routinely perform simple tasks such as walking, talking, and commonsense reasoning. Current AI systems cannot do any of these things better than humans. Why not? Perhaps the structure of the brain is somehow suited to these tasks, and not suited to tasks like high-speed arithmetic calculation. Working under constraints suggested by the brain may make traditional computation more difficult, but it may lead to solutions to AI problems that would otherwise be overlooked. What constraints, then, does the brain offer us? First of all, individual neurons are extremely slow devices when compared to their counterparts in digital computers. Neurons operate in the millisecond range, an eternity to a VLSI designer. Yet, humans can perform extremely complex tasks, like interpreting a visual scene or understanding a sentence, in just a tenth of a second. In other words, we do in about a hundred steps what current computers cannot do in ten million steps. How can this be possible? Unlike a conventional computer, the brain contains a huge number of processing elements that act in parallel. This suggests that in our search for solutions, we look for massively parallel algorithms that require no more than 100 processing steps [9]. Also, neurons are failure-prone devices. They are constantly dying (you have certainly lost a few since you began reading this article), and their firing patterns are irregular. Components in digital computers, on the other hand, must operate perfectly. Why? Such components store bits of information that are available nowhere else in the computer: the failure of one component means a loss of information. Suppose that we built AI programs that were not sensitive to the failure of a few components, perhaps by using redundancy and distributing information across a wide range of components? This would open the possibility of very large-scale implementations. With current technology, it is far easier to build a billion-component integrated circuit in which 95 percent of the components work correctly than it is to build a perfectly functioning million-component machine [8]. Another thing people seem to be able to do better than computers is handle fuzzy situations. We have very large memories of visual, auditory, and problem-solving episodes, and one key operation in solving new problems is finding closest matches to old situations. Inexact matching is something brain-style models seem to be good at, because of the diffuse and fluid way in which knowledge is represented. The idea behind connectionism, then, is that we may see significant advances in AI if we approach problems from the point of view of brain-style computation rather than rule-based symbol manipulation. At the end of this article, we will look more closely at the relationship between connectionist and symbolic AI.", "year": 1990, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/92755.92764", "venue": "CACM", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1978549074", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["13342881", "9337256", "58098738", "60305883", "13973497", "1692561", "14087507", "73677720", "7137403", "16567311", "62680121", "3057017", "55180507", "5986240", "2910104", "42208356", "13561350", "7899193", "60618453", "335788", "18028751", "13580693", "18160362", "46972780", "111010358", "18979303", "55460369", "32548737", "18964230", "62349699", "62231759", "8803095", "114873054", "56081859", "58277913", "6045568", "62624450"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:36475526"}

A number of ITS applications such as Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS), Dynamic Route Guidance (DRG) and Urban Traffic Control (UTC) can benefit from improved prediction of traffic variables for the short-term future. Traffic prediction during abnormal condition, such as incidents, is especially important to these applications. However, this is an area not well-researched. This paper presents a novel improvement to a k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) based traffic predictor with Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) technique based data preprocessing. This SSA-kNN framework is implemented for short-term traffic prediction under both normal and incident traffic conditions. A key feature of this approach is the data pre-processing step, which is designed to accommodate the extremely noisy sensor inputs that arise during incident conditions. This paper compares the prediction accuracy of the SSA-kNN approach with three other commonly used machine learning methods, kNN, Grey System Model (GM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Moreover, the sensitivity of traffic prediction accuracy to various kNN design parameters is explored.

One of the major contributions of this paper is the proposal for implementation of the decision function using only fixed point arithmetic without compromising the recognition accuracy. Compared to the scheme which uses floating point arithmetic, the proposed scheme reduces the number of LEs required by a factor of 3.29. The second scheme proposed results in about 25 times lower area compared to the first scheme. For the soft-core processor approach, a custom instruction is proposed for floating point arithmetic. Speaker dependent TI46 database of isolated digits is used for training and testing. Features are extracted using both Linear Predictive Coefficients (LPC) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCC) and features are compressed using Self Organized Feature Mapping (SOFM). This in turn is used by the SVM classifier to evaluate the recognition accuracy and the hardware resources utilized. Both the schemes proposed result in 100% recognition accuracy when implemented on Altera Cyclone II FPGA. The proposed schemes can also be used for speaker verification and speaker authentication applications. Since the scheme which uses soft-core processor requires lower area, it can be used for systems which require a large vocabulary size.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.23", "venue": "2009 22nd International Conference on VLSI Design", "journal": "2009 22nd International Conference on VLSI Design", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2100605071", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["46724827", "1614843", "8719870", "14261126", "53783407", "1369781", "15202588", "14727192", "52874011", "7788300", "63462058", "38824611", "44754084"], "inbound_citations": ["11080601", "38927996", "2426567", "110331813", "13937809", "14201670", "20926051", "7704220", "7084534", "28399097", "8408468", "17519254", "12689808", "199589807", "12965320", "12548450", "29231334", "6495282", "8613644"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206843493"}

The training data is prepared by randomly selecting some text sentences from the large corpus of financial text. Conventionally, bootstrapping algorithm is used to annotate large volume of unlabeled data by learning from a small set of annotated data. However, the small set of annotated data have to be carefully chosen as seed data. Thus, our approach is a digress from the conventional approach of bootstrapping as we let the users randomly select the seed data. We show that our proposed algorithm has an accuracy of 73.56% in classifying the financial texts into the different categories (\u201cAccounting\u201d, \u201cCost\u201d, \u201cEmployee\u201d, \u201cFinancing\u201d, \u201cSales\u201d, \u201cInvestments\u201d, \u201cOperations\u201d, \u201cProfit\u201d, \u201cRegulations\u201d and \u201cIrrelevant\u201d) even when the training data is just 30% of the total data set. Additionally, the accuracy improves by an approximate average of 2% for an increase of the training data by 10% and the accuracy of our system is 77.91% when the training data is about 50% of the total data set. As a dictionary of hand chosen keywords prepared by domain experts are often used for financial text extraction, we assumed the existence of almost linearly separable hyperplanes between the different classes and therefore, we have used Linear Support Vector Machine along with a modified version of Label Propagation Algorithm which exploits the notion of neighborhood (in Euclidean space) for classification. We believe that our proposed techniques will be of help to Early Warning Systems used in banks where large volumes of unstructured texts need to be processed for better insights about a company.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2017.07.016", "venue": "Expert Syst.

To overcome the two problems, an ensemble DAE is proposed for operational reliability assessment. Firstly, different structure parameters are employed to design a series of DAEs for feature learning from the measured data. Secondly, a feature ensemble strategy is designed to enhance the generalization ability of the DAE model, in which the features learned by different DAEs are clustered to remove the irrelevant DAEs and select the more general feature subset. Finally, the operational reliability indicator is defined by the Euclidean distance of the selected features and the operational reliability model is developed.

The host markers and highly co-mutated individual sites and site pairs (P values < 0.035) in the three gene segments were identified with their relative significance between the overlapping genes calculated.

In order to evaluate the usability of protein biomarkers for pre-screening purposes several different approaches were used, including machine learning algorithms. All persons involved in the study had diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was diagnosed by capturing 7-field fundus images, evaluated by two independent ophthalmologists. 165 eyes were examined (from 119 patients), 55 were diagnosed healthy and 110 images showed signs of DR. Tear samples were taken from all eyes and state-of-the-art nano-HPLC coupled ESI-MS/MS mass spectrometry protein identification was performed on all samples. Applicability of protein biomarkers was evaluated by six different optimally parameterized machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Recursive Partitioning, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor. Out of the six investigated machine learning algorithms the result of Recursive Partitioning proved to be the most accurate.

However, the high mutation rate of HIV permits the emergence of variants that can be resistant to the drug treatment. Predicting drug resistance to previously unobserved variants is therefore very important for an optimum medical treatment. In this paper, we propose the use of weighted categorical kernel functions to predict drug resistance from virus sequence data. These kernel functions are very simple to implement and are able to take into account HIV data particularities, such as allele mixtures, and to weigh the different importance of each protein residue, as it is known that not all positions contribute equally to the resistance. We analyzed 21 drugs of four classes: protease inhibitors (PI), integrase inhibitors (INI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). We compared two categorical kernel functions, Overlap and Jaccard, against two well-known noncategorical kernel functions (Linear and RBF) and Random Forest (RF). Weighted versions of these kernels were also considered, where the weights were obtained from the RF decrease in node impurity. The Jaccard kernel was the best method, either in its weighted or unweighted form, for 20 out of the 21 drugs. Results show that kernels that take into account both the categorical nature of the data and the presence of mixtures consistently result in the best prediction model. The advantage of including weights depended on the protein targeted by the drug. In the case of reverse transcriptase, weights based in the relative importance of each position clearly increased the prediction performance, while the improvement in the protease was much smaller. This seems to be related to the distribution of weights, as measured by the Gini index.

In this paper, a soft-sensor based on SVM and coupled to Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented and applied to estimate the concentrations of lipid fermentation variables: lipids, biomass, and citric acid. The soft-sensor was trained with one data set, and validated with an independent data set of fed-batch fermentations. The PSO-SVM was compared with the SVM algorithm.

However, its performance depends not only on its features but also on data preprocessing and model tuning. The main purpose of this paper is to compare the efficiency of more Support Vector Machine models using both TF-IDF approach and Word2Vec and Doc2Vec neural networks for text data representation. Besides the data vectorization process, I try to enhance the models\u2019 efficiency by identifying which kind of kernel fits better the data or if it is just better to opt for the linear case. My results prove that for the \u201cReuters 21578\u201d dataset, nonlinear Support Vector Machine is more efficient when the conversion of text data into numerical attributes is realized using Word2Vec models instead of TF-IDF and Doc2Vec representations. When it is considered that data meet linear separability requirements, TF-IDF representation outperforms all other options. Surprisingly, Doc2Vec models have the lowest performance and only in terms of computational cost they provide satisfactory results. This paper proves that while Word2Vec models are truly efficient for text data representation, Doc2Vec neural networks are unable to exceed even TF-IDF index representation.

Land use-land cover (LULC) maps can be used as a decision making tool by policy makers to ensure sustainable development and understanding of the effect of human activities within and around PAs.

Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are good at learning strong classifier and discriminative features, CNNs can not perform well in incremental classifier learning due to the catastrophic forgetting problem in the retraining process. In this paper, we propose a novel yet extremely simple approach to enhance the discriminative property of features for incremental classifier learning. We build a network for the universal feature space in which a group of image classes have intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. And, we model each incremental class to have a maximum margin from the rest of the models in universal space.

Random Forest and Rotation Forest are two approaches which are perceived as \"classic\" at present.

However, the splitting criteria used for constructing each tree in Random Forest and Rotation Forest are Gini index and information gain ratio respectively, which are skew-sensitive. When learning from highly imbalanced datasets, class imbalance impedes their ability to learn the minority class concept. Hellinger distance decision tree (HDDT) was proposed by Chawla, which is skew-insensitive. Especially, bagged unpruned HDDT has proven to be an effective way to deal with highly imbalanced problem. Nevertheless, the bootstrap sampling used in Bagging can lead to ensembles of low diversity compared to Random Forest and Rotation Forest. In order to combine the skew-insensitivity of HDDT and the diversities of Random Forest and Rotation Forest, we use Hellinger distance as the splitting criterion for building each tree in Random Forest and Rotation Forest respectively. An experimental framework is performed across a wide range of highly imbalanced datasets to investigate the effectiveness of Hellinger distance, information gain ratio and Gini index which are used as the splitting criteria in ensembles of decision trees including Bagging, Boosting, Random Forest and Rotation Forest. In addition, Balanced Random Forest is also included in the experiment since it is designed to tackle class imbalance problem.

We propose the use of logistic regression with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to capture the most critical input features.

An additional advantage of LASSO is its probabilistic output, which allows evaluation of diagnosis certainty.

However, this conclusion is valid only for the specific assumptions made in parallel models implemented to date, and is not valid more generally. As Townsend and colleagues (Snodgrass & Townsend, 1980; Townsend, 1972) have argued, parallel models can mimic linearly increasing RTs as the number of items to be processed increases if stochastic processing times, limited processing capacity (i.e., attention), and a self-terminating stopping rule (i.e., the criterion to initiate articulation corresponding to the segment) are considered.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2623849002,2773110375", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67113881"}

We consider two main datasets for the performance evaluation. The first dataset is an artificial dataset based on representative templates from 11 types of galaxies, which are evaluated with different transformations (noise, smoothing), alone or combined. The evaluation is based on image retrieval performance to estimate the robustness of the rotation invariant descriptors with this type of images. The second dataset is composed of real images extracted from the Galaxy Zoo 2 project. The binary classification of elliptical and spiral galaxies is achieved with pre-processing steps including morphological filtering and a Laplacian pyramid. For the binary classification, we compare the different set of features with Support Vector Machines, Extreme Learning Machine, and different types of linear discriminant analysis techniques.

In this work, thermal images of machine conditions are firstly decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by utilizing BEMD. At each decomposition level, the IMF is expanded and fused with the residue by using gray-scale transformation and principal component analysis fusion technique, respectively. Finally, the enhanced image is rebuilt from the improved IMFs in reconstruction process. In order to diagnose the machine faults, histogram features are extracted from enhanced image. This results in high dimensionality of feature set which causes difficulties for data storage and decreases the accuracy in fault diagnosis. The high dimensionality is surmounted by employing the generalized discriminant analysis (GDA), which is one of the feature extraction methods. The features obtained from GDA are subsequently utilized for fault diagnosis system in which support vector machine is used as classifier.

Unfortunately, the two QPPs still lead to rather high computational costs. Moreover, although TWSVM has better classification performance than GEPSVM, a major disadvantage is it fails to exploit the underlying correlation or similarity information between any pair of data points with the same labels that may be important for classification performance as much as possible. To mitigate the above deficiencies, in this paper, we propose a novel nonparallel plane classifier, called Weighted Twin Support Vector Machines with Local Information (WLTSVM). WLTSVM mines as much underlying similarity information within samples as possible. This method not only retains the superior characteristics of TWSVM, but also has its additional advantages: (1) comparable or better classification accuracy compared to SVM, GEPSVM and TWSVM; (2) taking motivation from standard SVM, the concept of support vectors is retained; (3) more efficient than TWSVM in terms of computational costs; and (4) only one penalty parameter is considered as opposed to two in TWSVM.

Unlike previous methods, the fingerprint coarseness is modeled as multiplicative noise rather than additive noise and is extracted by cepstral analysis. A random forest classifier is employed to select effective features among the extracted features and to differentiate fake from live fingerprints.

Therefore, in order to enhance enterprise\u2019s training-implementing ability, Taiwan has designed a set of Taiwan TrainQuali System (TTQS) using a training quality score card to perform the assessment and audit. It is important to understand whether the introducing TTQS mechanism to an enterprise can enhance business operation performance and enterprise\u2019s competitiveness, and it is also important to know also if the entire training-implementing attitude of the training-implementing personnel will affect the assessment and audit result of an enterprise.

In this study, Genetic Algorithm is associated with Support Vector Machine technique to perform data mining and analysis. The experimental results show that within an enterprise, enterprise supervisor and training personnel of different standing points will have different thinking on the introduction of TTQS, and there is also significant difference on the educational training attitude too.

Inspired by the trainable attention model via deep architecture, and the fact that the periocular region is proven to be the most salient region for gender classification purposes, we are able to design a progressive convolutional neural network training paradigm to enforce the attention shift during the learning process. The hope is to enable the network to attend to particular high-profile regions (e.g., the periocular region) without the need to change the network architecture itself. The network benefits from this attention shift and becomes more robust toward occlusions and low-resolution degradations. With the progressively trained attention shift convolutional neural networks (PTAS-CNN) models, we have achieved better gender classification results on the large-scale PCSO mugshot database with 400 K images under occlusion and low-resolution settings, compared to the one undergone traditional training. In addition, our progressively trained network is sufficiently generalized so that it can be robust to occlusions of arbitrary types and at arbitrary locations, as well as low resolution. One way to further improve the robustness of the proposed gender classification algorithm is to invoke a generative approach for occluded image recovery, such as using the deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN). The facial occlusions degradation studied in this work is a missing data challenge. For the occlusion problems, the missing data locations are known whether they are randomly scattered, or in a contiguous fashion.

Despite the fact that long-term recall is excellent in such situations, short-term recall is poor, worse than in the long-term case. This article presents a model, based upon Hebb\u2019s cell assembly construct, to account for this puzzling data. The system, called MultiTrace, has previously been used to model a lexical priming task and was adapted with only minor changes for this task. Introduction The relationship between arousal and short-term memory has presented a problem for standard memory models for nearly 40 years. In a pair of studies in the early 1960s Kleinsmith and Kaplan (1963; 1964) found that while there is a positive correlation between increases in arousal and long-term memory, in the short-term case the reverse is true. Further, in cases of where arousal markedly increases, short-term recall is substantially worse than long-term recall, an effect called \u201creminiscence.\u201d Because these results challenge standard memory models in which short-term memory is necessarily stronger than long-term memory, they have often been criticized, but just as often have been replicated (Eysenck, 1977; Weingartner & Parker, 1984; Revelle & Loftus, 1990). To date, no widely accepted explanation has ever been provided to account for the data (see, for example, Revelle & Loftus, 1990). However, more modern views of memory, updated with an increased understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms involved, can now provide a plausible explanation of the data. This article presents an existing model that can account for the data in a way that is surprisingly close to the original account of Kleinsmith and Kaplan. The model used in this article, called MultiTrace (Sonntag, 1991; Chown, 1994; Forbell & Chown, 2000), is a variant on the cell assembly construct proposed by Hebb (1949) and later extended by Kaplan, et. al. in their TRACE system (1991). What makes the cell assembly model so attractive for this task is that, unlike many other neural network models, cell assemblies have complex temporal dynamics directly affected by the physiological properties of neurons. MultiTrace is an extension of the single cell assembly TRACE model to allowing sequence learning through the inclusion of multiple cell assemblies. This article will begin with a discussion of the Kleinsmith and Kaplan data and some of the theoretical problems it raises. Next the MultiTrace model is presented, highlighting parts of the model directly relevant to this task. Finally, the original experiments are modeled in MultiTrace and the results are compared to the originals. Reminiscence The learning paradigm used by Kleinsmith and Kaplan was a simple paired-associate task. In the first experiment, subjects were shown a word for four seconds and then the same word and a number for another four seconds. The recall task was to remember the number when the word was given as a cue. Changes in galvanic skin response (GSR) deflection were used as the measure of arousal response. These changes were sorted into \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d categories for each subject. In the long-term case (one week), Kleinsmith and Kaplan got the results that they expected \u2013 recall was better for words in the \u201chigh\u201d category. The surprising result was that in the short- term cases (2 minutes and 20 minutes) this was not the case, and further, recall in the \u201chigh\u201d categories was worse than in the long-term case. When the arousal deflection was \u201clow\u201d, the recall curves generated were what would normally be predicted \u2013 short-term recall was very good but decayed over time (Figure 1). In the \u201chigh\u201d case, however, Kleinsmith and Kaplan found that the recall curve was essentially an inverted U (Figure 1). To address criticism of the original study, Kleinsmith and Kaplan replicated their work the following year, but used nonsense syllables instead of words, and got qualitatively similar results.

Early detection of individuals at risk of lung cancer is critical to reduce the mortality rate. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prospective risk prediction model to identify patients at risk of new incident lung cancer within the next 1 year in the general population. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Data from individual patient electronic health records (EHRs) were extracted from the Maine Health Information Exchange network. The study population consisted of patients with at least one EHR between April 1, 2016, and March 31, 2018, who had no history of lung cancer. A retrospective cohort (N=873,598) and a prospective cohort (N=836,659) were formed for model construction and validation. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was adopted to build the model. It assigned a score to each individual to quantify the probability of a new incident lung cancer diagnosis from October 1, 2016, to September 31, 2017. The model was trained with the clinical profile in the retrospective cohort from the preceding 6 months and validated with the prospective cohort to predict the risk of incident lung cancer from April 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.881 (95% CI 0.873-0.889) in the prospective cohort. Two thresholds of 0.0045 and 0.01 were applied to the predictive scores to stratify the population into low-, medium-, and high-risk categories. The incidence of lung cancer in the high-risk category (579/53,922, 1.07%) was 7.7 times higher than that in the overall cohort (1167/836,659, 0.14%). Age, a history of pulmonary diseases and other chronic diseases, medications for mental disorders, and social disparities were found to be associated with new incident lung cancer. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: We retrospectively developed and prospectively validated an accurate risk prediction model of new incident lung cancer occurring in the next 1 year. Through statistical learning from the statewide EHR data in the preceding 6 months, our model was able to identify statewide high-risk patients, which will benefit the population health through establishment of preventive interventions or more intensive surveillance.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6542253", "pubmed_id": "31099339", "doi": "10.2196/13260", "venue": "Journal of Medical Internet Research", "journal": "Journal of Medical Internet Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2941233955,2975026923", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149546104"}

Inspired by recent advances in disentangled representation, in this paper we propose DMT (Disentangled Makeup Transfer), a unified generative adversarial network to achieve different scenarios of makeup transfer. Our model contains an identity encoder as well as a makeup encoder to disentangle the personal identity and the makeup style for arbitrary face images. Based on the outputs of the two encoders, a decoder is employed to reconstruct the original faces. We also apply a discriminator to distinguish real faces from fake ones. As a result, our model can not only transfer the makeup styles from one or more reference face images to a non-makeup face with controllable strength, but also produce various outputs with styles sampled from a prior distribution.

Mostly the modeling approaches focused on an average response of a large group of building occupants. Recently, the focus has been shifted towards personal comfort models that predict individuals' thermal comfort responses. Currently, thermal comfort responses are collected from the occupants via survey. This study explored if the thermal comfort of individuals could be predicted using machine learning algorithms while relaying on the set of collected inputs from an experiment. The model was developed using experimental data including collected from a previously performed experiment in the climate chamber. Two different approaches based on the output data (thermal sensation and thermal comfort votes) and five different sets of input variables were explored. The algorithms tested were Support Vector Machine with four different Kernel functions (Linear, Quadratic, Cubic and Gaussian) and Ensemble Algorithms (Boosted trees, Bagged trees and RUSBoosted trees). The combination of occupants' heating behavior with a personal comfort system (PCS), skin temperatures, time and environmental data were used for the development of personal comfort models to predict individuals' thermal preference. The study investigated the novel combination of inputs such as the use of skin temperature and settings of the personalized heating system as parameters in predicting personal thermal comfort. The results showed that personal comfort models among all tested approaches and subjects showed the best median accuracy of 0.84 using RUSBoosted trees. Individually looking, the approach using thermal sensation output produced better prediction accuracy. On the other hand, the models based on inputs that consisted of PCS control behavior and mean and hand skin temperatures produced the best prediction accuracy when assessing all tested algorithms.

Coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), this algorithm can take advantage of spectral dimension reduction and parameter optimization of LS-SVM model. In PCA-PSO-LS-SVM algorithm, PCA algorithm is firstly employed to reduce the dimension of raw spectra for simplicity based on the cumulative contribution rate of variation of each principle component. Then, to get the calibration model with better prediction precision, the strategies of grid searching and PSO searching are used to optimize the parameters of LS-SVM model in calibration set. At last, the prediction model can be constructed using the optimum parameters of LS-SVM obtained in calibration phase.

This work analyzes more than 40 GB data by testing different strategies of reducing the processed data without losing and compromising on the detection and model learning in machine learning. Many alternatives are analyzed and it is observed that 50% reduction does not drastically harm the machine learning model performance. On average, in SVM only 3.6%, and in Random Forest, only 1.8% performance is reduced, if only 50% data is used. The 50% reduction in instances means that in most cases, the data will fit in the RAM and the processing times will be considerably reduced, benefitting in execution times and or resources. From the incremental training and testing experiments, it is found that in special cases, smaller sub-sampled data can be used for model generation in machine learning problems.

For reduction of the death rate due to breast cancer, early detection and treatment are of utmost necessity. Recent developments in digital mammography imaging systems have aimed to better diagnosis of abnormalities present in the breast. In the current scenario, mammography is an effectual and reliable method for an accurate detection of breast cancer. Digital mammograms are computerized X-ray images of breasts. Reading of mammograms is a crucial task for radiologists as they suggest patients for biopsy. It has been studied that radiologists report several interpretations for the same mammographic image. Thus, mammogram interpretation is a repetitive task that requires maximum attention for the avoidance of misinterpretation. Therefore, at present, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system is exceptionally popular which analyzes the mammograms with the usage of image processing and pattern recognition techniques and classify them into several classes namely, malignant, benign, and normal. The CAD system recognizes the type of tissues automatically by collecting and analyzing significant features from mammographic images. In this thesis, the contributions aim at developing the new and useful features from mammograms for classification of the pattern of tissues. Additionally, some feature reduction techniques have been proposed to select the reduced set of significant features prior to classification. In this context, five different schemes have been proposed for extraction and selection of relevant features for subsequent classification. Using the relevant features, several classifiers are employed for classification of mammograms to derive an overall inference. Each scheme has been validated using two standard databases, namely MIAS and DDSM in isolation. The achieved results are very promising with respect to classification accuracy in comparison to the existing schemes and have been elaborated in each chapter. In Chapter 2, hybrid features are developed using Two-Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform (2D-DWT) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) in succession. Subsequently relevant features are selected using t-test. The resultant feature set is of substantially lower dimension. On application of various classifiers it is observed that Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) gives better classification accuracy as compared to others. In Chapter 3, a Segmentation-based Fractal Texture Analysis (SFTA) is used to extract the texture features from the mammograms. A Fast Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF) method has been used to generate a significant feature subset. Among all classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) results superior classification accuracy. In Chapter 4, Two-Dimensional Discrete Orthonormal S-Transform (2D-DOST) is used to extract the features from mammograms. A feature selection methodology based on null-hypothesis with statistical two-sample t-test method has been suggested to select most significant features. This feature with AdaBoost and Random Forest (AdaBoost-RF) classifier outperforms other classifierswith respect to accuracy. In Chapter 5, features are derived using Two-Dimensional Slantlet Transform (2D-SLT) from mammographic images. The most significant features are selected by utilizing the Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLogR) method. Utilizing these features, LogitBoost and Random Forest (LogitBoost-RF) classifier gives the better classification accuracy among all the classifiers. In Chapter 6, Fast Radial Symmetry Transform (FRST) is applied to mammographic images for derivation of radially symmetric features. A t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method has been utilized to select most relevant features. Using these features, classification experiments have been carried out through all the classifiers. A Logistic Model Tree (LMT) classifier achieves optimal results among all classifiers. An overall comparative analysis has also been made among all our suggested features and feature reduction techniques along with the corresponding classifier where they show superior results.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2504493275", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63645412"}

Thus, there is a strong motivation for \ufb01nding ef\ufb01cientautomated methods to perform functional annotation. Automatedannotation can take on several forms. Simple decision-making logicsuch as transferring annotations from top BLAST hits are oftenused to provide preliminary annotations for proteins or expressedsequence tags (ESTs).

The GOA project relies on several mappings to provideautomated GO annotations for users (Camon et al., 2003, 2004).Automated functional annotation lends itself well to the applica-tion of statistical pattern recognition techniques and a number ofapproaches have been developed that use different feature sets andalgorithms for assigning functions to proteins (Biswas et al., 2002;Al-Shahib et al., 2005; Vinayagam et al., 2004, 2006; Khan et al.,2003; Hennig et al., 2003; Martin et al., 2004; King et al., 2000;Pavlidis et al., 2001).

In order to achieve such automatic operation, high fidelity and computationally efficiency whole building energy forecasting models are needed. Currently, data-driven (black box) models and hybrid (grey box) models are commonly used in model based building control. However, typical black box models often require long training period and are bounded to building operation conditions during the training period. On the other hand, creating a grey box model often requires (a) long calculation time due to parameter optimization process; and (b) expert knowledge during the model development process. This paper attempts to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of two significant system characteristics: system nonlinearity and response time, on the accuracy of the model developed by a system identification process. A general methodology for building energy forecasting model development is then developed. How to adapt the system identification process based on these two characteristics is also studied. A set of comparison criteria are then proposed to evaluate the energy forecasting models generated from the adapted system identification process against other methods reported in the literature, including Resistance and Capacitance method, Support Vector Regression method, Artificial Neural Networks method, and N4SID subspace algorithm. Two commercial buildings: a small and a medium commercial building, with varying chiller nonlinearity, are simulated using EnergyPlus in lieu of real buildings for model development and evaluation.

While machine learning techniques offer promising results in automated detection of Windows and Android malware, there have been limited efforts in extending them to OS X malware detection.

Wavelet Energy, and 2. Wavelet Entropy. EEG Channels reduction was then implemented to reduce the complexity of the features. The ground truth emotional states of each subject were inferred using Russel's circumplex model of emotion, that is, by mapping the subjectively reported degrees of valence (pleasure) and arousal to the appropriate emotions - for example, an emotion with high valence and high arousal is equivalent to a `happy' emotional state, while low valence and low arousal is equivalent to a `sad' emotional state.

Automated information extraction procedures can assist in the acquisition and management of this knowledge. Previous efforts in biomedical text mining have focused primarily upon named entity recognition of well-defined molecular objects such as genes, but less work has been performed to identify disease-related objects and concepts. Furthermore, promise has been tempered by an inability to efficiently scale approaches in ways that minimize manual efforts and still perform with high accuracy. Here, we have applied a machine-learning approach previously successful for identifying molecular entities to a disease concept to determine if the underlying probabilistic model effectively generalizes to unrelated concepts with minimal manual intervention for model retraining.ResultsWe developed a named entity recognizer (MTag), an entity tagger for recognizing clinical descriptions of malignancy presented in text. The application uses the machine-learning technique Conditional Random Fields with additional domain-specific features. MTag was tested with 1,010 training and 432 evaluation documents pertaining to cancer genomics. Overall, our experiments resulted in 0.85 precision, 0.83 recall, and 0.84 F-measure on the evaluation set. Compared with a baseline system using string matching of text with a neoplasm term list, MTag performed with a much higher recall rate (92.1% vs. 42.1% recall) and demonstrated the ability to learn new patterns. Application of MTag to all MEDLINE abstracts yielded the identification of 580,002 unique and 9,153,340 overall mentions of malignancy.

Surprisingly, this is even possible for GANs with same architecture and same training that only differ by the training seed.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1811.08180", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "mag_id": "2901566135", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["209202273", "214603516", "211090913", "209531954", "146807759", "213177377", "214743122", "207870154", "202771852", "196622700", "209444798", "195732375", "57189570", "208527270", "207930418", "199457628", "203641883"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53787410"}

Online news articles provide timely information on disease outbreaks worldwide. In this study, we investigated automated detection of articles relevant to disease outbreaks using machine learning classifiers. In a real-life setting, it is expensive to prepare a training data set for classifiers, which usually consists of manually labeled relevant and irrelevant articles. To mitigate this challenge, we examined the use of randomly sampled unlabeled articles as well as labeled relevant articles. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Na\u00efve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were trained on 149 relevant and 149 or more randomly sampled unlabeled articles. Diverse classifiers were trained by varying the number of sampled unlabeled articles and also the number of word features. The trained classifiers were applied to 15 thousand articles published over 15 days. Top-ranked articles from each classifier were pooled and the resulting set of 1337 articles was reviewed by an expert analyst to evaluate the classifiers. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Daily averages of areas under ROC curves (AUCs) over the 15-day evaluation period were 0.841 and 0.836, respectively, for the na\u00efve Bayes and SVM classifier. We referenced a database of disease outbreak reports to confirm that this evaluation data set resulted from the pooling method indeed covered incidents recorded in the database during the evaluation period. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The proposed text classification framework utilizing randomly sampled unlabeled articles can facilitate a cost-effective approach to training machine learning classifiers in a real-life Internet-based biosurveillance project.

To tackle this issue, we propose to use a small and deep classification forest to encode each atlas individually in reference to an aligned probabilistic atlas, resulting in an Atlas Forest (AF). At test time, each AF yields a probabilistic label estimate, and fusion is done by averaging. Our scheme performs only one registration per target image, achieves good results with a simple fusion scheme, and allows for efficient experimentation.

Recent effective methods are developed in a pair-wise similarity learning system to detect a fixed set of features from distinct regions which are mapped to their vector embeddings for the distance measuring. However, the most relevant and crucial parts of each image are detected independently without referring to the dependency conditioned on one and another. Also, these region based methods rely on spatial manipulation to position the local features in comparable similarity measuring. To combat these limitations, in this paper we introduce the Deep Co-attention based Comparators (DCCs) that fuse the co-dependent representations of the paired images so as to focus on the relevant parts of both images and produce their \\textit{relative representations}. Given a pair of pedestrian images to be compared, the proposed model mimics the foveation of human eyes to detect distinct regions concurrent on both images, namely co-dependent features, and alternatively attend to relevant regions to fuse them into the similarity learning. Our comparator is capable of producing dynamic representations relative to a particular sample every time, and thus well-suited to the case of re-identifying pedestrians on-the-fly. We perform extensive experiments to provide the insights and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCCs in person re-ID.

Researchers now have to filter the large field of potentially useful information to find the golden nuggets that will serve their needs, while ignoring data that would actually hamper their experiments. To address this issue, we propose a novel integration of a variogram-based system for selecting potentially informative relationships with a Gaussian Conditional Random Field (GCRF) model that is able to perform node attribute prediction in social networks that are both temporal and contain a wide variety of relationship types. By first evaluating the large pool of relationships via variograms, which can be done very quickly, we are able to fully utilize the power of the GCRF model, which becomes computationally expensive when the network size or the number of relationships examined grows.

In their target article Kashima and colleagues try to show how a connectionist model conceptualization of the self is best suited to capture the self's temporal and socio-culturally contextualized nature. They propose a new model and to support this model, the authors conduct computer simulations of psychological phenomena whose importance for the self has long been clear, even if not formally modeled, such as imitation, and learning of sequence and narrative. As explicated when we advocated connectionist models as a metaphor for self in Mischel and Morf (2003), we fully endorse the utility of such a metaphor, as these models have some of the processing characteristics necessary for capturing key aspects and functions of a dynamic cognitive-affective self-system. As elaborated in that chapter, we see as their principal strength that connectionist models can take account of multiple simultaneous processes without invoking a single central control. All outputs reflect a distributed pattern of activation across a large number of simple processing units, the nature of which depends on (and changes with) the connection weights between the links and the satisfaction of mutual constraints across these links (Rummelhart & McClelland, 1986).

Due to the growing demand for video summarization in marketing, advertising agencies, awareness videos, documentaries, and other interest groups, researchers are continuously proposing automation frameworks and novel schemes. Since the scene classification is a fundamental component of video summarization and video analysis, the quality of scene classification is particularly important. This article focuses on various practical implementation gaps over the existing techniques and presents a method to achieve high-quality of scene classification. We consider cricket as a case study and classify five scene categories, i.e., batting, bowling, boundary, crowd and close-up. We employ our model using pre-trained AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for scene classification. The proposed method employs new, fully connected layers in an encoder fashion. We employ data augmentation to achieve a high accuracy of 99.26% over a smaller dataset. We conduct a performance comparison against baseline approaches to prove the superiority of the method as well as state-of-the-art models.

Forensic techniques that independently verify the declared species and geographic origin are needed, as current legality procedures are based on certificates and documents that can be falsified. Timber from the genus Cedrela is among the most economically valued tropical timbers worldwide. Three Cedrela species are included in the Appendix III of CITES: C. fissilis, C. odorata and C. angustifolia (listed as C. lilloi). Cedrela timber is currently traded with false origin declarations and under a different species name, but tools to verify this are lacking. We used Direct Analysis in Real Time Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (DART-TOFMS) to chemically identify Cedrela species and sites of origin. Heartwood samples from six Cedrela species (the three CITES-listed species plus C. balansae, C. montana and C. saltensis) were collected at 11 sites throughout Bolivia. Mass spectra detected by DART-TOFMS comprised 1062 compounds; their relative intensities were analysed using Principal Component Analyses, Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA) and Random Forest analyses to check discrimination potential among species and sites. Species were identified with a mean discrimination error of 15\u201319 per cent, with substantial variation in discrimination accuracy among species. The lowest error was observed in C. fissilis (mean = 4.4 per cent). Site discrimination error was considerably higher: 43\u201354 per cent for C. fissilis and 42\u201348 per cent for C. odorata. These results provide good prospects to differentiate C. fissilis from other species, but at present there is no scope to do so for other tested species. Thus, discrimination is highly species specific. Our findings for tests of geographic origin suggest no potential to discriminate at the studied scale and for the studied species.

Early ILP systems, such as FOIL, Golem and LINUS learned single predicate definitions from positive and negative examples and extensional background knowledge. They also employed strong learning biases such as ij-determinacy. Although these systems found a number of applications, they had problems in areas such as molecular biology and natural language learning. General mechanisms for inverting entailment have now been developed which support the use of non-ground background knowledge, and the revision of multiple inter-related predicates. ILP theory results concerning complete refinement graph operators now allow efficient admissible searches. The absolute requirement for negative examples (rare within natural language domains) has been eased by Bayesian analysis of learning from positive-only examples. Bayesian approaches have also supported sample complexity analysis of predicate invention within the framework of repeat learning. In this framework it is assumed that the learner's prior is not equivalent to the distribution from which the teacher is sampling targets. By providing a series of sessions the learner is able to update the initial prior by adding and deleting background predicates. Within the Bayesian framework stochastic logic program representations have been used to estimate the distribution of examples over the instance space. Stochastic logic programs are a generalisation of hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars. Apart from a few special cases PAC-learning results have been largely negative for ILP. This is in large part due to the fact that testing satisfiability is intractable for most interesting subsets of first-order Horn logic. The development of Bayesian approaches to ILP supported the development of U-learnability, which allows classes of distributions over the hypotheses. Here it was shown that for any exponential-decay distribution the class of time-bounded logic-programs is polynomially U-learnable. The use of such bounds on proof depth is common within ILP systems.

LSSVM classifiers are an alternative to SVM ones due to the training process of LSSVM classifiers only requires to solve a linear equation system instead of a quadratic programming optimization problem. However, the lost of sparseness in the Lagrange multipliers vector (i.e. the solution) is a significant drawback which comes out with theses classifiers. In order to overcome this lack of sparseness, we propose a novel GA approach to leave a few support vectors out of the solution without affecting the classifier's accuracy and even improving it. The main idea is to leave out outliers, non-relevant patterns or those ones which can be corrupted with noise and thus prevent classifiers to achieve higher accuracies along with a reduced set of support vectors. This algorithm is attractive when one seeks a competitive classifier with large datasets and limited computing resources.

The presence of a speaker\u2019s accent in the speech signal has significant implications for the accuracy of speech recognition because the effectiveness of an Automatic Speech Recognition System (ASR) is greatly reduced when the particular accent or dialect in the speech samples on which it is trained differs from the accent or dialect of the end-user [4] [14].

In this paper, we present a comparative study of the performance of three techniques resulting from the field of the artificial intelligence namely: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), RBF Neural Networks (RBF-NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Developed from the statistical learning theory, these methods display optimal training performances and generalization in many fields of application, among others the field of pattern recognition. In order to evaluate their performances regarding the recognition rate, training time, and robustness, a simulation using generated and real data is carried out. To validate their functionalities, an application performed on real data is presented.

Up to now, few works have been done to explore CL for the data with graph structure. Therefore, this article proposes a novel CL algorithm that can be utilized to guide the Label Propagation (LP) over graphs, of which the target is to \u201clearn\u201d the labels of unlabeled examples on the graphs. Specifically, we assume that different unlabeled examples have different levels of difficulty for propagation, and their label learning should follow a simple-to-difficult sequence with the updated curricula. Furthermore, considering that the practical data are often characterized by multiple modalities, every modality in our method is associated with a \u201cteacher\u201d that not only evaluates the difficulties of examples from its own viewpoint, but also cooperates with other teachers to generate the overall simplest curriculum examples for propagation. By taking the curriculums suggested by the teachers as a whole, the common preference (i.e., commonality) of teachers on selecting the simplest examples can be discovered by a row-sparse matrix, and their distinct opinions (i.e., individuality) are captured by a sparse noise matrix. As a result, an accurate curriculum sequence can be established and the propagation quality can thus be improved. Theoretically, we prove that the propagation risk bound is closely related to the examples\u2019 difficulty information, and empirically, we show that our method can generate higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art CL approach and LP algorithms on various multi-modal tasks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3322122", "venue": "TIST", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2963102641", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6793014", "6852251", "52019590", "873046", "7211257", "8411963", "2374498", "18963274", "7389881", "645240", "18990699", "6521366", "28208943", "2203086", "10364203", "51614388", "6416654", "115518358", "10891229", "15034264", "12211078", "15481197", "18268744", "195908774", "1977996", "2164653", "2439109", "125428741", "3295267", "15615355", "53944443", "832721", "2105943", "73516403", "3264198", "17504174", "11664336", "49866530", "606761", "8502955", "1043277", "21697434", "14124313", "10118550", "207184031", "6253107", "2140394", "9301367", "3405874", "7531970", "10224573", "6369679", "508435", "1052837", "40097546"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199589453"}

Detecting SIPs is one of the most important issues in current molecular biology.

In addition, they yield high false negative and positive rates. Thus, there is a great need for in silico methods to predict SIPs accurately and efficiently. In this study, a new sequence-based method is proposed to predict SIPs. The evolutionary information contained in Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) is extracted from of protein with known sequence. Then, features are fed to an ensemble classifier to distinguish the self-interacting and non-self-interacting proteins. When performed on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Human SIPs data sets, the proposed method can achieve high accuracies of 86.86 and 91.30 percent, respectively. Our method also shows a good performance when compared with the SVM classifier and previous methods.

Thirdly, to avoid the occlusion problem, this paper utilities vision based ego-motion estimation to detect and remove other vehicles. As surround view images contain less dynamic information and gray scales, improved ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm is introduced to ensure that the ego-motion parameters are consequently obtained. For panoramic images, optical flow algorithm is used. The results from the surround view system help to filter the optical flow and optimize the ego-motion parameters; other vehicles are detected by the optical flow feature.

Multi-site studies present a valuable opportunity to advance research by pooling data in order to increase sensitivity and statistical power. However images derived from MRI are susceptible to both obvious and non-obvious differences between sites which can introduce bias and subject variance, and so reduce statistical power. To rectify these differences, we propose a data driven approach using a deep learning architecture known as generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs learn to estimate two distributions, and can then be used to transform examples from one distribution into the other distribution. Here we transform T1-weighted brain images collected from two different sites into MR images from the same site. We evaluate whether our model can reduce site-specific differences without loss of information related to gender (male, female) or clinical diagnosis (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, healthy). When trained appropriately, our model is able to normalise imaging sets to a common scanner set with less information loss compared to current approaches.

Although there are numerous studies investigating nutrient deficiency in forests using remote sensing, research has usually focused on extracting nutrient/pigment concentrations using hyperspectral imagery. Results of studies using this method of assessment are uncertain at the canopy level. This study proposes using freely available multispectral imagery to identify nutrient deficiency in commercially managed forest plantations. A classification map of nutrient deficient, healthy, and a third class, other, for State spruce forests in the Republic of Ireland was constructed using multispectral Sentinel 2 images from Spring and a Random Forest model. The forest area of interest (AOI) was Sitka spruce or Norway spruce plantations greater than 12 years old. Results showed that the overall accuracy was 89% and the associated Kappa Index of agreement was 79%. An unbiased area estimator was vital for an accurate estimate of the scale of nutrient deficiency, which concluded that 23% of the AOI was nutrient deficient. Early detection of nutrient deficiency is crucial to mitigate negative impacts on productivity so a time series analysis of the spectral response of healthy and nutrient deficient classes using Google Earth Engine's Landsat 5, 7, and 8 archive was carried out. A control of known nutrient deficient sites, as identified through foliar analysis, was used for comparison with the nutrient deficient and healthy training data. The spectral response showed a decrease through time for all of the foliar analysis and training data using the green (520\u2013600 nm), red (630\u2013690 nm), and SWIR spectra (1550\u20131700 nm) during Spring. This decreasing trend is due to the growth of foliage, with the difference in spectral response between nutrient deficient and healthy stands being attributed to the presence of chlorosis in stands suffering from nutrient deficiency.

Targeting mTOR for therapeutic interventions in cancer through autophagy pathway is challenging due to the dual roles of autophagy in tumor progression.

Such imbalance severely reduces bag-of-poses based classification performance. On the other hand, collecting a dataset of human gestures or actions is an expensive and time-consuming procedure. It is often impractical to reacquire the data or to modify the existing dataset using oversampling or undersampling procedures. The best way to handle such imbalance is by making the used classifier be directly aware and adapt to the real condition inside the data. Balancing class distribution, i.e., the number of pose samples per class, is one of difficult tasks in machine learning. Standard statistical learning models (e.g., SVM, HMM, CRF) are insensitive to unbalanced datasets. This paper proposes a distribution-sensitive prior on a standard statistical learning, i.e., Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), to deal with the imbalanced data problem. This prior analyzes the training dataset before learning a model. Thus, the RVM can put more weight on the samples from under-represented classes, while allows overall samples from the dataset to have a balanced impact to the learning process. Our experiment uses a publicly available gesture datasets, the Microsoft Research Cambridge-12 (MSRC-12). Experimental results show the importance of adapting to the unbalanced data and improving the recognition performance through distribution-sensitive prior.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.160", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia Computer Science", "mag_id": "2238458904", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["6457149"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61658774"}

One open problem in the design of API algorithms is how to construct the basis functions or features for value function approximation (VFA). In this paper, we propose a novel batch-mode RL approach with randomly projected features for VFA. The proposed approach can be viewed as an extension of extreme learning machines (ELMs) to RL problems so it can be called ELM-API. The ELMs have been popularly studied in supervised learning problems, but there is not much work on the extension of ELMs to learning control problems. The proposed approach has advantages over the previous API algorithms in that the features for VFA can be quickly generated without complex parameter selection and the performance will be adaptive to different sample sets in batch-mode RL. In particular, the ELM-API approach can realize fast and efficient feature reconstruction when training sample sets are relatively small. Comprehensive simulation studies on two benchmark learning control problems were carried out to test the performance of API algorithms with different feature construction methods. It is shown that the ELM-API algorithm can obtain comparable or better performance than the previous API approaches. To further show the effectiveness of ELM-API in real-world applications, the simulation results on a more challenging high-dimensional lane-changing decision problem in dynamic traffic environment are also reported, which show the capability of the ELM-API algorithm in learning satisfactory lane-changing policies with high data efficiency.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSMC.2019.2926806", "venue": null, "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics", "mag_id": "2967043083", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202124535"}

Many implementations of gradient descent rely on a discretized version, i.e., moving in the direction of the gradient for a set step size, recomputing the gradient, and continuing. Manifold learning/dimensionality reduction, which seeks a low dimensional manifold that best represents data in a high dimensional Euclidean space, is an inherently infinite dimensional problem. In this context, gradient descent has been applied only after simplifying manifold learning to a finite dimensional problem by e.g. RKHS or parametric methods. In this paper, we present a gradient descent approach to optimize manifold embeddings, where the gradient descent takes place in the infinite dimensional space of smooth embeddings $\\phi$ of a manifold $M$ into $\\mathbb{R}^N$. We first argue that the penalty function should be invariant under diffeomorphisms of $M$, as this guarantees that the gradient direction is always pointwise normal to $\\phi(M)$ inside $\\mathbb{R}^N$. Thus implementing discretized gradient flow in our framework requires estimating how far we can move in a fixed normal direction before leaving the space of smooth embeddings. We give an explicit lower bound for this distance in terms of the geometry of $\\phi(M)$ induced from its embedding in $\\mathbb{R}^N.$", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1901.09057", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Differential Geometry", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2914869884", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["62824717", "116362549", "14204170", "16902615", "121509970", "52010076", "62574244", "1810410", "8693282", "36385503", "50258911", "122795652", "4964521", "10018418", "118086305", "1692710", "17455595", "125920107", "13500984", "14524999", "17336654", "119350428"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:119132077"}

This rapid growth in population and urbanization have also led to infrastructural development such as transportation systems, sewer, power utilities and many others. One major problem with rapid urbanization in developing/third-world countries is that developments in mega cities are hindered by ineffective planning before construction projects are initiated and mostly developments are random. Libya faces similar problems associated with rapid urbanization. To resolve this, an automating process via effective decision making tools is needed for development in Libyan cities. This study develops a geospatial solution based on GIS and TOPSIS for automating the process of selecting a city or a group of cities for development in Libya. To achieve this goal, fifteen GIS factors were prepared from various data sources including Landsat, MODIS, and ASTER. These factors are categorized into six groups of topography, land use and infrastructure, vegetation, demography, climate, and air quality. The suitability map produced based on the proposed methodology showed that the northern part of the study area, especially the areas surrounding Benghazi city and northern parts of Al Marj and Al Jabal al Akhdar cities, are most suitable. Support Vector Machine (SVM) model accurately classified 1178 samples which is equal to 78.5% of the total samples. The results produced Kappa statistic of 0.67 and average success rate of 0.861. Validation results revealed that the average prediction rate is 0.719. Based on the closeness coefficient statistics, Benghazi, Al Jabal al Akhdar, Al Marj, Darnah, Al Hizam Al Akhdar, and Al Qubbah cities are ranked in that order of suitability.

Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) can extract important features of an image and attain high precision in image classification tasks. In the proposed system, image features are extracted using CNNs, and attribute features added to image features, and attributes added images are generated by DCGANs. Specifically, we use the attributes of \"smile\" and \"male\", and work on a task of generating smile images from non-smile images, and a task of generating male images from female images. Since the training of the proposed system requires image pairs including with and without attributes, we use two extraction methods, 1)Usage of attribute label attached dataset, 2)Usage of cosine similarity. To obtain attribute features, we trained 4-layer CNNs which are the same architecture as Discriminator of GANs, to classify images into two classes, with and without attributes. Here, attribute features are defined as the averaged difference between image features with and without attributes, more specifically, the values in the final convolution layer in the 4-layer CNNs. We performed two kinds of evaluation experiments: the first one is a subjective evaluation experiment on items such as \"whether generated images have attributes\", the second one is a quantitative evaluation experiment for measuring whether the people shown in the input image and the generated image are the same person.

This paper proposes an effective method for blind median filter detection based on streaking effect of the median filter. The method offered in the paper is built on experimental observation that the percentage streak area (psa) of an image increases on repetitive median filtering of the image, the rate at which psa increases for median filtered images is different from the rate at which psa increases for unfiltered images.

Combinational illuminant estimation schemes have been shown to improve estimation accuracy significantly compared to other colour constancy algorithms. These schemes combine individual estimates of simpler colour constancy algorithms in some \u2018intelligent\u2019 manner into a joint and, usually, more efficient illuminant estimation. Among them, a combinational method based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) was proposed recently, demonstrating the more accurate illuminant estimation (Li et al. IEEE Trans. Image Process. 23(3), 1194\u20131209, 2014). We extended this method by our previously introduced convolutional framework, in which the illuminant was estimated by a set of image-specific filters generated using a linear analysis. In this work, the convolutional framework was reformulated, so that each image-specific filter obtained by principal component analysis (PCA) produced one illuminant estimate. All these individual estimates were then combined into a joint illuminant estimation by using SVR. Each illuminant estimation by using a single image-specific PCA filter within the convolutional framework actually represented one base algorithm for the combinational method based on SVR. The proposed method was validated on the well-known Gehler image dataset, reprocessed and prepared by author Shi, and, as well, on the NUS multi-camera dataset. It was shown that the median and trimean angular errors were (non-significantly) lower for our proposed method compared to the original combinational method based on SVR for which our method utilized just 6 image-specific PCA filters, while the original combinational method required 12 base algorithms for similar results.

METAPHOR is implemented ::: as a modular workflow, whose internal engine for photo-z estimation makes use of the ::: MLPQNA neural network (Multi Layer Perceptron with Quasi Newton learning rule) for the ::: estimation of photo-z\u2019s, with the possibility to easily replace the specific machine learning ::: model chosen to predict photo-z\u2019s, and of an algorithm for the calculation of individual source ::: as well as of stacked objects sample PDFs. More in detail, my work in this context has been: ::: i) the creation of software modules providing some of the functionalities of the entire method ::: and finalised to obtain and analyze the results on all the datasets used so far (see the list of ::: publications) and for the EUCLID contest (see below), ii) to fix the natural algorithms for ::: improving some workflow facilities and, iii) the debugging of the whole procedure. The first ::: application of METAPHOR was in the framework of the second internal Photo-z challenge ::: of the Euclid consortium: a contest among different teams, aimed at establishing the best ::: SED fitting and/or empirical methods, to be included in the official data flow processing ::: pipelines for the mission. This contest lasted from September 2015 until the end of Jenuary ::: 2016, and it was concluded with the releases of the results on the participants performances, ::: in the middle of May 2016. ::: Finally, the original workflow has been improved by adding other statistical estimators in ::: order to better quantify the significance of the results. Through a comparison of the results ::: obtained by METAPHOR and by the SED template fitting method Le-Phare on the SDSS- ::: DR9 (Sloan Digital Sky Survey - Data Release 9) we verified the reliability of our PDF ::: estimates using three different self-adaptive techniques, namely: MLPQNA, Random Forest ::: and the standard K-Nearest Neighbors models. ::: In order to further explore ways to improve the overall performances of photo-z methods, ::: I also contributed to the implementation of an hybrid procedure based on the combination ::: of SED template fitting estimates obtained with Le-Phare and of METAPHOR using as test ::: data those extracted from the ESO (European Southern Observatory) KiDS (Kilo Degree ::: Survey) Data Release 2. ::: Always in the context of the KiDS survey, I was involved in the creation of a catalogue of ::: ML photo-z\u2019s and relative PDFs for the KiDS-DR3 (Data Release 3) survey, widely and ::: exhaustively described in de Jong et al. (2017). A further work on KiDS DR3 data,Amaro et ::: al. (2017), has been submitted to MNRAS. The main topic of this last work is to achieve a ::: deeper analysis of photo-z PDFs obtained using different methods, two machine learning ::: models (METAPHOR and ANNz2) and one based on SED fitting techniques (BPZ), through ::: a direct comparison of both cumulative (stacked) and individual PDFs. The comparison has ::: been made by discriminating between quantitative and qualitative estimators and using a ::: special dummy PDF as benchmark to assess their capability to measure the quality of error ::: estimation and invariance with respect to any type of error source. In fact, it is well known ::: that, in absence of systematics, there are several factors affecting the photo-z reliability, such ::: as photometric and internal errors of the methods as well as statistical biases. For the first ::: time we implemented a ML based procedure capable to take into account also the intrinsic ::: photometric uncertainties. ::: By modifying the METAPHOR internal mechanism, I derived a dummy PDF method through ::: which the individual PDFs, called dummy, are made up of a single number, e.g. 1 (the ::: maximum probability) associated to the the redshift bin of chosen accuracy in which the ::: only photo-z estimate for that source, falls. All the other redshift bins of a dummy PDF will ::: be characterized by a probability identically equal to zero. Due to its intrinsic invariance ::: to different sources of errors, the dummy method enables the possibility to compare PDF ::: methods independently from the statistical estimator adopted. ::: The results of this comparison, along with a discussion of the statistical estimators, have ::: allowed us to conclude that, in order to assess the objective validity and quality of any photo-z ::: PDF method, a combined set of statistical estimators is required. ::: Finally, a natural application of photo-z PDFs is that involving the measurements of Weak ::: Lensing (WL), i.e. the weak distortion of the galaxies images due to the inhomogeneities of ::: the Universe Large Scale Structure (LSS, made up of voids, filaments, halos) along the line of ::: sight. The shear or distortion of the galaxy shapes (ellipticities) due to the presence of matter ::: between the observer and the lensed sources, is evaluated through the tangential component ::: of the shear. The Excess Surface Density (i.e. a measurement of density distribution of the ::: lenses), is proportional to the tangential shear, through a geometrical factor, which takes into ::: account the angular diameter distances among observer, lens, and lensed galaxy source. Such ::: distances in the geometrical factor are measured through photometric redshifts, or better ::: through their full posterior probability distributions. ::: Up to now, such distributions have been measured with template fitting methods: our Ma- ::: chine Learning METAPHOR has been employed to make a preliminary comparative study ::: on WL ESD, with respect to the SED fitter results. Furthermore, a confrontation between the ::: ESD estimates obtained by using both METAPHOR PDFs and photo-z punctual estimates has been performed. ::: The WL study outcome is very promising since we found that the use of ::: punctual estimates and relative PDFs lead to indistinguishable results, at least to the required ::: accuracy. Most importantly, we found a similar trend for the ESD results in the comparison ::: of our Machine Learning method with a template fitter performance, despite all the limits ::: of Machine Learning techniques (incompleteness of the training dataset, low reliability for ::: results extrapolated outside the knowledge base) which become particularly relevant in WL ::: studies.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2939274961", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:146105056"}

To date, many standard-of-care chemotherapy agents act by directly binding or modifying DNA or indirectly during processes that rely on chromatin architecture, as exemplified with docetaxel. Therefore, alterations in chromatin organization may impact resistance mechanisms for these drugs. Here, we explore the mis-regulation of chromatin regulators\u2014factors involved in the establishment and maintenance of functional chromatin domains\u2014as a tool to predict the response to docetaxel. For a series of chromatin regulators, we exploit Affymetrix microarray and NanoString gene expression data generated from breast cancer patient derived xenograft (PDX) models, colorectal cancer organoids, and breast cancer patient samples treated with docetaxel. Random Forest classification reveals a limited set of chromatin regulators that readily distinguish docetaxel responders from non-responders. Since the candidate predictive factors feature key subunits of the chromatin remodeler SWI/SNF complex, we then explore the behavior of SWI/SNF subunits in the response to docetaxel in the large NCI-60 dataset and in cultured cells. All together, our results showcase the predictive value of chromatin regulators and reveal that the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler associates tightly with docetaxel response in several settings. Our findings open avenues for applications as biomarkers, but also as therapeutic targets to sensitize patients towards docetaxel. These approaches offer a means to potentially combat drug resistance. Citation Format: Zachary A. Gurard-Levin, Laurence OW Wilson, Vera Pancaldi, Sophie Postel-Vinay, Fabricio G.

Despite the recent release of a few plant phenotyping datasets, large annotated plant image datasets for the purpose of training deep learning algorithms are lacking. One common approach to alleviate the lack of training data is dataset augmentation. Herein, we propose an alternative solution to dataset augmentation for plant phenotyping, creating artificial images of plants using generative neural networks. We propose the Arabidopsis Rosette Image Generator (through) Adversarial Network: a deep convolutional network that is able to generate synthetic rosette-shaped plants, inspired by DCGAN (a recent adversarial network model using convolutional layers). Specifically, we trained the network using A1, A2, and A4 of the CVPPP 2017 LCC dataset, containing Arabidopsis Thaliana plants. We show that our model is able to generate realistic 128x128 colour images of plants. We train our network conditioning on leaf count, such that it is possible to generate plants with a given number of leaves suitable, among others, for training regression based models.

Due to the perceived failure of these programmes, the country embarked on a highly politicised and forceful acquisition and re-distribution of white owned commercial farms under the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP). Whereas a large number of Zimbabweans have been allocated land under the programme, there has been a significant decline in agricultural productivity and an increase in degradation of land and associated resources. Popular opinion has even suggested the country\u2019s current socio-economic challenges are linked to the programme. Mitigating land degradation, enhancing agricultural productivity and promoting natural resources sustainability requires an objective understanding and determination landscape transformation within relevant administrative decision making spatial extents. In this study, we adopted multi-temporal remotely sensed imagery to determine landscape transformation after the implementation of the FTLRP in Chipinge administrative district, characterised by heterogeneous land usage and natural resources. Major land-use-land-cover types were determined using the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm and accuracy established using field survey and ancillary data. Results show significant landscape transformation after the implementation of the FTLRP. Specifically, there was a decline in plantations, small farms, water bodies and forests and an increase in bare areas and settlements. This study demonstrates the value of remotely data in monitoring landscape transformation arising from a shift in policy. Furthermore, these results provide an insight into multi-temporal spatial changes in cultivated, natural and degraded lands, valuable for designing measures to improve landscape productivity and to adopt relevant rehabilitation measures.

The main arguments against Connectionism concern its inability to form mental representations for complex expressions, which can be used for structure sensitive operations.

This paper starts off by examining the definitions of the different approaches and also their strengths and weaknesses. One section is devoted to the debate between the advocators of the different paradigms, including the arguments about the lack of compositionality and systematicity in Connectionist cognitive models. We then argue for the Connectionist approach as the most attractive model of the mind.

A lot of effort has been made to develop intelligent agents that simulate human learning of math and science, e.g., for use in cognitive tutors. However, constructing such a learning agent currently requires manual encoding of prior domain knowledge for each domain and even for each level of problem difficulty, which hurts the generality of the learning agent and is less cognitively plausible. Li et al. (2012) recently proposed an efficient algorithm that acquires representation knowledge in the form of \u201cdeep features,\u201d and use the acquired representation to automatically generate feature predicates to assist future learning. The authors demonstrated the generality of the proposed approach across multiple domains. The results showed that by integrating this algorithm into a simulated student, SimStudent, the extended agent achieves efficient skill acquisition, while requiring less prior knowledge engineering effort, and being a more realistic model of the state of prior knowledge of novice algebra students. In this work, we further explore the generality of the proposed approach within one domain, but across multiple difficulty levels. The results indicates that the new, extended SimStudent is able to acquire skill knowledge of harder problems using only its learned problem representations, while the original SimStudent requires its domain-specific prior knowledge to be engineered explicitly to handle these harder problems. The extended SimStudent\u2019s performance is shown to match and even exceed the original as the complexity of problems increases.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2186113267", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16902382", "61326110", "20017564", "145120001", "106672214", "23408221", "10577260", "10546302", "59944670", "17022877", "160022951", "10671372", "1922606", "8186244", "1093509", "14455449", "16762143", "2161139", "35810271", "62688491", "16838417", "9017502", "11927187"], "inbound_citations": ["15185609", "211733137", "10171484", "8909310", "18263930", "211731784", "73523054", "46649892", "17212621", "14320111", "32940578", "198907235"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3939832"}

However, in a real-world network, there exist links that connect nodes of different classes. These inconsistent links raise a big challenge for graph regularization and deteriorate the classification performance significantly. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm, namely Consistent Graph Learning, which is robust to the inconsistent links of a network. In particular, given a network and a small number of labeled nodes, we aim at learning a consistent network with more consistent and fewer inconsistent links than the original network. Since the link information of a network is naturally represented by a set of relation matrices, the learning of a consistent network is reduced to learning consistent relation matrices under some constraints. More specifically, we achieve it by joint graph regularization on the nuclear norm minimization of consistent relation matrices together with $$\\ell _1$$-norm minimization on the difference matrices between the original relation matrices and the learned consistent ones subject to certain constraints.

First, candidate variables that may influence the development of soil depth were selected based on pedogenetic knowledge. Second, three conventional methods (Pearson correlation analysis (PsCA), generalized additive models (GAMs), and Random Forest (RF)) were used to generate optimal combinations of environmental covariates. Finally, three optimal combinations were integrated to produce a final combination based on the importance and occurrence frequency of each environmental covariate. We tested this method for soil depth mapping in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin in Northwest China. A total of 129 soil sampling sites were collected using a representative sampling strategy, and RF and support vector machine (SVM) models were used to map soil depth. The results showed that compared to the set of environmental covariates selected by the three conventional selection methods, the set of environmental covariates selected by the proposed method achieved higher mapping accuracy.

The forest-savanna mosaic in the northern part of Lope National Park, Gabon, has a large and complex variation in vegetation structure along a successional gradient. The goal of this research is to assess whether large footprint full-waveform lidar data can be used to distinguish successional vegetation types based on their vertical structure in this area. Eleven vegetation metrics were derived from the lidar waveforms: canopy height, canopy fractional cover, total Plant Area Index (PAI) and vertical profile of PAI. The PAI profiles from airborne waveform lidar showed good agreement with those from Terrestrial Laser Scanning, sampled at eight field plots across different vegetation types (r2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.63, bias = 0.41). The agreement further strengthened our confidence that lidar waveforms can be used to distinguish between the five vegetation types, within the limits of the sampled structure, because TLS was known to provide distinct PAI profiles for these vegetation types. We then employed a Random Forest model, trained with 193 locations of known vegetation type, to classify the entire study area into five successional vegetation types (classification accuracy = 81.3%). The resulting predictive map revealed the overall spatial pattern of vegetation types across the study area. Our results suggest that lidar-derived vegetation profiles can provide valuable information on vegetation type and successional stage.

To predict whether a candidate name mention in a sentence indeed refers to a specific phone model, a Conditional Random Field (CRF)-based name recognizer is developed.

Background and objectiveDepression has become a major health burden worldwide, and effectively detection of such disorder is a great challenge which requires latest technological tool, such as Electroencephalography (EEG). This EEG-based research seeks to find prominent frequency band and brain regions that are most related to mild depression, as well as an optimal combination of classification algorithms and feature selection methods which can be used in future mild depression detection. MethodsAn experiment based on facial expression viewing task (Emo_block and Neu_block) was conducted, and EEG data of 37 university students were collected using a 128 channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net (HCGSN). For discriminating mild depressive patients and normal controls, BayesNet (BN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and RandomForest (RF) classifiers were used. And BestFirst (BF), GreedyStepwise (GSW), GeneticSearch (GS), LinearForwordSelection (LFS) and RankSearch (RS) based on Correlation Features Selection (CFS) were applied for linear and non-linear EEG features selection. Independent Samples T-test with Bonferroni correction was used to find the significantly discriminant electrodes and features. ResultsData mining results indicate that optimal performance is achieved using a combination of feature selection method GSW based on CFS and classifier KNN for beta frequency band. Accuracies achieved 92.00% and 98.00%, and AUC achieved 0.957 and 0.997, for Emo_block and Neu_block beta band data respectively.

However, the automatic segmentation is limited in performance due to the difficulty of obtaining an accurate segmentation since mass occurs in the dense areas of the breast tissue and has smoother boundaries. Semi-automatic CAD systems overcome these limitations, however, they also have problems including high FP (False Positive) rate and a large amount of training data required for training a classifier. The proposed system which overcomes the aforementioned problems to detect mass is composed of the suspected area selection, the level set segmentation and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification. To assess the efficacy of the system, 60 test images from the FFDM (Full-Field Digital Mammography) are analyzed and compared with the previous semi-automatic system, which uses the ANN classifier. The experimental results of the proposed system indicate higher accuracy of detecting mass in comparison to the previous systems.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "36811373", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108184152"}

As the number of community-available ChIP-seq profiles increases, it becomes more common to use data from different sources, which makes joint analysis challenging. Issues such as lack of reproducibility, heterogeneous quality and conflicts between replicates become evident when comparing datasets, especially when they are produced by different laboratories. Results: Here, we present Zerone, a ChIP-seq discretizer with built-in quality control. Zerone is powered by a Hidden Markov Model with zero-inflated negative multinomial emissions, which allows it to merge several replicates into a single discretized profile. To identify low quality or irreproducible data, we trained a Support Vector Machine and integrated it as part of the discretization process. The result is a classifier reaching 95% accuracy in detecting low quality profiles. We also introduce a graphical representation to compare discretization quality and we show that Zerone achieves outstanding accuracy. Finally, on current hardware, Zerone discretizes a ChIP-seq experiment on mammalian genomes in about 5 min using less than 700 MB of memory.

The complex heterogeneous nature and large data dimensionality of unconventional mudstone reservoirs increase the challenge of lithofacies interpretation by conventional qualitative methods. Quantitative shale lithofacies, which are meaningful, mappable, and predictable at core, well log, and regional scales, can be defined based on mineralogy and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) derived from core analysis and advanced geochemical spectroscopy logs (e.g. Pulsed Neutron Spectroscopy, PNS). However, access to numerous and widespread core samples and geochemical log responses is typically limited by cost and time. We apply different mathematical techniques to ubiquitous conventional well log suites calibrated to rock types, defined by the limited number of wells with high-quality core and geochemical logs. The documented interrelationships between lithofacies and conventional logs are propagated with a quantified degree of accuracy in wells without advanced log or core data. Our study addresses issues of different approaches of quantitative lithofacies classification and prediction techniques from well logs. Various data-driven supervised and unsupervised computational approaches, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Multi-Resolution Graph-based Clustering (MRGC), are applied and compared to reduce uncertainty of propagating single-well based lithofacies analysis, and efficiently understand geological trends. Two different dataset from the Devonian Bakken and Mahantango-Marcellus Shale formations in North America are used, in order to undertake a comparative assessment of computational techniques for lithofacies characterization. Original shale lithofacies, defined from geochemical logs and core data, are used to compare the results of selected supervised and unsupervised computational approaches. The results show that both Bakken and Mahantango-Marcellus shale members are vertically and laterally heterogeneous, but can be classified into at least five mudstone lithofacies, along with calcareous siltstone and limestone lithofacies. SVM works better than other techniques for lithofacies classification and prediction in reduced computational time, no iteration, and with highly repeatable results.

This paper presents the feasibility of classifying the different shoulder movements from around shoulder muscles of transhumeral amputees. The performance of a classifier is affected by the variation of Surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals due to the different categories of contraction. To avoid this, the wavelet transform and data transformation method are employed for features extraction from sEMG signals. Afterward five different supervised machine learning techniques viz.

To improve this, we propose the use of GAN's (Generative Adversarial Networks).

Presently, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are commonly using tool to detect and prevent internal and external network attacks/intrusions. IDSs are majorly bifurcated into host-based and network-based systems, and use pattern-matching techniques to detect intrusions that known as misuse-based intrusion detection system. Machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) algorithms are widely using for classifying intrusions in IDS over the last few decades. One of the major challenges for building IDS employing machine learning and data mining algorithms is to improve the intrusion classification accuracy and also reducing the false-positive rate. In this paper, we have introduced a new method for improving detection rate to classify minority-class network attacks/ intrusions using cluster-based under-sampling with Random Forest classifier. The proposed method is a multi-layer classification approach, which can process the highly imbalanced big data to correctly identify the minority/ rare class-intrusions. Initially, the proposed method classify a data point/ incoming data is attack/ intrusion or not (like normal behaviour), if it\u2019s an attack then the proposed method try to classify attack type and later sub-attack type. We have used cluster-based under-sampling technique to deal with class-imbalanced problem and popular ensemble classifier Random Forest for addressing overfitting problem. We have used KDD99 intrusion detection benchmark dataset for experimental analysis and tested the performance of proposed method with existing machine learning algorithms like: Artificial N eural Network (ANN), naive Bayes (NB) classifier, Random Forest, and Bagging techniques.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICASERT.2019.8934495", "venue": "2019 1st International Conference on Advances in Science, Engineering and Robotics Technology (ICASERT)", "journal": "2019 1st International Conference on Advances in Science, Engineering and Robotics Technology (ICASERT)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2995758142", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["44056425", "26827411", "27758905", "24475361", "17336586", "2925214", "17839586", "3947660", "16115682", "207551222", "67054180", "3015337", "29328938", "13244475", "10618681"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209457956"}

The proposed SMOMA integrates an efficient data-driven surrogate model with an improved non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm-II (NSGAII) that employs a local search operator to accelerate its convergence in optimization. The surrogate model based on Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) is developed and evaluated as an approximate simulator to generate the patterns of regional groundwater flow and salinity levels in coastal aquifers for reducing huge computational burden. The KELM model is adaptively trained during evolutionary search to satisfy desired fidelity level of surrogate so that it inhibits error accumulation of forecasting and results in correctly converging to true Pareto-optimal front. The proposed methodology is then applied to a large-scale coastal aquifer management in Baldwin County, Alabama. Objectives of minimizing the saltwater mass increase and maximizing the total pumping rate in the coastal aquifers are considered. The optimal solutions achieved by the proposed adaptive surrogate model are compared against those solutions obtained from one-shot surrogate model and original simulation model. The adaptive surrogate model does not only improve the prediction accuracy of Pareto-optimal solutions compared with those by the one-shot surrogate model, but also maintains the equivalent quality of Pareto-optimal solutions compared with those by NSGAII coupled with original simulation model, while retaining the advantage of surrogate models in reducing computational burden up to 94% of time-saving. This study shows that the proposed methodology is a computationally efficient and promising tool for multiobjective optimizations of coastal aquifer managements.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.03.063", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2794524994", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210930962", "158964121", "211244497", "200057766", "209340115", "195877825", "133895136", "214648465"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134712560"}

The objective of this study is to develop and test a novel independent system to monitor treatment center and amend the position of patient, which is applicable to most accelerators, based on binocular location. The system monitors the treatment center by tracking the markers attached to the patient. Once the treatment center shifts, the system uses the magic finger, which is developed to control the treatment bet automatically to adjust the treatment bed position. To improve the monitoring accuracy, we trained the data collected from the clinic based on SVM (Support Vector Machine). Thus, the training results assist users to adjust the feasible degree of the monitoring.

Recently, within the RC context, deep Echo State Network (ESN) models have been proposed. Being composed of a stack of multiple non-linear reservoir layers, deep ESNs potentially allow to exploit the advantages of a hierarchical temporal feature representation at different levels of abstraction, at the same time preserving the training efficiency typical of the RC methodology. In this paper, we generalize to the case of deep architectures the fundamental RC conditions related to the Echo State Property (ESP), based on the study of stability and contractivity of the resulting dynamical system. Besides providing a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for the ESP of layered RC networks, the results of our analysis provide also insights on the nature of the state dynamics in hierarchically organized recurrent models. In particular, we find out that by adding layers to a deep reservoir architecture, the regime of network\u2019s dynamics can only be driven towards (equally or) less stable behaviors. Moreover, our investigation shows the intrinsic ability of temporal dynamics differentiation at the different levels in a deep recurrent architecture, with higher layers in the stack characterized by less contractive dynamics. Such theoretical insights are further supported by experimental results that show the effect of layering in terms of a progressively increased short-term memory capacity of the recurrent models.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12559-017-9461-9", "venue": "Cognitive Computation", "journal": "Cognitive Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2611445505", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["41184786", "36872360", "22771216", "664843", "15222519", "2843869", "30362685", "27054014", "32040653", "14874207", "20071973", "17200921", "2184251", "28259788", "195908774", "3074096", "1045112", "8888128", "458512", "8877067", "54062268", "15750282", "2792851", "11715509", "16699485", "9448547", "13385595", "14708001", "537138", "6527216", "16538082", "1102883", "33841325", "12004294"], "inbound_citations": ["204210220", "201090523", "53240610", "52917716", "96432042", "53240029", "108285488", "212725148", "76667800", "202550348", "146803970", "49564619", "5934317", "153316189", "208131588", "41670309", "52985395", "3366620", "44107610", "3610117", "211532599", "159042136", "53240412", "51866256", "429259", "211532393", "57189452", "4005039", "51873535", "133604224", "46934726", "52987841", "3544459"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1077549"}

The brain coherently groups these fragments into a trackable percept of the deer and its trajectory. Form and motion processes are needed to accomplish this using feedforward and feedback interactions both within and across cortical processing streams. All the cortical areas V1, V2, MT, and MST are involved in these interactions. Figure-ground processes in the form stream through V2, such as the separation of occluding boundaries of the forest cover from boundaries of the deer, select the motion signals which determine global object motion percepts in the motion stream through MT. Sparse, but unambiguous, feature tracking signals are amplified before they propagate across position and are integrated with far more numerous ambiguous motion signals.

The PALM predictive and prescriptive technologies utilize Support Vector Machine learning, signatures, and real-time Random Forest and decision trees to steer hydraulic fractures to become high instead of low oil and gas producers as completions of horizontal shale wells progress.

Therefore, it would be helpful to exploit an existing large labeled dataset of one (source) population to improve the age estimation performance on another (target) population with only a small labeled dataset available. In this work, we propose a Deep Cross-Population (DCP) age estimation model to achieve this goal. In particular, our DCP model develops a two-stage training strategy. First, a novel cost-sensitive multitask loss function is designed to learn transferable aging features by training on the source population. Second, a novel order-preserving pair-wise loss function is designed to align the aging features of the two populations. By doing so, our DCP model can transfer the knowledge encoded in the source population to the target population.

Reservoir characterization impacts well placement, injection and production strategies, and field management. Reservoir characterization projects point and line data to a large three-dimensional volume. The relationship between variables, e.g. porosity and permeability, is often established by regression yet the complexities between measured variables often lead to poor correlation coefficients between the regressed variables. Recent advances in machine learning methods have provided attractive alternatives for constructing interpretation models of rock properties in heterogeneous reservoirs. Here, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a class of a learning machine that is formulated to output regression models and classifiers of competitive generalization capability, has been explored to determine its capabilities for determining the relationship, both in regression and in classification, between reservoir rock properties. This thesis documents research on the capability of SVMs to model petrophysical and elastic properties in heterogeneous sandstone and carbonate reservoirs. Specifically, the capabilities of SVM regression and classification has been examined and compared to neural network-based methods, namely multilayered neural networks, radial basis function neural networks, general regression neural networks, probabilistic neural networks, and linear discriminant analysis. The petrophysical properties that have been evaluated include porosity, permeability, Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus. Statistical error analysis reveals that the SVM method yields comparable or superior predictions of petrophysical and elastic rock properties and classification of the lithology compared to neural networks.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals helps in the analysis and diagnosis of epilepsy by recording the activities in the cortical regions of the epileptic patient. Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal EEG signal flow. The recordings of the EEG signals are too huge to process and hence the necessity of dimensionality reduction is mandatory. The total number of epileptic patients analyzed in this work is twenty. Initially the dimensions of the EEG signal are reduced with the help of Fuzzy Mutual Information (FMI). The dimensionally reduced data is then transmitted with the help of a 2 x 2 Orthogonal Space Time Block Coded Multiple Input Multiple Output-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OSTBC MIMO-OFDM) System.

In contrast to the dialectal Arabic language, these selection methods have been investigated widely for the English language. This work investigated the effect of feature selection methods and their combinations on dialectal Arabic sentiment classification. The feature selection methods are Information Gain (IG), Correlation, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gini Index (GI), and Chi-Square. A number of experiments were carried out on dialectical Jordanian reviews with using an SVM classifier.

The texture features either correspond to components of a linear texture space or are learned by auto-encoders directly from in-the-wild images. In all cases, the quality of the facial texture reconstruction of the state-of-the-art methods is still not capable of modeling textures in high fidelity. In this paper, we take a radically different approach and harness the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and DCNNs in order to reconstruct the facial texture and shape from single images.

Although IoT brings significant advantages over traditional information and communication (ICT) technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), these applications are still very rare. Although there is a continuous improvement in road and vehicle safety, as well as improvements in IoT, the road traffic accidents have been increasing over the last decades. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. Hence, this paper presents an intelligent traffic accident detection system in which vehicles exchange their microscopic vehicle variables with each other. The proposed system uses simulated data collected from vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) based on the speeds and coordinates of the vehicles and then, it sends traffic alerts to the drivers. Furthermore, it shows how machine learning methods can be exploited to detect accidents on freeways in ITS. It is shown that if position and velocity values of every vehicle are given, vehicles' behavior could be analyzed and accidents can be detected easily. Supervised machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) are implemented on traffic data to develop a model to distinguish accident cases from normal cases. The performance of RF algorithm, in terms of its accuracy, was found superior to ANN and SVM algorithms.

Recently SVMs have been proposed for clustering analysis as well. Support Vector Clustering (SVC) works by finding the minimum enclosing sphere of data points using SVM training. SVC is a boundary based clustering method, where the support information is used to construct cluster boundaries. In support vector-based clustering algorithms, the main computational bottle-neck is the high cluster labeling time for each data point. In addition, in many cases labeled data is not available for use with SVC. This tends to restrict the scalability of the method and results in decreased efficiency. This also decreases the applicability of the SVC method to real-life datasets most of which do not have any class labels.. In this paper we present a technique that could be used to utilize SVM to improve the accuracy of clustering without the need of labeled dataset.

The mu rhythm recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a prominent oscillation generated by Rolandic cortex containing alpha and beta bands. Despite its prominence, the neural mechanisms regulating mu are unknown. We characterized the ongoing MEG mu rhythm from a localized source in the finger representation of primary somatosensory (SI) cortex. Subjects showed variation in the relative expression of mu-alpha or mu-beta, which were nonoverlapping for roughly 50% of their respective durations on single trials. To delineate the origins of this rhythm, a biophysically principled computational neural model of SI was developed, with distinct laminae, inhibitory and excitatory neurons, and feedforward (FF, representative of lemniscal thalamic drive) and feedback (FB, representative of higher-order cortical drive or input from nonlemniscal thalamic nuclei) inputs defined by the laminar location of their postsynaptic effects. The mu-alpha component was accurately modeled by rhythmic FF input at approximately 10-Hz. The mu-beta component was accurately modeled by the addition of approximately 10-Hz FB input that was nearly synchronous with the FF input. The relative dominance of these two frequencies depended on the delay between FF and FB drives, their relative input strengths, and stochastic changes in these variables. The model also reproduced key features of the impact of high prestimulus mu power on peaks in SI-evoked activity. For stimuli presented during high mu power, the model predicted enhancement in an initial evoked peak and decreased subsequent deflections. In agreement, the MEG-evoked responses showed an enhanced initial peak and a trend to smaller subsequent peaks. These data provide new information on the dynamics of the mu rhythm in humans and the model provides a novel mechanistic interpretation of this rhythm and its functional significance.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2804421", "pubmed_id": "19812290", "doi": "10.1152/jn.00535.2009", "venue": "Journal of neurophysiology", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2168712912", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["142896262", "31336375", "6379567", "24523573", "144021759", "4423189", "11151997", "43510007", "27969408", "4540562", "8026756", "25829010", "5243418", "46074444", "888145", "14247667", "18998788", "9334496", "29359849", "11273389", "25523273", "25954512", "11593762", "10574551", "122610393", "28755273", "3359666", "40646546", "12167769", "27596877", "10335245", "26220501", "10558977", "36983164", "8934498", "320204", "6238226", "15221058", "4535503", "4524629", "5776854", "810098", "5754107", "1904060", "33476310", "15200185", "25588036", "14332585", "44637080", "24939616", "144157390", "21620727", "10634420", "7389095", "7500204", "10995545", "32397", "4155826", "7623157", "34476444", "4352326", "6315981", "18870849", "19342110", "39185283", "23882659", "20691248", "19467822", "40767332", "25264379", "6328876", "25048610", "15571596", "2979407", "34821263", "32253034", "17947146", "29620661", "5634864", "13409281", "30883163", "10673686", "38753277", "1466229", "1176862", "23075866", "6027839", "10243026", "18262583", "224795"], "inbound_citations": ["16447828", "208613606", "210154233", "17401900", "11242291", "7926743", "214880396", "14800707", "16055428", "196061016", "4624540", "7192551", "6439914", "1990778", "4924255", "91292659", "5934710", "11560033", "195933731", "46271276", "48628", "196639388", "9562171", "203647433", "1493961", "1593162", "90633467", "15117954", "92500852", "85513832", "208366699", "92119704", "4717107", "2329514", "215420545", "6295883", "16831813", "7682681", "215079387", "8257368", "215077514", "53632717", "7741087", "49743139", "15694727", "10445019", "201209553", "15766982", "214147812", "4625938", "15858175", "4546435", "210117323", "53950068", "196671461", "1891098", "133607906", "2121301", "215253377", "8722007", "58603901", "202844353", "5966609", "7106742", "52301580", "3363881", "202022081", "26085810", "1405535", "9951987", "2505715", "133577601", "220071", "215301761", "3430439", "1405170", "92198595", "155092774", "16265829", "182523109", "3375345", "3362980", "13390616", "3308707", "53664105", "214911104", "14578325", "20821653", "8756808", "56173646", "44119049", "214896840", "53818281", "29157439", "10177852", "90995841", "207198889"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1914953"}

The accuracy assessment showed that compared to the visible and near infrared (VIS/NIR) bands, the time series of thermal images alone can produce comparatively reliable land cover maps with the best overall accuracy of 98.7% to 99.1% for Level 1 classification and 93.9% to 96.3% for the Level 2 classification. In addition, the combination with the thermal band improves the overall accuracy by 5% and 6% for the single Landsat 8 image in Level 2 and Level 3 category and provides the best classified results with all seven bands for the time series of Landsat TM images.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs70708368", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1589181030", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["127854734", "127195275", "152423929", "129851177", "13254579", "33886494", "14165362", "129110639", "44050004", "140177230", "129229000", "128917295", "129325356", "129849422", "110333332", "83673296", "119590560", "129654705", "6579507", "129740661", "14328333", "129732113", "5629482", "140593348", "16372737", "62739295", "122928956", "12872756", "122043226", "129022625", "129029413", "5856858", "128687577", "123334660", "8725477", "52997034", "43081545", "5246200", "89141", "128909253", "9985555", "128736387", "53963210", "129107850", "131004331", "14917167", "128848964", "123476171", "2702042", "17883484", "60985554", "128369578", "129427014", "23649872", "129318588", "121381837"], "inbound_citations": ["122386790", "201315184", "12071867", "5048059", "15672623", "51741109", "55994636", "294790", "36722768", "3774119", "6104298"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:784576"}

In this paper, a novel regularization framework referred to least-squares support vector machine in sum space (LS-SVM-SS) of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) is proposed for the classification of hyperspectral images using spectral signatures or local binary pattern features. The method is designed to simultaneously approximate the low- and high-frequency components of the target classification function with multiscale kernels. In the newly proposed scheme, LS-SVM-SS carries out the supervised learning and train a closed-form discriminant function to directly implement the multiclass classification. In contrast to multiple-kernel learning (MKL) by one-step method or two-step method, we can obtain a noniterative optimization procedure. Experiments are conducted on three real hyperspectral datasets. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that the LS-SVM-SS method achieves good generalization performance in most cases compared with several state-of-the-art methods, which is better than that in any single-kernel RKHS.

Recent advances in NGS let to measure the expression levels of tens to thousands of transcripts simultaneously. Using such information, developing expression-based classification algorithms is an emerging powerful method for diagnosis, disease classification and monitoring at molecular level, as well as providing potential markers of disease. Here, we present the bagging support vector machines (bagSVM), a machine learning approach and bagged ensembles of support vector machines (SVM), for classification of RNA-Seq data. The bagSVM basically uses bootstrap technique and trains each single SVM separately; next it combines the results of each SVM model using majority-voting technique. Results We demonstrate the performance of the bagSVM on simulated and real datasets. Simulated datasets are generated from negative binomial distribution under different scenarios and real datasets are obtained from publicly available resources. A deseq normalization and variance stabilizing transformation (vst) were applied to all datasets. We compared the results with several classifiers including Poisson linear discriminant analysis (PLDA), single SVM, classification and regression trees (CART), and random forests (RF). In slightly overdispersed data, all methods, except CART algorithm, performed well. Performance of PLDA seemed to be best and RF as second best for very slightly and substantially overdispersed datasets. While data become more spread, bagSVM turned out to be the best classifier. In overall results, bagSVM and PLDA had the highest accuracies. Conclusions According to our results, bagSVM algorithm after vst transformation can be a good choice of classifier for RNA-Seq datasets mostly for overdispersed ones. Thus, we recommend researchers to use bagSVM algorithm for the purpose of classification of RNA-Seq data. PLDA algorithm should be a method of choice for slight and moderately overdispersed datasets.

GANs consist of two models, a generative model and a discriminative model. While the discriminative model uses the conventional convolution operator, the generative model is fundamentally different per its use of the transposed convolution operator. Unlike the conventional convolution, the transposed convolution initially inserts a large number of zeros in its input. This zero-insertion leads to a large number of inconsequential operations and creates different patterns of computation across the sliding windows. The inconsequential operations along with the variation in computation patterns lead to signicant resource underutilization when evaluated using conventional convolution hardware. This paper introduces FlexiGAN, an end-to-end solution, from high-level GAN specication to an optimized synthesizable FPGA accelerator. FlexiGAN framework is coupled with a novel architecture that aims to harness the benets of both MIMD and SIMD execution models. The proposed architecture separated data retrieval and data processing units at the nest granularity of each compute engine. Leveraging the separation between data retrieval and data processing units in the compute engines, we introduce a succinct set of operations that enable us to signicantly reduce the on-chip memory usage, which is generally scarce in FPGAs. We evaluate our end-to-end solution across various GANs from machine learning literature. FlexiGAN provides 2.4 higher performance than an optimized conventional convolution design. In addition, FlexiGAN, on average, yields 2.8 (up to 3.7) improvements in Performance-per-Watt over a high-end GPU. These results indicate that FlexiGAN is an effective initial step towards providing an end-to-end solution for accelerating GANs", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/FCCM.2018.00019", "venue": "2018 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM)", "journal": "2018 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2891976760", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1033682", "16153365", "1499857", "115408617", "16628328", "3248075", "11758569", "8239952", "10804187", "11286593", "67444704", "525898", "207209696", "1663491", "6016019", "13256843", "2050688", "6329628", "319103", "1775161", "1744178", "15281419", "9700159", "25406634", "12662941", "52807439", "1312967", "6074727", "14441598", "19257811"], "inbound_citations": ["214784338", "195791627", "201848236", "214692068", "198895402", "57764551", "207957526", "71146205", "209531934", "195222683", "53235059", "163164841", "214692219"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21657876"}

A new approach to the problem was raised which intends to match the different modal features directly. Thus, how to get rid of the heterogeneity between the different modalities and match the different modal features with different dimensions become the key points in this research. On the other hand, the metric learning shows great power to learn a distance metric to explore the relationship between data points. However, the traditional metric learning algorithms are only focusing on one modality features, which suffers difficulties to handle the heterogeneous features with different dimensions. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a heterogeneous similarity learning algorithm based on the metric learning for the cross-modal feature matching.

These shortages have had a very detrimental effect on the overall economic growth of the country. As total Power losses equals transmission power losses plus distribution power losses. The reasons cited for such high losses are; lack of adequate T & D capacity, too many transformation stages, improper load distribution and extensive rural electrification etc. The sources of transmission power losses may be directly driven by network investment or by network operation. Distribution power losses arise from several areas including theft, un-billed accounts, and estimated customer accounts, errors due to the approximation of consumption by un-metered supplies and metering errors Electricity theft can be in the form of fraud (meter tampering), stealing (illegal connections), billing irregularities, and unpaid bills. Estimates of the extent of electricity theft in a sample of 102 countries are undertaken. The evidence shows that theft is increasing in most regions of the world. Electricity consumer dishonesty is a problem faced by all power utilities. Finding efficient measurements for detecting fraudulent electricity consumption has been an active research area in recent years. Data mining has become increasingly common in both the public and private sectors. This paper presents a new approach towards Distribution Power Loss analysis for electric utilities using a novel intelligence-based technique like Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), an online sequential learning algorithm for single hidden layer feed forward networks (SLFNs) with additive or radial basis function (RBF) hidden nodes in a unified framework.

The main motivation of this study is to assist Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam LTD (GUVNL), GUJARAT, INDIA to reduce its Distribution Power Loss due to electricity theft. This approach provides a method of data mining and involves feature extraction from historical customer consumption data.

The Audio-video Sub-challenge in EmotiW contains audio-video short clips with several emotional labels and the task is to distinguish which label the video belongs to. For the better emotion recognition in videos, we propose a multiple spatio-temporal feature fusion (MSFF) framework, which can more accurately depict emotional information in spatial and temporal dimensions by two mutually complementary sources, including the facial image and audio. The framework is consisted of two parts: the facial image model and the audio model. With respect to the facial image model, three different architectures of spatial-temporal neural networks are employed to extract discriminative features about different emotions in facial expression images. Firstly, the high-level spatial features are obtained by the pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN), including VGG-Face and ResNet-50 which are all fed with the images generated by each video. Then, the features of all frames are sequentially input to the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) so as to capture dynamic variations of facial appearance textures in a video. In addition to the structure of CNN-RNN, another spatio-temporal network, namely deep 3-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) by extending the 2D convolution kernel to 3D, is also applied to attain evolving emotional information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. For the audio model, the spectrogram images of speech generated by preprocessing audio, are also modeled in a VGG-BLSTM framework to characterize the affective fluctuation more efficiently. Finally, a fusion strategy with the score matrices of different spatio-temporal networks gained from the above framework is proposed to boost the performance of emotion recognition complementally.

Bankruptcy prediction has been a subject of interests for almost a century and it still ranks high among hottest topics in economics. The aim of predicting financial distress is to develop a predictive model that combines various econometric measures and allows to foresee a financial condition of a firm. In this domain various methods were proposed that were based on statistical hypothesis testing, statistical modeling (e.g., generalized linear models), and recently artificial intelligence (e.g., neural networks, Support Vector Machines, decision tress). In this paper, we propose a novel approach for bankruptcy prediction that utilizes Extreme Gradient Boosting for learning an ensemble of decision trees. Additionally, in order to reflect higher-order statistics in data and impose a prior knowledge about data representation, we introduce a new concept that we refer as to synthetic features. A synthetic feature is a combination of the econometric measures using arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Each synthetic feature can be seen as a single regression model that is developed in an evolutionary manner.

A total of 12 conditioning factors (slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), rainfall, lithology, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), fault density, and river density) were selected for groundwater modeling. The least square support vector machine (LSSVM) feature selection method with a 10-fold cross-validation technique was used to validate the predictive capability of these conditioning factors for training the models. The performance of the RS-RF model was validated using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), success and prediction rate curves, kappa index, and several statistical index-based measures. In addition, Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to assess statistically significant level among the new model with the state-of-the-art soft computing benchmark models, such as random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR) and naive Bayes (NB).

After features extraction, different machine learning approaches are applied on the dataset which has shown its capability of extracting high-level representations from high-dimensional data. Support Vector Machine and Deep Belief Networks (DBN) are the concentration in this study. In the first section, Support vector machine is applied on the dataset. Next Deep Belief Network which is capable of extracting features in an unsupervised manner is implemented and with back-propagation the network is fine tuned. The results show that DBN can be effective when applied to cytological cancer diagnosis by increasing the accuracy in cancer detection. In the last section a subset of DBN features are selected and then appended with raw features and Support Vector Machine is trained and tested with that.

In particular, the recently developed, ultra-fast 454 pyrosequencing has dramatically reduced the cost and time requirements per sequenced base pair. Furthermore, novel methods have been developed that enable sequencing of the 99 percent of microbes that are difficult to access with conventional, culture-dependent approaches. These culture-independent methods launch the exciting field of metagenomics - the study of the collective genomes (metagenomes) of free-living microbial communities. ::: In light of the immense data sets produced, sequence analysis is still a contemporary, ongoing challenge in computational biology. Additionally, new demands arise from the short length of sequence reads produced by ultra-fast sequencing techniques. In the field of whole-genome research, accurate methods are required for identifying and functionally characterizing the gene content of organisms, thus reducing the required manual effort while at the same time producing high-quality annotations. On the other hand, metagenomes are nowadays routinely sequenced, and an increasing number of metagenomic projects is expected in the near future (Pennisi, 2007), but their computational analysis is still in its infancy. ::: In the presented thesis, state-of-the-art machine learning techniques as well as algorithmic and statistical methods are employed for the high-throughput analysis and characterization of large genomic data sets. First, the gene finding software GISMO was developed, which combines the search for protein domains using profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs) with a sequence composition-based classification using a Support Vector Machine. This combined strategy is able to unveil almost the complete gene content of prokaryotic genomes in a fully automated manner. GISMO has already been extensively employed in the international effort to \"Annotate a Thousand Genomes\" as well as in various genome annotation and re-annotation projects. ::: Furthermore, a novel gene finding algorithm for metagenomic data sets was developed. It is robust for most problems encountered when predicting genes in metagenomes, including short sequence length and low sequence quality. Thereby, the algorithm allows to hunt for novel, unknown genes carried by organisms that cannot be sequenced using conventional, culture dependent techniques. ::: Finally, methods were devised for characterizing short-read metagenomes obtained by pyrosequencing. Following the pHMM-based identification of gene fragments, the latter are categorized into functional groups. Additionally, the source organisms (taxonomic origins) of gene fragments are predicted. The resulting genetic and taxonomic profiles can in turn be used to unveil important trends in the gene content, metabolism, and species composition of the underlying microbial communities.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2146774182", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85967786"}

In this paper, we study the RSVM from the viewpoint of sampling design, its robustness, and the spectral analysis of the reduced kernel. We consider the nonlinear separating surface as a mixture of kernels. Instead of a full model, the RSVM uses a reduced mixture with kernels sampled from certain candidate set. Our main results center on two major themes. One is the robustness of the random subset mixture model. The other is the spectral analysis of the reduced kernel. The robustness is judged by a few criteria as follows: 1) model variation measure; 2) model bias (deviation) between the reduced model and the full model; and 3) test power in distinguishing the reduced model from the full one. For the spectral analysis, we compare the eigenstructures of the full kernel matrix and the approximation kernel matrix. The approximation kernels are generated by uniform random subsets. The small discrepancies between them indicate that the approximation kernels can retain most of the relevant information for learning tasks in the full kernel. We focus on some statistical theory of the reduced set method mainly in the context of the RSVM. The use of a uniform random subset is not limited to the RSVM. This approach can act as a supplemental algorithm on top of a basic optimization algorithm, wherein the actual optimization takes place on the subset-approximated data.

Distance metric learning is a classic method to learn distances between instances on data set with complex distributions. However, most researches on distance metric learning are based on Mahalanobis metric, which is equivalent to linear transformation on distance space that has limitation on complex data. To solve this problem, we propose a metric learning method based on non-linear transformation suitable for complex data. By using the tree model, we could address non-linearly separable data that rearrange input data and represent them to another forms, and tree model could be able to implicitly represent data to a new distance space with a non-linear activator function. Furthermore, single tree model will lead to overfit that has higher generalization errors. Therefore, we design a randomize algorithm to combining different tree models which could reduce the generalization errors in theory and practice.

ILP is more powerful than traditional machine learning methods, such as C4.5 decision trees, because it uses an expressive first-order logic framework and readily allows the user to incorporate background knowledge. In first-order logic, sentences are formed by using constants, variables, predicates, functions, quantifiers, and connectives in a well-formed format, where constants are the objects in the domain of discourse, variables range over the objects in the domain, predicates specify the properties of objects or the relations among objects, functions map object(s) onto other object(s), quantifiers are 8 (Universal) and 9 (Existential) that quantify the variables, and connectives include negation, and, or, etc. ILP has a strong theoretical foundation from logic programming and computational learning theory. There has been significant progress in ILP in the last two decades and this book contains 25 papers associated with the 21st International Conference of Inductive Logic Programming which was held in Cumberland Lodge, an educational charity and a unique conference center in the heart of the Great Park, Windsor, United Kingdom.

The first problem concerns the classification of vasculitis in multiple sclerosis fundus angiography, aiming to help ophthalmologists to diagnose such autoimmune diseases. It also aims at determining potential angiography details in intermediate uveitis in order to help diagnosing multiple sclerosis. The second problem aims at developing new airspace congestion metric, which is an important index that is used for improving Air Traffic Management (ATM) capacity. In the first part of this thesis, we provide preliminary knowledge required to solve the above-mentioned problems. First, we present an overview of the Total Variation and express how it is used in our methods. Then, we present a tutorial on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) which is a learning algorithm used for classification and regression. In the second part of this thesis, we first provide a review of methods for segmentation and measurement of blood vessel in retinal image that is an important step in our method. Then, we present our proposed method for classification of retinal images. First, we detect the diseased region in the pathological images based on the computation of BV norm at each point along the centerline of the blood vessels. Then, to classify the images, we introduce a feature extraction strategy to generate a set of feature vectors that represents the input image set for the SVMs. After that, a standard SVM classifier is applied in order to classify the images. Finally, in the third part of this thesis, we address two applications of TV in the ATM domain. In the first application, based on the ideas developed in the second part, we introduce a methodology to extract the main air traffic flows in the airspace. Moreover, we develop a new airspace complexity indicator which can be used to organize air traffic at macroscopic level. This indicator is then compared to the regular density metric which is computed just by counting the number of aircraft in the airspace sector. The second application is based on a dynamical system model of air traffic. We propose a method for developing a new traffic complexity metric by computing the local vectorial total variation norm of the relative deviation vector field. Its aim is to reduce complexity. Three different traffic situations are investigated to evaluate the fitness of the proposed method.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2551341890", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125566479"}

Ensemble methods have gained popularity because many researchers have demonstrated their superior prediction performance relative to single models on a variety of problems especially when the correlations of the errors made by the base models are low (e.g., (Freund & Schapire 1996; Tumer & Oza 1999)). However, these learning methods have largely operated in batch mode\u2014that is, they repeatedly process the entire set of training examples as a whole. These methods typically require at least one pass through the data for each base model in the ensemble. We would instead prefer to learn the entire ensemble in an online fashion, i.e., using only one pass through the entire dataset. This would make ensemble methods practical when data is being generated continuously so that storing data for batch learning is impractical, or in data mining tasks where the datasets are large enough that multiple passes would require a prohibitively large training time. We have so far developed online versions of the popular bagging (Breiman 1994) and boosting (Freund & Schapire 1996) algorithms. We have shown empirically that both online algorithms converge to the same prediction performance as the batch versions and proved this convergence for online bagging (Oza 2000). However, significant empirical and theoretical work remains to be done. There are several traditional ensemble learning issues that remain in our online ensemble learning framework such as the number and types of base models to use, the combining method to use, and how to maintain diversity among the base models. When learning large datasets, we may hope to avoid using all of the training examples and/or input features. We have developed input decimation (Tumer & Oza 1999), a technique that uses different subsets of the input features in different base models.

However, current methods are still prone to generate artifacts and blurs around expression-intensive regions, and often introduce undesired overlapping artifacts while handling large-gap expression transformations such as transformation from furious to laughing. To address these limitations, we propose Cascade Expression Focal GAN (Cascade EF-GAN), a novel network that performs progressive facial expression editing with local expression focuses. The introduction of the local focus enables the Cascade EF-GAN to better preserve identity-related features and details around eyes, noses and mouths, which further helps reduce artifacts and blurs within the generated facial images. In addition, an innovative cascade transformation strategy is designed by dividing a large facial expression transformation into multiple small ones in cascade, which helps suppress overlapping artifacts and produce more realistic editing while dealing with large-gap expression transformations. Extensive experiments over two publicly available facial expression datasets show that our proposed Cascade EF-GAN achieves superior performance for facial expression editing.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.05905", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3010923700", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["45916410", "206652126", "52889459", "198162730", "198317175", "9417016", "19126895", "24675185", "141196166", "1033682", "10894094", "326772", "14442115", "13058841", "62732555", "6200260", "3568073", "8239952", "6628106", "27009824", "211227", "7142333", "5058972", "9459250", "37226097", "52957983", "12803511", "3366315", "37515850", "2202933", "50769652", "53047201", "206771333", "17272965", "12275803", "42092779", "1023605", "21011865", "211258635", "41805341", "51609927", "4393808", "4854984", "24005817", "2806929", "4072789", "52967339", "52847135", "52959267", "43244115", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["215238866"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212675115"}

In particular, we first add an adversarial component into traditional CNN-based gaze estimator so that we can learn features that are gaze-responsive but can generalize to appearance and pose variations. Next, we extend the point-estimation based deterministic model to a Bayesian framework so that gaze estimation can be performed using all parameters instead of only one set of parameters.

There are several factors that cause this to happen, e.g. atmospheric effects that can disrupt the reflection captured by the sensor and the natural similarity of several classes. So not all spectral bands have enough information that can separates each class in these spectral bands.

In the current paper we highlight that GANs can not only be used for creating synthetic cell images optimized for different fluorescent molecular labels, but that by using GANs for augmentation of training data involving scaling or other transformations the inherent length scale of biological structures is retained. In addition, GANs make it possible to create synthetic cells with specific shape features, which can be used, for example, to validate different methods for feature extraction. Here, we apply GANs to create 2D distributions of fluorescent markers for F-actin in the cell cortex of Dictyostelium cells (ABD), a membrane receptor (cAR1), and a cortex-membrane linker protein (TalA). The recent more widespread use of 3D lightsheet microscopy, where obtaining sufficient training data is considerably more difficult than in 2D, creates significant demand for novel approaches to data augmentation. We show that it is possible to directly generate synthetic 3D cell images using GANs, but limitations are excessive training times, dependence on high-quality segmentations of 3D images, and that the number of z-slices cannot be freely adjusted without retraining the network. We demonstrate that in the case of molecular labels that are highly correlated with cell shape, like F-actin in our example, 2D GANs can be used efficiently to create pseudo-3D synthetic cell data from individually generated 2D slices. Because high quality segmented 2D cell data are more readily available, this is an attractive alternative to using less efficient 3D networks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3389/fcomp.2019.00010", "venue": "Front.

The learning of finite-state languages (FSL) from example strings is a domain which has been extensively studied and might provide an opportunity to help understand connectionist learning. A majot problem is that traditional FSL learning assumes the storage of all examples and thus violates connectionist principles. This paper presents a provably correct algorithm for inferring any minimum-state deterministic finite state automata (FSA) from a complete ordered sample using limited total storage and without storing example strings. The algorithm is an iterative strategy that uses at each stage a current encoding of the data considered so far, and one single sample string. One of the crucial advantages of our algorithm is that the total amount of space used in the course of learning for encoding any finite prefix of the sample is polynomial in the size of the inferred minimum state deterministic FSA. The algorithm is also relatively efficient in time and has been implemented. More importantly, there is a connectionist version of the algorithm that preserves these properties. The connectionist version requires much more structure than the usual models and has been implemented using the Rochester Connectionist Simulator.

First, deep Boltzmann machine is adopted to infer the spatial and structural information encoded in the low-level and middle-level features to effectively describe objects in optical RSIs. Then, a novel WSL approach is presented to object detection where the training sets require only binary labels indicating whether an image contains the target object or not.

Because of sensor equipment occasional failure and network transmission unreliability, a large number of low-quality data, such as noisy data and incomplete data, is collected from the cyber-physical systems. Low-quality data pose a remarkable challenge on deep learning models for big data feature learning. As a novel deep learning model, the deep computation model achieves superior performance for big data feature learning. However, it is difficult for the deep computation model to learn dependable features for low-quality data, since it uses the nonlinear function as the encoder. In this article, a dependable deep computation model is proposed for feature learning on low-quality big data in cyber-physical systems. Specially, a regularity is added into the objective function of the deep computation model to obtain reliable features in the intermediate-level representation space. Furthermore, a learning algorithm based on the back-propagation strategy is devised to train the parameters of the proposed model. Finally, experiments are conducted on three representative datasets and a real dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the dependable deep computation model for low-quality big data feature learning. Results show that the proposed model achieves a remarkable result for the tasks of classification, restoration, and prediction, proving the potential of this work for practical applications in cyber-physical systems.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3110218", "venue": "TCPS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2894423278", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13858998", "543597", "16171497", "7119799", "17547614", "14556708", "5765409", "146680", "352650", "7332452", "206738073", "392458", "3334366", "11715509", "710430", "17804904", "10305401", "206742931", "7038503", "13235711", "5805711"], "inbound_citations": ["195430678"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53425330"}

We detect the spatiotemporal salient points by measuring the variations in the information content of pixel neighborhoods not only in space but also in time. We derive a suitable distance measure between the representations, which is based on the Chamfer distance, and we optimize this measure with respect to a number of temporal and scaling parameters. In this way we achieve invariance against scaling, while at the same time, we eliminate the temporal differences between the representations. We use Relevance Vector Machines (RVM) in order to address the classification problem. We propose new kernels for use by the RVM, which are specifically tailored to the proposed spatiotemporal salient point representation.

Furthermore, various diseases are caused by the dysfunction of ECM proteins. Therefore, identifying these important ECM proteins may assist in understanding related biological processes and drug development. In view of the serious imbalance in the training dataset, a Random Forest-based ensemble method with hybrid features is developed in this paper to identify ECM proteins. Hybrid features are employed by incorporating sequence composition, physicochemical properties, evolutionary and structural information. The Information Gain Ratio and Incremental Feature Selection (IGR-IFS) methods are adopted to select the optimal features. Finally, the resulting predictor termed IECMP (Identify ECM Proteins) achieves an balanced accuracy of 86.4% using the 10-fold cross-validation on the training dataset, which is much higher than results obtained by other methods (ECMPRED: 71.0%, ECMPP: 77.8%). Moreover, when tested on a common independent dataset, our method also achieves significantly improved performance over ECMPP and ECMPRED. These results indicate that IECMP is an effective method for ECM protein prediction, which has a more balanced prediction capability for positive and negative samples.

We tested GARBO and six alternative selection methods with two high relevant topics in precision medicine: cancer patient stratification and drug sensitivity prediction. We found multivariate biomarker models from different omics data types such as mRNA, miRNA, copy number variation, mutation and DNA methylation. The top performing models were evaluated by using two different strategies: the Pareto-based selection, and the weighted sum between accuracy and set size (w = 0.5). Pareto-based preferences shows the ability of the proposed algorithm to search minimal subsets of relevant features that can be used to model accurate Random Forest-based classification systems. Moreover, GARBO systematically identified, on larger omics data types, such as gene expression and DNA methylation, biomarker panels exhibiting higher classification accuracy or employing a number of features much lower than those discovered with other methods.

Unlike traditional data-driven models for capacity fault diagnosis and failure prognosis, which require multidimensional physical characteristics, the proposed algorithm uses only two variables: Energy Efficiency (EE), and Work Temperature. The aim of this novel framework is to improve the accuracy of incipient and abrupt faults diagnosis and failure prognosis. First, the LSSVM is used to generate residual signal based on capacity fade trends of the Li-ion batteries. Second, adaptive threshold model is developed based on several factors including input, output model error, disturbance, and drift parameter. The adaptive threshold is used to tackle the shortcoming of a fixed threshold. Third, the M-PF is proposed as the new method for failure prognostic to determine Remaining Useful Life (RUL). The M-PF is based on the assumption of the availability of real-time observation and historical data, where the historical failure data can be used instead of the physical failure model within the particle filter. The feasibility of the framework is validated using Li-ion battery prognostic data obtained from the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Prognostic Center of Excellence (PCoE). The experimental results show the following: (1) fewer data dimensions for the input data are required compared to traditional empirical models; (2) the proposed diagnostic approach provides an effective way of diagnosing Li-ion battery fault; (3) the proposed prognostic approach can predict the RUL of Li-ion batteries with small error, and has high prediction accuracy; and, (4) the proposed prognostic approach shows that historical failure data can be used instead of a physical failure model in the particle filter.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2204336887", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110082737"}

The used squared hinge loss not only inherits the robustness of the well-known hinge loss for classification with outliers, but also brings some benefits for computational implementation and theoretical justification. Under some sparseness assumption, we derive a fast learning rate of the order ${\\cal O}((m/\\log m)^{-1/4})$ for the proposed boosting method, which can be further improved to ${\\cal O}((m/\\log m)^{-1/2})$ if certain additional noise assumption is imposed, where $m$ is the size of sample set.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can potentially penetrate vegetation canopies and assist geological mapping in this environment. This study applies manual and automated lithological classification methods to airborne polarimetric TopSAR and geophysical data in the Heazlewood region, western Tasmania. Major discrepancies between classification results and the existing geological map generated fieldwork targets that led to the discovery of previously unmapped rock units. Manual analysis of radar image texture was essential for the identification of lithological boundaries. Automated pixel-based classification of radar data using Random Forests achieved poor results despite the inclusion of textural information derived from gray level co-occurrence matrices. This is because the majority of manually identified features within the radar imagery result from geobotanical and geomorphological relationships, rather than direct imaging of surficial lithological variations. Inconsistent relationships between geology and vegetation or geology and topography limit the reliability of TopSAR interpretations for geological mapping in this environment. However, Random Forest classifications, based on geophysical data and validated against manual interpretations, were accurate (\u223c90%) even when using limited training data (\u223c0.15% of total data). These classifications identified a previously unmapped region of mafic\u2013ultramafic rocks, the presence of which was verified through fieldwork.

The ALSSVR algorithm adopts the moving window scheme and a two-stage recursive learning framework to trace the time-varying dynamics of a process. The useless sample (i.e., a node of analyzer model), while not the oldest one, is selectively deleted from the model topology, using the fast leave-one-out cross-validation criterion.

Enabling a human to efficiently transfer knowledge and skills to a machine has inspired decades of research. I present a learning mechanism in which a robot learns new tasks using genetic-based machine learning technique, learning classifier system (LCS). LCSs are rule-based systems that automatically build their ruleset. At the origin of Holland\u2019s work, LCSs were seen as a model of the emergence of cognitive abilities thanks to adaptive mechanisms, particularly evolutionary processes. After a renewal of the field more focused on learning, LCSs are now considered as sequential decision problem-solving systems endowed with a generalization property. Indeed, from a Reinforcement Learning point of view, LCSs can be seen as learning systems building a compact representation of their problem. More recently, LCSs have proved efficient at solving automatic classification tasks (Sigaud et al., 2007). The aim of the present contribution is to describe the state-of the-art of LCSs, emphasizing recent developments, and focusing more on the application of LCS for Robotics domain. In previous robot learning studies, optimization of parameters has been applied to acquire suitable behaviors in a real environment. Also in most of such studies, a model of human evaluation has been used for validation of learned behaviors. However, since it is very difficult to build human evaluation function and adjust parameters, a system hardly learns behavior intended by a human operator. In order to reach that goal, I first present the two mechanisms on which they rely, namely GAs and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Then I provide a brief history of LCS research intended to highlight the emergence of three families of systems: strength-based LCSs, accuracy-based LCSs, and anticipatory LCSs (ALCSs) but mainly XCS as XCS, is the most studied LCS at this time. Afterward, in section 5, I present some examples of existing LCSs which have LCS applied for robotics. The next sections are dedicated to the particular aspects of theoretical and applied extensions of Intelligent Robotics. Finally, I try to highlight what seem to be the most promising lines of research given the current state of the art, and I conclude with the available resources that can be consulted in order to get a more detailed knowledge of these systems.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/10247", "venue": "Robot Learning", "journal": "Robot Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1494273972", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2145048", "64832941", "207507686", "15362783", "60930935", "18756977", "14328600", "56489392", "62483302", "2370", "39103390", "122017624", "40947976", "7931402", "59698993", "9166388", "145706818", "17613419", "7228178", "17680778", "18341635"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53758642"}

To exploit the kernel trick, C-SVR generally solves the Lagrangian dual problem. In this paper, an efficient sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm with a novel easy to compute working set selection (WSS) based on the minimization of an upper bound on the difference between consecutive loss function values for solving a convex non-smooth dual optimization problem obtained by reformulating the dual problem of C-SVR with \\(l_2\\) error loss function which is equivalent to the \\(\\varepsilon \\)-insensitive version of the LSSVR, is proposed. The asymptotic convergence to the optimum of the proposed SMO algorithm is also proved. This proposed SMO algorithm for solving non-smooth problem comprises both SMO algorithms for solving LSSVR and C-SVR. Indeed, it becomes equivalent to the SMO algorithm with second-order WSS for solving LSSVR when \\(\\varepsilon =0\\). The proposed algorithm has the advantage of dealing with the optimization variables half the number of the ones in C-SVR, which results in lesser number of kernel related matrix evaluations than the standard SMO algorithm developed for C-SVR and improves the probability of the matrix outputs to have been precomputed and cached.

More precise information is needed for making treatment decisions to distinguish aggressive cases from indolent disease, for which heritable factors could be a useful tool. The genetic makeup of PrCa has only recently begun to be unravelled through large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The thus far identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) explain, however, only a fraction of familial clustering. Moreover, the known risk SNPs are not associated with the clinical outcome of the disease, such as aggressive or metastasised disease, and therefore cannot be used to predict the prognosis. Annotating the SNPs with deep clinical data together with miRNA expression profiles can improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of different phenotypes of prostate cancer. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In this study microRNA (miRNA) profiles were studied as potential biomarkers to predict the disease outcome. The study subjects were from Finnish high risk prostate cancer families. To identify potential biomarkers we combined a novel non-parametrical test with an importance measure provided from a Random Forest classifier. This combination delivered a set of nine miRNAs that was able to separate cases from controls. The detected miRNA expression profiles could predict the development of the disease years before the actual PrCa diagnosis or detect the existence of other cancers in the studied individuals. Furthermore, using an expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis, regulatory SNPs for miRNA miR-483-3p that were also directly associated with PrCa were found. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Based on our findings, we suggest that blood-based miRNA expression profiling can be used in the diagnosis and maybe even prognosis of the disease. In the future, miRNA profiling could possibly be used in targeted screening, together with Prostate Specific Antigene (PSA) testing, to identify men with an elevated PrCa risk.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4447459", "pubmed_id": "26020509", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0127427", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2256502871", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13794496", "27203512", "13774613", "8882312", "13341852", "3059789", "41978995", "5323299", "7056259", "89141", "2641530", "17331156", "20375407", "6416636", "118145464", "500171", "43736039", "45041493", "87977277", "207605420", "1741341", "31098934", "12361506", "23102156", "96115", "32957636", "40183729", "24827326", "23016064", "13275577", "392288", "7216086", "5578299", "46114467", "1175864", "13182548", "16909839"], "inbound_citations": ["46929047", "9500172", "46536443", "215129685"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8639745"}

Its main difficulty lies in how to preserve similarity of the same person against large appearance and structure variation while discriminating different individuals. In this paper, we present a scalable distance driven feature learning framework based on the deep neural network for person re-identification, and demonstrate its effectiveness to handle the existing challenges. Specifically, given the training images with the class labels (person IDs), we first produce a large number of triplet units, each of which contains three images, i.e. one person with a matched reference and a mismatched reference. Treating the units as the input, we build the convolutional neural network to generate the layered representations, and follow with the L 2 distance metric. By means of parameter optimization, our framework tends to maximize the relative distance between the matched pair and the mismatched pair for each triplet unit. Moreover, a nontrivial issue arising with the framework is that the triplet organization cubically enlarges the number of training triplets, as one image can be involved into several triplet units. To overcome this problem, we develop an effective triplet generation scheme and an optimized gradient descent algorithm, making the computational load mainly depend on the number of original images instead of the number of triplets. On several challenging databases, our approach achieves very promising results and outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

However, the original MTL cannot effectively exploit both local and global structures of the HSI and the class label information is not fully used. Moreover, although the mathematical morphology (MM) has attracted considerable interest in feature extraction of HSI, it remains a challenging issue to sufficiently utilize multiple morphological profiles obtained by various structuring elements (SEs). In this paper, we propose a joint sparse and low-rank MTL method with Laplacian-like regularization (termed as sllMTL) for hyperspectral classification by utilizing the three-dimensional morphological profiles (3D-MPs) features. The main steps of the proposed method are twofold. First, the 3D-MPs are extracted by the 3D-opening and 3D-closing operators. Different SEs are adopted to result in multiple 3D-MPs. Second, sllMTL is proposed for hyperspectral classification by taking the 3D-MPs as features of different tasks. In the sllMTL, joint sparse and low-rank structures are exploited to capture the task specificity and relatedness, respectively. Laplacian-like regularization is also added to make full use of the label information of training samples.

The results of AVIRIS hyper-spectral data show that the classification precision of alteration information reaches 78.172 6%, and a Kappa coefficient of 0.712 5. This model is convenient calculation, and has some practical meaning in solving spectral dimension terrain classification and similar mineral alteration information extraction.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Computer Engineering and Applications", "mag_id": "2351138382", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201716297"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63775767"}

The analysis of drill core hyperspectral data is traditionally carried out by a visual interpretation of the spectra and a comparison with reference libraries using spectral similarity measures. Although this approach produces good results it is time-consuming and subjective. In this work, we introduce, for the first time, an innovative automatic mineral mapping technique for drill core hyperspectral data by using a machine learning approach. More specifically, we propose to exploit detailed information coming from the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)-based Mineral Liberation Analysis (MLA) to train a supervised classifier. For the extraction of input features, a traditional technique is explored, i.e., Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For the classification step, we suggest to use Random Forest (RF) because of its significant performance when there are few training samples available.

In this paper, we use SR method and combine Generative Adversarial Networks to design a super-resolution (Lapras-GAN) model of the enhanced loss function. The proposed enhancement loss function is a Mix loss function that combines the multiscale SSIM and L1 loss functions to obtain realistic images. We performed qualitative and quantitative analysis of the performance of different loss functions and demonstrated the advantages of the Mix loss function. In addition, the neural network is accelerated by multiple GPUs of multiple nodes, which can be 3-4 times faster than a single node single GPU. Experimental results show that the proposed Lapras-GAN method can generate images consistent with images produced by human perception. Further comparisons show that our Lapras-GAN has excellent performance and test time in the PIRM2018 experimental test data set.

The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge aims to evaluate the success of GRN inference algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this article, we present GENIE3, a new algorithm for the inference of GRNs that was best performer in the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. GENIE3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that GENIE3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed GRNs, and is fast and scalable. In conclusion, we propose a new algorithm for GRN inference that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression data. The algorithm, based on feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods, is simple and generic, making it adaptable to other types of genomic data and interactions.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id":

This framework, can be specialized to obtain two SVM optimization methods. The first solves the fixed bias problem, while the second starts with an optimal solution for a fixed bias problem and adjusts the bias until the optimal value is found. The later method can be applied in conjunction with any other existing technique which obtains a fixed bias solution. Moreover, the second method can also be used independently to solve the complete SVM training problem. A combination of these two methods is more flexible than each individual method and, among other things, produces an incremental algorithm which exactly solve the 1-Norm Soft, Margin SVM optimization problem. Applying Selective Sampling techniques may further boost convergence.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.7551/mitpress/1120.003.0095", "venue": "NIPS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2103105543", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["118352833", "209099422", "117743742"], "inbound_citations": ["16587282", "14487094", "6143287", "22480768", "210183869", "1733259", "3602518", "16289255", "199508755", "2903428", "8799873", "18228763", "18266405"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10623405"}

InfoGAN is a generative adversarial network that also maximizes the mutual information between a small subset of the latent variables and the observation. We derive a lower bound to the mutual information objective that can be optimized efficiently, and show that our training procedure can be interpreted as a variation of the Wake-Sleep algorithm. Specifically, InfoGAN successfully disentangles writing styles from digit shapes on the MNIST dataset, pose from lighting of 3D rendered images, and background digits from the central digit on the SVHN dataset. It also discovers visual concepts that include hair styles, presence/absence of eyeglasses, and emotions on the CelebA face dataset. Experiments show that InfoGAN learns interpretable representations that are competitive with representations learned by existing fully supervised methods.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1606.03657",

In this paper, we propose to use feature combinations derived from frequent patterns to obtain more accurate multiclass clas\u00ad sification models. Specifically, we present a novel mathematics inference to show what are discriminative feature combinations. Hence, an efficient algorithm is propsed for mining and selecting discriminative patterns. Experimental results on twenty VCI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can help to improve the classification performance remarkably, compared with other baseline methods. Moreover, an internal evaluation is employed to validate the strong discriminative power of our feature combinations. the discriminative strength of combined features. Yet, these approaches seldom consider the class distribution of data set when mining combined features if any, and class labels are required to be known to evaluate these measures but unlabeled data cannot still be utilized. In this paper, we focus on selecting discriminative feature combinations for enhancing multiclass classification. Based on the above analysis, we propose a feature selection algorithm called Maximal Frequent Pattern-based Feature Selection on One-Class (MFP _FS). In general, the MFP _FS model has three distinct properties. First, it treats the entire dataset as the union of subsets on every class and exploits maximal frequent patterns as the candidate extension of feature space. Second, a novel D function is proposed as the key metrics for evaluating discriminative strength of each feature combination. Third, our algorithm makes full use of both labeled training instances and unlabeled testing instances to enhance the process of pattern selection. Note that only attributes information in testing data are employed for model construction, the class labels remain unexposed. Extensive experiments are conducted on data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository (1 3). An overall comparison on twenty UCI datasets provides empirical results with four competing algorithms to demonstrate the effectiveness of MF\u00ad P _FS. Nalves Bayes (NB) and C4.5 are used as the baseline classifier. Then, factor of the size of training instances are explored to show the usefulness of feature combinations in varying situations. Finally, discriminative strength of combined features are studied by internally evaluating their information gain (IG) and chi-square (X2). Through experiments, we indeed discover the effectiveness of our proposed feature combination selection algorithm.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2247265604", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123686318"}

For mass detection, the segmentation of mammograms generates regions of interest (ROIs) that represent not only mass areas but normal tissues as well leading to false positives. This results in the problem of false positive reduction (i.e. classifying ROIs as masses and normal tissues). Texture properties of masses provide powerful discriminative information and the texture micropatterns can be effectively represented using Gabor filters with different scales and orientations. Though a local texture descriptor based on Gabor filter bank represents multiscale and multidirectional texture micropatterns of masses effectively, it involves a bulk of redundant features, increasing the dimensionality of the feature space and reducing the classification performance. This poses a challenge to even some of the most modern classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). To tackle this issue, the effectiveness of two state- of-the-art feature subset selection algorithms has been investigated in this study.

The main idea behind success of NMF and DLP in applications is matching the levels of uncertainty of the problem/model and the levels of uncertainty of the evaluation criterion used to identify the model with data. When a model becomes more certain then the evaluation criterion is also adjusted dynamically to match the adjusted model. This process mimics processes of the mind and natural evolution. This paper also outlines a generalization of k-nearest neighbors' algorithm in the DLP framework for geo-spatial structural data mining and fusion. The generalization is demonstrated on the problem of vector to raster conflation (VRC) of topologically and geometrically uncertain geo-spatial data. In this problem, multiple sources of data uncertainty include feature extraction from satellite imagery, vectorization of extracted features, and the whole process of generation of vector layers such as road and drainage networks. The derived conflation algorithm exploits generalized DLP with the lattice of models based on the hierarchy of topological and geometric uncertainties. The efficiency of this algorithm is shown on conflating satellite imagery with Tiger vector data.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CCMB.2011.5952126", "venue": "2011 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence, Cognitive Algorithms, Mind, and Brain (CCMB)", "journal": "2011 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence, Cognitive Algorithms, Mind, and Brain (CCMB)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2105100707", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1504626", "218423", "62178517", "17867091", "44859193", "14733321", "59976867", "8481495", "15609042", "117193723", "825192", "9758332", "120476025", "18107723", "14768092", "16426579", "11196857", "11334939", "13249098", "3737979", "13295966", "1754976"], "inbound_citations": ["14793913"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1878952"}

Reliable technologies have become available for the chemical analysis of suspect medicines. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows for instance fast, specific and non-destructive authentication of pharmaceutical products. In this paper, a NIRS method is presented for the identification of 29 different pharmaceutical product families of tablets, one family containing one or more formulation (s), e.g. different dosages. This selection represents the whole tablet portfolio of our firm. The high number of product families constituted a challenge, given that the measurement of the samples, made on two similar instruments, generated a dataset of 7120 spectra. Several chemometric tools proved efficient for the identification of these medicines. The dataset was first investigated with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to provide an overview of the distribution of the samples. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the Discriminant Analysis (DA) supervised classification tools were successfully applied and generated an outstanding classification rate of 100% of correct answer. The methods were then fully validated with an independent set of spectra. The DA was selected as the method for the routine analysis of suspect tablets with the Mahalanobis distance as acceptance criterion for identification. Counterfeits, generics and placebos samples, constituting a second validation set, were tested and rejected by the method. NIRS has thus been demonstrated as an efficient tool for the quick identification of a large dataset of pharmaceutical tablets and the detection of counterfeit medicines.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27236101", "doi": "10.1016/j.jpba.2016.05.004", "venue": "Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis", "journal": "Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis", "mag_id": "2346532858", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["122565911", "204908574", "51967716", "207225122", "214799494", "59303988", "3650049", "215109068"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28584637"}

Patients were divided into a discovery cohort of 179 cases in comparison with 1,917 control subjects and a replication cohort of 109 cases and 1,114 control subjects. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Our analyses detected strong association with the MHC region and association with a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) genes (P combined = 1.96 \u00d7 10(-7)) replicated in the independent cohort. CNV analysis defined 16 disease-associated deletions and duplications, including duplication of origin recognition complex 4L (ORC4L) that was unique to 15 cases (P = 8.66 \u00d7 10(-16)), as well as numerous unique rare intraexonic deletions and duplications suggesting multiple novel genetic causes of CVID. Furthermore, the 1,000 most significant SNPs were strongly predictive of the CVID phenotype by using a Support Vector Machine algorithm with positive and negative predictive values of 1.0 and 0.957, respectively. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Our integrative genome-wide analysis of SNP genotypes and CNVs has uncovered multiple novel susceptibility loci for CVID, both common and rare, which is consistent with the highly heterogeneous nature of CVID.

A total of 194 raw ham samples were used to evaluate the DSIA performance in the experiments. Support Vector Machine and Random Forest algorithms were compared for inducing the classification model using 92 image features.

At first, this straight- forward idea seems to suffer from an obvious shortcom- ing: Transporting large datasets is prohibitively expensive, hindering scalability. Fortunately, with our approach, we never transport data. Rather, we show how the statistical models themselves can be transported, and prove that for the tangent-space models above, the transport \"commutes\" with learning.

That is, the methodology adopts the stance that rules must either be hard-wired or \"trained into\" neural structures, rather than represented via explicit symbolic structures. Even recent attempts to implement production systems within connectionist networks have assumed that condition-action rules (or rule schema) are to be embodied in the structure of individual networks. Such networks must be grown or trained over a significant span of time. However, arguments are presented herein that humans sometimes follow rules which are very rapidly assigned explicit internal representations, and that humans possess general mechanisms capable of interpreting and following such rules. In particular, arguments are presented that the speed with which humans are able to follow rules of novel structure demonstrates the existence of general-purpose rule following mechanisms. It is further argued that the existence of general-purpose rule following mechanisms strongly indicates that explicit rule following is not an isolated phenomenon, but may well be a pervasive aspect of cognition.

The missing target values are interpolated by using both the temporal relationships within each stream and the relationships across streams.

The progress mainly comes from searching for new network structures to learn person representations. Most of these networks are trained using the classic stochastic gradient descent optimizer. However, limited efforts have been made to explore potential performance of existing ReID networks directly by better training scheme, which leaves a large space for ReID research. In this paper, we propose a Self-Inspirited Feature Learning (SIF) method to enhance performance of given ReID networks from the viewpoint of optimization. We design a simple adversarial learning scheme to encourage a network to learn more discriminative person representation. In our method, an auxiliary branch is added into the network only in the training stage, while the structure of the original network stays unchanged during the testing stage. In summary, SIF has three aspects of advantages: (1) it is designed under general setting; (2) it is compatible with many existing feature learning networks on the ReID task; (3) it is easy to implement and has steady performance. We evaluate the performance of SIF on three public ReID datasets: Market1501, DuckMTMC-reID, and CUHK03(both labeled and detected).

In this paper, we present an alternative diagnostic method based on feature extraction and pattern classification (FEPC) to diagnose abnormal patterns in ACL thermograms. The proposed method was experimented with a total of 30 thermograms for each camera view (anterior, lateral and posterior) including 14 disease and 16 non-disease cases provided from Long Island Veterinary Specialists. The normal and abnormal patterns in thermograms are analyzed in two steps: feature extraction and pattern classification.

The general idea of the previous approaches is to model the shared structure in one latent space as the bridge across domains by reducing the distribution divergences.

In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method, referred to as Multi-Bridge Transfer Learning (MBTL), to learn the distributions in the different latent spaces together.

The friction velocity was also used instead of wind speed at 10 m height. For this case, three different assumptions were considered for computing friction velocity. For the analysis, one month (from August 20th, 2008 to September 20th, 2008) data including passage of hurricanes Gustav and Ike over Gulf of Mexico were collected from six different buoys. Next, seven different parameters were used to train the models based on the data observed from five buoys. Later the trained models were used to forecast observed wave height in the sixth buoy in different lead times. The results showed that using more number of input parameters leads to better performance of the methods, especially in longer lead times. Moreover, in longer lead times, the effect of other parameters such as air pressure were increased and assisted the models to outperform previous models.

Several rule-based and machine learning-based techniques have been developed to address this problem. However, the majority of these methods rely on the availability of different physiological signals such as different electrocardiogram (ECG) leads, arterial blood pressure (ABP), and photoplethysmogram (PPG), where each signal is analyzed by an independent processing unit and the results are fed to an algorithm to determine an alarm. That calls for novel methods that can accurately detect the cardiac events by only accessing one signal (e.g., ECG) with a low level of computation and sensors requirement. We propose a novel and robust representation learning framework for ECG analysis that only rely on a single lead ECG signal and yet achieves considerably better performance compared to the state-of-the-art works in this domain, without relying on an expert knowledge. We evaluate the performance of this method using the \u201c2015 Physionet computing in cardiology challenge\u201d dataset. To the best of our knowledge, the best previously reported performance is based on both expert knowledge and machine learning where all available signals of ECG, ABP and PPG are utilized.

Existing methods for image inpainting either fill the missing regions by borrowing information from surrounding areas or generating semantically coherent content from region context. They often produce ambiguous or semantically incoherent content when the missing region is large or with complex structures. In this paper, we present an approach for image inpainting. The completion model based on our proposed algorithm contains one generator, one global discriminator, and one local discriminator. The generator is responsible for inpainting the missing area, the global discriminator aims evaluating whether the repair result has global consistency, and the local discriminator is responsible for identifying whether the repair area is correct. The architecture of the generator is an auto-encoder. We use the skip-connection in the generator to improve the prediction power of the model. Also, we use Wasserstein GAN loss to ensure the stability of training.

Impressive progress has been made by adversarial learning-based methods that align distributions across domains through deceiving a domain discriminator network. However, these methods only try to align two domains and neglect the boundaries between classes, which may lead to false alignment and poor generalization performance. In contrast, consistency-enforcing methods exploit the target data posterior distribution to make the target features far away from decision boundaries. Despite their efficacy, these approaches require additional intensity augmentation to align distributions when encountering datasets with large domain discrepancy. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel UDA method that unifies the adversarial learning-based method and consistency-enforcing method together to take both domain alignment and boundaries between classes into consideration.

To be specific, we first construct robust and informative pseudo labels for target samples, and then we encourage the prediction at an interpolation of unlabeled target samples to be consistent with the interpolation of the pseudo labels of these samples.

To represent the complex intrinsic spatial-spectral of HSI, a novel feature learning algorithm, termed discriminant spatial-spectral hypergraph learning (DSSHL), has been proposed on the basis of spatial-spectral information and hypergraph learning. DSSHL constructs an intraclass spatial-spectral hypergraph and an interclass spatial-spectral hypergraph to represent the intrinsic properties of HSI.

This task becomes challenging due to inclusion of noise in acquisition process owing to number of different factors. In this paper we propose a system for heart sound localization and classification into S1 and S2. The proposed system introduces the concept of quality assessment before localization, feature extraction and classification of heart sounds. Methods: The signal quality is assessed by predefined criteria based upon number of peaks and zero crossing of PCG signal. Once quality assessment is performed, then heart beats within PCG signal are localized, which is done by envelope extraction using homomorphic envelogram and finding prominent peaks. In order to classify localized peaks into S1 and S2, temporal and time-frequency based statistical features have been used. Support Vector Machine using radial basis function kernel is used for classification of heart beats into S1 and S2 based upon extracted features. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, F-measure and Total Error. The dataset provided by PASCAL classifying heart sound challenge is used for testing. Results: Performance of system is significantly improved by quality assessment.

Unfortunately, the black-box nature of Deep Learning models has posed unanswered questions about what they learn from data. Certain application scenarios have highlighted the importance of assessing the bounds under which Deep Learning models operate, a problem addressed by using assorted approaches aimed at audiences from different domains. However, as the focus of the application is placed more on non-expert users, it results mandatory to provide the means for him/her to trust the model, just like a human gets familiar with a system or process: by understanding the hypothetical circumstances under which it fails. This is indeed the angular stone for this research work: to undertake an adversarial analysis of a Deep Learning model. The proposed framework constructs counterfactual examples by ensuring their plausibility, e.g. there is a reasonable probability that a human could generate them without resorting to a computer program.

To this end, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and multi-objective heuristics are used to furnish a plausible attack to the audited model, efficiently trading between the confusion of this model, the intensity and plausibility of the generated counterfactual.

Biomarkers have long been used for the prognosis and diagnosis of different types of diseases. The need for new and more specific biomarkers for leukemia arises. In this study gene selection was approached first using gene filtering by determining the expressions inter-quartile ranges (IQR) of the genes and determining whether or not they are differentially expressed across the different sample types by using the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA). Filtered genes were then subjected to k-means clustering algorithm to identify candidate genes that can be used to discriminate the four main types of leukemia (ALL, AML, CLL, CML) and non-leukemia (NoL) bone marrow samples. The selected genes were then used to build classification models using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learning algorithms.

The proposed metric learning framework can handle three typical tasks of video-based face recognition: Video-to-Still, Still-to-Video and Video-to-Video settings. To accomplish this new framework, by exploiting typical Riemannian geometries for kernel embedding, we map the source Euclidean space and Riemannian manifold into a common Euclidean subspace, each through a corresponding high-dimensional Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). With this mapping, the problem of learning a cross-view metric between the two source heterogeneous spaces can be expressed as learning a single-view Euclidean distance metric in the target common Euclidean space. By learning information on heterogeneous data with the shared label, the discriminant metric in the common space improves face recognition from videos.

With the development of clinical technologies, different tumor features have been collected for breast cancer diagnosis. Filtering all the pertinent feature information to support the clinical disease diagnosis is a challenging and time-consuming task. The objective of this research was to diagnose breast cancer based on the extracted tumor features. The main contribution of our study is to use multivariate techniques such as principal component analysis, discriminant analysis and logistic regression for feature reduction combined with machine learning tools to classify and predict the tumor type. A hybrid DA-LR feature reduction is proposed, and models created with reduced features are tested by performing classification using Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network. Materials and Methods: Feature extraction and selection are critical to the quality of classifiers founded through data mining methods. To diagnose tumor through reduced features, a hybrid feature extraction is proposed. We tried to predict the disease based on relevant features in the data. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset obtained from the UCI Irvine Machine Learning Repository has been used in this study. After data pre-processing, the correlation matrix is generated that suggests the presence of multicollinearity. Feature reduction techniques including principal component analysis, discriminant analysis, and logistic regression are applied to extract features. Classification models namely Support vector machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network are created with extracted features, and their performance is compared. Result: The results not only illustrate the capability of the proposed approach on breast cancer diagnosis but also show time savings during the training phase.

ILP systems have successful applications in the learning of structure-activity rules for drug design, semantic grammars rules, finite element mesh design rules and rules for prediction of protein structure and mutagenic molecules. The strong applications in ILP can be contrasted with relatively weak PAC-learning results (even highly restricted forms of logic programs are known to be prediction-hard). It has been recently argued that the mismatch is due to distributional assumptions made in application domains. These assumptions can be modelled as a Bayesian prior probability representing subjective degrees of belief. Other authors have argued for the use of Bayesian prior distributions for reasons different to those here, though this has not lead to a new model of polynomial-time learnability. Incorporation of Bayesian prior distributions over time-bounded hypotheses in PAC leads to a new model called U-learnability. It is argued that U-learnability is more appropriate than PAC for Universal (Turing computable) languages. Time-bounded logic programs have been shown to be polynomially U-learnable under certain distributions.

Experimental results have verified that the proposed VPSO-ELM scheme significantly improves the testing accuracy of classification problems.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ROBIO.2013.6739599", "venue": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)", "journal": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1999024143", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15589402", "26893209", "29540768", "9279281", "9782308", "206597767", "18105393", "2051753", "30609731", "17292559", "11124791", "14573166", "4185891", "7367791"], "inbound_citations": ["25842226"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7404436"}

Degradation tendency measurement on an engine can not only improve its safety, but effectively reduce the maintenance costs. In this paper, a hybrid method using multi-sensor data based on fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition permutation entropy (FEEMD-PE) and regularized extreme learning machine (RELM), systematically blending the signal processing technology and trend prediction approach, is proposed for aircraft engine degradation tendency measurement. Firstly, a synthesized degradation index was designed utilizing multi-sensor data and a data fusion technique to evaluate the degradation level of the engine unit. Secondly, in order to eliminate the irregular data fluctuation, FEEMD was employed to efficiently decompose the constructed degradation index series. Subsequently, considering the complexity of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) obtained through sequence decomposition, a permutation entropy-based reconstruction strategy was innovatively developed to generate the refactored IMFs (RIMFs), which have stronger ability for describing the degradation states and contribute to improving the prediction accuracy. Finally, RIMFs were used as the inputs of the RELM model to measure the degradation tendency. The proposed method was applied to the degradation tendency measurement of aircraft engines.

To overcome this, we first borrow an auxiliary database with complete modalities, then consider knowledge transfer across databases and across modalities within databases simultaneously in a unified framework. The contributions are threefold: 1) a latent factor is introduced to uncover the underlying structure of the missing modality from the known data; 2) transfer learning in two directions allows the data alignment between both modalities and databases, giving rise to a very promising recovery; and 3) an efficient solution with theoretical guarantees to the proposed latent low-rank transfer learning algorithm.

They have resorted to many arguments to justify these claims among which, the complexity of language, the poverty of stimulus and the lack of negative evidence can be mentioned (Cook and Newson, 1996). For some decades these theories have been widely accepted as being not controversial and even undeniable. But within the last two decades these ideas have been strongly disputed by emergentists, construction grammarians, associationists, and connectionists. These approaches differ strikingly from other accounts of language learning. They do not believe that language acquisition is the result of internalizing language rules. Instead, in these approaches, the importance is put on construction of associative patterns (Mitchell & Myles 2004). Among these approaches to language the last one, connectionism, is greatly distinguished by others in its research techniques. The development of neural network computer simulations or what has come to be known as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has helped researchers in this approach to make stronger claims about the nature of language and language acquisition.

This paper presents the Deep Neural Network approach for estimation of an inter-area dominant mode based on synchrophasor data. It has faster estimating time over a conventional method. In addition, this approach avoids using complicated power system mathematical models. The results show better accuracy of inter-area mode estimation in comparison with an existing method and Support Vector Regression.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/gtdasia.2019.8716002", "venue": "2019 IEEE PES GTD Grand International Conference and Exposition Asia (GTD Asia)", "journal": "2019 IEEE PES GTD Grand International Conference and Exposition Asia (GTD Asia)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2946157687", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15136210", "52127574", "25032874", "109894007", "65080459", "37607278"], "inbound_citations": ["211297930", "199440680"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:155109402"}

In this paper, we propose a discriminative block-diagonal low-rank representation (BDLRR) method for recognition. In particular, the elaborate BDLRR is formulated as a joint optimization problem of shrinking the unfavorable representation from off-block-diagonal elements and strengthening the compact block-diagonal representation under the semisupervised framework of LRR. To this end, we first impose penalty constraints on the negative representation to eliminate the correlation between different classes such that the incoherence criterion of the extra-class representation is boosted. Moreover, a constructed subspace model is developed to enhance the self-expressive power of training samples and further build the representation bridge between the training and test samples, such that the coherence of the learned intraclass representation is consistently heightened. Finally, the resulting optimization problem is solved elegantly by employing an alternative optimization strategy, and a simple recognition algorithm on the learned representation is utilized for final prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superb recognition results on four face image data sets, three character data sets, and the 15 scene multicategories data set.

Historically, a single global threshold, typically optimized via cross-validation testing, is applied to all protein pairs. However, we here use data visualization techniques to show that no single decision threshold is suitable for all protein pairs, given the inherent diversity of protein interaction profiles. The recent development of high throughput PPI predictors has enabled the comprehensive scoring of all possible protein-protein pairs. This, in turn, has given rise to context, enabling us now to evaluate a PPI within the context of all possible predictions. Leveraging this context, we introduce a novel modeling framework called Reciprocal Perspective (RP), which estimates a localized threshold on a per-protein basis using several rank order metrics. By considering a putative PPI from the perspective of each of the proteins within the pair, RP rescores the predicted PPI and applies a cascaded Random Forest classifier leading to improvements in recall and precision. We here validate RP using two state-of-the-art PPI predictors, the Protein-protein Interaction Prediction Engine and the Scoring PRotein INTeractions methods, over five organisms: Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Mus musculus.

The estimation of a module's fault-proneness is important for minimizing cost and improving the effectiveness of the software testing process. Unfortunately, no general technique for estimating software fault-proneness is available. The observed correlation between some software metrics and fault-proneness has resulted in a variety of predictive models based on multiple metrics. Much work has concentrated on how to select the software metrics that are most likely to indicate fault-proneness. In this paper, we propose the use of machine learning for this purpose. Specifically, given historical data on software metric values and number of reported errors, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained. Then, in order to determine the importance of each software metric in predicting fault-proneness, a sensitivity analysis is performed on the trained ANN. The software metrics that are deemed to be the most critical are then used as the basis of an ANN-based predictive model of a continuous measure of fault-proneness. We also view fault-proneness prediction as a binary classification task (i.e., a module can either contain errors or be error-free) and use Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a state-of-the-art classification method.

The named entity recognition approach used is one that fosters language and domain independence by eliminating the use of prior language and/or domain knowledge. The biomedical domain is chosen as the focus of this work due to its importance and inherent challenges. ::: To investigate the scalability of the SVM machine learning approach, we conduct a series of baseline experiments using biomedical abstracts. Single class and multi-class classification performance and results are examined. The initial performance results\u2014measured in terms of precision, recall, and F-score\u2014are comparable to those obtained using more complex approaches. These results demonstrate that the simplified architecture used is capable of providing a reasonable solution to the language and domain-independent named entity recognition problem. ::: To improve the scalability of named entity recognition using SVM, two main factors are tackled: computation time and memory requirements. We develop a new cutting plane algorithm for multi-class classification\u2014 SVM-PerfMulti\u2014based on a new structural formulation for support vector optimization. The solution is several orders of magnitude faster than the traditional SVM-Multiclass machine and provides good out-of-the-box performance, yet it requires a considerable amount of memory that is linear w.r.t. the training data size. ::: We introduce a new database-supported solution embedded in a relational database server. The database framework supports both the binary and multi-class classification problems. We explore the trade-off between computation time and online memory requirement when input feature vectors and trained support vectors are stored and fetched from the database. Database caching of input vectors has minimal to no impact on the computation time. On the other hand, constantly fetching support vectors from permanent storage negatively impacts computation time and can be improved by caching kernel computations in active memory. The database framework promotes the usability of the machine learning solution and provides a way to build a growing dictionary of previously identified named entities.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2106288831", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["18904364", "5555787", "2094032"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62537083"}

The hybrid model uses the SOM algorithm to cluster the entire dataset into several disjointed clusters, where the monthly river flows data with similar input pattern are grouped together from a high dimensional input space onto a low dimensional output layer. By doing this, the data with similar input patterns will be mapped to neighbouring neurons in the SOM's output layer. After the dataset has been decomposed into several disjointed clusters, an individual LSSVM is applied to forecast the river flow. The feasibility of this proposed model is evaluated with respect to the actual river flow data from the Bernam River located in Selangor, Malaysia. The performance of the SOM-LSSVM was compared with other single models such as ARIMA, ANN and LSSVM. The performance of these models was then evaluated using various performance indicators.

First of all, a large number of unlabeled samples are made use of through the unsupervised training of GAN, which is used to provide a good initial state to the following model. Afterwards, the manually labeled samples corresponding to each hardness level are individually used to train the GAN, of which the architecture and initial parameter values are inherited from the unsupervised GAN, and augmented by the generator of trained GAN. Finally, the hardness recognition network (HRN), of which the main architecture and initial parameter values are inherited from the discriminator of unsupervised GAN, is pretrained by a large number of augmented labeled samples and fine-tuned by manually labeled samples. The hardness recognition result can be obtained online by importing the tactile data captured by the robotic forearm into the trained HRN.

We obtained 3300 reflectance spectra from pears acquired from different lots, producers and with diverse storage times and ripening stages. The macroscopic properties of the pears, such as size, temperature and SSC were measured under controlled laboratory conditions. For the spectral analysis, we implemented a computational pipeline that incorporates multiple pre-processing techniques including a feature selection procedure, various multivariate regression models and three different validation strategies. This benchmark allowed us to find the best model/preproccesing procedure for SSC prediction from our data. From the several calibration models tested, we have found that Support Vector Machines provides the best predictions metrics with an RMSEP of around 0.82 \u2218 Brix and 1.09 \u2218 Brix for internal and external validation strategies respectively. The latter validation was implemented to assess the prediction accuracy of this calibration method under more 'real world-like' conditions.

Previous studies have mostly focused on classifiers for gesture recognition using steady state EMG. Only few studies have used non-steady-state EMG classifier when gross upper arm muscles are in motion. To investigate it further, our study was designed to take EMG measurements from 4 upper limb muscles of 10 participants while interacting with HapticMaster robot in assisting mode. The participants were asked to move the robotic arm in a rectangular path consisting of 4 segments named S1 to S4. The EMG signals were analyzed by splitting them into non-overlapping windows of 100 milliseconds width. The initial windows within the initial 1 seconds of each segment iteration were considered to train and test a Support Vector Machine classifier. Various EMG features were calculated for different number of windows and used for classifying different segments. For the different combinations of features and muscles, it was noticed that the near-the-body segments S1 and S4 displayed the highest median accuracy for the feature combination (Waveform Length + Mean Average Value + Zero Crossing Count + Signal Slope Change) which were 100% each. For the same feature combination, it was also noticed that the segments S2 and S3 had the least accuracy, 76.2% and 73.8% respectively, possibly due to the away-from-body movements. In general, the accuracy was found to be more stable and higher for S1 and S4 segments. Considering 700 milliseconds (so 7 windows) for classification provided the best accuracy and the best muscle combination was Trapezius + Deltoid + Biceps Brachii + Triceps Brachii.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ROMAN.2017.8172408", "venue": "2017 26th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)", "journal": "2017 26th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2771076607", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17162934", "21869062", "26426470", "46023432", "7291430", "11240886", "6660923", "55011395", "20692387", "206759569", "25308802"], "inbound_citations": ["214627692"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32837690"}

In pupylation process, the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) tagging is functionally analogous to ubiquitination in order to tag target proteins for proteasomal degradation. To date, several experimental methods have been developed to identify pupylated proteins and their pupylation sites, but these experimental methods are generally laborious and costly. Therefore, computational methods that can accurately predict potential pupylation sites based on protein sequence information are highly desirable. In this paper, a novel predictor termed as pbPUP has been developed for accurate prediction of pupylation sites. In particular, a sophisticated sequence encoding scheme [i.e. the profile-based composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (pbCKSAAP)] is used to represent the sequence patterns and evolutionary information of the sequence fragments surrounding pupylation sites. Then, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained using the pbCKSAAP encoding scheme. The final pbPUP predictor achieves an AUC value of 0.849 in10-fold cross-validation tests and outperforms other existing predictors on a comprehensive independent test dataset.

This model also has a strong potential in the application of SVMs on other research areas with huge datasets.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3226186", "pubmed_id": "19811680", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-10-S11-S15", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2345930099,2157556292", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17729088", "11733984", "16556204", "1589525", "52874011", "14477426", "18321401", "15367521", "18905054"], "inbound_citations": ["19956705", "11167815", "11947184", "199569472", "14284955", "15128502", "16592097", "3830546", "82071301", "14498911", "2596485"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:991877"}

Recent advancements in the area rely on the use of deep learning, which allows researchers to operate on a low-level description of the music. Deep neural network architectures can learn to build feature representations that summarize music files from data itself, rather than expert knowledge. In this paper, a novel approach to applying feature learning in combination with support vector machines to musical data is presented. A spectrogram of the music file, which is too complex to be processed by SVM, is first reduced to a compact representation by a recurrent neural network. An adjustment to loss function of the network is proposed so that the network learns to build a representation space that replicates a certain notion of similarity between annotations, rather than to explicitly make predictions. We evaluate the approach on five datasets, focusing on emotion recognition and complementing it with genre classification. In experiments, the proposed loss function adjustment is shown to improve results in classification and regression tasks, but only when the learned similarity notion corresponds to a kernel function employed within the SVM. These results suggest that adjusting deep learning methods to build data representations that target a specific classifier or regressor can open up new perspectives for the use of standard machine learning methods in music domain.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2018/1935938", "venue": "Complexity", "journal": "Complexity", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2885684249", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13797977", "143280193", "11771973", "147936492", "15813425", "9275207", "7955288", "447039", "17994257", "17124499", "16232231", "17194956", "2721330", "3134584", "11055993", "419137", "9128633", "9404659", "6928185", "1407171", "6536466", "1915014", "11212020", "5201925", "17106059", "6832733", "23060285", "15438733", "3238519", "18799449", "17768426", "27527626", "7365802", "8993325", "17943490"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52094877"}

In this paper, we try to address such a question using vehicle license plate character recognition as an example application. We apply computer graphic scripts and Generative Adversarial Networks to generate and augment a large number of annotated, synthesized license plate images with realistic colors, fonts, and character composition from a small number of real, manually labeled license plate images. Generated and augmented data are mixed and used as training data for the license plate recognition network modified from DenseNet. The experimental results show that the model trained from the generated mixed training data has good generalization ability, and the proposed approach achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on Dataset-1 and AOLP, even with a very limited number of original real license plates. In addition, the accuracy improvement caused by data generation becomes more significant when the number of labeled images is reduced.

The use of this technology to predict cancer outcome has a history of almost a decade. Disease class predictors can be designed for known disease cases and provide diagnostic confirmation or clarify abnormal cases. The main input to this class predictors are high dimensional data with many variables and few observations. Dimensionality reduction of these features set significantly speeds up the prediction task. Feature selection and feature transformation methods are well known preprocessing steps in the field of bioinformatics. Several prediction tools are available based on these techniques. Studies show that a well tuned Kernel PCA (KPCA) is an efficient preprocessing step for dimensionality reduction, but the available bandwidth selection method for KPCA was computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven bandwidth selection criterion for KPCA, which is related to least squares cross-validation for kernel density estimation. We propose a new prediction model with a well tuned KPCA and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM). We estimate the accuracy of the newly proposed model based on 9 case studies. Then, we compare its performances (in terms of test set Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and computational time) with other well known techniques such as whole data set + LS-SVM, PCA + LS-SVM, t-test + LS-SVM, Prediction Analysis of Microarrays (PAM) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso). Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed strategy with an existing KPCA parameter tuning algorithm by means of two additional case studies. We propose, evaluate, and compare several mathematical/statistical techniques, which apply feature transformation/selection for subsequent classification, and consider its application in medical diagnostics. Both feature selection and feature transformation perform well on classification tasks. Due to the dynamic selection property of feature selection, it is hard to define significant features for the classifier, which predicts classes of future samples.

For this reason, the aim of this study was to determine if measurements of hippocampal subfields provide advantages over total hippocampal volume for discriminating these groups. Hippocampal subfields volumetry was extracted in 55 AD, 32 converted and 89 not-converted MCI (c/nc-MCI) and 47 healthy controls, using an atlas-based automatic algorithm based on Markov random fields embedded in the Freesurfer framework. To evaluate the impact of hippocampal atrophy in discriminating the insurgence of AD-like phenotypes we used three classification methods: Support Vector Machine, Na\u00efve Bayesian Classifier and Neural Networks Classifier. Taking into account only the total hippocampal volume, all classification models, reached a sensitivity of about 66% in discriminating between c-MCI and nc-MCI. Otherwise, classification analysis considering all segmenting subfields increased accuracy to diagnose c-MCI from 68% to 72%. This effect resulted to be strongly dependent upon atrophies of the subiculum and presubiculum.

Word embedding is a way to express words by vector of real numbers. In addition to its advantages of low dimension and denseness, word embedding itself also carries the semantic information of corresponding words in context. For example, the cosine value between two word embeddings can reflect the semantic relevance of corresponding words to a certain extent. However, this paper finds that the mapping from cosine value to relevancy is not accurate enough through analyzing actual data. Therefore, this paper adopts a machine learning algorithm as Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT). Firstly, extract training samples from word embedding library, then build a training set by relevancy scoring to the target word. Secondly, build GBDT model based on the training set to conduct regression analysis of mapping from word embedding to relevancy score. Finally, fit the whole word embedding library with the resulting model. Experimental results show that comparing with the cosine value of word embedding, the GBDT regression model significantly improves the fitting values of the words closely related to the meaning of the target word, and the fitting values of words weakly related to the target word is effectively suppressed, which proves that the GBDT model performs better in accuracy.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CompComm.2018.8780897", "venue": "2018 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)", "journal": "2018 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2966336779", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7478738", "85205", "5959482", "2617020", "52098500", "17596863", "1326925"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199441436"}

This paper presents the application of GANs to cyber-attack alert data and shows that GANs not only successfully learn to generate realistic alerts, but also reveal feature dependencies within alerts. This is accomplished by reviewing the intersection of histograms for varying alert-feature combinations between the ground truth and generated datsets. Traditional statistical metrics, such as conditional and joint entropy, are also employed to verify the accuracy of these dependencies. Finally, it is shown that a Mutual Information constraint on the network can be used to increase the generation of low probability, critical, alert values.

The Hammerstein model expressed by a nonlinear static subunit followed by a linear dynamic subunit was used to describe the nonlinear dynamic system. Through the function expansion, the nonlinear transfer function of Hammerstein model could be converted to the same form as linear one, thus generating the intermediate linear model. Also, by SVR algorithm, the coefficients of the intermediate model were obtained. Moreover, through the relations of the coefficients of intermediate model and that of Hammerstein model, the nonlinear static subunit and linear dynamic subunit were identified simultaneously. Calibrating experimental data of nonlinear dynamic system were used to test. The results show that, compared with conventional nonlinear dynamic modeling methods, the proposed one possesses prominent advantages: 1) Only once dynamic calibrating experiment need be made; 2) The analytic expressions of nonlinear dynamic model are derived; 3) The model is more robust in noise resistance due to the good features of SVR.

We decompose the problem into three subproblems: (i) coronal hole segmentation based on physical constraints, (ii) matching clusters of coronal holes between different maps, and (iii) physical map classification. For segmenting coronal holes, we develop a multi-modal method that uses segmentation maps from three different methods to initialize a level-set method that evolves the initial coronal hole segmentation to the magnetic boundary. Then, we introduce a new method based on Linear Programming for matching clusters of coronal holes. The final matching is then performed using Random Forests. The methods were carefully validated using consensus maps derived from multiple readers, manual clustering, manual map classification, and method validation for 50 maps.

In this paper, we propose an automatic generation system of multiple-choice cloze questions from English texts. Empirical knowledge is necessary to produce appropriate questions, so machine learning is introduced to acquire knowledge from existing questions. To generate the questions from texts automatically, the system (1) extracts appropriate sentences for questions from texts based on Preference Learning, (2) estimates a blank part based on Conditional Random Field, and (3) generates distracters based on statistical patterns of existing questions. Experimental results show our method is workable for selecting appropriate sentences and blank part. Moreover, our method is appropriate to generate the available distracters, especially for the sentence that does not contain the proper noun. https://doi.org/10.34105/j.kmel.2010.02.016", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.34105/j.kmel.2010.02.016", "venue": null, "journal": "Knowledge Management & E-Learning: An International Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "150749837", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1973351", "7506864", "60553474", "157638901", "6249291", "277918", "173900", "1845735", "5882669"], "inbound_citations": ["10920633", "45333334", "70335228", "201114900", "58937305", "14182644", "199372034", "3603773", "208206734", "64506808", "67900564", "3247715", "42511758", "59479483", "53293668", "17781199", "29837208", "9349036", "3387353", "215321554", "52333715", "17389217"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15482954"}

It has been observed that the increase in classification accuracy for the proposed method is highly significant for dengue gene expression datasets when compared with benchmark algorithms and the standard results.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-76348-4_50", "venue": "ISDA", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2791592529", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4893162"}

Recently, lazy learning, similar to a successful idea from satisfiability modulo theories solvers, has been shown to be an effective means of incorporating constraint learning into a solver. Although a powerful technique to reduce search in some circumstances, lazy learning introduces a substantial overhead, which can outweigh its benefits. Hence, it is desirable to know beforehand whether or not it is expected to be useful. We approach this problem using machine learning (ML). We show that, in the context of a large benchmark set, standard ML approaches can be used to learn a simple, cheap classifier which performs well in identifying instances on which lazy learning should or should not be used. Furthermore, we demonstrate significant performance improvements of a system using our classifier and the lazy learning and standard constraint solvers over a standard solver.

In this thesis, I describe two computational approaches developed to analyze the image data from two different RNAi screens. Firstly, I developed an alternative approach to detect host factors (human proteins) that support virus growth and replication of cells infected with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). To identify the human proteins that are crucial for the efficiency of viral infection, several RNAi experiments of viral-infected cells have been conducted. However, the target lists from different laboratories have shown only little overlap. This inconsistency might be caused not only by experimental discrepancies, but also by not fully explored possibilities of the data analysis. Observing only viral intensity readouts from the experiments might be insufficient. In this project, I describe our computational development as a new alternative approach to improve the reliability for the host factor identification. Our approach is based on characterizing the clustering of infected cells. The idea is that viral infection is spread by cell-cell contacts, or at least advantaged by the vicinity of cells. Therefore, clustering of the HCV infected cells is observed during spreading of the infection. We developed a clustering detection method basing on a distance-based point pattern analysis (K-function) to identify knockdown genes in which the clusters of HCV infected cells were reduced. The approach could significantly separate between positive and negative controls and found good correlations between the clustering score and intensity readouts from the experimental screens. In comparison to another clustering algorithm, the K-function method was superior to Quadrat analysis method. Statistical normalization approaches were exploited to identify protein targets from our clustering-based approach and the experimental screens. Integrating results from our clustering method, intensity readout analysis and secondary screen, we finally identified five promising host factors that are suitable candidate targets for drug therapy. Secondly, a machine learning based approach was developed to characterize protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in a signaling network. The characterization of each PPI is fundamental to our understanding of the complex signaling system of a human cell. Experiments for PPI identification, such as yeast two-hybrid and FRET analysis, are resource-intensive, and, therefore, computational approaches for analysing large-scale RNAi knockdown screens have become an important pursuit of inferring the functional similarities from the phenotypic similarities of the down-regulated proteins. However, these methods did not provide a more detailed characterization of the PPIs. In this project, I developed a new computational approach that is based on a machine learning technique which employs the mitotic phenotypes of an RNAi screen. It enables the identification of the nature of a PPI, i.e., if it is of rather activating or inhibiting nature. We established a systematic classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that was based on the phenotypic descriptors and used it to classify the interactions that activate or inhibit signal transduction. The machines yielded promising results with good performance when integrating different sets of published descriptors and our own developed descriptors calculated from fractions of specific phenotypes, linear classification of phenotypes, and phenotypic distance to distinct proteins. A comprehensive model generated from the machines was used for further predictions. We investigated the nature of pairs of interacting proteins and generated a consistency score that enhanced the precisions of the classification results. We predicted the activating/inhibiting nature for 214 PPIs with high confidence in signaling pathways and enabled to identify a new subgroup of chemokine receptors. These findings might facilitate an enhanced understanding of the cellular mechanisms during inflammation and immunologic responses. In summary, two computational approaches were developed to analyze the image data of the different RNAi screens: 1) a clustering-based approach was used to identify the host factors that are crucial for HCV infection; and 2) a machine learning-based approach with various descriptors was employed to characterize PPI activities. The results from the host factor analysis revealed novel target proteins that are involved in the spread of the HCV. In addition, the results of the characterization of the PPIs lead to a better understanding of the signaling pathways. The two large-scale RNAi data were successfully analyzed by our established approaches to obtain new insights into virus biology and cellular signaling.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.11588/heidok.00013845", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2600264072", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:89764178"}

Heat damage directly degrades the quality of processing products and greatly reduces the edible value of soybeans. Rapid and nondestructive techniques for assessing the quality of imported soybeans are in demand. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology was used to distinguish sound and heat-damaged soybeans. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Various preprocessing methods were implemented to original spectra to test their effectiveness in enhancing model performance. To solve the problem in accuracy, efficiency and model interpretability caused by high-dimensional HSI data, three waveband selection algorithms dependency measure (DM-NRS), mutual information (MI-NRS) and variable precision (VP-NRS) based on neighborhood rough set (NRS) theory were proposed to identify waveband subsets with optimal distinguishing ability. The effectiveness of preprocessing methods and waveband selection algorithms were validated by establishing two kinds of models of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Random Forest (RF). In addition to classification accuracy, the robustness of waveband selection algorithms was studied. The results demonstrated that the model of Savitzky-Golay smoothing (SG) preprocessing method combined with the MI-NRS waveband selection algorithm and the ELM classifier achieved the best classification and robustness results. Classification accuracy reached 99.98% when using only two optimal wavebands, and reached 100% when using more than four optimal wavebands. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The results prove that the HSI technology is an accurate, effective and nondestructive technique for classifying sound and heat-damaged soybeans.

Perfect storage means that all memories are stored stably, and there are no spurious memories. Perfect storage is achieved at the cost of creating additional units, as needed, to prevent spurious memories. To keep the number of additional units created small, a sophisticated storage rule, employing backtracking, is presented. We extend our perfect storage results on Q-state vectors to arbitrary sets. We also show that collections of sets satisfying a certain condition are stored perfectly without creating a single additional unit. Finally, we conduct three case studies with this model: storing 3-bit vectors, storing the Jets and Sharks database, and storing the Room Schemata database. In all three cases, the network is able to store all memories perfectly, while creating only a few additional units. The results of the second and third cases are compared with those of PDP models on the same data sets.", "year": 1996, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/0165-0114(95)00257-X", "venue": "Fuzzy Sets Syst.", "journal": "Fuzzy Sets Syst.", "mag_id": "2046230594", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:40256307"}

Inductive Logic Programming provides an interesting alternative, particularly for learning from structured examples whose parts, each with its own attributes, are related to each other by means of first-order predicates. Several subsets of first-order logic (FOL) with different expressive power have been proposed in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). The challenge lies in the fact that the more expressive the subset of FOL the learner works with, the more critical the dimensionality of the learning task. The Datalog language is expressive enough to represent realistic learning problems when data is given directly in a relational database, making it a suitable tool for data mining. Consequently, it is important to elaborate techniques that will dynamically decrease the dimensionality of learning tasks expressed in Datalog, just as Feature Subset Selection (FSS) techniques do it in attribute-value learning. The idea of re-using these techniques in ILP runs immediately into a problem as ILP examples have variable size and do not share the same set of literals. We propose here the first paradigm that brings Feature Subset Selection to the level of ILP, in languages at least as expressive as Datalog. The main idea is to first perform a change of representation, which approximates the original relational problem by a multi-instance problem. The representation obtained as the result is suitable for FSS techniques which we adapted from attribute-value learning by taking into account some of the characteristics of the data due to the change of representation. We present the simple FSS proposed for the task, the requisite change of representation, and the entire method combining those two algorithms. The method acts as a filter, preprocessing the relational data, prior to the model building, which outputs relational examples with empirically relevant literals.
