Geographic object based image analysis (GEOBIA) emerged as a solution to partition remote sensing imagery or digital elevation models into homogeneous image objects, based on image segmentation. This study proposes an object-based methodology, for detailed delineation and classification of soil types, using digital maps of topography and vegetation as soil covariates, based on Random forests classifier. For further assessing the object-based method we compared its results with the results of pixel-based classification, using the same classifier. We used eighteen digital elevation model derivatives and five remote sensing indices, related to vegetation cover and soil. Using 171 soil profiles with associated values of environmental variables, Random forests (RF) method was applied to identify the most important soil type predictors for use in the segmentation process. The stack of raster-geodatasets corresponding to the selected predictors was segmented with multi-resolution segmentation algorithm resulting in homogeneous objects related to soil types. These objects were further classified as soil types using the same method, RF. Also we conducted a pixel-based classification, using the same classifier and the same soil samples. Resulting maps were assessed in terms of their accuracy using 30% of the soil profiles for validation. The main result of this study shows that GEOBIA is a valid and beneficial method for soil type mapping, leading to improvements over the pixel-based approach. The optimized object-based soil map has an overall accuracy of 58% being 10% higher than the optimized pixel-based map.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S1002-0160(17)60377-1", "venue": null, "journal": "Pedosphere", "mag_id": "2743743455", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:104232630"}

At the heart of our contribution is an algorithm which transforms raw sensor data into a 'sifted' representation which minimizes exposure of user defined private attributes while maximally exposing application-requested public attributes. We envision multiple applications using the same platform, and requesting access to public attributes explicitly not known at the time of the platform creation. Support for future-defined public attributes, while still preserving the defined privacy of the private attributes, is a central challenge that we tackle. To evaluate our approach, we apply SensorSift to the PubFig dataset of celebrity face images, and study how well we can simultaneously hide and reveal various policy combinations of face attributes using machine classifiers. We find that as long as the public and private attributes are not significantly correlated, it is possible to generate a sifting transformation which reduces private attribute inferences to random guessing while maximally retaining classifier accuracy of public attributes relative to raw data (average PubLoss = .053 and PrivLoss = .075, see Figure 4). In addition, our sifting transformations led to consistent classification performance when evaluated using a set of five modern machine learning methods (linear SVM, kNearest Neighbors, Random Forests, kernel SVM, and Neural Nets).", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2420950.2420975", "venue": "ACSAC '12", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2169248685", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["36477899", "14257839", "6460436", "947660", "9648954", "945967", "3136364", "28040141", "553916", "1813467", "14461429", "14293030", "12256213"], "inbound_citations": ["30061878", "37414808", "207721825", "7971428", "198972653", "99500", "17953649", "16168917", "9090373", "15910815", "5638885", "14835886", "52271570"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7224726"}

The identification of visual cues in facial images has been widely explored in the broad area of computer vision. However theoretical analyses are often not transformed into widespread assistive Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems, due to factors such as inconsistent robustness, low efficiency, large computational expense or strong dependence on complex hardware. We present a novel gender recognition algorithm, a modular eye centre localisation approach and a gaze gesture recognition method, aiming to escalate the intelligence, adaptability and interactivity of HCI systems by combining demographic data (gender) and behavioural data (gaze) to enable development of a range of real-world assistive-technology applications.The gender recognition algorithm utilises Fisher Vectors as facial features which are encoded from low-level local features in facial images. We experimented with four types of low-level features: greyscale values, Local Binary Patterns (LBP), LBP histograms and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). The corresponding Fisher Vectors were classified using a linear Support Vector Machine. The algorithm has been tested on the FERET database, the LFW database and the FRGCv2 database, yielding 97.7%, 92.5% and 96.7% accuracy respectively.The eye centre localisation algorithm has a modular approach, following a coarse-to-fine, global-to-regional scheme and utilising isophote and gradient features. A Selective Oriented Gradient filter has been specifically designed to detect and remove strong gradients from eyebrows, eye corners and self-shadows (which sabotage most eye centre localisation methods). The trajectories of the eye centres are then defined as gaze gestures for active HCI. The eye centre localisation algorithm has been compared with 10 other state-of-the-art algorithms with similar functionality and has outperformed them in terms of accuracy while maintaining excellent real-time performance.The above methods have been employed for development of a data recovery system that can be employed for implementation of advanced assistive technology tools.

Following this latter direction, in this paper, we propose an approach that is able not only to read the mind, but also to decode and visualize human thoughts. More specifically, we analyze brain activity, recorded by an ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG), of a subject while thinking about a digit, character or an object and synthesize visually the thought item. To accomplish this, we leverage the recent progress of adversarial learning by devising a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which takes, as input, encoded EEG signals and generates corresponding images. In addition, since collecting large EEG signals in not trivial, our GAN model allows for learning distributions with limited training data. Performance analysis carried out on three different datasets -- brain signals of multiple subjects thinking digits, characters, and objects -- show that our approach is able to effectively generate images from thoughts of a person.

Unlike naturally occurring sinkholes, human-induced ones in urban areas are typically due to groundwater disturbances and leaks of water and sewage caused by large-scale construction. Although many sinkhole detection methods have been developed, it is still difficult to predict sinkholes that occur in depth areas. In addition, conventional methods are inappropriate for scanning a large area because of their high cost. Therefore, this paper uses a drone combined with a thermal far-infrared (FIR) camera to detect potential sinkholes over a large area based on computer vision and pattern classification techniques. To make a standard dataset, we dug eight holes of depths 0.5\u20132 m in increments of 0.5 m and with a maximum width of 1 m. We filmed these using the drone-based FIR camera at a height of 50 m. We first detect candidate regions by analysing cold spots in the thermal images based on the fact that a sinkhole typically has a lower thermal energy than its background. Then, these regions are classified into sinkhole and non-sinkhole classes using a pattern classifier. In this study, we ensemble the classification results based on a light convolutional neural network (CNN) and those based on a Boosted Random Forest (BRF) with handcrafted features. We apply the proposed ensemble method successfully to sinkhole data for various sizes and depths in different environments, and prove that the CNN ensemble and the BRF one with handcrafted features are better at detecting sinkholes than other classifiers or standalone CNN.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.infrared.2016.08.009", "venue": null, "journal": "Infrared Physics & Technology", "mag_id": "2513674286", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210987066", "197551034", "203566555", "54914934", "59552151", "55615696", "201621464", "134418585", "189974410", "207951675", "53611172"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125635985"}

Recent research has shown that such problems can be approached by learning a natural motion manifold using deep learning to address the shortcomings of traditional data-driven approaches. However, previous methods can be sub-optimal for two reasons. First, the skeletal information has not been fully utilized for feature extraction. Unlike images, it is difficult to define spatial proximity in skeletal motions in the way that deep networks can be applied. Second, motion is time-series data with strong multi-modal temporal correlations. A frame could be followed by several candidate frames leading to different motions; long-range dependencies exist where a number of frames in the beginning correlate to a number of frames later. Ineffective modeling would either under-estimate the multi-modality and variance, resulting in featureless mean motion or over-estimate them resulting in jittery motions. In this paper, we propose a new deep network to tackle these challenges by creating a natural motion manifold that is versatile for many applications. The network has a new spatial component for feature extraction. It is also equipped with a new batch prediction model that predicts a large number of frames at once, such that long-term temporally-based objective functions can be employed to correctly learn the motion multi-modality and variances. With our system, long-duration motions can be predicted/synthesized using an open-loop setup where the motion retains the dynamics accurately. It can also be used for denoising corrupted motions and synthesizing new motions with given control signals. We demonstrate that our system can create superior results comparing to existing work in multiple applications.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1908.07214", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31443030", "doi": "10.1109/TVCG.2019.2936810", "venue": "IEEE Transaction on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 2019", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2969225566,2969416295", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["18149328", "61430723", "14962437", "9531590", "7261259", "128024", "37437102", "14104669", "16583122", "300390", "6080095", "1631735", "37054308", "15523181", "2899068", "60954886", "8708348", "14124193", "6712034", "195908774", "3332126", "645845", "8040013", "5736847", "8930176", "54103335", "5634118", "52865362", "61968097", "14036983", "4333408", "1798119", "6450218", "1915014", "8815057", "7961699", "11699847", "6844431", "5808102", "5273326", "7365802", "16389007", "4244548", "13914587", "5201925", "8421376"], "inbound_citations": ["214784062"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201106149"}

It also provides a solution for processing large volumes of data automatically. Work has been done in recognizing handwritten characters in many languages like Chinese, Arabic, Devnagari, Urdu and English. The work presented in this thesis, focuses on the problem of recognition of isolated handwritten characters in Gurmukhi script. The whole process consists of two stages. The first, feature extraction stage analyzes the set of isolated characters and selects a set of features that can be used to uniquely identify characters. The performance of recognition system depends heavily on what features are being used. The selection of stable and representative set of features is the heart of recognition system. The feature extraction method Zoning, is used for extracting features of the character under consideration in this problem. In Zoning method, the frame containing the character is divided into several overlapping or non-overlapping zones and the densities of object pixels in each zone are calculated. Densities are used to form a representation. The final, classification stage is the main decision making stage of the recognition system. It uses features extracted in the feature extraction stage to identify the character. K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine are the two classifiers used for identifying the character in the problem. In k-nearest classification method, the Euclidean distance between the test point and all the reference points is calculated in order to find K nearest neighbors, and then the obtained distances are ranked in ascending order and the reference points corresponding to the k smallest Euclidean distances are taken. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is learning machine with very good generalization ability. SVM implements the Structural Risk Minimization Principal which seeks to minimize an upper bound of the generalization error. An SVM classifier discriminates two classes of feature vectors by generating hyper-surfaces in the feature space, which are \"optimal\" in a specific sense that is the hyper-surface obtained by the SVM optimization is guaranteed to have the maximum distance to the \"nearest\u201d support vectors. SVM operate on kernel evaluations of the feature vectors.

A common approach is to use stand-alone Information Extraction (IE) techniques to identify and label entities within blocks of text; the resulting entities are then imported into a standard database and processed using relational queries. This two-part approach, however, suffers from two main drawbacks. First, IE is inherently probabilistic, but traditional query processing does not properly handle probabilistic data, resulting in reduced answer quality. Second, performance inefficiencies arise due to the separation of IE from query processing. In this paper, we address these two problems by building on an in-database implementation of a leading IE model---Conditional Random Fields using the Viterbi inference algorithm. We develop two different query approaches on top of this implementation. The first uses deterministic queries over maximum-likelihood extractions, with optimizations to push the relational operators into the Viterbi algorithm. The second extends the Viterbi algorithm to produce a set of possible extraction \"worlds\", from which we compute top-k probabilistic query answers.

However, 90% of the European and North-American river floodplains are in a degraded state. The functions of floodplains are strongly determined by land cover and they often compete for space in narrowed floodplains. Integrated river management (IRM) tries to take care of floodplains in such way that land cover is optimized for multiple functions. For IRM, monitoring is essential to capture the dynamics, to evaluate changes, and to document the state of floodplains over time. The main objective of this thesis was to establish remote-sensing methods for the monitoring of floodplain land cover over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Several remote-sensing based solutions have been developed for the monitoring of land-cover dynamics in river floodplains and tested in floodplains of the lower Rhine. The phenological change of floodplain vegetation over the course of one year was studied using temporal profiles of its height and greenness. Using multitemporal UAV images, vegetation height was determined with an accuracy similar to much more expensive airborne LiDAR data. Multitemporal elevation models yielded meaningful profiles of greenness and vegetation height over time, which enabled discriminating the different land-cover types. The same dataset combined with a powerful machine learning model (Random Forest) yielded unprecedented high classification accuracies for floodplain vegetation (> 90%), even for similar vegetation types such as grassland and herbaceous vegetation. This method is a practical and highly accurate solution for monitoring areas of a few square kilometres. For large-scale monitoring of floodplains, the same method is recommended, but with data from airborne platforms covering larger extents. Land-cover change over the course of five years was studied for a 100-km river section using satellite images. Using an object-based approach, a sequential deviation of a land-cover object from its class mean was used to detect land-cover change. For most classes the method was unsuccessful (accuracy 75%. The developed method has important advantages, such as high observation frequency, independence of repeated land-cover classification, and fast processing. At sub-daily frequency, it was assessed how accurate water temperature in a floodplain side channel can be documented from thermal UAV maps. The associated habitat suitability for native and alien fish assemblages was estimated based on the produced temperature maps. Water surface temperatures were mapped four times during a hot summer day with an overall RMSE of 0.53 oC. During the day, temperatures in the side channel increased rapidly to values detrimental for many fish species. The study showed that thermal imagery from UAVs is an efficient and accurate information source to monitor spatiotemporal patterns of thermal habitat suitability. The presently available range of spaceborne and airborne platforms and sensors offers great opportunities to collect information on land-cover change across a range of spatial and temporal scales.

Despite the inherently subjective nature of many of the decisions associated with this process, an expert radiologist is able to perform this task with a significant degree of precision and accuracy. However, in the effort to deliver more effective treatment, clinicians are continuously seeking for greater accuracy in the pathological characterization of brain tissues. ::: The aim of the present thesis was to design, implement, and evaluate a software classification system for discriminating between different brain tumor types on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), employing textural and spectroscopic features. ::: The clinical material consisted of sixty seven T1-weighted post-contrast MR brain images (21 metastases, 19 meningiomas, and 27 gliomas), obtained from patients with verified and untreated intracranial tumors. Thirty-six 2-dimensional textural features (2D), from the image histogram and the co-occurrence and run-length matrices, were extracted from each one of 67 MR-images. Similarly, an equal number of 3-dimensional textural features (3D) were also calculated in the attempt to maximize classification performances. Finally, MR-spectroscopy features were also incorporated for improving classification accuracies. ::: Classification methods employed included i/ a modified Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms, incorporating a non-linear Least Squares Features Transformation (LSFT) into the classifiers and ii/ an ensemble classification scheme employing the LSFT-SVM classifier. The LSFT improved classifiers\u2019 performances, increased class separability, and resulted in dimensionality reduction. For evaluating the performance of the designed classification schemes, evaluations were performed by means of the external cross validation process, which is considered indicative of the generalization performance of the designed classification system to \u2018unseen\u2019 cases. ::: It was found that the LSFT features transformation enhanced the performance of the PNN and SVM algorithms, achieving classification accuracies of 73.48 % in distinguishing metastatic from primary tumors and 88.67% in discriminating gliomas from meningiomas. When volumetric 3-dimensional features were employed, these results improved to 88.18% for discriminating between metastatic and primary tumors and 97.33% for distinguishing gliomas from meningiomas. The textural features employed in the design of the optimum classification scheme were associated primarily with image texture homogeneity. Finally, when MR-spectroscopy features were also incorporated, classification accuracy was boosted up from 95% in discriminating meningiomas from metastasis to 100%. ::: The MR-image features that participated in the optimum feature vector were related to the degree of homogeneity, the amount of randomness and the dispersion of the gray-tone intensity values within the texture of the tumor. These textural characteristics are related to textural parameters that physicians employ in diagnosis and they were proportional to the textural imprint of brain tumors, i.e. gliomas have heterogeneous texture while meningiomas appear to be homogeneous in MR imaging. ::: The MR-spectroscopy feature that participated in the optimum feature vector was the Choline (Cho) / N-Acetyl Aspartate (NAA) metabolite integral ratio. It was found that both meningiomas and metastases are characterized from low concentrations of NAA while meningiomas exhibit higher concentrations of Cho than metastases, which could be attributed to increased synthesis of tumor cell membranes. ::: Finally, the proposed system might be of value as an assisting tool for brain tumor characterization on volumetric MRI series.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1538907325", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31091287", "126832765", "17420107"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109234435"}

Our objective is to accurately predict node labels in a target network by leveraging information from an auxiliary source network. Such a transfer learning framework is potentially useful for broader areas of network classification, where emerging new networks might not have sufficient labeled information because node labels are either costly to obtain or simply not available, whereas many established networks from related domains are available to benefit the learning. In reality, the source and the target networks may not share common nodes or connections, so the major challenge of cross-network transfer learning is to identify knowledge/patterns transferable between networks and potentially useful to support cross-network learning. In this work, we propose to learn common signature subgraphs between networks, and use them as structure features for the target network. By combining the original node content features and the new structure features, we develop an iterative classification algorithm, TrGraph, that utilizes label dependency to jointly classify nodes in the target network.

One approach for doing this is to use the information available about these genes in the biomedical literature. Our goal, based on this approach, is to develop automatic methods for annotation that could supplement the expensive manual annotation processes currently in place. Using a set of Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers we were able to achieve Fscores of 0.48, 0.4 and 0.32 for codes of the molecular function, cellular component and biological process GO hierarchies respectively. We explore thresholding of SVM scores, the relationship of performance to hierarchy level and to the number of positives in the training sets. We find that hierarchy level is important especially for the molecular function and biological process hierarchies. We find that the cellular component hierarchy stands apart from the other two in many respects. This may be due to fundamental differences in link semantics.

A Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to extract features from transient fault currents measured at the source terminal of the network. The extracted features are subsequently fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to detect and classify various types of faults. The method uses the first two cycles of the transient fault current measured at the source terminal after the fault inception. A hybrid technique using DWT and SVM is thus proposed.

The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1609.04802",

This method uses the samples of fault currents for half cycle duration from the inception of fault. The features of fault currents are extracted by first level decomposition of the current samples using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the extracted features are applied as inputs to ELMs for fault section identification, classification and location. The feasibility of the proposed method has been tested on a 400kV, 300km series compensated transmission line for all the ten types of faults using MATLAB simulink. On testing 28,800 fault cases with varying fault resistance, fault inception angle, fault distance, load angle, percentage compensation level and source impedance, the performance of the proposed method has been found to be quite promising.

There are several indices used to differentiate IDA from \u03b2-thalassemia disease. Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a rapid, inexpensive and accessible test for the diagnosis of anemia and is used as a primary test. However, since CBC cannot fully distinguish between IDA and \u03b2-thalassemia, more advanced testing is required. These tests are not available in small centers and are performed on higher-cost devices. Moreover, it is important to differentiate between anemia and \u03b2-thalassemia medically for two reasons (IDA). First, if a patient with \u03b2-Thalassemia is diagnosed with IDA, the patient is given unnecessary iron supplementation as a result of the treatment, which is recommended by the doctor. Secondly, when the patient with \u03b2-thalassemia is diagnosed with IDA, children will have \u03b2-thalassemia patients in marriages. A decision support system to distinguish between \u03b2-Thalassemia and IDA has been developed. Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Learning Machine and Regularized Extreme Learning Machine classification algorithms were used in the proposed system.

In recent years due to the development of numerical tools like artificial intelligence methods, VLE prediction has been find new alternatives. In the present study a novel method called Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) used for predicting bubble/dew point pressures of binary mixtures containing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) + cyclic compounds as function of reduced temperature of the system, critical pressure, acentric factor of the cyclic compound, and CO 2 composition. A 333 binary equilibrium data points of CO 2 and six cyclic compounds within temperature and pressure ranges of 308.15\u2013473.15 K and 0.5\u201327.71 MPa were used to develop the model. Results show that the proposed model is able to predict VLE data for binary systems containing supercritical or near-critical CO 2 /cyclic compounds with an acceptable average absolute relative deviation percent (AARD%) of 3.9381% and the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) value of 0.9980.

Empirically, it has been shown that GANs are able to produce realistic images from as few as 100 latent variables. While numerous studies have focused on modifying the original GAN architecture, few have explored the structure of the input latent variables. In this study we propose placing structure on the input for aiding GANs to converge faster, lead insight into the structure of the underlying data distribution, and produce potentially more creative outputs. To achieve a GAN with such constraints, we call our proposed architecture RemixNet. In RemixNet the latent variables are a result of multiple draws from our existing dataset and \"remixed\" into a new distribution. This idea of combining existing data into new data is inspired from the artistic and musical practice of collage making and remixes. For example, an artist may take an existing recording of music, modify each with a filter and combine to form a new composition.

To assess FoG, current clinical practice mostly employs repeated evaluations over weeks and months based on questionnaires, which may not accurately map the severity of this symptom. The use of a non-invasive system to monitor the activities of daily living (ADL) and the PD symptoms experienced by patients throughout the day could provide a more accurate and objective evaluation of FoG in order to better understand the evolution of the disease and allow for a more informed decision-making process in making adjustments to the patient\u2019s treatment plan. This paper presents a new algorithm to detect FoG with a machine learning approach based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a single tri-axial accelerometer worn at the waist. The method is evaluated through the acceleration signals in an outpatient setting gathered from 21 PD patients at their home and evaluated under two different conditions: first, a generic model is tested by using a leave-one-out approach and, second, a personalised model that also uses part of the dataset from each patient. Results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of the personalised model compared to the generic model, showing enhancement in the specificity and sensitivity geometric mean (GM) of 7.2%.

CD issue frequently appears in Online Supervised Learning environments in which data trends change over time.

Accurate natural gas price forecasting and the direction of price changes are paramount since these forecasts are used in commodity trading, electricity production planning and regulatory decision making, covering both the supply and demand side of natural gas market. This paper presents the results of short-term forecasting of US Henry Hub spot gas prices based on the strategic seasonality-adjusted support vector regression machines (SSA-SVR). Several improvements to the forecasting method based on SVR are introduced. The improvements we propose are made by taking into account that the successfulness of any method (including the SVR) to forecast natural gas prices depends on the available data. An additional objective of the proposed approach is to reduce the human input in the building of the forecasting model. The proposed use of FS algorithms for automatic model input selection as well as the use of the global optimization PSwarm method to optimize the SVR hyper parameters further reduces the human input. We generate the inputs of the model in such a way that it enables us to capture the seasonal effects. Adding the binary variables, such as days in a week and months in a year, as inputs often enhances the model accuracy. Furthermore, the use of FS algorithm improves the forecasting accuracy compared to expert based input selection. The forecasting results of 1- day ahead prices show a clear dominance of Steepwise FS algorithm both in terms of RMSE and MAPE statistics. In the case where we allowed ten variables in the FS algorithm Steepwise FS and GA come to a tie. In the five variable FS case there is only a marginal improvement of RMSE and MAPE statistics obtained by adding days, months and temperatures. We can conclude that there is no real gain in adding additional variables to the basic set of variables. In the ten variable FS case there is a more noticeable gain in accuracy especially in adding days in a week and temperatures variables to the basic set. The forecasting results for 1-week ahead gas prices display greater difference among the analyzed FS algorithms but again Steepwise FS clearly dominates over the competition in both the RMSE and MAPE categories. The superiority of Steepwise FS is especially pronounced in the case when ten variable FS is considered. Unlike the 1-day ahead forecasts there is no gain in adding months to the basic set of variables, since the addition worsens the RMSE and MAPE statistics. Our results point to the conclusion that the SVR results reported in the literature often over exaggerate the successfulness of these models since we record only marginal improvements over a classical, simplistic approach to short term asset price forecasting.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2734846160", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115979877"}

They also show impairments in measures of emotional functioning parallel to schizophrenia. Whilst previous studies have revealed altered brain activation in patients with schizophrenia during emotional processing, it is unclear whether these alterations are also expressed in individuals with high PP. Here we used Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform multivariate pattern classification based on brain activation during emotional processing in 20 individuals with high PP and 20 comparison subjects (low PP). In addition, we performed a standard univariate analysis based on the General Linear Model (GLM) on the same data for comparison. The experimental task involved passively viewing negative and neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). SVM allowed classification of the two groups with statistically significant accuracy (p = 0.017) and identified group differences within an emotional circuitry including the amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, the standard univariate analysis did not detect any significant between-group differences. Our results reveal a distributed and subtle set of alterations in brain function within the emotional circuitry of individuals with high PP, providing neurobiological support for the notion of dysfunctional emotional circuitry in this group. In addition, these alterations are best detected using a multivariate approach rather than standard univariate methods. Further application of this approach may aid in characterising people at clinical and genetic risk of developing psychosis.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "22036677", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.048", "venue": "NeuroImage", "journal": "NeuroImage", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2165938937", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1597302", "19992423", "1813749", "14065048", "38211681", "10469721", "21342115", "207165665", "35327057", "16451230", "7236848", "10052158", "4804934", "3352415", "12773609", "30912026", "20272554", "19974014", "117574115", "42823380", "45775856", "33702639", "26060880", "9283911", "18111250", "19297821", "14967150", "628111", "37330311", "13253903", "25763965", "27438606", "1114153", "8401991", "204372206", "38008421", "9055409", "12780082", "13088135", "11841532", "210222146", "14914956", "25525410", "44698291", "25074912", "33546609", "3332444", "35887920", "26494289", "2025311", "17695833", "7150871", "6328301", "15418204", "1073403", "903508", "205846401", "9452803", "5877906", "432027", "8166749", "30550021", "10980762", "23017758", "145175689", "44786782", "146877352", "29696877", "1937205", "11992363", "16647636", "7138354", "19127754", "35486124", "22522434", "1721002", "31342026", "12738106"], "inbound_citations": ["2394357", "43927280", "16596955", "12026304", "11703045", "203661153", "8930212", "26214753", "3942217", "14518100", "17846357", "207188645", "215687410", "3799718", "52962071", "53834212", "214957018", "3030380", "39809377", "21162917", "211081509", "23163266", "215632424"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13637446"}

Whereas using Gaussian filtering in the pre-processing stage along with normalization and standardizing steps better recall for the model was obtained as compared to other pre-processing tasks. In addition to that, this paper also utilizes the planetary characteristics related to the exoplanets to assess the probability of an exoplanet being habitable based on the characteristics of an Exoplanet using Naive Bayes algorithm. The probabilities obtained revealed some interesting insights about the habitability which have been discussed in the evaluation section.

This paper addresses the problem of band selection for hyperspectral remote sensing image and SVM parameter optimization. First, we present a thorough experime- ntal study to show the superiority of the generalization capability of the support vector machine (SVM) approach in the hyperspec- tral classification of remote sensing image. Second, we propose an evolutionary classification system based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve the generalization performance of the SVM classifier. For this purpose, we have optimized the SVM classifier design by searching for the best value of the parameters that tune its discriminant function, and upstream by looking for the best subset of features that feed the classifier. The experiments are conducted on the basis of AVIRIS 92AV3C dataset. The obtained results clearly confirm the superiority of the SVM approach as compared to traditional classifiers, and suggest that further substantial improvements in terms of classification accuracy can be achieved by the proposed PSO- SVM classification system. important for a specific task. Some of them may be redundant or even irrelevant. Better performance may be achieved by discarding some features. In other circumstances, the dimensionality of input space may be decreased to save some computation effort, although this may slightly lower classification accuracy. Therefore, the classification process must be fast and accurate, using the smallest number of features. This objective can be achieved using feature selection. Feature selection strategies are often implied to explore the effect of irrelevant attributes on the performance of classifier systems. This study attempts to increase the classification accuracy rate by employing an approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) in SVM. This novel approach is termed PSO-SVM. The developed PSO-SVM approach not only tunes the parameter values of SVM, but also identifies a subset of features for specific problems, maximizing the classification accuracy rate of SVM. This makes the optimal separating hyper-plane obtainable in both linear and non-linear classification problems.

The objective of this study is to monitor crop phenology using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetric decompositions and a random forest algorithm applied to a multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 dataset, acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Validation Experiment 2016 in Manitoba (SMAPVEX16-MB). The model-based and eigen-based polarimetric parameters are used to separate the vegetation and soil scattering contributions in the total radar signal. As the crop morphological shape and structure vary with phenological growth, our study assumes that the polarimetric parameters related to the volume scattering mechanism have the potential to track the crop phenology. The sensitivity of the polarimetric parameters to the ground identified crop phenology is analyzed for different crop types. For canola, a single polarimetric parameter is sufficient to characterize the crop phenology, due to the high volume scattering power and large temporal dynamic. For corn, soybean and wheat, combinations of multiple polarimetric parameters are required. For each crop type, the Random Forest algorithm trained using 60% of the data is used to retrieve the crop phenology. Performances are compared to Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine Regression and k-Nearest neighborhood algorithms.

Furthermore, it has been challenging to identify an individual biomarker, be it biological or physiological to identify an exacerbation, although identification of exacerbation phenotypes improves this. Most, if not all, patients report increase in symptoms during an exacerbation, measured using the visual analogue scale, performed on a 100 mm line ranging from no symptoms to worst ever symptoms. However, it is unclear if there is a linear relationship with the increase in VAS symptoms and the onset of an exacerbation. In this study, we seek to mathematically model relationships with the VAS and symptoms of dyspnoea, sputum production, sputum purulence and cough in patients with COPD at stable state and during exacerbations. Methods Patients with COPD with completed assessments of VAS during both stable state and exacerbations were studied. An exacerbation was defined according to healthcare utilisation and increased symptoms. Classifier algorithms (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis software \u00ae) were run to predict the value of an exacerbation and multiple cross validation was used to assess the predictive accuracy. The Naive Bayes (based on conditional probability), Multi-layer Perceptron (neural networks), J48 (decision tree) and Random Forest classifier were each run to model relationships. Results Data from 149 COPD subjects was collected, with 180 instances of an exacerbation recorded. The mean (SD) VAS (mm) for cough, dyspnoea, sputum production and purulence at baseline was 35 (27), 47 (27), 33 (27) and 28 (25) respectively. At exacerbation there was a significant increase (p The J48 classifier decision tree had the most predictive accuracy (80%) of identifying an exacerbation (Figure 1), based on VAS and score.

The FCNN-SVM is proposed as a viable alternative to the standard SVM in applications where a fast response time is a fundamental requirement.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "20071255", "doi": "10.1109/TNN.2009.2039227", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2155415049", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["14414560", "7374264", "207165665", "961425", "14727192", "206731103", "59916112", "14502194", "19848531", "14152802", "209099422", "5667586", "577580", "196129709", "35730151", "7138354", "9016542"], "inbound_citations": ["7279811", "43124067", "40958029", "11698384", "27363083", "587606", "16430682", "1178560", "20504839", "122367646", "15841346", "208612614", "70348302", "12186658", "38703692", "42849217", "14418819", "14674817", "18796902", "207831635"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16334375"}

A good semantic understanding of the feature space is critical in providing the domain specific understanding for setting up good distance functions. Unfortunately, not all domains have feature representations which are equally interpretable. For example, in some domains such as text, the semantics of the feature representation are clear, as a result of which it is easy for a domain expert to set up distance functions for specific kinds of semantics. In the case of image data, the features are semantically harder to interpret, and it is harder to set up distance functions, especially for particular semantic criteria.

Recent applications in text and speech processing and computational biology require however the analysis of variable-length sequences and more generally weighted automata. An approach widely used in statistical learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is that of kernel methods, due to their computational efficiency in high-dimensional feature spaces. We introduce a general family of kernels based on weighted transducers or rational relations, rational kernels , that extend kernel methods to the analysis of variable-length sequences or more generally weighted automata. We show that rational kernels can be computed efficiently using a general algorithm of composition of weighted transducers and a general single-source shortest-distance algorithm. Not all rational kernels are positive definite and symmetric (PDS), or equivalently verify the Mercer condition, a condition that guarantees the convergence of training for discriminant classification algorithms such as SVMs. We present several theoretical results related to PDS rational kernels. We show that under some general conditions these kernels are closed under sum, product, or Kleene-closure and give a general method for constructing a PDS rational kernel from an arbitrary transducer defined on some non-idempotent semirings. We give the proof of several characterization results that can be used to guide the design of PDS rational kernels. We also show that some commonly used string kernels or similarity measures such as the edit-distance, the convolution kernels of Haussler, and some string kernels used in the context of computational biology are specific instances of rational kernels. Our results include the proof that the edit-distance over a non-trivial alphabet is not negative definite, which, to the best of our knowledge, was never stated or proved before. Rational kernels can be combined with SVMs to form efficient and powerful techniques for a variety of classification tasks in text and speech processing, or computational biology. We describe examples of general families of PDS rational kernels that are useful in many of these applications and report the result of our experiments illustrating the use of rational kernels in several difficult large-vocabulary spoken-dialog classification tasks based on deployed spoken-dialog systems. Our results show that rational kernels are easy to design and implement and lead to substantial improvements of the classification accuracy.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "J.

Color name as a descriptor finds it\u2019s applications in many real-world tasks such as Color Blind assistance, image retrieval and scene understanding.

The proposed systems for color naming automates the process and avoids human labelling. These methods are based on superpixels in the CIELAB color space. We trained Random Forests classifier with color-chip dataset for pixel-wise color naming and for image-wise color naming it is trained on weakly color labelled image dataset.

This allows identifying the limit-state function that separates the failure domain from the safe domain. In practice, the TH model response is affected by uncertainties (both epistemic and aleatory), which make the limit-state function and the failure domain probabilistic. The present paper sets forth an innovative approach to identify the failure domain together with the safest plant operating conditions. The approach relies on the use of Reduced Order Models (ROMs) and K-D Tree. The model failure boundary is approximated by Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and, then, projected onto the space of the controllable variables (i.e., the model inputs that can be manipulated by the plant operator, such as reactor control-rods position, feed-water flow-rate through the plant primary loops, accumulator water temperature and pressure, repair times, etc.). The farthest point from the failure boundary is, then, computed by means of a K-D Tree-based nearest neighbor algorithm; this point represents the combination of input values corresponding to the safest operating conditions.

It poses great challenges over the proper semantic alignment between vision and linguistic domains and knowledge reasoning to generate persuasive reasoning paths. Existing works either resort to a powerful end-to-end network that cannot produce interpretable reasoning paths or solely explore intra-relationship of visual objects (homogeneous graph) while ignoring the cross-domain semantic alignment among visual concepts and linguistic words. In this paper, we propose a new Heterogeneous Graph Learning (HGL) framework for seamlessly integrating the intra-graph and inter-graph reasoning in order to bridge the vision and language domain. Our HGL consists of a primal vision-to-answer heterogeneous graph (VAHG) module and a dual question-to-answer heterogeneous graph (QAHG) module to interactively refine reasoning paths for semantic agreement. Moreover, our HGL integrates a contextual voting module to exploit a long-range visual context for better global reasoning. Experiments on the large-scale Visual Commonsense Reasoning benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed modules on three tasks (improving 5% accuracy on Q->A, 3.5% on QA->R, 5.8% on Q->AR).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1910.11475", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2970641692,2982073904", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207616048", "3753452", "58727669", "12913776", "17682909", "14675158", "131773797", "47159154", "1448723", "52837841", "52967399", "1690180", "207238980", "67856632", "206594692", "10248021", "67855531", "11328415", "6282691", "70350040", "51969884", "6628106", "3144218", "85529811", "49554331", "3974866", "8701238", "868693", "16227864", "1430801", "49317766", "40027675", "3626819", "26356195", "11923637", "54459095", "207238964", "53735892", "18548166", "9190307", "1055111", "4244142", "53734356"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202785103"}

One drawback of standard DNNs is that they are prone to catastrophic forgetting. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a commonly used technique to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we demonstrate it can indeed help the model to output more discriminative results within old classes. However, it cannot alleviate the problem that the model tends to classify objects into new classes, causing the positive effect of KD to be hidden and limited. We observed that an important factor causing catastrophic forgetting is that the weights in the last fully connected (FC) layer are highly biased in class incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective solution motivated by the aforementioned observations to address catastrophic forgetting. Firstly, we utilize KD to maintain the discrimination within old classes. Then, to further maintain the fairness between old classes and new classes, we propose Weight Aligning (WA) that corrects the biased weights in the FC layer after normal training process. Unlike previous work, WA does not require any extra parameters or a validation set in advance, as it utilizes the information provided by the biased weights themselves.

In this paper, we propose a novel measurement and machine learning mixed approach for real-time multimedia quality control for multicast networks. Most of current adaptive multimedia quality control schemes are based on measurements of available network resources (whether active or passive measurements) or the use of network traffic models and they are reactive in nature. The proposed scheme is based on statistical learning techniques, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), mixed with network measurements to predict packet loss rate in the near future and thus is a pro-active scheme. The prediction scheme triggers the rate control mechanism to pre-adjust the multimedia sending rate before network conditions start deteriorating. We use packet dispersion technique to measure end-to-end queuing delay combined with video display buffer information to train the acquired dataset for prediction in real time.

This paper proposes a novel method for generating this type of representation in infrared images by taking advantage of high-level discriminative Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to feature the extraction framework and the deformation invariant nature of the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) aggregator. Different from existing methods, we delve deep into the convolutional feature maps. We first extract deep activation maps from convolutional layers of a pretrained deep model and replace the last three fully-connected layers with a VLAD pooling layer to generate the representation of an insulator. Then, we train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for binary classification.

Early detection and treatment of colon cancer can significantly improve patient prognosis. Manual identification of polyps by radiologists using CT colonography can be labour intensive due to the increasing size of datasets and is error prone due to the complexity of the anatomical structures. There has been increasing interest in computer aided detection (CAD) systems for detecting polyps using CT colonography. For a typical CAD system two major steps can be identified. In the first step image processing techniques are used to detect potential polyp candidates. Many non-polyps are inevitably found in this process. The second step attempts to discount the non-polyp candidates while maintaining true polyps. In practice this is a challenging task as training data is heavily imbalanced, that is, non-polyps dominate the data. This paper describes how the weighted support vector machine (weighted-SVM) can be used to tackle the problem effectively. The weighted-SVM generalises the traditional SVM by applying different penalties to different classes. This trains the classifier to give favour to the most weighted class (in this case true polyps). In this paper the method was applied to data obtained from the intermediate results from a CAD system, originally applied to 209 cases. The results show that the weighted-SVM can play an important role in CAD algorithms for colorectal polyps.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "18002988", "doi": "10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4353322", "venue": "2007 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "journal": "2007 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2188525698,2012928268", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["37947893", "22670935", "22675211", "43945168", "15800158", "5965163", "16332556", "33354724", "16222365", "15140283", "16268556", "7138354", "14727192", "206787478", "118779721", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["15196187", "15149276", "2424386", "12792003", "21671808", "31567782", "215692954", "21681073", "617020", "21659102", "17606434"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11284867"}

An example of altered and partially restored coastal wetlands is the Danube Delta in Romania. Over time, human intervention has manifested itself in more than one-quarter of the entire Danube surface. This intervention was brutal and has rendered ecosystem restoration very difficult. Studies for rehabilitation/re-vegetation were begun immediately after the Danube Delta was declared a Biosphere Reservation in 1990. Remote sensing offers accurate methods for detecting changes in restored wetlands. Vegetation change detection is a powerful indicator of restoration success. The restoration projects use vegetative cover as an important indicator of restoration success. To follow the evolution of the vegetation cover of the restored areas, images obtained by radar and optical satellites, such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, have been used. The sensitivity of such sensors to the landscape depends on the wavelength of the radar or optical detection system and, for radar data, on polarization. Combining these types of data, which are associated with the density and size of the vegetation, is particularly relevant for the classification of wetland vegetation. In addition, the high temporal acquisition frequencies used by Sentinel-1, which are not sensitive to cloud cover, allow the use of temporal signatures of different land covers. Thus, to better understand the signatures of the different study classes, we analyze the polarimetric and temporal signatures of Sentinel-1 data. In a second phase, we perform classifications based on the Random Forest supervised classification algorithm involving the entire Sentinel-1 time series, proceeding through a Sentinel-2 collection and finally involving combinations of Sentinel-1 and-2 data. The supervised classifier used is the Random Forest algorithm that is available in the OrfeoToolbox (version 5.6) free software. Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that builds upon multiple decision trees and is particularly relevant when combining different types 2 of indicators. The results of this study relate to the use of combinations of data from different satellite sensors (multi-date Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2) to improve the accuracy of recognition and mapping of major vegetation classes in the restoring areas of the Danube Delta. First, the data from each sensor are classified and analyzed. The results obtained in the first step show quite good classification performance for only one Sentinel-2 data (87.5% mean accuracy), in contrast to the very good results obtained using the Sentinel-1 time series (95.7% mean accuracy). The combination of Sentinel-1 time series and optical data from Sentinel-2 improved the performance of the classification (97.1%).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-56179-0_17", "venue": "Coastal Research Library", "journal": "Coastal Research Library", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2737233584", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["85139407", "85065347", "24964196", "82683343", "2484288", "8432440", "52233433", "86352384", "133345015", "81398269", "95342626", "2582283", "17455515", "95900414", "18008349", "128996770", "130281100", "21524428", "128687779", "37499919", "3456308", "2946025", "81683337", "140172816", "128787512", "85693262", "123476171", "85645364", "55444376", "8739945", "83172890", "19831558", "54067749", "55041248", "43387031", "20435313", "83936332", "8251169", "19138432", "8501426", "56438040"], "inbound_citations": ["133931725", "55756704"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:89611024"}

Visual appearances of an object are acquired by a sufficient number of images showing the object under different conditions and in different situations including varying angles of poses, changing illumination, different distances of the object from the camera, and cluttered background. ::: ::: In the present work appearance variations are conditioned only by different object poses and cluttered backgrounds. As a learning method the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used. The classic SVM classifier does not distinguish the background from the object. By changing the view angle the shape of the object silhouette in an image changes. Consequently, the number and the locations of the objects and background vary from view to view. On condition that both, the pose of the object and the background vary, the efficiency of the standard classification methods drops significantly. Furthermore, if the positions and the number of the objects in the image are not given, the complexity of the problem increases. ::: ::: If the training set allows object segmentation, it is reasonable to employ this knowledge in the process of recognition training and reduce the influence of the background as much as possible. Several approaches are possible.

Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research has traditionally focused on how experimentally controlled species richness affects net primary productivity (S\u2192NPP) at small spatial grains. In contrast, the influence of productivity on richness (NPP\u2192S) has been explored at many grains in naturally assembled communities. Mismatches in spatial scale between approaches have fostered debate about the strength and direction of biodiversity-productivity relationships. Here we examine the direction and strength of productivity\u2019s influence on diversity (NPP\u2192S) and of diversity\u2019s influence on productivity (S\u2192NPP), and how this varies across spatial grains using data from North American forests at grains from local (672 m2) to coarse spatial units (median area = 35,677 km2). We assess relationships using structural equation and Random Forest models, while accounting for variation in climate, environmental heterogeneity, management, and forest age. We show that relationships between S and NPP strengthen with spatial grain. Within each grain, S\u2192NPP and NPP\u2192S have similar magnitudes, meaning that processes underlying S\u2192NPP and NPP\u2192S either operate simultaneously, or that one of them is real and the other is an artifact. At all spatial grains, S was one of the weakest predictors of forest productivity, which was largely driven by biomass, temperature, and forest management and age. We conclude that spatial grain mediates relationships between biodiversity and productivity in real-world ecosystems and that results supporting predictions from each approach (NPP\u2192S and S\u2192NPP) serve as an impetus for future studies testing underlying mechanisms. Significance statement The relationships between diversity and productivity are central to efforts explaining global variation of biodiversity and rates of carbon sequestration. However, little is known about the relative importance of biodiversity as the driving force, or as the consequence of ecosystem-level productivity. Our analysis of a comprehensive database of North American forests reveals that biodiversity and productivity can be both cause and effect and that their relationship strengthens with spatial grain. Importantly, we show that environmental context is more important in determining biodiversity and productivity than either biodiversity or productivity alone. Productivity-diversity relationships emerge at multiple spatial grains, which should widen the focus of national and global policy and research to larger spatial grains.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/769232", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2972716878", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203374797"}

Most researchers working in computational linguistics focus on linguistic solutions to their problems.

Borrowing from the field of communication theory, an information theoretic approach to natural language understanding is applied. This is based on the source-channel model of communication. ::: The source-channel model of NLU assumes that the user has a meaning in the domain of the application that he wishes to convey. This meaning is sent through a noisy channel. The observer receives the English sentence as output from the noisy channel. The observer then submits the English sentence to a decoder, which determines the meaning most likely to have generated the English. The decoder uses mathematical models of the channel and the meanings to process the English sentence. Thus, the following problems must be addressed in a source-channel model for NLU: (1) A mathematical model of the noisy-channel must be developed. (2) The parameters of the model must be set, either manually or by an automatic training procedure. (3) A decoder must be built to search through the meaning space for the most likely meaning to have generated the observed English. ::: This dissertation focuses on the first two of these problems. Several mathematical models of the noisy channel are developed. They are trained from a corpus of context independent sentence pairs consisting of both English and the corresponding meaning.

{"paper_id": "69843092", "title": "Assessing edge pixel classification and growing stock volume estimation in forest stands using a machine learning algorithm and Sentinel-2 data", "authors": [{"first": "Enzo", "middle": [], "last": "Zerega", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Sustainable forest management requires accurate and up-to-date baseline data regarding forest structural parameters and the definition of forest stand units. A crucial component in stand characterization is the identification of tree species and to correctly define the stand boundaries. The most common procedure used for this is land cover classification using remote sensing data. However, when classifying forests, misclassification of edge areas can be substantial, yet classification studies often exclude these areas from the accuracy assessment. With the launch of the Sentinel-2 (S2) mission, which provides medium-high spatial resolution satellite imagery, global coverage and high revisit times, new methodologies for defining and estimating stand parameters are being developed. In combination with machine learning algorithms, the use of S2 data to predict forest variables has demonstrated to generate highly accurate results. Random Forest (RF) is one of these algorithms, and has become increasingly popular in environmental studies during the last decade. The combination of the multi-temporal higher resolution S2 images with the ability of the RF algorithm to detect outliers may contribute to improve the classification accuracy of forest edge areas. This study presents a methodology based on a combination of field data and S2 multi-temporal imagery that were analyzed using the RF algorithm in southern Sweden. The aim was to perform a land cover classification to identify forest patches of three tree species (Scots pine, Norway spruce and birch), and to test the inclusion of edge pixels as training data to improve the accuracy at edge areas. For this, a segmented accuracy assessment was proposed, where the accuracy was assessed for interior, intermediate and edge areas, as well as for entire forest patches. The RF algorithm was also used to estimate growing stock volume (GSV), another important forest stand parameter. The results indicate that higher accuracies at edge areas can be obtained when edge pixels are included in the training set. Moreover, the findings describe how different allocation schemes of the training and validation data affect the results. Bands covering the Red Edge, SWIR and a narrow segment of the NIR proved to be beneficial, together with the use of multi-temporal scenes. The GSV estimation yielded inferior results but was able to distinguish the S2 bands most correlated with tree volume. The present study contributes to a better characterization of forest stands and, consequently, to facilitate the generation of forest data required by environmental scientists and the forestry sector.

Although the MT-based approach brings improvement, it assumes the availability of a sentence-level translation system. A GAN-based approach incorporates a language discriminator to learn language-universal feature representations, and consequentially transfer knowledge from the source language. The GAN-based approach rivals the performance of the MT-based approach with fewer linguistic resources. Applying both approaches simultaneously yield the best results.

MRI volumetry with AVS may support the diagnosis of dementias by identifying regional atrophy. Moreover, automatic classifiers using machine learning techniques have recently emerged as promising approaches to assist diagnosis. However, the performance of both AVS and automatic classifiers has been evaluated mostly in the artificial setting of research datasets.OBJECTIVE:Our aim was to evaluate the performance of two AVS and an automatic classifier in the clinical routine condition of a memory clinic.METHODS:We studied 239 patients with cognitive troubles from a single memory center cohort. Using clinical routine T1-weighted MRI, we evaluated the classification performance of: 1) univariate volumetry using two AVS (volBrain and Neuroreader$^{TM}$); 2) Support Vector Machine (SVM) automatic classifier, using either the AVS volumes (SVM-AVS), or whole gray matter (SVM-WGM); 3) reading by two neuroradiologists. The performance measure was the balanced diagnostic accuracy. The reference standard was consensus diagnosis by three neurologists using clinical, biological (cerebrospinal fluid) and imaging data and following international criteria.RESULTS:Univariate AVS volumetry provided only moderate accuracies (46% to 71% with hippocampal volume). The accuracy improved when using SVM-AVS classifier (52% to 85%), becoming close to that of SVM-WGM (52 to 90%). Visual classification by neuroradiologists ranged between SVM-AVS and SVM-WGM.CONCLUSION:In the routine practice of a memory clinic, the use of volumetric measures provided by AVS yields only moderate accuracy. Automatic classifiers can improve accuracy and could be a useful tool to assist diagnosis.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.09260", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32144978", "doi": "10.3233/JAD-190594", "venue": "Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, IOS Press, 2020, pp.1-10", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2767121381", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology", "Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["206160801", "3825161", "7356809", "9303775", "23861631", "13615191", "10135518", "2909582", "13154713", "11088012", "628131", "47011", "13926857", "285128", "1219753", "27160692", "1939828", "5735424", "24727810", "43861843", "14672606", "16777465", "545830", "76345386", "9613770", "37682573", "23919922", "39071403", "2909582", "18240938", "22893397", "12377570"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212622601"}

Abstract. Drainage systems can significantly improve the water management in agricultural fields. However, they may transport contaminants originating from fertilizers and pesticides and threaten ecosystems. Determining the quantity of drainage water is an important factor for constructed wetlands and other drainage mitigation techniques. This study was carried out in Denmark where tile drainage systems are implemented in more than half of the agricultural fields. The first aim of the study was to predict the annual discharge of tile drainage systems using machine-learning methods, which have been highly popular in recent years. The second objective was to assess the importance of the parameters and their impact on the predictions. Data from 53 drainage stations distributed in different regions of Denmark were collected and used for the analysis. The covariates contained 35 parameters including the calculated percolation and geographic variables such as drainage probability, clay content in different depth intervals, and elevation, all extracted from existing national maps. Random Forest and Cubist were selected as predictive models. Both models were trained on the dataset and used to predict yearly drainage discharge. Results highlighted the importance of the cross-validation methods and indicated that both Random Forest and Cubist can perform as predictive models with a low complexity and good correlation between predicted and observed discharge. Covariate importance analysis showed that among all of the used predictors, the percolation and elevation have the largest effect on the prediction of tile drainage discharge. This work opens up for a better understanding of the dynamics of tile drainage discharge and proves that machine-learning techniques can perform as predictive models in this specific concept. The developed models can be used in regard to a national mapping of expected tile drain discharge.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/hess-2019-650", "venue": null, "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions", "mag_id": "3000072164", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213322170"}

In this line of reasoning, Sentiment Analysis can be applied in several contexts to classify the attitude expressed in text samples, for example, movie reviews, sarcasm, among others. A common approach to represent text samples is the use of the Vector Space Model to compute numerical feature vectors consisting of the weight of terms. The most popular term weighting scheme is TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency). It is an Unsupervised Weighting Scheme (UWS) since it does not consider the class information in the weighting of terms. Apart from that, there are Supervised Weighting Schemes (SWS), which consider the class information on term weighting calculation. Several SWS have been recently proposed, demonstrating better results than TF-IDF. In this scenario, this work presents a comparative study on different term weighting schemes and proposes a novel supervised term weighting scheme, named as TF-IDFC-RF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency in Class - Relevance Frequency). The effectiveness of TF-IDFC-RF is validated with SVM (Support Vector Machine) and NB (Naive Bayes) classifiers on four commonly used Sentiment Analysis datasets. TF-IDFC-RF outperforms all other weighting schemes and achieves F1 results of more than 99.9% on all datasets with SVM classifier.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.07193", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3011698949", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["16177937", "18580557", "29551152", "388", "9215625", "195351710", "69844172", "67567", "8455737", "53241924", "6473756", "11079689", "51873494", "145959548", "39374702", "29239220", "182323353", "6688577", "9474856", "566311", "16540675", "35246259", "27023385", "3091", "9220563", "3166032", "10334230", "469886", "3264224", "140963519", "5083193", "140109802", "217537", "16372911"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212725845"}

Accurate wind speed forecasting is vital for the integration of wind energy conversion system into existing electric power grids. The important factor of wind speed forecast is the choice of accurate prediction algorithm. Support Vector Machine Regression Model (SVM-R), the most widely used algorithm for classification and forecasting measures, has shown extraordinary performance in various fields for short-term forecasting. Different SVM kernels including polynomial, linear and Gaussian have been explored. The performance of each kernel function has investigated on real time-series wind speed data for the site located at coastal areas of Sindh, Pakistan. The algorithm converts original training data into a higher dimension using nonlinear mapping. Optimal linear hyper-plane (LHP) is examined for separating data of one class from another one within this new dimension. The trend of root mean square error (RMSE) due to variation in various parameters, i.e., size of training sample, kernel parameters and regularization parameter has been presented.

We previously identified a 62-probe sets signature (NB-hypo) to identify tissue hypoxia in neuroblastoma tumors and showed that NB-hypo stratified neuroblastoma patients in good and poor outcome [1]. It was important to develop a prognostic classifier to cluster patients into risk groups benefiting of defined therapeutic approaches. Novel classification and data discretization approaches can be instrumental for the generation of accurate predictors and robust tools for clinical decision support. We explored the application to gene expression data of Rulex, a novel software suite including the Attribute Driven Incremental Discretization technique for transforming continuous variables into simplified discrete ones and the Logic Learning Machine model for intelligible rule generation.ResultsWe applied Rulex components to the problem of predicting the outcome of neuroblastoma patients on the bases of 62 probe sets NB-hypo gene expression signature. The resulting classifier consisted in 9 rules utilizing mainly two conditions of the relative expression of 11 probe sets. These rules were very effective predictors, as shown in an independent validation set, demonstrating the validity of the LLM algorithm applied to microarray data and patients' classification. The LLM performed as efficiently as Prediction Analysis of Microarray and Support Vector Machine, and outperformed other learning algorithms such as C4.5. Rulex carried out a feature selection by selecting a new signature (NB-hypo-II) of 11 probe sets that turned out to be the most relevant in predicting outcome among the 62 of the NB-hypo signature. Rules are easily interpretable as they involve only few conditions.Furthermore, we demonstrate that the application of a weighted classification associated with the rules improves the classification of poorly represented classes.ConclusionsOur findings provided evidence that the application of Rulex to the expression values of NB-hypo signature created a set of accurate, high quality, consistent and interpretable rules for the prediction of neuroblastoma patients' outcome. We identified the Rulex weighted classification as a flexible tool that can support clinical decisions.

However, strong individual differences make it challenging to develop a generic single-trial ERP classifier that performs well for all subjects. Usually some subject-specific training samples need to be collected in an initial calibration session to customize the classifier. However, if implemented into an actual BCI system, then this calibration process would decrease the utility of the system, potentially decreasing its usability. In this paper we propose a Transfer Learning approach for reducing the amount of subject-specific data in online single-trial ERP classifier calibration, and an Active Transfer Learning approach for offline calibration. By applying these approaches to data from a Visually-Evoked Potential EEG experiment, we demonstrate that they improve the classification performance, given the same number of labeled subject-specific training samples. In other words, these approaches can also attain a desired level of classification accuracy with less labeling effort when compared to a randomly selected training set.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SMC.2014.6974353", "venue": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)", "journal": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2008205547", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["914609", "16902615", "393948", "12073775", "961425", "14491759", "9112273", "1101322", "185481", "61389897", "16952699", "4709079", "17153136", "32397743", "10821551", "740063", "5594021", "61325119", "14016805", "471128", "324600", "8042650", "10547392", "1963651", "18490933", "11695825", "5802280"], "inbound_citations": ["58671731", "31518323", "2702548", "15462619", "116294676", "15531760", "37345961", "52989109", "8415292", "26359756", "18792817", "2709639", "26754495", "10243990", "214858475", "214691982", "54559074", "215448944", "24491823", "15978018", "15529306", "32143103", "202639531", "23259106", "204229051", "52984063", "23703391", "4656041", "85463583", "214885890", "36586506"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:36423320"}

One such major area is singer identification (SID). There has been enormous increase in production of movies and songs in Bollywood industry over the last 50 decades. Surveying this extensive dataset of singers, the paper presents singer identification system for Indian playback singers. Four acoustic features namely\u2014formants, harmonic spectral envelope, vibrato, and timbre\u2014that uniquely describe the singer are extracted from the singing voice segments. Using the combination of these multiple acoustic features, we address the major challenges in SID like the variations in singer\u2019s voice, testing of multilingual songs, and the album effect. Systematic evaluation shows the SID is robust against the variations in singer\u2019s singing style and structure of songs and is effective in identifying the cover songs and singers. The results are investigated on in-house cappella database consisting of 26 singers and 550 songs. By performing dimension reduction of the feature vector and using Support Vector Machine classifier, we achieved an accuracy of 86% using fourfold cross validation process.

This effort presents an alternative approach for the selection of the Gaussian kernel width via analysis of the distributional characteristics of the training data projected on the 'trained' SVM (margin values). The efficacy of a particular kernel width can be visually determined via one-dimensional density estimate plots of the training data margin values. Projecting the data onto the SVM hyperplane allows the one-dimensional analysis of the data from the viewpoint of the 'trained' SVM. The effect of kernel parameter selection on class-conditional margin distributions is demonstrated in the one-dimensional projection subspace, and a criterion for unsupervised optimization of kernel width is discussed.

Currently, ASD is diagnosed mainly with psychometric tools, often unable to provide an early and reliable diagnosis. Recently, biochemical methods are being explored as a means to meet the latter need. For example, an increased predisposition to ASD has been associated with abnormalities of metabolites in folate-dependent one carbon metabolism (FOCM) and transsulfuration (TS). Multiple metabolites in the FOCM/TS pathways have been measured, and statistical analysis tools employed to identify certain metabolites that are closely related to ASD. The prime difficulty in such biochemical studies comes from (i) inefficient determination of which metabolites are most important and (ii) understanding how these metabolites are collectively related to ASD. This paper presents a new method based on scores produced in Support Vector Machine (SVM) modeling combined with High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) sensitivity analysis. The new method effectively and efficiently identifies the key causative metabolites in FOCM/TS pathways, ranks their importance, and discovers their independent and correlative action patterns upon ASD. Such information is valuable not only for providing a foundation for a pathological interpretation but also for potentially providing an early, reliable diagnosis ideally leading to a subsequent comprehensive treatment of ASD. With only tens of SVM model runs, the new method can identify the combinations of the most important metabolites in the FOCM/TS pathways that lead to ASD. Previous efforts to find these metabolites required hundreds of thousands of model runs with the same data.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5814015", "pubmed_id": "29447214", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0192867", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2791321351", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["22258803", "151272230", "19337150", "26900156", "23881899", "6184963", "15943670", "39526512", "123020838", "122047931", "197158748", "8431486", "119961049", "40412900", "125802936", "15480929", "22279875", "17883206", "121067883", "3908197"], "inbound_citations": ["215722659", "215371637", "214967489", "214631028", "56171087", "51888715"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3604880"}

This problem can be overcome by the proposed navigation method using fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM).

The decisions are taken at each step for the mobile robot to attain the goal position without collision.

Horst (jessica-horst@uiowa.edu) Bob McMurray (bob-mcmurray@uiowa.edu) Larissa K. Samuelson (larissa-samuelson@uiowa.edu) Department of Psychology, E11 Seashore Hall Iowa City, IA 52242 USA Abstract independent processes (Horst & Samuelson, submitted), the present computational model suggests a subtle integration. Specifically, the model confirms that fast mapping and word learning represent two distinct, but related, time scales and that fast mapping can, in fact, lead to word learning. Thus, we argue that fast mapping and word learning are related but not coextensive, as previously argued in the literature. In making the initial mapping, the child is faced with a very specific problem: given a series of objects and a name, the child must determine which object should be associated with that name. In other words, which object is the referent of the name. To solve this problem, the child engages in probabilistic constraint satisfaction. That is, the child determines the most probable and optimal solution to this problem, given present constraints. In the case of making the initial mapping, the constraints include both the present input, which are the objects and name presented, and the child\u2019s own developmental history, which includes a vocabulary of known names. Thus, the problem solving required for fast mapping is done in real-time as the child determines the most likely solution (object) to a specific problem (unknown referent). Further, the real-time aspect of fast mapping does not necessarily require learning on the part of the child. However, as we will show, the repetition of these real-time dynamics change the constraints for the next time the novel referent is presented and eventually, with enough repetitions, fast mapping can lead to word learning. Thus, the process of quickly mapping a novel name to a referent emerges in the moment, while the process of encoding a robust representation of this link unfolds over a longer time scale (for a similar argument see also Capone & McGregor, in press; Carey, 1978). Recent empirical data underscores this hypothesized distinction between fast referent mapping and word learning. The acquisition of word meaning is often partially attributed to fast mapping. However, recent research suggests that fast mapping and word learning may represent distinct components of language acquisition. Here we examine their interaction with a Hebbian Normalized Recurrence Network, a connectionist architecture that captures both online processing and long-term statistical learning. After training on a small lexicon, the model performed well above chance on a fast mapping task. Careful analyses of the weight changes, however, suggest that the fast mapping task can be solved with minimal learning. Thus, this model not only captures both long-term learning and online processes, but also provides unique insights regarding the relationship between fast mapping and word learning and that the two should be carefully distinguished. Fast Mapping and Word Learning In early childhood, children learn words at very impressive rates; typically saying their first word between 10-14- months-of-age, around 300 words by their second birthday and over 60,000 words by their fifth birthday (Carey, 1978). Young children also solve word learning problems with remarkable ease. When presented with two familiar objects, one novel object and a novel name, a child can correctly pick the novel object as the referent of a novel name (Carey, 1978; Carey & Bartlett, 1978). This ability, known as \u201cfast mapping\u201d is often cited as evidence of children\u2019s word learning proficiency. However, recent empirical and computational findings suggest that although fast mapping may be important to word learning, selecting a novel object in response to a novel name is not coextensive with learning the novel name. In the literature, fast mapping and word learning are often discussed as if they are the same thing (see, for example, Behrend, Scofield, & Kleinknecht, 2001). We argue, however, that fast mapping and word learning represent distinct, though subtly related components of word recognition and learning. First, the child must select the referent in the moment (fast mapping). Second, the child must encode the name-object mapping such that it can be recalled after a delay (complete word learning). The extant literature reinforces this distinction as studies either test children\u2019s ability to make the initial mapping, or to remember mappings after a delay, typically with some additional review (see, Horst & Samuelson, submitted). While we have argued that these are potentially logically Supporting Empirical Data Horst & Samuelson (submitted) found that twenty-four- month-old children were able to fast map as many as eight new words in a single session, but did not retain these words over a five minute delay. On each fast mapping trial, children were presented with two familiar objects and one novel object. On half of the trials they were asked to get a familiar object (e.g., \u201ccan you get the car?\u201d), on the other half of the trials were asked, (e.g., \u201ccan you get the blicket?\u201d). Overall, children were excellent at selecting both the familiar and novel referents (see Figure 1A). Five minutes later children were tested for retention of the fast-", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "587117725", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["200069103", "1136830", "17710641", "50145091", "38729030", "11572042", "46543653", "142760767"], "inbound_citations": ["15713669", "12058643", "31095886", "7996820", "732305", "11222740", "9411450", "12877717", "2919307", "39909425", "215531589", "7505899", "12502153", "10122196", "59694791", "20396626", "174788192", "37325680", "7037231"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55363862"}

Additionally, it is well known that, in autonomous vehicles, safety is a major challenge, where unexpected obstacles in the working area must be conveniently addressed in order to guarantee the security and the continuity of the process. The objective of this study was to design a tri-class Support Vector Machine classifier for identifying plants (crops and weeds), soil and objects in maize fields based on unsupervised learning. For this, a strategy for automatic sample selection was designed to obtain elements of the three involved classes for the training process. In this context, the identification of obstacles for safe navigation makes an important contribution. A comparative analysis of different texture descriptors and local patterns was carried out with the aim of determining the best for characterizing the classes under study; results have shown that the Speeded-Up Robust Features descriptor is the most appropriate to discriminate between plants, soil and objects.

Most existing proposals for software watermarking have the shortcoming that they heavily rely on the stealth of watermark to prevent adversaries removing marks. Besides, the watermark is separate from the original program and can be destroyed via fairly straightforward semantics-preserving code transformations. In order to mitigate these problems, this paper introduces SVM-based watermarking, a non-stealthy approach to software watermarking based on the incomprehensibility of support vector machines(SVMs). The advantage of this technique is that software watermarking is handled as the knowledge embedded into SVMs and is closely associated with the program logic. Thus, it makes watermark more difficult to be destroyed and removed.

Fire. and Dangerous Things and Langacker\u2019s Foundations of Cognitive Grammar) converges with connectionist cognitive science in a variety of ways. This paper gives an overview of what those convergences are and what an overall theory of language with connectionist foundations might look like. 1. Some Larger Issues I would like to situate this lecture with respect to certain larger issues raised by connectionist research. I see connectionist research as being primarily concerned with the question: How is it possible for the brain to be the mind? That is. how is it possible for a physical brain to engage in reason? And how is language represented in the brain? Such questions are indirectly related to the question: How could human intelligence have evolved from the brains of other primates? Does human intelligence involve the use of capacities present in the animals front which we evolved? I will be presenting a number of linguistic results that bear indirectly on these issues, and will add a number of speculations that. if correct. might allow us to begin answering such questions. The linguistic results I will be presenting indicate that htunan reason uses some of the same mechanisms involved in perception and that human reason can be seen as growing out of perceptual and motor mechanisms. Before going on to this, however, it is important to make a distinction between connectionist modelling and the connectionist theory of mind. 2. Activation Patterns Over Portions of Topographic Maps Are Meaningful The various parts of the body are connected to the brain by neural networks. Indeed. they are literally \u2018u-nannn:-I\u2019 Anon ol-manta AF Ilnunounn :n Ilia L-min no-IL-ul \u2018topographic maps\u2018. Such mappings preserve topological relations. but not relative size; e.g.. the topographic map of the thumb is next to that of the forefinger, but is much larger than it. The neural networks of the brain are an appropriate locus for a theory of how concepts are embodied for a very simple reason: Patterns of activation over topographic maps in the brain are meaningful, because of the way those portions of the brain are connected to the body. . \u00bb 9 Consider. for example, the pattern of activation that gr-ises in those neurons in the topographic map of the retina that characterize color. The patterns of activation over such neurons characterize color categories, and we experience those patterns as colors within those categories. Those same pattems .of activation, located in some other topographic map in the brain, would be experienced as something else: say, in the map of auditory space. they would be experienced as sounds. Activation patterns considered in isolation from their locations in the brain are meaningless in themselves; at particular locations in the brain. they are meaningful \u2014 not by virtue of the location per se but because of the way such locations are connected to the body. It is in this sense that the neural networks of the brain(asitishookeduptothebody)appeartobethe right locus for a theory of how concepts are embodied. They are thus a suitable basis for a theory of meaning, given the additional assumption that our perceptual systems respond in a lawlike way to external stimuli. 3. The Connectionist Theory of Mind versus Connectionist Modelling Connectionist cognitive science. as I understand it. is ultimately about the physical brain as located in the body. it is important to see how connectionist modelling \ufb01ts into the overall program of connectionist cognitive science. Models of neural networks. simulated on a computer. are very different from the physical brain as it is located in the human body. Computer models of neural networks are disembodied. Their job is limited. Their job is to study the properties of particular neural architectures.", "year": 1988, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2522223260,2777227301", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16155259", "32384303", "14373130", "18652805", "27432038", "60408780", "18368982", "10139791", "202593753", "45803176", "45803176", "37780610", "3192005"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67327163"}

It becomes critical to develop efficient debugging systems for WSN applications. A flexible and generic debugger for WSN applications is highly demanded. In this thesis, I proposed and developed a flexible and iterative WSN debugging system based on sequence analyzing and data mining techniques. At first, I developed vectorized Probabilistic Suffix Tree (vPST), a variable memory length model to extract and store sequential information from program runtime traces in compact suffix tree based vectors, based on original Probabilistic Suffix Tree (PST). Then I built a novel WSN debugging system by integrating vPST with Support Vector Machine (SVM), a robust and generic classifier for both linear and nonlinear data classification. The vPST-SVM debugging system enables developers to target at any hot spots they know might be problematic in the program source codes. They simply need insert trace points into the hot spots, collect runtime traces, then iteratively analyze the traces and finally locate real bugs. At last, I studied three different test cases, two on LiteOS and one on TinyOS, to evaluate the proposed WSN debugging system. It is demonstrated to be an efficient, flexible, generic and portable WSN debugger by the case studies. In addition, the vPST-SVM sequence analyzing methodology provides researchers with an inspiring angle of view on extracting sequential features and obtaining meaningful insights from sequences by appropriate transformation of sequential data.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "126506853", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7370941"}

However, some applications require the inclusion of grammar rules, and in these cases generative models, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Stochastic Grammars, are routinely applied.ResultsWe introduce Grammatical-Restrained Hidden Conditional Random Fields (GRHCRFs) as an extension of Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRFs). GRHCRFs while preserving the discriminative character of HCRFs, can assign labels in agreement with the production rules of a defined grammar. The main GRHCRF novelty is the possibility of including in HCRFs prior knowledge of the problem by means of a defined grammar. Our current implementation allows regular grammar rules. We test our GRHCRF on a typical biosequence labeling problem: the prediction of the topology of Prokaryotic outer-membrane proteins.ConclusionWe show that in a typical biosequence labeling problem the GRHCRF performs better than CRF models of the same complexity, indicating that GRHCRFs can be useful tools for biosequence analysis applications.AvailabilityGRHCRF software is available under GPLv3 licence at the website ::: http://www.biocomp.unibo.it/~savojard/biocrf-0.9.tar.gz", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2776008", "pubmed_id": "19849839", "doi": "10.1186/1748-7188-4-13", "venue": "Algorithms for Molecular Biology", "journal": "Algorithms for Molecular Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2145631315", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["41874679", "207927251", "277918", "337131", "38548504", "38582565", "8135532", "16163331", "206340994", "1171329", "5245012", "9389968", "16273213", "12943282", "15267366", "31866940", "15390763", "29185760", "6038991"], "inbound_citations": ["16175197", "959208", "9010993", "5760446", "5050722", "19055464", "2850711", "2175068"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6560384"}

We then test the SVM and NN, the two best performing methods, on Bach?s Prelude in C major BWV 943, transposed to different keys and time-stretched to various tempi. The error rates ranged from 23.91% (when training set key and tempo equals those of the test set) to 37.22% (when the key is off by four accidentals) and 37.91% (when tempo is 20 beats per minute faster).

Analysis of over 1000 S. ::: enterica genomes allowed the correct prediction (67 \u201390 % accuracy) of the source host for S.

Moreover, only a minor subset of isolates had high probability scores for multiple hosts, indicating generalists with genetic content that may facilitate transition between hosts. The same approach correctly identified human versus bovine E. coli isolates (83 % accuracy) and the potential of the classifier to predict a zoonotic threat was demonstrated using E. coli O157. This research indicates marked host restriction for both S. enterica and E. coli, with only limited isolate subsets exhibiting host promiscuity by gene content.

LS-SVMs are an extension of \"traditional\" SVMs that have been introduced recently in the field of chemistry and chemometrics. The advantages of SVM-based methods over many other methods are that these lead to global models that are often unique, and nonlinear regression can be performed easily as an extension to linear regression. An additional advantage of LS-SVM (compared to SVM) is that model calculation and optimization can be performed relatively fast. As a test case to study the use of LS-SVM, the well-known and important chemical problem is considered in which spectra are affected by nonlinear interferences. As one specific example, a commonly used case is studied in which near-infrared spectra are affected by temperature-induced spectral variation. Using this test case, model optimization, pruning, and model interpretation of the LS-SVM have been demonstrated. Furthermore, excellent performance of the LS-SVM, compared to other approaches, has been presented on the specific example. Therefore, it can be concluded that LS-SVMs can be seen as very promising techniques to solve ill-posed problems. Furthermore, these have been shown to lead to robust models in cases of spectral variations due to nonlinear interferences.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "15167788", "doi": "10.1021/ac035522m", "venue": "Analytical chemistry", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2055817716,2795327385", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": ["15379424"], "inbound_citations": ["96352375", "12323370", "33052641", "86866114", "43469897", "18817479", "2539224", "38797389", "52244893", "39228167", "14912666", "93703162", "126229286", "93957704", "4586531", "1564274", "13408406", "103068690", "7980131", "209900562", "1251884", "93190525", "111177350", "105465059", "94722586", "62543456", "16539578", "12301163", "2580289", "54087744", "2523386", "17681571", "11986031", "17520770", "4231572", "15144258", "12375060"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8995155"}

Using data on pneumonia-related hospitalizations from 2015, we compared six hospitals with similar complexity regarding the frequency of all pneumonia-related diagnosis codes in order to identify codes that were significantly overreported in a given facility relatively to its peers. To verify whether the discrepant codes could be related to upcoding, we built Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to simulate the APR-DRG system and assess its response to each discrepant code. Findings demonstrate that hospitals significantly differed in coding six pneumonia conditions, with five of them playing a major role in increasing APR-DRG complexity, being thus suspicious cases of upcoding. However, those comprised a minority of cases and the overall credibility concerning upcoding of pneumonia was above 99% for all evaluated hospitals. Our findings can not only be relevant for planning future audit processes by signalizing errors impacting APR-DRG classification, but also for discussing credibility of administrative data, keeping in mind their impact on hospital financing.

Two different convolutional neural networks are trained to maximize the probability of item co-occurrences.

Our proposed technique can detect the boundaries of carpal bones in X-ray images by using the information from the vector image model and the edge map. Feature analysis of the carpal bones can reveal the important information for bone age assessment. Five features for bone age assessment are calculated from the boundary extraction result of each carpal bone. All features are taken as input into the support vector regression (SVR) that assesses the bone age. We compare the SVR with the neural network regression (NNR). We use 180 images of carpal bone from a digital hand atlas to assess the bone age of young children from 0 to 6 years old.

{"paper_id": "167727674", "title": "Strategic Learning Agents in Equilibrium-based Markets for Resource Allocation", "authors": [{"first": "Eduardo", "middle": ["Rodrigues"], "last": "Gomes", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "The Commodity Market (CM) economic model offers a promising approach for resource allocation in large-scale distributed systems. A CM provides a marketplace where sellers and buyers trade resources based on a common price known by all the participants. A traditional approach for resource allocation with CM is to apply concepts from the general equilibrium theory of microeconomics, assuming pricetaking participants that will not attempt to strategically influence the mechanism to improve their profits or welfare. Such a condition, apart from being criticized as not realistic, is hardly satisfied in large-scale distributed systems where there is little control over the behaviour of the agents, making it impossible to guarantee that they will behave in an ordered manner. To understand the impacts of these attempts and to develop mechanisms that are robust in the presence of strategic participants are important aspects of the problem. Additionally, most mechanisms focus on the achievement of a Pareto-Optimal (PO) allocation, usually disregarding how fair and how desirable the solution is for both the system and the participants. Different PO outcomes can generate different gains to the involved parties. Therefore, being able to find a mutually desirable PO allocation is also an important aspect of the problem. This thesis addresses the above issues and proposes a framework to optimise the individual and social allocation efficiency in equilibrium-based commodity market mechanisms composed of strategic learning agents. It addresses the problem from the premise that participants can behave like the entities composing real economies and will engage in strategic behaviour in order to satisfy their preferences. We propose the Iterative Price Adjustment with Reinforcement Learning (IPA with RL), a CM-based mechanism in which agents use utility functions to describe preferences over different resource attributes and develop strategic behaviour by learning demand functions adapted to the market through Reinforcement Learning. We investigate and compare the individual and social performance of the mechanism in the presence of two types of strategic learning agents: selfish, whose learning goal is to improve their individual utility; and altruistic, whose learning goal is to improve the social utility. The results show that the market composed exclusively of selfish learning agents can achieve social performance similar to the performance obtained by the market composed exclusively of altruistic learning agents, both achieving near-optimal social welfare measured by the Nash Product function. The results also show that the selfish agents are able to approximate the solution to the fairest PO allocation in situations where the altruistic agents fail. We further investigate these outcomes and present their theoretical analysis first from the perspective of game-theory, highlighting the properties of the results in terms of Nash Equilibrium and Pareto-Optimality, and then from the perspective of the dynamic process generated by the agents\u2019 learning algorithm. The thesis advances the knowledge base in a number of areas of Market-based Resource Allocation, Multiagent Learning and Agent-based Computational Economics. First, it formalizes a new conceptual framework involving multiagent reinforcement learning in commodity-market resource allocation mechanisms. Second, it introduces strategic learning agents in market-based resource allocation mechanisms founded on general equilibrium theory. So far, these mechanisms have assumed the existence of rational price-taking participants. The approach proposed in the thesis, instead, is more realistic as it explicitly addresses the existence of strategic participants that can try to exploit the mechanism. Third, it simultaneously optimises both the individual and social efficiency of the allocation. Existing approaches typically focus on the achievement of a PO allocation only, usually disregarding the individual utility and social welfare resulting from it. Fourth, it develops a theoretical model for the dynamics of Multiagent Q-learning with \u01eb-greedy exploration. Despite the popularity of this algorithm, such a model has not been developed before. Finally, it develops a new technique to support the application and scalability of reinforcement learning in commodity-market resource allocation.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2277796638", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167727674"}

Given a query data point that is classified in this way, we can retrieve all the locally similar training data points and use them to predict latent global object shape. This information may help to further prune positively labeled grasp hypotheses based on, e.g. relation to the predicted average global shape or suitability for a specific task. This prediction can also guide scene exploration to prune object shape hypotheses. To learn the function that maps local shape to grasp stability we use a Random Forest Classifier. We show that our method reaches the same classification performance as the current state-of-the-art on this dataset which uses a Convolutional Neural Network. Additionally, we exploit the natural ability of the Random Forest to cluster similar data. For a positively predicted query data point, we retrieve all the locally similar training data points that are associated with the same leaf nodes of the Random Forest.

These results demonstrate that the machine learning regression methods can successfully describe the complex formation between organic molecules and \u03b2-cyclodextrin or sulfobutylether-\u03b2-cyclodextrin. In particular, the root mean square errors for the test sets predictions by the best models are low, 1.9 and 2.7 kJ/mol, respectively. The developed QSPR models can be used to predict the solubilizing effect of cyclodextrins and to help prioritizing experimental work in drug discovery.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21497190", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.03.065", "venue": "International journal of pharmaceutics", "journal": "International journal of pharmaceutics", "mag_id": "2087985529", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52167718", "195259920", "215391091", "164382087", "103285758", "201206383", "215494869", "199074794"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23733089"}

In this sense, this paper proposes a deep learning architecture for Ar2p, which is based on supervised and unsupervised mechanisms for the discovery and the selection of features for classification problems (called Ar2p-DL). Ar2p is an algorithm of pattern recognition based on the systematic functioning of the human brain. Ar2p-DL is composed of three phases: the first phase, called feature analysis, is supported by two feature-engineering approaches to discover or select atomic features/descriptors. The feature engineering approach used for the discovery, is based on a classical clustering technique, K-means; and the approach used for the selection, is based on a classification technique, Random Forest. The second phase, called aggregation, creates a feature hierarchy (merge of descriptors) from the atomic features/descriptors (it uses as aggregation strategy the DBSCAN algorithm). Finally, the classification phase carries out the classification of the inputs based on the feature hierarchy, using the classical Ar2p algorithm. The last phase of Ar2p-DL uses a supervised learning approach, while the first phases combine supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. To analyze the performance of Ar2p-DL, several tests have been made using different benchmarks (datasets) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, in order to compare Ar2p-DL with other classification methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11063-019-10062-4", "venue": "Neural Processing Letters", "journal": "Neural Processing Letters", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2959370640", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60626986", "3074096", "11715509", "9383489", "2754701", "355163", "11110897", "22534641", "63641546", "12601450", "3629972", "53187376", "16347813", "69296744", "22716123", "26960994", "52300962", "62230592", "17860116", "3285833", "1552055", "31155500", "56487231", "329415", "55044342", "120491167", "89141", "117082824", "355163", "15152372", "55385258", "56261429", "14378101", "60990406", "69968952", "14433964", "206592585", "9329224", "50772500", "4247866", "17068353", "53765997", "59336365", "65294571"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198190200"}

For this purpose, given a single frontal training image, a multi-depth generic elastic model and an extended generic elastic model are developed to synthesize facial images of the target pose with varying 3D shape (depth) and illumination variations respectively. To reduce these \u201csynthesized\u201d variability, Pose-Aware Metric spaces are separately learnt by linear regression analysis at each quantized pose, and pose-invariant recognition is performed in the corresponding metric space. By preserving the detailed texture and reducing the shape variability, the PAML method achieves an 100% accuracy on the Multi-PIE database under the test setting across poses, which is significantly better than the traditional methods that use a large generic image ensemble to learn the cross-pose transformations. On the more challenging setting across both poses and illuminations, PAML outperforms the recent deep learning approaches by over 10% accuracy.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2017.10.020", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.", "journal": "Pattern Recognit.", "mag_id": "2767014173", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53027704", "201905114", "195882722", "58567753"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3876642"}

Endorectal coils are commonly used in DW-MR imaging to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the acquisition, at the expense of significant intensity inhomogeneities (bias field) that worsens as we move away from the endorectal coil. The presence of bias field can have a significant negative impact on the accuracy of different image analysis tasks, as well as prostate tumor localization, thus leading to increased inter- and intra-observer variability. Retrospective bias correction approaches are introduced as a more efficient way of bias correction compared to the prospective methods such that they correct for both of the scanner and anatomy-related bias fields in MR imaging. Previously proposed retrospective bias field correction methods suffer from undesired noise amplification that can reduce the quality of bias-corrected DW-MR image. Here, we propose a unified data reconstruction approach that enables joint compensation of bias field as well as data noise in DW-MR imaging. The proposed noise-compensated, bias-corrected (NCBC) data reconstruction method takes advantage of a novel stochastically fully connected joint conditional random field (SFC-JCRF) model to mitigate the effects of data noise and bias field in the reconstructed MR data. The proposed NCBC reconstruction method was tested on synthetic DW-MR data, physical DW-phantom as well as real DW-MR data all acquired using endorectal MR coil. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis illustrated that the proposed NCBC method can achieve improved image quality when compared to other tested bias correction methods.

Some traditional methods, e.g., SVM and random forest, tend to ignore the contextual information, which may fail to process ambiguous samples. Conditional random fields (CRF) is an effective approach which eliminates semantic ambiguity via considering the relationship between adjacent pixels. In CRF model, the pairwise potential reflects the contextual relationship. However, the existed pairwise potential often equally treats each feature and does not highlight the roles of key features.

The primary goal of this study was to develop machine learning models that classify non-small Lung Cancers according to histopathology types and to compare several machine learning methods in this learning task. DNA from tumors of 37 patients (21 squamous carcinomas, and 16 adenocarcinomas) were extracted and hybridized onto a 452 BAC clone array. The following algorithms were used: KNN, Decision Tree Induction, Support Vector Machines and Feed-Forward Neural Networks. Performance was measured via leave-one-out classification accuracy. The best multi-gene model found had a leave-one-out accuracy of 89.2%. Decision Trees performed poorer than the other methods in this learning task and dataset. We conclude that gene copy numbers as measured by array CGH are, collectively, an excellent indicator of histological subtype.

The epilepsy is occurring due to the brain stroke, lack of blood flow, brain fever and so on, these lead to create the number of human deaths. So, the brain epilepsy needs to be analyzed and it has to be detected for improving the epilepsy recognition rate. But the major problem with the epilepsy recognition is the accuracy and efficiency of the classifier because of the traditional approximation entropy only extracts the minimum number of features which is difficult to detect the epilepsy with effective manner. These problems increase the false classification rate while analyzing the brain features. So, brain abnormalities has been automatically recognized by using the various machine learning steps like preprocessing, signal decomposition, feature extraction, feature selection and classification.

We can show by inspection that the reliable samples with smaller errors are beneficial to achieve a better generator, while the unreliable one might disturb the training procedure. Enlightened from this observation, we introduce an indicator for each sample to indicate its reliability in this paper. Based on this, we exploit a new objective function to learn the generator/discriminator and infer the indicator for each sample simultaneously. In such a way, the unreliable samples that might result in the opposite side are discarded in training stage. Meanwhile, when the training errors become smaller, more and more samples are included in the reliable set of samples, until no more reliable one are produced.

In this paper, the feature extraction has been done by taking the curvelet transforms of each of the original image and its quantized 4 bit and 2 bit representations. The curvelet coefficients thus obtained act as the feature set for classification.

The vast majority of such works leverages the strengths of adversarial learning in tandem with deep convolutional autoencoders to achieve realistic results by well-capturing the target data distribution. Nevertheless, the most prominent representatives of this class of methods do not facilitate semantic structure in the latent space, and usually rely on domain labels for test-time transfer. This leads to rigid models that are unable to capture the variance of each domain label. In this light, we propose a novel adversarial learning method that (i) facilitates latent structure by disentangling sources of variation based on a novel cost function and (ii) encourages learning generalizable, continuous and transferable latent codes that can be utilized for tasks such as unpaired multi-domain image transfer and synthesis, without requiring labelled test data. The resulting representations can be combined in arbitrary ways to generate novel hybrid imagery, as for example generating mixtures of identities.

In Study 1, we build cross-entropy reinforcement learning (CERL) models (Szita & Lorincz, 2006) to determine whether different goals result in different feature weights. Two of these optimization strategies quickly rise to performance plateaus, whereas two others continue toward higher but more jagged (i.e., variable) heights. In Study 2, we compare the zoid placement decisions made by our best CERL models with those made by 67 human players. Across 370,131 human game episodes, two CERL models picked the same zoid placements as our lowest scoring human for 43% of the placements and as our three best scoring experts for 65% of the placements. Our findings suggest that people focus on maximizing points, not number of lines cleared or number of levels reached. They also show that goal choice influences the choice of zoid placements for CERLs and suggest that the same is true of humans.

An RF model comprises a set of decision trees each of which is trained using random subsets of features. Given an instance, the prediction by the RF is obtained via majority voting of the predictions of all the trees in the forest. However, different test instances would have different values for the features used in the trees and the trees should contribute differently to the predictions. This diverse contribution of the trees is not considered in traditional RFs. Many approaches have been proposed to model the diverse contributions by selecting a subset of trees for each instance. This paper is among these approaches. It proposes a Semantics Aware Random Forest (SARF) classifier.

CI occurs when one class of the data contains most of the samples while the other class contains only a few. Standard classifiers, when applied to imbalanced data, result in high accuracy for the majority class and low accuracy for the minority one. We were motivated to propose a novel framework for classifying the content of Arabic comics; therefore, we propose KerMinSVM, a kernel extension of our previously proposed MinSVM coupled with a new dimensionality featuring a reduction scheme based on word root frequency ratios (WRFR). KerMinSVM was tested on multiple imbalanced benchmark datasets, and the results were verified using three measures: accuracy, F-measure, and statistical analysis.

Patients were classified into MND with a pure motor syndrome (MND-motor) and those with cognitive/behavioural symptoms (MND-plus). A surface-based morphometry analysis was used to assess cortical thickness. Corticospinal tract (CST), corpus callosum (CC), and major association tracts diffusion tensor (DT) metrics were obtained. A Random Forest (RF) approach was used to identify the set of image features correlated with cognitive/behavioural deficits. ::: Results: There were 48 MND-motor and 53 MND-plus patients. Relative to controls, both patient groups showed cortical thinning of the bilateral precentral and postcentral gyri, cingulate cortex, inferior temporal and parietal areas. In all regions, there was a trend towards a more extensive involvement in MND-plus vs MND-motor. Both patient groups showed a damage of the motor CC fibers, but such a damage was greater in MND-plus cases. MND-plus patients also showed a severe involvement of the extra-motor WM tracts bilaterally. RF analysis showed that the best predictors of cognitive deficits and behavioural symptoms in MND patients were the DT MRI metrics of the frontotemporal tracts. ::: Conclusions: Cortical thinning and WM degeneration are highly dependent upon neuropsychological and behavioural symptoms in patients with MND. WM tract damage contributes to the severity of selective cognitive and behavioural manifestations more than cortical thinning. ::: Study Supported by: Italian Ministry of Health (#RF-2010-2313220).

However, these approaches involve batch learning algorithms that are not well-equipped to address the demands of continuously changing data stream. In this paper, we conduct a study to predict the daily wave heights in different geographical regions using sequential learning algorithms, namely the Minimal Resource Allocation Network (MRAN) and the Growing and Pruning Radial Basis Function (GAP-RBF) network. The study is conducted using data collected from 13 stations across three geographically distinct regions, viz., the Gulf of Mexico, the Korean region and the UK region, for the period between Jan 1, 2011 and Aug 30, 2015. The data is chosen such that the study covers a wide range of geographical terrains and locations, a wide range of wind speed and wave heights. We compare the performance of MRAN and GAP-RBF with Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The performance study results show that the MRAN and GAP-RBF outperform the SVR and ELM with minimal network resources, in the daily wave height prediction.

We demonstrate that this approach is effective for social network spam filtering on a benchmark dataset in terms of accuracy and area under ROC. In addition, solid performance is achieved in terms of false negative and false positive rates. We also show that the proposed approach outperforms other popular algorithms used in spam filtering, such as decision trees, Naive Bayes, artificial immune systems, support vector machines, etc.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-92007-8_4", "venue": "AIAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2804978736", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210999314", "209531703", "195774119"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46896041"}

We develop a linear regression, regression tree and random forest model for each sub-segment and find that the weekday and month in which requisitions begin the Transporter segment are among the most significant drivers in variability. United States Transportation Command currently uses the average performance per sub-segment to estimate Transporter length, and our models, when applied to the test set, perform considerably better than the average. We conclude that the random forest models provide the best and most robust results for most sub-segments.

In many cases, if we can identify which tasks are related, we can also clearly identify which tasks are unrelated. In the past, most researchers emphasized exploiting correlations among interrelated tasks while completely ignoring the unrelated tasks that may provide valuable prior knowledge for multi-task learning. In this paper, a new approach is developed to hierarchically learn a tree of multi-task metrics by leveraging prior knowledge about both the related tasks and unrelated tasks. First, a visual tree is constructed to hierarchically organize large numbers of image categories in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Over the visual tree, a multi-task metric classifier is learned for each node by exploiting both the related and unrelated tasks, where the learning tasks for training the classifiers for the sibling child nodes under the same parent node are treated as the interrelated tasks, and the others are treated as the unrelated tasks. In addition, the node-specific metric for the parent node is propagated to its sibling child nodes to control inter-level error propagation.

Domains like healthcare look to enrich the database gradually with more medical cases, or in astronomy, with human\u2019s growing knowledge about the universe, the theoretical basis for labelling data will change. The techniques applied in a stable TS dataset are then not adaptable in such dynamic scenarios (i.e. streaming context). Classical data stream analysis are biased towards vector or row data, where each attribute is independent to train an adaptive learning model, but rarely considers Time Series as a stream instance.

Sequential nonlinear response history analyses using as-recorded mainshock-aftershock ground motions are conducted to generate distinct feature patterns comprised of spatially distributed global and local engineering demand parameters (EDP) within the tall building. Residual structural capacity is assessed based on the median spectral intensity corresponding to the collapse prevention performance level. Dispersion-based filtering and feature selection using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operator (LASSO) are performed to effectively reduce the high dimensional feature space while selecting the most informative ones. The features that survive the filtering but excluded by LASSO are reserved and grouped based on their correlations with those that are selected. These reserved features can be utilized if the selected ones are unavailable. Predictive models using Support Vector Machine are constructed to map the EDP-based features to the residual structural capacity of the tall building, where satisfactory performance is observed as measured by the root mean square errors in the testing dataset. In addition to guiding post-earthquake inspections and residual structural capacity assessments, the proposed framework can inform optimal sensor placement as well as provide time-dependent limit state evaluation in aftershock environments.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.strusafe.2018.12.004", "venue": null, "journal": "Structural Safety", "mag_id": "2905955008", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125666185"}

Firstly, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Wavelet Transform (WT) and Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) are adopted to extract features of the human body, which can be achieved by single PIR sensor. Then, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to reduce the characteristic dimensions and to classify the human targets, respectively. Finally, Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE) is utilized to fuse recognition results from multiple PIR sensors to finalize human identification. The pyroelectric characteristics under scenarios with different people and/or different paths are analyzed by various experiments, and the recognition results with/without fusion procedure are also shown and compared. The experimental results demonstrate our scheme has improved efficiency for human identification.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/a7040685", "venue": "Algorithms", "journal": "Algorithms", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2091036469", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17699167", "10112350", "703589", "61727283", "15666024", "2578499", "6909065", "20453149", "16570468", "8862921", "42967164", "3639755", "16056062", "11162996", "14648314", "18994292", "41278187", "11460117", "27254636", "19284152", "24342437", "10433341", "18352555", "12365634", "2803959", "110388039", "41909374", "109083717", "109914606", "12850037"], "inbound_citations": ["25547374", "195698144", "6911971"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14210484"}

Our approach addresses feature learning as an optimization problem. As owning the advantage of parallel computing, genetic algorithm (GA) has fast speed of convergence and excellent global optimization performance. At the same time, unlike handcrafted feature and deep learning methods, GA can be employed to solve the problem of feature representation without prior knowledge, and it has no use for a large number of parameters to be learned. The candidate solution in RGB or depth modality is represented as an encoding of an image in GA, and genetic feature is learned through population initialization, fitness evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation.

New experiments are performed, as well, to evaluate the results of the application of both temporal features and pressure data.

A feature selection strategy is adopted in computer simulations and the resulting performance indices are evaluated in terms of Area Under Curve (AUC).

In such cases, it would be useful to exploit the latest, cheaper datasets and combine them with free datasets for the mapping of forest canopy height.

Second, we refined the crude CHM and correlated it with the topographically corrected Landsat 8 surface reflectance data, the vegetation indices, and the forest types through a Random Forest model.

Systems of forest attributes and ecological indicators were estimated using ALS statistics and ground data collected in Central-East Spain, on two Mediterranean pine forest areas. Co-registration errors were simulated by means of altering ground data coordinates. The larger the co-registration error, the higher the variation in the selected ALS-based predictors in the parametric approach, which was less affected than the RF-based selection. In both cases, the final performance of the models was not as affected by co-registration errors as the observed variation in the selection of variables: the impact was around 1% in the parametric approach while the value reached the 8% for both stand basal area and the Gini-index under the non-parametric method.

To predict Bitcoin price at different frequencies using machine learning techniques, we first classify Bitcoin price by daily price and high-frequency price. A set of high-dimension features including property and network, trading and market, attention and gold spot price are used for Bitcoin daily price prediction, while the basic trading features acquired from a cryptocurrency exchange are used for 5-minute interval price prediction. Statistical methods including Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis for Bitcoin daily price prediction with high-dimensional features achieve an accuracy of 66%, outperforming more complicated machine learning algorithms. Compared with benchmark results for daily price prediction, we achieve a better performance, with the highest accuracies of the statistical methods and machine learning algorithms of 66% and 65.3%, respectively. Machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine and Long Short-term Memory for Bitcoin 5-minute interval price prediction are superior to statistical methods, with accuracy reaching 67.2%. Our investigation of Bitcoin price prediction can be considered a pilot study of the importance of the sample dimension in machine learning techniques.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cam.2019.112395", "venue": "J.

This method is aimed at learning with both labeled and unlabeled parts and effectively predicting future values in a graph. The method is even capable of learning from nodes for which the response variable is never observed in history, which poses problems for many state-of-the-art models that can handle missing data. The proposed model is characterized for various missingness mechanisms on 500 synthetic graphs. The benefits of the new method are also demonstrated on a challenging application for predicting precipitation based on partial observations of climate variables in a temporal graph that spans the entire continental US. We also show that the method can be useful for optimizing the costs of data collection in climate applications via active reduction of the number of weather stations to consider.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is an alternative tool used to predict N. However, SVMs do not provide an explicit formula, which creates an obstacle for practical engineers. Thus, a heuristic algorithm (the Tabu search, TS) was used to build the prediction formula. A total of 240 in-situ data samples were analyzed to ensure the accuracy of the proposed formula. The format of the existing empirical formula was adopted in the proposed TS-based formula. Four parameters were considered in our TS models: the effective soil particle size (D 10), the soil particle size (D 15), the water-to-cement ratio (w/c) and the FC. The prediction accuracy of the TS-based formula was approximately 94.17%, indicating that the proposed formula is a suitable tool.

There are some challenges in the detection and localization of water pollution sources due to the particularity and complexity of the water environment.

Complex and uncertain interference, such as time delays, flow velocity, and the fact that propagation relies heavily on propagation distance, makes the positions of pollution sources not constant, and the sensor data cannot reach the information processing center at the same time. Therefore, a nonlinear concentration diffusion model formulated by combining Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with Partial Least Squares (PLS) has been established to describe the relationship between the concentration diffusion value and the position of the sensor in order to solve the problem that the traditional model parameters cannot be acquired in real time. Furthermore, the Sequential Unscented Kalman Filter (SUKF) combined with the ELM-PLS model is utilized to realize precise localization.

The search for such markers has been challenging due to clinical and molecular heterogeneity of MDD, the lack of statistical power in studies and suboptimal statistical tools applied to multidimensional data. Machine learning is a powerful approach to mitigate some of these limitations. Methods We aimed to identify the predictive markers of recurrent MDD in the elderly using peripheral whole blood from the Sydney Memory and Aging Study (SMAS) (N = 521, aged over 65) and adopting machine learning methodology on transcriptome data. Fuzzy Forests is a Random Forests-based classification algorithm that takes advantage of the co-expression network structure between genes; it allows to alleviate the problem of p >> n via reducing the dimensionality of transcriptomic feature space. Results By adopting Fuzzy Forests on transcriptome data, we found that the downregulated TFRC (transferrin receptor) can predict recurrent MDD with an accuracy of 63%. Limitations Although we corrected our data for several important confounders, we were not able to account for the comorbidities and medication taken, which may be numerous in the elderly and might have affected the levels of gene transcription. Conclusions We found that downregulated TFRC is predictive of recurrent MDD, which is consistent with the previous literature, indicating the role of the innate immune system in depression.

The system is based on a two-stage classifier. Candidates are detected using a Haar cascade classifier and then partverification is done using the cascade object detector. The Histogram of oriented gradients is found for the whole input and it is combined with the classification done using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The location of the human is detected using a background subtraction algorithm. The detected human are traced by determining the centroid point of the blob and keeping track of its location.

Classifiers of different characteristics are used. These are the Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, k-Nearest-Neighbor, and Naive Bayes. They are compared to two not pre-trained and four pre-trained neural networks. The former neural network are based on LeNet, the second ones include AlexNet, GoogleNet and ResNet provided by Matlab as well as a pre-trained neural network provided by MVTec HALCON. Comparisons were made using the recognition rates achieved with five real data sets from industrial applications. The results showed that not pre-trained neural networks produce worse results than classical classifiers with the given small amounts of data for training. On the other hand, the pre-trained networks achieved surpassing recognition rates. However, if there are features that describe the classes very well, the recognition performance of classical machine learning methods little differs from that of deep learning algorithms.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2530899", "venue": "Other Conferences", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2974237300", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["9333065", "115803897", "9804430", "6488286", "10023724", "34272612", "10344554", "206787478", "140109802", "89141", "106437179", "110075070", "3074096", "1872638", "10808461", "208146000", "207170725", "206592484", "12387176", "44206145", "14542261", "114865586", "207763512", "206594692"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202698571"}

The RF algorithm used various surface variables to construct the SM relationship model, such as surface temperature, leaf area index, albedo, water index, vegetation index, and elevation, comparing with the widely used polynomial-based relationship model.

The effectiveness of this method was confirmed to yield a license plate detection rate of approximately 90%.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICARCV.2016.7838653", "venue": "2016 14th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV)", "journal": "2016 14th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2585641723", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["189806293", "206661467", "110810866", "14703515", "12109951", "44018849", "1317006", "107128194", "13018587", "88480335"], "inbound_citations": ["201833706", "52128848", "49419377", "199059325", "211242865"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16434963"}

This unpredictable change in the latent variable results in non-stationarity. We frame this problem as transfer learning in a particular subclass of MDPs, which we call MDPs-with-agents (MDP-A), where each task/MDP requires the learner to learn to interact with opponent agents with fixed policies. Across the tasks, the state and action space remains the same (and is known) but the agent-policies change. We transfer information from previous tasks to quickly infer the combined agent behavior policy in a new task after some limited initial exploration, and hence rapidly learn an optimal/nearoptimal policy. We propose a transfer algorithm which given a collection of source behavior policies, eliminates, using a novel statistical test, the policies that do not apply in the new task in time polynomial in the relevant parameters.

This paper proposes an robust approach, called the Global Optimization Approach (GOA), to identify both optimal and stable features, relying on multi-criterion fusion-based feature selection technique and an information-theoretic method. The proposed GOA first combines multiple well-known FS techniques to yield a possible optimal feature subsets across different traffic datasets; then the proposed adaptive threshold, which is based on entropy to extract the stable features. A new goodness measure is proposed within a Random Forest framework to estimate the final optimum feature subset.

The CFS-EM is a hybrid of coevolutionary genetic programming (CGP) and EM algorithm applied on partially labeled data. CFS-EM is especially suitable for image retrieval because the images can be searched in the synthesized low-dimensional feature space, while a kernel-based method has to make classification computation in the original high-dimensional space. Experiments on real image databases show that CFS-EM outperforms Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM), CGP, Discriminant-EM (D-EM) and Transductive-SVM (TSVM) in the sense of classification performance and it is computationally more efficient than RBF-SVM in the query phase.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1352012.1352014", "venue": "TOMCCAP", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1990759220", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1325319", "63449066", "12684542", "14715074", "961425", "63261522", "7953896", "2339440", "10449966", "16153703", "4034894", "110716", "379259", "9650912", "14585493", "14591650", "6027413", "31795221", "4428232", "3246026", "2064887", "6531497", "124985575", "1063642", "686980", "6690236", "6288778", "11039454", "11320785", "7728397", "15214029", "7138354", "13910274", "42282461", "483881", "3195769", "3725761", "14990223", "2237682", "18459015", "16984936", "9873659", "6768478", "5296584"], "inbound_citations": ["55001621", "209393373", "32425618", "16167086", "18834222"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:615472"}

The combination of sampling images with coefficients bigger than a threshold will be taken as the tracking target without any template.

In dual mechanism accounts, such interference depends on irregular frequency but not on the frequency of regulars with the possible exception of high frequency regulars. Such models predict that high and low frequency regulars are equally susceptible to interference from irregulars, or that high frequency regulars would be more affected than low frequency ones. Connectionist single mechanism models, on the other hand, claim that low frequency regulars are more susceptible to interference from irregulars than high frequency regulars. We present results from two experiments that investigate interference from irregulars on the past tense production of high and low frequency regular verbs. In these experiments, high frequency regulars were less affected by interference from phonologically similar irregulars than low frequency regulars. These results support connectionist single mechanism models of past tense verb production. The dichotomy between regular and irregular patterns permeates many levels of language. In many areas, accounting for differences between regular and irregular patterns has become the battlefield on which competing theories of language processing win or lose. One such case, which has received much attention in recent years, is the production of the past tense form of English verbs. This case has become the focus of an ongoing debate between dual mechanism and connectionist single mechanism models of word processing (MacWhinney B. & Leinbach, J., 1991; Marchman et al., 1999; Marcus, 1995a, 1995b, 1996; Pinker 1991, 1999; Pinker & Prince, 1991, Plunket & Marchman, 1993, 1996; Rumlehart & McClelland, 1986; Seidenberg 1997). Dual Mechanism Accounts. In dual mechanism accounts (Marcus, 1995a, 1995b, 1996; Pinker 1991, 1999; Pinker & Prince, 1991), regular past tense is produced via a rule (add \u2013ed) that applies to the root stem of the verb, which is stored in the mental lexicon. Irregulars, on the other hand, are formed via associations between present and past tense forms, each of which is stored as a separate lexical entry. The add \u2013ed rule applies as a default to verbs without a separate lexical past tense entry (regulars and non-words). The existence of a separate past tense entry, as in the case of irregulars, blocks the application of the add \u2013ed rule. However, if the representation of a past tense entry is weak (due to low frequency), the add \u2013ed rule could be applied erroneously, causing an over-regularization error (buy > *buyed). Such errors are well documented both under natural and experimental conditions (Berko, 1958; Bybee & Slobin, 1982; Marcus et al., 1992). In addition to irregulars being regularized, regulars can also be incorrectly produced as if they were irregulars (e.g., vie > *vought). This phenomenon of irregularization has also been documented both in and out of the laboratory (Bybee and Moder, 1983; Xu & Pinker, 1995). Pinker (1999), in his most recent version of a dual mechanism model, provides an account of irregularization. In his model, the word association mechanism responsible for irregular past tense production is a connectionist type neural network that contains both irregular and high frequency regular items. In the course of past tense production, the network attempts to compose a past tense form on the basis of the present tense. Phonological overlap between regular and irregular items can cause two types of interference during this computation. First, an incorrect form may gain enough activation to actually block the add \u2013 ed rule resulting in an irregularization error. Alternatively, regular past tense production could be successful, but the spurious activation caused by interference may slow down production.

Particularly, owing to adversarial learning, the problem of data noise can be handled by adding adversarial perturbations or forcing discriminators to tell the informative and uninformative data examples apart. As for the mitigation of data sparsity issue, the GAN-based models are able to replicate the real distribution of the user-item interactions and augment the available data.

Automatic phrase or syllable detection systems of bird sounds are useful in several applications. However, bird-phrase detection is challenging due to segmentation error, duration variability, limited training data, and background noise. Two spectrograms with identical class labels may look different due to time misalignment and frequency variation. In real recording environments such as in a forest, the data can be corrupted by background interference, such as rain, wind, other animals or even other birds vocalizing. A noise-robust classifier needs to handle such conditions. Similarly, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) works well in quiet environments, but a large degradation in performance is observed when the speech signal is corrupted by background noise. The ASR performance would benefit from robust representations of speech signals and from robust recognition systems.The first topic of this dissertation focuses on an automatic birdsong-phrase recognition system that is robust to limited training data, class variability, and noise. The algorithm comprises a noise-robust Dynamic-Time-Warping (DTW)- based segmentation and a discriminative classifier for outlier rejection. The algorithm utilizes DTW and prominent (high energy) time-frequency regions of training spectrograms to derive a reliable noise-robust template for each phrase class. The resulting template is then used for segmenting continuous recordings to obtain segment candidates whose spectrogram amplitudes in the prominent regions are used as features to a Support Vector Machine (SVM). In addition, we present a novel approach to training HMMs with extremely limited data. First, the algorithm learns the Global Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for all training phrases available. GMM parameters are then used to initialize state parameters of each individual model. The number of states and the mixture components for each state are determined by the acoustic variation of each phrase type. The (high-energy) time-frequency prominent regions are used to compute the state emitting probability to increase noise-robustness.The second topic of the dissertation deals with noise-robust processing for automatic speech recognition. We also propose a new pitch-based spectral enhancement algorithm based on voiced frames for speech analysis and noise-robust speech processing. The proposed algorithm determines a time-warping function (TWF) and the speaker's pitch with high precision, simultaneously. This technique reduces the smearing effect in between harmonics when the fundamental frequency is not constant within the analysis window. To do so, we propose a metric called the harmonic residual which measures the difference between the actual spectrum and the resynthesized spectrum derived from the linear model of speech production with various combinations of TWF and high-precision pitch values as parameters. The TWF and pitch pair that yields the minimum harmonic residual is selected and the enhanced spectrum is obtained accordingly. We show how this new representation can be also used for automatic speech recognition by proposing a robust spectral representation derived from harmonic amplitude interpolation.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2966359829", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13628562"}

Critical to this effort is an understanding of the semantics of such notations, and more generally an understanding of the fundamental notions of 'semantics' and 'meaning'. This report addresses fundamental issues of semantics for computational systems. The question at issue is 'What is it that machines can have that would correspond to the knowledge of meanings that people have and that seem to refer to by the ordinary language term 'meaning'?' The proposed answer is that the notion of truth-conditions can be explicated and made precise by identifying them with a particular kind of abstract procedure and that such procedures can serve as the meaning bearing elements of a theory of semantics suitable for computer implementation. This theory, referred to as 'procedural semantics,' has been the basis of several successful computerized systems and is acquiring increasing interest among philosophers of language.

The problem consists of a number of customers who may at any time of the day place an order on another customer for some package.

The SIs, H, and HCSM were used as input values, and then the PLSR, ANN, and RF were trained using regression techniques. The three different regression techniques were used for modeling and verification to test the stability of the yield estimation. The results showed that: (1) HCSM is strongly correlated with H (R2 = 0.97); (2) of the regression techniques, the best yield prediction was obtained using PLSR, followed closely by ANN, while RF had the worst prediction performance; and (3) the best prediction results were obtained using PLSR and training using a combination of the SIs and HCSM as inputs (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 648.90 kg/ha, NRMSE = 10.63%).

In recent years there has been considerable interest in corpus-based methods for constructing natural language parsers. These empirical approaches replace hand-crafted grammars with linguistic models acquired through automated training over language corpora. A common thread among such methods to date is the use of propositional or probabilistic representations for the learned knowledge. This dissertation presents an alternative approach based on techniques from a subfield of machine learning known as inductive logic programming (ILP). ILP, which investigates the learning of relational (first-order) rules, provides an empirical method for acquiring knowledge within traditional symbolic parsing frameworks. ::: This dissertation details the architecture, implementation and evaluation of C scHILL, a computer system for acquiring natural language parsers by training over corpora of parsed text. C scHILL treats language acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program that implements a shift-reduce parser. Control rules are induced using a novel ILP algorithm which handles difficult issues arising in the induction of search-control heuristics. Both the control-rule framework and the induction algorithm are crucial to C scHILL's success. ::: The main advantage of C scHILL over propositional counterparts is its flexibility in handling varied representations. C scHILL has produced parsers for various analyses including case-role mapping, detailed syntactic parse trees, and a logical form suitable for expressing first-order database queries. All of these tasks are accomplished within the same framework, using a single, general learning method that can acquire new syntactic and semantic categories for resolving ambiguities. ::: Experimental evidence from both artificial and real-world corpora demonstrates that C scHILL learns parsers as well or better than previous artificial neural network or probabilistic approaches on comparable tasks. In the database query domain, which goes beyond the scope of previous empirical approaches, the learned parser outperforms an existing hand-crafted system. These results support the claim that ILP techniques as implemented in C scHILL represent a viable alternative with significant potential advantages over neural-network, propositional, and probabilistic approaches to empirical parser construction.", "year": 1995, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "University of Texas", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1499506821", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208613866", "15904331", "14767534", "201697099", "7756383", "1954146", "6171311", "12831401", "12210211", "14109330", "15299844", "12696810", "208612294", "511880", "18812984", "19435386", "6714837", "14266924", "18672966", "3750904", "6971327", "2964330", "17936607", "15898336", "44594859", "5997985", "15887128", "805082", "9226412", "26703467"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59081657"}

It provides economic, social and health benefits to the inhabitants. Rapid urbanization and increase in population has put extreme pressure on urban green spaces. Therefore, mapping of urban green spaces is important to facilitate the urban planning sustainably. This study has been taken up to map the UGS in the Hisar Municipal Corporation (HMC) area of Haryana State constituting an area of 4197.32 ha using high resolution LISS-IV data of November, 2017. Three different methods namely (a) Onscreen Digitization (b) Support Vector Machine-based classification (SVM) and (c) Multi Resolution Segmentation (MRS) have been tested to extract the green spaces. The onscreen digitization method has been considered as best method as compared to SVM and MRS because of the intervention of human mind and full control on manual editing. The SVM under estimated the green space for HMC with average relative deviation of 15%. However, it extracted the green area precisely without mixing of open spaces. MRS have given good results in terms of total area (relative deviation was 5%), however, spatial distribution of green spaces have been mixed with open spaces. The study identified the green index of HMC and suggested the suitability and sustainability of the city based on World Health Organization (WHO) defined standards.

Many of recent studies toward multi-label learning construct a linear subspace embedding with encoded multi-label information, such that data points sharing many common labels tend to be close to each other in the embedded subspace. Motivated by the advances of compressive sensing research, a sparse representation that selects a compact subset to describe the input data can be more discriminative. In this paper, we propose a sparse multi-label learning method to circumvent the visually polysemous barrier of multiple tags. Our approach learns a multi-label encoded sparse linear embedding space from a related dataset, and maps the target data into the learned new representation space to achieve better annotation performance. Instead of using l1-norm penalty (lasso) to induce sparse representation, we propose to formulate the multi-label learning as a penalized least squares optimization problem with elastic-net penalty.

These guidelines for sex recognition have proven to be subjective and highly labor-intensive. To address this problem, we present a methodology to automatically classify the phenotypic sex using two machine learning methods: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) based on the whole fish appearance and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on caudal fin coloration. Machine learning techniques in sex classification provide potential efficiency with the advantage of automatization and robustness in the prediction process. Furthermore, since developmental plasticity can be influenced by environmental conditions, we have investigated the impact of elevated water temperature during embryogenesis on sex and sex-related differences in color intensity of adult zebrafish. The estimated color intensity based on SVM was then applied to detect the association between coloration and body weight and length. Phenotypic sex classifications using machine learning methods resulted in a high degree of association with the real sex in nontreated animals. In temperature-induced animals, DCNNs reached a performance of 100%, whereas 20% of males were misclassified using SVM due to a lower color intensity. Furthermore, a positive association between color intensity and body weight and length was observed in males. Our study demonstrates that high ambient temperature leads to a lower color intensity in male animals and a positive association of male caudal fin coloration with body weight and length, which appears to play a significant role in sexual attraction.

In particular, butyric acid contributes to host health by facilitating maintenance of epithelial integrity, regulating inflammation, and influencing gene expression in colonocytes. We sought to increase the concentration of butyrate in 20 healthy young adults through dietary supplementation with resistant starch (unmodified potato starch\u2014resistant starch (RS) type 2).MethodsFecal samples were collected from individuals to characterize butyrate concentration via liquid chromatography and composition of the microbiota via surveys of 16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences from the Illumina MiSeq platform. Random Forest and LEfSe analyses were used to associate responses in butyrate production to features of the microbiota.ResultsRS supplementation increased fecal butyrate concentrations in this cohort from 8 to 12 mmol/kg wet feces, but responses varied widely between individuals. Individuals could be categorized into three groups based upon butyrate concentrations before and during RS: enhanced, high, and low (n = 11, 3, and 6, respectively). Fecal butyrate increased by 67 % in the enhanced group (from 9 to 15 mmol/kg), while it remained \u226511 mmol/kg in the high group and \u22648 mmol/kg in the low group. Microbiota analyses revealed that the relative abundance of RS-degrading organisms\u2014Bifidobacterium adolescentis or Ruminococcus bromii\u2014increased from ~2 to 9 % in the enhanced and high groups, but remained at ~1.5 % in the low group. The lack of increase in RS-degrading bacteria in the low group may explain why there was no increase in fecal butyrate in response to RS. The microbiota of individuals in the high group were characterized by an elevated abundance of the butyrogenic microbe Eubacterium rectale (~6 % in high vs. 3 % in enhanced and low groups) throughout the study.ConclusionsWe document the heterogeneous responses in butyrate concentrations upon RS supplementation and identify characteristic of the microbiota that appear to underlie this variation.

The fuzzy-information-granulation-based GA-SVR-ARIMA hybrid model is intended to deal with the problem of imprecision in PPI estimation. The proposed model adopts the fuzzy information-granulation algorithm to pre-classification-process monthly training samples of the PPI, and produced three different sequences of fuzzy information granules, whose Support Vector Regression (SVR) machine forecast models were separately established for their Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization parameters. Finally, the residual errors of the GA-SVR model were rectified through ARIMA modeling, and the PPI estimate was reached. Research shows that the PPI value predicted by this hybrid model is more accurate than that predicted by other models, including ARIMA, GRNN, and GA-SVR, following several comparative experiments.

Therefore, an early identification supporting effective treatments is required to increase the life quality of a wide number of patients. Recently, computer-aided diagnosis tools for dementia using Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans have been successfully proposed to discriminate between patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy controls. Most of the attention has been given to the clinical data, provided by initiatives as the ADNI, supporting reliable researches on intervention, prevention, and treatments of AD. Therefore, there is a need for improving the performance of classification machines. In this paper, we propose a kernel framework for learning metrics that enhances conventional machines and supports the diagnosis of dementia. Our framework aims at building discriminative spaces through the maximization of center kernel alignment function, aiming at improving the discrimination of the three considered neurological classes. The proposed metric learning performance is evaluated on the widely-known ADNI database using three supervised classification machines (\\textit{k}-nn, SVM and NNs) for multi-class and bi-class scenarios from structural MRIs. Specifically, from ADNI collection 286 AD patients, 379 MCI patients and 231 healthy controls are used for development and validation of our proposed metric learning framework. For the experimental validation, we split the data into two subsets: 30% of subjects used like a blindfolded assessment and 70% employed for parameter tuning. Then, in the preprocessing stage, each structural MRI scan a total of $310$ morphological measurements are automatically extracted from by FreeSurfer software package and concatenated to build an input feature matrix. Obtained test performance results, show that including a supervised metric learning improves the compared baseline classifiers in both scenarios. In the multi-class scenario, we achieve the best performance (accuracy 60.1%) for pretrained 1-layered NN, and we obtain measures over 90% in the average for HC vs. AD task.

This enables the generation of intermediate spatial data that corresponds to the original dataset. In the training stage, these models learn to decrease the distance of their output distribution to the actual data and, in the test phase, they map a latent space to the data space. Since these models have already learned their latent space mapping, one question is whether there is a function mapping the latent space to any aspect of the database for the given generator. In this work, it has been shown that this mapping is relatively straightforward using small neural network models and by minimizing the mean square error.

Generative policies can help a coalition system to be more effective when working in a distributed, continuously transforming environment with a diverse set of members, resources, and tasks. Learning mechanisms based on logic programming, e.g., Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), have several properties that make them suitable and attractive for the creation and adaptation of generative policies, such as the ability to learn a general model from a small number of examples, and being able to incorporate existing background knowledge. ILP has recently been extended with the introduction of systems for Inductive Learning of Answer Set Programs (ILASP) which are capable of supporting automated acquisition of complex knowledge such as constraints, preferences and rule-based models. Motivated by the capabilities of ILASP, we present AGENP, an Answer Set Grammar-based Generative Policy Framework for Autonomous Managed Systems (AMS) that aims to support the creation and evolution of generative policies by leveraging ILASP. We describe the framework components, i.e., inputs, data structures, mechanisms to support the refinement and instantiation of policies, identification of policy violations, monitoring of policies, and policy adaptation according to changes in the AMS and its context. Additionally, we present the main work-flow for the global and local refinement of policies and their adaptation based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) for policy representation and reasoning using ILASP.

Our key contribution to this end is a new decentralized approach for learning GANs from non-iid data called Forgiver-First Update (F2U), which a) asks clients to train an individual discriminator with their own data and b) updates a generator to fool the most `forgiving' discriminators who deem generated samples as the most real. Our theoretical analysis proves that this updating strategy allows the decentralized GAN to achieve a generator's distribution with all the input classes as its global optimum based on f-divergence minimization.

A bunch of excellent methods are proposed; however, there are still challenges to generate text rivals the real one by human, such as most machines output fixed length text, or can only generate text quite the same with the input training text. In this paper, we put forward a novel text generation system, called customizable conditional text generative adversarial network, which is capable of generating diverse text content of variable length with customizable emotion label. It is more convenient for generating actual original text with specific sensitive orientation. We propose a conditional text generative adversarial network (CTGAN), in which emotion label is adopted as an input channel to specify the output text, and variable length text generation strategy is put forward. After generating initial texts by CTGAN, to make the generated text data match the real scene, we design an automated word-level replacement strategy, which extracts the keywords (e.g. nouns) from the training texts and replaces the specific keywords in the generated texts. Finally, we design a comprehensive evaluation metric based on various text evaluations, called mixed evaluation metric. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets testify that our proposed CTGAN behaves better than other text generation methods, i.e., generated text are more real compared with the real text than other generation methods, achieving state-of-the-art generation performance.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2018.12.092", "venue": null, "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2953700661", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198434031"}

In mutual learning, students learn from each other and the generalization error is improved even if the teacher has not taken part in the mutual learning. However, in the case of different initial overlaps (direction cosine) between teacher and students, a student with a larger initial overlap tends to have a larger generalization error than that of before the mutual learning.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), most of the algorithms are used to solve problems of syndrome diagnosis that only focus on one syndrome, that is, single label learning. However, in clinical practice, patients may simultaneously have more than one syndrome, which has its own symptoms (signs). Methods. We employed a multilabel learning using the relevant feature for each label (REAL) algorithm to construct a syndrome diagnostic model for chronic gastritis (CG) in TCM. REAL combines feature selection methods to select the significant symptoms (signs) of CG. The method was tested on 919 patients using the standard scale. Results. The highest prediction accuracy was achieved when 20 features were selected. The features selected with the information gain were more consistent with the TCM theory. The lowest average accuracy was 54% using multi-label neural networks (BP-MLL), whereas the highest was 82% using REAL for constructing the diagnostic model.

Different feature selection algorithms have been proposed to overcome this problem but most of them involve complex transformed features, which require high computation and also result in increasing size of the feature set. In this paper, we present a new hybrid method to select features that involves a Differential Evolution (DE) optimization algorithm for searching the feature space to generate the optimal feature subset, with performance evaluated by a classifier. We provide a comprehensive study of the significance of evolutionary algorithm in selecting the best features for EEG signals. The BCI competition III, dataset IVa has been used to evaluate the method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, with an average classification accuracy of above 95% with a minimum of just 10 features.

This study aims to develop a method to perform grid-level damage classification of remote sensing images by detecting the damage corresponding to debris, rubble piles, and heavy spalling within a defined grid, regardless of the aforementioned image characteristics.

In this study supervised models using various radiometric descriptors (histogram of gradient orientations (HoG) and Gabor wavelets) and classifiers (SVM, Random Forests, and Adaboost) were developed for damage classification based on both BoW and conventional global feature representations, and tested with four datasets. Those vary according to the aforementioned image characteristics. The BoW framework outperformed conventional global feature representation approaches in all scenarios (i.e., for all combinations of feature descriptors, classifiers, and datasets), and produced an average accuracy of approximately 90%.

The aim of this study is to generate distribution maps for spruce and pine for entire Bavaria (70.500 km2) at a resolution of about one hectare. For each hectare cell, the fraction coverage of the two tree species is to be specified as well as associated uncertainties. ::: In order to meet these user-defined requirements, a two-step methodology combining satellite imagery at metric to deca-metric resolution was developed. In a first step, tree species maps with a high level of detail were generated from 8-band multispectral WorldView-2 data with 0.5 to 2.0 m spatial resolution. As reference, inventory data from the Bavaria State Forest enterprise was used. Where necessary, additional reference samples were derived from stereo interpretation of aerial images. From this data, detailed tree species maps were generated for roughly 40 sites (each about 100 km2 large) well distributed across Bavaria. For the object-based mapping, spectral information and textural indices were used. The textural measures were generated at several scales with a discrete stationary wavelet transformation (using Red, Near Infrared and NDVI as inputs). The classification itself was performed using Random Forest (RF). Features used in the classification were selected by means of RF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s importance measures. ::: The generated tree species maps were used in a second step as reference information (targets) to generate the fractional coverage maps for the entire country using neural nets.

The sketch-based query, which enjoys the flexibility in representing the user\u2019s intention, has received growing interests in recent years due to the popularization of the touchscreen technology. Essentially, the sketch depicts an abstraction of a shape in a certain view while the shape contains the full 3D information. Matching between them is a cross-modality retrieval problem, and the state-of-the-art solution is to project the sketch and the 3D shape into a common space with which the cross-modality similarity can be calculated by the feature similarity/distance within. However, for a given query, only part of the viewpoints of the 3D shape is representative. Thus, blindly projecting a 3D shape into a feature vector without considering what is the query will inevitably bring query-unrepresentative information. To handle this issue, in this work we propose a Deep Point-to-Subspace Metric Learning (DPSML) framework to project a sketch into a feature vector and a 3D shape into a subspace spanned by a few selected basis feature vectors. The similarity between them is defined as the distance between the query feature vector and its closest point in the subspace by solving an optimization problem on the fly. Note that, the closest point is query-adaptive and can reflect the viewpoint information that is representative to the given query. To efficiently learn such a deep model, we formulate it as a classification problem with a special classifier design. To reduce the redundancy of 3D shapes, we also introduce a Representative-View Selection (RVS) module to select the most representative views of a 3D shape.

Short Message Service (SMS) has become one of the most important media of communications due to the rapid increase of mobile users and it's easy to use operating mechanism. This flood of SMS goes with the problem of spam SMS that are generated by spurious users. The detection of spam SMS has gotten more attention of researchers in recent times and is treated with a number of different machine learning approaches. Supervised machine learning approaches, used so far, demands a large amount of labeled data which is not always available in real applications. The traditional semi-supervised methods can alleviate this problem but may not produce good results if they are provided with only positive and unlabeled data. In this paper, we have proposed a novel semi-supervised learning method which makes use of frequent itemset and ensemble learning ( FIEL ) to overcome this limitation. In this approach, Apriori algorithm has been used for finding the frequent itemset while Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest and LibSVM are used as base learners for ensemble learning which uses majority voting scheme. Our proposed approach works well with small number of positive data and different amounts of unlabeled dataset with higher accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted over UCI SMS spam collection data set, SMS spam collection Corpus v.0.1 Small and Big which show significant improvements in accuracy with very small amount of positive data.

The standalone GPS undergoes signal outages (in forest area) and multipath effects (in urban areas), whereas the standalone INS solution accuracy deteriorates with time. To overcome the limitations of standalone GPS and INS, an integrated INS/GPS system is required for continuous, accurate, and reliable navigation solution. This paper proposes a hybrid method of Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) for INS and GPS data fusion.Traditional filter based fusion techniques like Kalman filter (KF), linearized KF, and particle filter (PF) have deficiencies related to sensor error modeling, immunity to noise, and computational load. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are introduced to overcome these limitations, but they show poor generalization capability in the presence of noise and suffer from over fitting. Recently, RFR is proposed as an efficient fusion technique due to its flexibility to handle non-linear input-output relationships and overcome the over fitting problems. The limitation with RFR is that it cannot handle both linear and non-linear input-output relationships effectively Hence, the paper introduces PCR, which can model linear input-output relationships. Thus, a hybrid approach of RFR and PCR provides enhanced modeling of input-output relationships leading to increased prediction accuracy and thereby improved integrated INS/GPS system performance. The results are validated through five simulated GPS outages taken on real field test data. The proposed model showed a maximum of 45.06% decrement in positional error when compared to RFR.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2015.03.080", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2056869203", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["14990788", "158418088", "4414564", "49728732", "195282115", "210993493", "102354251", "106402685", "204763564"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207109639"}

In this work, we discuss the promises and challenges of exploiting graph learning to deanonymizing cryptocurrencies, which can aid the cyberfighters to circumvent cryptocurrency-based illicit activities.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CNS.2019.8802640", "venue": "2019 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)", "journal": "2019 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2969414314", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11955698", "17572432", "207217947", "141048761", "13999578", "4534396", "4000470", "5483923", "20643241", "59231009", "46945519", "12833486", "53446044", "53285117", "3144218", "58370896", "195993931", "207228970", "1896605", "18740505", "118869331", "2224198", "18992166", "4517676", "4957091", "16069399", "3334975", "120938693", "52908934"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201067641"}

As a result, therange of speech sounds a human is capable of producing may lieon a low dimensional submanifold of the high dimensional spaceof all possible sounds. In this study a number of manifold learningalgorithms are applied to speech data in an effort to extract usefullow dimensional structure from the high dimensional speech sig-nal. The ability of these manifold learning algorithms to separatevowels in a low dimensional space is evaluated and compared to aclassical linear dimensionality reduction method. Results indicatethat manifold learning algorithms outperform classical methods inlow dimensions and are capable of discovering useful manifoldstructure in speech data.Index Terms: speech analysis, manifold learning, dimensionalityreduction, classi\ufb01cation. 1. Introduction In speech processing, the speech signal is often modeled by rela-tively high dimensional features such as discrete Fourier transform(DFT) or linear prediction (LP) coef\ufb01cients. However due to phys-iological constraints the speech production apparatus has relativelyfew degrees of freedom. Thus, humans are only capable of gen-erating a limited range of sounds which occupy a con\ufb01ned regionof the acoustic space. In this case, we can imagine the speech dataas lying on or near a manifold embedded in the high dimensionalacoustic space. It has been proposed that speech intrinsically lieson some such low dimensional manifold [1, 2].It is desirable to reduce the dimensionality of the speech sig-nal prior to processing. Traditionally, signal processing techniqueshave been applied to speech in order to reduce the dimensional-ity by extracting information that is judged to capture informationabout the energy and spectral characteristics of the signal. Theextracted information is often transformed according to some per-ceptually motivated scheme to better model the speech auditorypath; for example, Mel-frequency cepstral coef\ufb01cients (MFCC)and perceptual linear prediction (PLP) parameters. These acousti-cally and perceptually motivated representations are based on ourknowledge and assumptions of speech production and perception,and as such do not attempt to automatically discover the underly-ing low dimensional structure of speech.A number of automatic dimensionality reduction algorithms,driven by the statistics of the data, have been proposed that aimto extract a meaningful low dimensional representation of high di-mensional data. Applications of these dimensionality reductionalgorithms include data compression, visualisation, noise reduc-tion, and feature extraction. Dimensionality reduction methodscan be categorised as linear or nonlinear methods. Linear meth-ods are limited to discovering the structure of data lying on ornear a linear subspace of the high dimensional input space. Themost widely used linear dimensionality reduction methods includethe classic principal component analysis (PCA) [3] and multidi-mensional scaling (MDS). These methods have been applied to awide range of speech processing problems including, feature trans-formation for improved speech recognition performance, speakeradaptation, data compaction, and speech analysis.Jansen and Niyogi [2] have recently shown that certain classesof speech sounds lie on a low dimensional manifold nonlinearlyembedded in the high dimensional acoustic space. A low dimen-sional submanifold such as this may have a highly nonlinear struc-ture that linear methods would fail to discover. Recently, a numberof manifold learning (also referred to as nonlinear dimensionalityreduction) algorithms have been proposed [4, 5, 6] which over-come the limitations of linear methods. These methods have beensuccessfully applied to a number of benchmark manifold problemsand have also proved useful in several image processing applica-tions.Manifold learning algorithms may also be useful in speechanalysis; for example, to project speech into a low dimensionalspace for visualisation or extract features for use in speech recog-nition. However there has been relatively little research conductedin this area to date. A number of exploratory studies have shownthat manifold learning algorithms can be used to successfully vi-sualise speech data in a low dimensional space [7, 6, 8] and forphone classi\ufb01cation [9].In this paper, we apply several manifold learning algorithms\u2014locally linear embedding (LLE) [4, 10], isometric feature mapping(Isomap) [5], and Laplacian eigenmaps [6]\u2014to speech data. Theability of these algorithms to discover low dimensional structurewithin speech data is evaluated and compared. Their performanceis also contrasted with that of the classical, linear, PCA method[3]. This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the man-ifold learning algorithms LLE, Isomap and Laplacian eigenmapsare described. The corpus, experiments and results are detailed inSection 3. Section 4 discusses a number of limitations of the mani-fold learning algorithms.

Sparsity of in situ measurements both spatially and temporally creates hindrance in framing groundwater management policies. Remotely sensed data can be a possible alternative. GRACE satellites can trace groundwater changes globally. Moreover, gridded rainfall (RF) and soil moisture (SM) data can shed some light on the hydrologic system. The present study attempts to use GRACE, RF and SM data at a local scale to predict groundwater level. Ground referencing of satellite data were done by using three machine learning techniques- Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Method (RFM) and Gradient Boosting Mechanism (GBM). The performance of the developed methodology was tested on a part of the Indo-Gangetic basin. The analyses were carried out for nine GRACE pixels to identify relationship between individual well measurements and satellite-derived data.

Medical history data comprises of a number of tests essential to diagnose a particular disease and the diagnosis are based on the experience of the physician; a less experience physician can diagnose a problem incorrectly. Hence, it is possible for the health care industry to increase the advantages through the use of data mining techniques to develop a decision support system (DSS) which will diagnose the problem uniformly and intelligently. Therefore, an effective and intelligent health care DSS for diagnosis of different types of diseases is an essential requirement for health care. Dermatology is a study of skin disease that is extremely complex and difficult to diagnose, and ultimately may be a leading cause of skin cancer. The six different categories of these diseases share the similar clinical features of erythema (Guvenir & Emeksiz, 2000; Elsayad, 2010b). Classification is a robust technique in medical mining. Even though most studies are conducted in the field of classification to diagnose erythemato-squamous diseases, researchers still are working to find the best classifier for this kind of dataset (Ubeyli, 2008 & 2009; Elsayad, 2010b). Several authors (Guvenir, 1998; Guvenir & Emeksiz, 2000; Nanni, 2006; Elsayad, 2010b) have used data mining techniques for the diagnosis of erythemato-squamous disease. Guvenir et al. (1998, 2000) were the pioneers in this area and have done lots of works to develop a classifier. In their work (Guvenir & Emeksiz, 2000), they have developed a graphical user interface (GUI) with all visible information based on nearest neighbor, naive Bayesian and voting features intervals-5 techniques to assist physician involved in this domain. A domain expert physician can use this DSS to diagnose the disease while intern-doctors can use it to verify their knowledge; model has achieved remarkably high classification accuracy of 99.2% based on the data set collected on their own. Other authors (Bojarczuk, 2001; Ubeyli & Guler, 2005; Nani, 2006; Polat & Gunes, 2009; Ubeyli & Dogdu, 2010; Barati et al., 2011) have also used various data mining techniques such as a decision tree, neuro-fuzzy, k-means clustering, and SVM techniques for the same purpose and achieved accuracy between 94.22% to 98.3%. Elsayad (2010b) has investigated this problem and developed a data mining based ensemble model using multilayer neural network, decision tree and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) techniques and got 98.23% classification accuracy. Recently, Xie and Wang (2011) applied support vector machine with novel hybrid feature selection methods and achieved 98.61% classification accuracy. Among all the above authors, Guvenir and Emeksiz (2000) achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99.2%. In this study, we have presented classifications techniques with ensemble of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), for the classification of different categories of erythemato-squamous diseases. The dermatology dataset is taken from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning dataset (web source http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html, last accessed on Jan 2012) to demonstrate the techniques. The classification accuracy obtained in this piece of research work using ensemble model is remarkably close to that of Guvenir and Emeksiz (2000) and is highest among all other models suggested in the literature. The proposed model is the only ensemble model using SVM and artificial neural network techniques with highest classification accuracy of 98.99%. Hence, our model is a competitive model as compared to the model developed by the different authors using data mining techniques.

A rational spatial framework is required to manage continuing invasions and set conservation objectives and priorities. Multispectral satellite imagery is applied to monitor para grass at medium and high spatial resolution on the 225 km2 Magela Creek floodplain of KNP. Knowledge- and object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods are developed to map vegetation, water depth and fire and used to assess: 1) the spatial vulnerability of native vegetation to invasion by para grass; and 2) the spatio-temporal dynamics of para grass on the floodplain. Changes in para grass distribution are mapped over a 42 km2 of the floodplain, biennially from 2002 to 2010 using high spatial resolution imagery. Accuracy was optimised by: 1) applying a novel method to standardise the scale of image objects used in classifications; and 2) testing different classification models built using Stochastic Gradient Boosting. Models were trained using samples from single- or multi-date sources and three different OBIA predictor variable sets. Single-date models were most accurate but not transferrable, possibly due to high temporal variability in wetland features and insufficient number of images. Nett para grass cover, patch connectivity and range increased over the decade, although spatial distribution was highly variable between years. Para grass distribution patterns were defined along a depth habitat gradient and change dynamics was also associated with site-specific fire histories. In years following fire, cover was reduced in \u2018shallow\u2019 and \u2018moderate\u2019 depth habitats but accelerated in \u2018deep\u2019 habitats. \u2018Moderate\u2019 depths showed the greatest rate of increase, more persistent increases occurred within the \u2018shallow\u2019 depth and no significant increase was detected in the \u2018deep\u2019 habitat. Native rice and Hymenachne grassland communities were most vulnerable to invasion. A trade-off is required between the scale, accuracy and precision of data and the need to cover extensive and remote areas in a timely and cost-effective manner. Also, extrapolation and validation at one scale requires comparative information subsampled at finer scales. Adherence to a dedicated protocol for sampling of imagery and field information will reduce inconsistencies contributing to map uncertainty.

In C. elegans genome, DNA helitrons sequences possess great variability in terms of length that varies between 11 and 8965 base pairs (bps) from one sequence to another. In this work, we develop a new method to predict helitrons DNA-sequences, which is particularly based on Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) DNA-images. Thus, we introduce an automatic system in order to classify helitrons families in C. elegans genome, based on a combination between machine learning approaches and features extracted from DNA-sequences. Consequently, the new set of helitrons features (the FCGR images and K-mers) are extracted from DNA sequences. These helitrons features consist of the frequency apparition number of K nucleotides pairs (Tandem Repeat) in the DNA sequences. Indeed, three different classifiers are used for the classification of all existing helitrons families. The results have shown potential global score equal to 72.7% due to FCGR images which constitute helitrons features and the pre-trained neural network as a classifier. The two other classifiers demonstrate that their efficiency reaches 68.7% for Support Vector Machine (SVM) and 91.45% for Random Forest (RF) algorithms using the K-mers features corresponding to the genomic sequences.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.irbm.2019.12.004", "venue": null, "journal": "Irbm", "mag_id": "2998251538", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212978551"}

The use of deep learning in order to teach machines to discriminate between different rooms is a new area of research.

Data augmentation methods have proven useful in addressing this issue in the tasks of sound event detection and scene classification. This paper proposes a method for data augmentation for the task of room classification from reverberant speech. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are trained that generate artificial data as if they were measured in real rooms. This provides additional training examples to the classifiers without the need for any additional data collection, which is time-consuming and often impractical. A representation of acoustic environments is proposed, which is used to train the GANs. The representation is based on a sparse model for the early reflections, a stochastic model for the reverberant tail and a mixing mechanism between the two.

Experimental results show that MrCAR has higher accuracy and better understandability comparing with a typical existing multi relational classification algorithm.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/WISM.2009.60", "venue": "2009 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining", "journal": "2009 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2162269557", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["232928", "6465422", "2243455", "2762813", "18145925", "8095105", "2920446", "15667489", "62120512", "3489319", "10084934", "15259097", "7416822", "1183403", "16914350", "195837802"], "inbound_citations": ["14288228", "16143682", "14559714", "14559714", "15804503"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18665848"}

Despite recent advances, current solutions depend on domain knowledge and are typically driven by visual inspection. In this work, we propose a deep Neural Network (DNN) for representation learning from binary images to predict vein quality. First, driven by the primary target of biometric quality assessment, i.e. verification error minimization, we assume that low quality images are false rejected finger-vein images in a verification system. Based on this assumption, the low and high quality images are labeled automatically. Second, as image processing approaches such as enhancement and segmentation may produce false features and ignore actual ones thus degrading verification accuracy, we train a DNN on binary images and derive deep features from its last hidden layer for quality assessment.

In this study, the Gaussian process regression method is investigated as a potential surrogate model for the computationally expensive variable density model. Gaussian process regression is a nonparametric kernel-based probabilistic model able to handle complex relations between input and output. In this study, the extent of seawater intrusion is represented by the location of the 0.5 kg/m3 iso-chlore at the bottom of the aquifer (seawater intrusion toe). The initial position of the toe, expressed as the distance of the specific line from a number of observation points across the coastline, along with the pumping rates are the surrogate model inputs, whereas the final position of the toe constitutes the output variable set. The training sample of the surrogate model consists of 4000 variable density simulations, which differ not only in the pumping rate pattern but also in the initial concentration distribution. The Latin hypercube sampling method is used to obtain the pumping rate patterns. For comparison purposes, a number of widely used regression methods are employed, specifically regression trees and Support Vector Machine regression (linear and nonlinear). A Bayesian optimization method is applied to all the regressors, to maximize their efficiency in the prediction of seawater intrusion.

However, the usability of cyberspace services is frequently reduced by its lack of customization according to individual needs and preferences.In this thesis we address the cyberspace customization issue by focusing on methods for user representation and prediction. Examples of cyberspace customization include delegation of user data and tasks to software agents, automatic pre-fetching, or pre-processing of service content based on predictions. The cyberspace service types primarily investigated are Mobile Commerce (e.g. news, finance and games) and Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs).First a conceptual software agent architecture for supporting users of mobile commerce services will be presented, including a peer-to-peer based collaborative filtering extension to support product and service recommendations.In order to examine the scalability of the proposed conceptual software agent architecture a simulator for MMOGs is developed. Due to their size and complexity, MMOGs can provide an estimated \u201cupper bound\u201d for the performance requirements of other cyberspace services using similar agent architectures.Prediction of cyberspace user behaviour is considered to be a classification problem, and because of the large and continuously changing nature of cyberspace services there is a need for scalable classifiers. This is handled by proposed classifiers that are incrementally trainable, support a large number of classes, and supports efficient decremental untraining of outdated classification knowledge, and are efficiently parallelized in order to scale well.Finally the incremental classifier is empirically compared with existing classifiers on: 1) general classification data sets, 2) user clickstreams from an actual web usage log, and 3) a synthetic game usage log from the developed MMOG simulator. The proposed incremental classifier is shown to an order of magnitude faster than the other classifiers, significantly more accurate than the naive bayes classifier on the selected data sets, and with insignificantly different accuracy from the other classifiers.The papers leading to this thesis have combined been cited more than 50 times in book, journal, magazine, conference, workshop, thesis, whitepaper and technical report publications at research events and universities in 20 countries. 2 of the papers have been applied in educational settings for university courses in Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden and USA.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In Parallel and Distributed computing for Machine Learning.

From the history, the development of the soft computing model shows that the soft computing techniques can be applied successfully to the prediction of the wave characteristics by making use of experimental data available. Similarly, attempt is made to predict the wave transmission over a submerged reef of tandem breakwater based on the data of Subba Rao developed in 2004 on a tandem breakwater in a 2D wave flume available at NITK Surathkal India using Support Vector Regression (SVR) model with different kernel functions. The non-dimensional input parameters used for the development of the models are five in number. Those inputs are incident wave steepness (Hi/gT2), relative reef crest width (B/Lo), relative reef submergence (F/Hi), relative reef crest height (h/d), depth parameter (d/gT2) and the output as (Ht/Htmax). The 202 data points (70%) are used for training and the 86 data points (30%) for testing out of 288 total data points. The statistical parameters are computed using the predicted and observed data points after training and testing the SVR models. The RBF kernel gives good correlation to the prediction of transmitted wave heights during testing with RMSE as 0.09 and MAE as 0.07.

The goal of our research is to design information extraction models that obtain improved performance by exploiting types of evidence that have not been explored in previous approaches. Since designing an extraction system through introspection by a domain expert is a laborious and time consuming process, the focus of this thesis will be on methods that automatically induce an extraction model by training on a dataset of manually labeled examples. ::: Named Entity Recognition is an information extraction task that is concerned with finding textual mentions of entities that belong to a predefined set of categories. We approach this task as a phrase classification problem, in which candidate phrases from the same document are collectively classified. Global correlations between candidate entities are captured in a model built using the expressive framework of Relational Markov Networks. Additionally, we propose a novel tractable approach to phrase classification for named entity recognition based on a special Junction Tree representation. ::: Classifying entity mentions into a predefined set of categories achieves only a partial disambiguation of the names. This is further refined in the task of Named Entity Disambiguation, where names need to be linked to their actual denotations. In our research, we use Wikipedia as a repository of named entities and propose a ranking approach to disambiguation that exploits learned correlations between words from the name context and categories from the Wikipedia taxonomy. ::: Relation Extraction refers to finding relevant relationships between entities mentioned in text documents. Our approaches to this information extraction task differ in the type and the amount of supervision required. We first propose two relation extraction methods that are trained on documents in which sentences are manually annotated for the required relationships. In the first method, the extraction patterns correspond to sequences of words and word classes anchored at two entity names occurring in the same sentence. These are used as implicit features in a generalized subsequence kernel, with weights computed through training of Support Vector Machines. In the second approach, the implicit extraction features are focused on the shortest path between the two entities in the word-word dependency graph of the sentence. Finally, in a significant departure from previous learning approaches to relation extraction, we propose reducing the amount of required supervision to only a handful of pairs of entities known to exhibit or not exhibit the desired relationship. Each pair is associated with a bag of sentences extracted automatically from a very large corpus. We extend the subsequence kernel to handle this weaker form of supervision, and describe a method for weighting features in order to focus on those correlated with the target relation rather than with the individual entities. The resulting Multiple Instance Learning approach offers a competitive alternative to previous relation extraction methods, at a significantly reduced cost in human supervision.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "14854443", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2862088"}

In addition, many factors can affect local PV production, but proper feature selection is needed to prevent overfitting and multicollinearity. In this study, we perform feature-selective long-term PV power generation predictions based on an ensemble model that combines machine learning methods and traditional time-series predictions. We provide a framework for performing feature selection through correlation analysis and backward elimination, along with an ensemble prediction methodology based on feature selection. Utilities gather predictions from various sources and need to consider them to make accurate forecasts. Our ensemble method can produce accurate predictions using various prediction sources.

In this paper, a new cascade Random Subspace ensembles scheme with reject options is proposed for microscopic biopsy image classification. The classification system is built as a serial fusion of two different Random Subspace classifier ensembles with rejection options to enhance the classification reliability. The first ensemble consists of a set of Support Vector Machine classifiers that converts the original $$K$$ -class classification problem into a number of $$K$$ 2-class problems. The second ensemble consists of a Multi-Layer Perceptron ensemble, that focuses on the rejected samples from the first ensemble. For both of the ensembles, the reject option is implemented by relating the consensus degree from majority voting to a confidence measure, and abstaining to classify ambiguous samples if the consensus degree is lower than some threshold. We also investigated the effectiveness of a feature description approach by combining Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture analysis, statistics derived using the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and the Curvelet Transform. While the LBP analysis efficiently describes local texture properties and the GLCM reflects global texture statistics, the Curvelet Transform is particularly appropriate for the representation of piece-wise smooth images with rich edge information. The combined feature description thus provides a comprehensive biopsy image characterization by taking advantages of their complementary strengths.

In this paper, a swarm intelligence technique based support vector machine classifier (PSO_SVM) is proposed for breast cancer diagnosis. In the proposed PSO-SVM, the issue of model selection and feature selection in SVM is simultaneously solved under particle swarm (PSO optimization) framework. A weighted function is adopted to design the objective function of PSO, which takes into account the average accuracy rates of SVM (ACC), the number of support vectors (SVs) and the selected features simultaneously. Furthermore, time varying acceleration coefficients (TVAC) and inertia weight (TVIW) are employed to efficiently control the local and global search in PSO algorithm. The effectiveness of PSO-SVM has been rigorously evaluated against the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD), which is commonly used among researchers who use machine learning methods for breast cancer diagnosis. The proposed system is compared with the grid search method with feature selection by F-score. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only obtains much more appropriate model parameters and discriminative feature subset, but also needs smaller set of SVs for training, giving high predictive accuracy. In addition, Compared to the existing methods in previous studies, the proposed system can also be regarded as a promising success with the excellent classification accuracy of 99.3% via 10-fold cross validation (CV) analysis. Moreover, a combination of five informative features is identified, which might provide important insights to the nature of the breast cancer disease and give an important clue for the physicians to take a closer attention.

In this thesis, I motivate the search for the gravitational wave signals from coalescing black hole binary systems with total mass between 25 and 100 solar masses. The mechanisms for formation of such systems are not well-understood, and we do not have many observational constraints on the parameters that guide the formation scenarios. Detection of gravitational waves from such systems \u2014 or, in the absence of detection, the tightening of upper limits on the rate of such coalescences \u2014 will provide valuable information that can inform the astrophysics of the formation of these systems. I review the search for these systems and place upper limits on the rate of black hole binary coalescences with total mass between 25 and 100 solar masses. I then show how the sensitivity of this search can be improved by up to 40% by the the application of the multivariate statistical classifier known as a random forest of bagged decision trees to more effectively discriminate between signal and non-Gaussian instrumental noise. I also discuss the use of this classifier in the search for the ringdown signal from the merger of two black holes with total mass between 50 and 450 solar masses and present upper limits. I also apply multivariate statistical classifiers to the problem of quantifying the non-Gaussianity of LIGO data. Despite these improvements, no gravitational-wave signals have been detected in LIGO data so far. However, the use of multivariate statistical classification can significantly improve the sensitivity of the Advanced LIGO detectors to such signals.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.7907/HY26-2059.", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1793350544", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:120384811"}

Adequacy is defined as suitably high recognition performance on a representative set of speech recognition problems. Seven acoustic phonetic problems are selected and discussed in relation to a physiological theory of phonetics. It is argued that the selected tasks are sufficiently representative and difficult to constitute a reasonable test of adequacy. A connectionist network is a fine-grained parallel distributed processing configuration, in which simple processing elements are interconnected by scalar links. A connectionist network model for speech recognition has been defined called the temporal flow model. The model incorporates link propagation delay and internal feedback to express temporal relationships. The model is contrasted with other connectionist models in which time is represented explicitly by separate processing elements for each time sample. It has been shown previously that temporal flow models can be 'trained' to perform successfully some speech recognition tasks. A method of 'learning' using techniques of numerical nonlinear optimization has been demonstrated. Methods for extending these results to the problems selected for this research are presented.

Variance in types of epileptic seizures provides challenge in recognizing the pattern of seizure signals from normal ones. In this paper, we discuss the classification of seizure and non-seizure conditions in epilepsy based on bandwidth features of EEG signals. These features were extracted using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). This method decomposes signal into eight Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and its residue. The IMFs is then analyzed by Hilbert transform to obtain amplitude modulation bandwidth (BAM) and frequency modulation bandwidth (BFM). These features are fed as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM). We propose to combine the first four IMFs to extract bandwidth features and we implement this method on two data sets, public data set that contains signals from both extracranial and intracranial EEG, and data set OF Rumah Sakit Universitas Airlangga (RSUA) that contains signals from extracranial EEG only. The results showed that in general, the values of accuracy and specificity using combined features of first four IMFs outperformed those using features of single IMF, for all SVM kernel functions.

This results in an increased computational burden owing to the concurrent learning of multiple labels. A straightforward approach to address this issue is feature selection; however, it may be insufficient to satisfy the practical constraints because the computational cost for feature selection can be impractical when the number of labels is large.

The design approach is further extended for application into a broader spectrum of climates across the mainland of China, including the severe cold zone, cold zone, hot summer cold winter zone, temperate zone as well as hot summer warm winter zone. The relative weight analysis is first compared with the Fourier Amplitude Transformation Analysis (FAST) in prioritizing the weighting of design inputs for different climatic zones. The relative weight analysis is then proved a feasible alternative sensitivity analysis method when its corresponding multiple linear regression (MLR) model can achieve good prediction performance. Furthermore, a tuning program in R is developed to improve the prediction performance of surrogate models with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm under above climatic zones. The model fitting performance with SVM is proved to be greatly improved by modifying the Sigma and C parameters. Finally, optimum design options under the five climatic zones are discussed in relation to the outdoor thermal, ventilation and solar radiation conditions.

Even though some of these approaches make a correct classification of the voltage events, there are certain operation conditions that are common in real electrical grids, in which the classification criteria, and their corresponding algorithms, make a wrong classification.

In contrast to the existing approaches where supervised or semi-supervised training is done on thousands of images of defects, we investigate whether unsupervised deep learning model for defect detection could be trained with orders of magnitude smaller amount of representative defect-free samples (tenths rather than thousands). This research is motivated by the fact that collection of large amounts of defective samples is difficult and expensive. Our model undergoes only one-class training and aims to extract distinctive semantic features from the normal samples in an unsupervised manner. We propose a variant of transfer learning, that consists of combination of unsupervised learning used upon VGG16 with pre-trained on ImageNet weight coefficients.

The control scheme based on closed-loop pole assignment is then utilized to ensure the time invariance and linearization of the state equations so that the system stability can be guaranteed under some mild assumptions, even in the presence of modelling error. The proposed approach requires a known state vector for the application of pole assignment state feedback. For this purpose, a generalized Kalman filtering algorithm with coloured noise is developed on the basis of the neurofuzzy state-space model to obtain an optimal state vector estimation.

The reduction of the CT radiation dose, however, compromises the signal-to-noise ratio, which affects image quality and diagnostic performance. Recently, deep-learning-based algorithms have achieved promising results in LDCT denoising, especially convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN) architectures. This paper introduces a conveying path-based convolutional encoder-decoder (CPCE) network in 2-D and 3-D configurations within the GAN framework for LDCT denoising. A novel feature of this approach is that an initial 3-D CPCE denoising model can be directly obtained by extending a trained 2-D CNN, which is then fine-tuned to incorporate 3-D spatial information from adjacent slices. Based on the transfer learning from 2-D to 3-D, the 3-D network converges faster and achieves a better denoising performance when compared with a training from scratch. By comparing the CPCE network with recently published work based on the simulated Mayo data set and the real MGH data set, we demonstrate that the 3-D CPCE denoising model has a better performance in that it suppresses image noise and preserves subtle structures.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1802.05656", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6022756", "pubmed_id": "29870379", "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2018.2832217", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging 37(6) (2018) 1522-1534", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2962818993,2787564202", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["75497666", "71326900", "6194273", "75915067", "46028808", "1250615", "3964805", "2286534", "16506022", "21342173", "10145792", "13015620", "2025224", "46931719", "4305082", "35353066", "13979180", "10544758", "1912619", "30344316", "623137", "9433631", "1033682", "207761262", "206771333", "2057420", "10894094", "3719281", "14454389", "18141673", "3074096", "8758543", "980236", "14124313", "6628106", "5707386", "8643626", "206593710", "10749103", "34457769", "207738357", "60385584", "5753308", "3568073"], "inbound_citations": ["51969563", "116023419", "211524054", "67789892", "53785422", "202235186", "210696427", "214715455", "199442316", "204332396", "208280826", "212805248", "53720500", "67769522", "202889307", "19077512", "59232699", "86520045", "198146049", "119337058", "209900849", "46931303", "209140483", "52896379", "204575900", "208006094", "195776120", "51694551", "198985832", "195833625", "195699640", "195882672", "195459963", "209695984", "58950081", "189929529", "202539316", "203605805", "117723853", "204743742"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3283965"}

However, existing network embedding methods mainly focus on single network embedding and neglect the information shared among different networks.

The method is encoded in the program SCREEN (Surface Cavity REcognition and EvaluatioN). As a first test of the utility of our approach we used SCREEN to locate and analyze the surface cavities of a nonredundant set of 99 proteins cocrystallized with drugs. We find that this set of proteins has on average about 14 distinct cavities per protein. In all cases, a drug is bound at one (and sometimes more than one) of these cavities. Using cavity size alone as a criterion for predicting drug-binding sites yields a high balanced error rate of 15.7%, with only 71.7% coverage. Here we characterize each surface cavity by computing a comprehensive set of 408 physicochemical, structural, and geometric attributes. By applying modern machine learning techniques (Random Forests) we were able to develop a classifier that can identify drug-binding cavities with a balanced error rate of 7.2% and coverage of 88.9%. Only 18 of the 408 cavity attributes had a statistically significant role in the prediction. Of these 18 important attributes, almost all involved size and shape rather than physicochemical properties of the surface cavity. The implications of these results are discussed.

There are many design aspects to a bug predictor, each of which has several options, i.e., software metrics, machine learning model, and response variable. Aims: These design decisions should be judiciously made because an improper choice in any of them might lead to wrong, misleading, or even useless results. We argue that bug prediction configurations are intertwined and thus need to be evaluated in their entirety, in contrast to the common practice in the field where each aspect is investigated in isolation. Method: We use a cost-aware evaluation scheme to evaluate 60 different bug prediction configuration combinations on five open source Java projects. Results: We find out that the best choices for building a cost-effective bug predictor are change metrics mixed with source code metrics as independent variables, Random Forest as the machine learning model, and the number of bugs as the response variable. Combining these configuration options results in the most efficient bug predictor across all subject systems.

The Adaptive Boosting in short considered to be AdaBoost algorithm. The classification of the multiple discrete weak classifiers allowing the formation of strong classifier by integrating, provides better improved performance using the concept of AdaBoost. The AdaBoost is used widely in almost all fields like physical sensing, chemical sensing, bio sensing etc. This paper primarily based on analyzing the spectrum from the bio sensors. The major role of the machine language is that it gives the accurate outputs which is easily understood by all the humans without having the knowledge on that particular field.

We applied the new and standard RF approaches to case-control alcohol dependence data from the Study of Addiction: Genes and Environment (SAGE), and compared the performance of the alternative approaches via a simulation study. Standard RF applied to a case-control study of alcohol dependence yielded inflated variable importance estimates for X SNPs, even when sex was included as a variable, but the results of the new RF methods were consistent with univariate regression-based approaches that correctly model X chromosome data. Simulations showed that the new RF methods eliminate the bias in standard RF variable importance for X SNPs when sex is associated with the trait, and are able to detect causal autosomal and X SNPs. Even in the absence of sex effects, the new extensions perform similarly to standard RF. Thus, we provide a powerful multimarker approach for genetic analysis that accommodates X chromosome data in an unbiased way.

Hence, discovering efficient ways to analyse and visualise stock market data is considered a significant issue in modern finance. The use of Data Mining (DM) techniques to predict stock market has been extensively studied using historical market prices but such approaches are constrained to make assessments within the scope of existing information, and thus they are not able to model any random behaviour of stock market or provide causes behind events. One area of limited success in stock market prediction comes from textual data, which is a rich source of information and analysing it may provide better understanding of random behaviours of the market. Text Mining (TM) combined with Random Forest (RF) algorithm offers a novel approach to study critical indicators, which contribute to the prediction of stock market abnormal movements.

A multi-detector approach of facial feature point localization has been utilized for identifying these points of interest from the contours of facial components such as eyes, eyebrows and mouth. Feature vectors composed of eleven features are then obtained by calculating the degree of displacement of these eleven feature points from a non-changeable rigid point. Finally, the obtained feature sets are used to train a SVM classifier so that it can classify facial expressions when given to it in the form of a feature set.

Albeit triplet approaches being powerful, their computational complexity mostly limits training to only a subset of all possible training triplets. Thus, sampling strategies that decide when to use which training sample during learning are crucial. Currently, the prominent paradigm are fixed or curriculum sampling strategies that are predefined before training starts. However, the problem truly calls for a sampling process that adjusts based on the actual state of the similarity representation during training. We, therefore, employ reinforcement learning and have a teacher network adjust the sampling distribution based on the current state of the learner network, which represents visual similarity.

Moreover, although our adaptive sampling is only applied on top of basic triplet-learning frameworks, we reach competitive results to state-of-the-art approaches that employ diverse additional learning signals or strong ensemble architectures.

In this paper, we have predicted PPI between dengue and its human host combining amino acid composition and the conjoint triad of human protein sequences as a feature vector.

The main goal of this study is to investigate the impact of major GLCM parameters including quantization level, displacement magnitudes, displacement direction and GLCM features on skin segmentation and classification performance. Each of these parameters has been assessed and optimized using an exhaustive supervised search from a fairly large initial feature space. Three supervised classifiers including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Multilayer Perceptron have been employed to evaluate the performance of the feature space subsets.

The MapReduce parallel programming paradigm supported in the Apache Hadoop environment is adopted. A benchmark mRNA dataset of 14 tumor types was used to evaluate the classification framework. Accurate tumor classification based on gene expression profiles (GEP) has great promise for early diagnosis and clinical prognosis of cancers. However, GEP samples are usually very highly dimensional and statistically differentially expressed genes are not always tumor-related. In the experiment, when the number of servers increased from 1 to 10, the training time of the classifier was significantly reduced from 22.06 to 2.33 days. The classification accuracy reached to 94 %, a significant improvement over previous studies (78 and 90 %).

The application results of practical vibration data state forecasting measured from a Co2 compressor demonstrate that the GA-SVR model outperforms the existing neural network based on the criteria of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE).", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICNC.2009.176", "venue": "2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation", "journal": "2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2118983555", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "19196574", "53879697", "5398743", "18860538", "155819250", "5175461", "2715867"], "inbound_citations": ["46962667", "17212594"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:535436"}

In this study, a discretionary cut-in risk model for vehicles is developed on the basis of field driving data and machine learning methods, namely, decision trees and Support Vector Machine (SVM). A united algorithm is developed to combine the two machine learning models for achieving enhanced conservativeness to the traffic states with high misclassification costs. To build the naturalistic driving database, the wavelet method is employed for filtering; the K-means approach, an unsupervised data learning method, is used to categorize the cut-in impact on the following vehicles in the target lane into three groups. The impact is indicated by the following vehicle\u2019s average and maximum deceleration.

We propose to address this task in the framework of the multi-objective optimization. A multi-objective function is defined based on a set of two (or more) metrics (e.g., mean squared error MSE and determination coefficient R2 ) that quantify from different (and sometimes competing) perspectives the goodness of a given parameter configuration. Then the metrics are jointly optimized according to the concept of Pareto optimality. This allows preserving the meaning of each metric and deriving multiple optimal solutions to the tuning problem. Each solution leads to a different optimal trade-off among the considered metrics. The main advantages of the proposed multi-objective parameter optimization approach with respect to traditional mono-objective strategies are: (1) the intrinsic improved robustness and efficiency, since multiple metrics are jointly exploited in the tuning of the free parameters of the considered regression method; and (2) the possibility to select the parameter configuration that leads to the desired trade-off among different criteria and thus best meets both the application constraints and the requirements of the specific estimation problem. The experimental analysis was focused on the challenging application domain of soil moisture retrieval from microwave remotely sensed data. The results obtained on data sets associated with two different operative conditions are very promising and show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with more traditional tuning strategies based on a single metric and its usefulness in defining estimation systems for real application domains.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2197178", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2038476006", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["129638151", "128946847", "126792213", "28748644", "4834278", "17636727", "18158266", "25603326", "1158286", "7006500", "3050830", "7138354", "8762930", "10745580", "12508011", "19893538", "5879455", "58731659", "5543127", "9585527", "2480872", "59867393", "59342666", "15770173", "18026914", "1068949", "152409705", "2464198", "2522644", "121599594", "1722599", "11072540", "1558680", "34945964", "54795591", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["52087779", "45387241", "3268354", "34101435", "52984588", "202689034", "9931210", "17388524", "134229316", "23085530", "2200282", "52302036", "18402435", "133887593"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20485387"}

But, the usage of MRI is limited by its slow acquisition time, which makes it expensive and causes patient discomfort. In order to accelerate the acquisition, multiple deep learning networks have been proposed. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown promising results in MRI reconstruction. The drawback with the proposed GAN based methods is it does not incorporate the prior information about the end goal which could help in better reconstruction. For instance, in the case of cardiac MRI, the physician would be interested in the heart region which is of diagnostic relevance while excluding the peripheral regions. In this work, we show that incorporating prior information about a region of interest in the model would offer better performance. Thereby, we propose a novel GAN based architecture, Reconstruction Global-Local GAN (Recon-GLGAN) for MRI reconstruction. The proposed model contains a generator and a context discriminator which incorporates global and local contextual information from images. Our model offers significant performance improvement over the baseline models. Our experiments show that the concept of a context discriminator can be extended to existing GAN based reconstruction models to offer better performance.

The attentional selection simulation show that as one channel is attenuated, the system exhibits attentional capture in which only the more intense stimulus is transmitted to higher levels. The signal maintenance simulations show that small levels of auto-associative feedback can faithfully maintain short bursts of input for extended periods of time. With high auto-associative feedback, one module can buffer information from a pervious transmission while the module blocks the interference resulting from concurrent transmissions.

To overcome this problem, the weights of the networks are trained on line.

However, determining drug-target interactions (DTIs) and potential protein-compound interactions by biological experiment based method alone is a very complicated, expensive and time-consuming process. Hence, there is an intense motivation to design in silico prediction methods to overcome these obstacles. In this work, we designed a novel in silico strategy to predict proteome-scale DTIs based on the assumption that DTI pairs can be expressed through the evolutionary information derived from frequency profiles and drugs' structural properties. To achieve this, drug molecules are encoded into the substructure fingerprints to represent certain fragments; target proteins are first converted into Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), and then encoded as 2-dimensional Principal Component Analysis (2DPCA) descriptors. In the prediction phase, the feature weighted Rotation Forest (RF) classifier is used to estimate whether drug and target interact with each other on four benchmark datasets, including Enzymes, Ion Channels, GPCRs and Nuclear Receptors. The prediction accuracy of cross-validation on the four datasets is 95.40%, 88.82%, 85.67%, and 82.22%, respectively. In order to have a clearer assessment of the proposed approach, we compared it with the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) descriptors model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier model and existing excellent approaches, including DBSI, NetCBP, KBMF2K, SIMCOMP and RFDT.

This may become crucial in the case of Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) applications, especially for the slot-filling task where models have to deal often with a high number of target labels. Conditional Random Fields (CRF) were previously considered as the most efficient algorithm in these conditions. More recently, different architectures of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been proposed for the SLU slot-filling task. Most of them, however, have been successfully evaluated on the simple ATIS database, on which it is difficult to draw significant conclusions. In this paper we propose new variants of RNNs able to learn efficiently and effectively label dependencies by integrating label embeddings.

In addition, such degraded images drastically affect performance of vision systems. Hence, it is important to solve the problem of single image de-raining/de-snowing. However, this is a difficult problem to solve due to its inherent ill-posed nature. Existing approaches attempt to introduce prior information to convert it into a well-posed problem. In this paper, we investigate a new point of view in addressing the single image de-raining problem. Instead of focusing only on deciding what is a good prior or a good framework to achieve good quantitative and qualitative performance, we also ensure that the de-rained image itself does not degrade the performance of a given computer vision algorithm such as detection and classification. In other words, the de-rained result should be indistinguishable from its corresponding clear image to a given discriminator. This criterion can be directly incorporated into the optimization framework by using the recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). To minimize artifacts introduced by GANs and ensure better visual quality, a new refined loss function is introduced. Based on this, we propose a novel single image de-raining method called Image De-raining Conditional General Adversarial Network (ID-CGAN), which considers quantitative, visual and also discriminative performance into the objective function. Experiments evaluated on synthetic images and real images show that the proposed method outperforms many recent state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods in terms of quantitative and visual performance.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1701.05957", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/tcsvt.2019.2920407", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2949174256,2963017889,2580458810", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1773169", "500435", "878806", "6744618", "62585859", "206818050", "15197266", "14460720", "9007541", "16379966", "1372266", "313985", "11758569", "6200260", "2202933", "211227", "25639151", "13002976", "1033682", "9494295", "12803511", "14984990", "1687220", "302491", "15876696", "18781152", "2202933", "1277217", "1563370", "2581941", "8758543", "56507745", "102496818", "206593185", "206594470", "13914930", "980236", "7032320", "13852540", "13271756", "980236", "14124313", "14301455", "206764694", "447975", "207761262", "14488670", "53307495", "14365368", "6628106"], "inbound_citations": ["199488391", "214713946", "5039079", "57373829", "202572625", "68540", "13685186", "204837115", "11049683", "210696277", "195657934", "53011298", "54439393", "119188226", "53039974", "202790016", "49864080", "53285580", "199489830", "57189262", "127065461", "52288835", "52290830", "208267912", "147704304", "201646439", "212708911", "50781207", "214623217", "213183248", "53731944", "4000182", "199488943", "58004880", "207950461", "104292300", "3760713", "192472084", "210088149", "49535889", "59316941", "51987847", "211242921", "211242921", "53291833", "13742055", "53039548", "208909744", "54437726", "174802589", "58576153", "52860200", "54609273", "13682113", "81986960", "208202148", "208202148", "212670927", "208281557", "208632525", "8858625", "10307745", "56170488", "25931462", "3397048", "38737775", "198190021", "204837551", "201067400", "3619954", "209376401", "210872935", "195654199", "52970654", "50784154", "208527596", "209376714", "209380692", "214610638", "210931979", "206849289", "3574580", "76663699", "53209050", "209460529", "211252826", "155107217", "213497657", "140215534", "43969617", "204836706", "4054776", "211554051", "208162406", "207831043", "202776190", "126324422", "59222564", "52860247", "28659025", "214692477", "202888825", "5017092", "3316514", "201872807", "3406592", "59389144", "210716444", "4563057", "211298025", "351964", "49559640", "58008038", "85503441", "209006418", "84187160", "203836195", "209445203", "214679994", "196200098", "210971201", "52288176", "21712570", "214713538", "13709403", "85502671", "214713540", "214596246", "86757630", "202660933", "210838848", "5033954", "3987902", "198917523", "4696758", "52096521", "209463459", "52286244", "212637030", "185542", "14010188", "2099022", "3680335", "49298083", "51875074", "54796531", "211206014", "209366918", "3614800", "210157916", "207986101", "4103993", "209439913", "59413813", "59234295", "91184545", "51909334", "213177174", "52838862", "3634386", "202542259", "3678780", "132043068", "210967146", "209376164", "209376164", "3671077", "52986191", "198930679", "198930679", "4609212", "50786650", "212647851", "210995815", "201646146", "51990067", "3853189", "52988330", "209314976", "53115897", "199489226", "214604229", "201657369", "56475902", "56475902", "214900427", "26910155", "210887880", "214672971"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11922819"}

Given the increasing recognition of heterogeneous market structure, this paper proposes an alternative Slantlet denoising based hybrid methodology that attempts to incorporate the linear and nonlinear data features. The recently emerging Slantlet analysis is introduced to separate the linear data features as it constructs filters with varying lengths at different scales and has more appealing time localization features than the normal wavelet analysis. Meanwhile, the Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) is used to model and correct for the empirical errors nonlinear in nature. As empirical studies were conducted in the Euro exchange rate market, the performance of the proposed algorithm was compared with those of benchmark models including random walk, ARMA and LSSVR models.

Top-down or bottom-up procedures for labelling the nodes in the hierarchy have recently been proposed, but they rely largely on pairwise interactions, thus susceptible to get stuck in local optima. In this paper, we remedy this problem by directly finding a small number of label paths that can cover the desired subgraph in a tree/DAG. To estimate the high-dimensional label vector, we adopt the advantages of partial least squares techniques which perform simultaneous projections of the feature and label space, while constructing sound linear models between them. We then show that the optimal label prediction problem with hierarchy constraints can be reasonably transformed into the optimal path prediction problem with the structured sparsity penalties. The introduction of path selection models further allows us to leverage the efficient network flow solvers with polynomial time complexity.

It provides appropriate guidance on granting loans and reduces risks in the financial area. Hence, companies and banks are trying to use novel automated solutions to deal with CS challenge to protect their own finances and customers. Nowadays, different machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) algorithms have been used to improve various aspects of CS prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology, named Deep Genetic Hierarchical Network of Learners (DGHNL). The proposed methodology comprises different types of learners, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN), and fuzzy systems. The Statlog German (1000 instances) credit approval dataset available in the UCI machine learning repository is used to test the effectiveness of our model in the CS domain. Our DGHNL model encompasses five kinds of learners, two kinds of data normalization procedures, two extraction of features methods, three kinds of kernel functions, and three kinds of parameter optimizations. Furthermore, the model applies deep learning, ensemble learning, supervised training, layered learning, genetic selection of features (attributes), genetic optimization of learners parameters, and novel genetic layered training (selection of learners) approaches used along with the cross-validation (CV) training-testing method (stratified 10-fold). The novelty of our approach relies on a proper flow and fusion of information (DGHNL structure and its optimization). We show that the proposed DGHNL model with a 29-layer structure is capable to achieve the prediction accuracy of 94.60% (54 errors per 1000 classifications) for the Statlog German credit approval data.

Individual desktop computers are no longer suitable to analyse terabyte, and potentially petabytes, of brain images. To fill in the gap between data acquisition and information extraction, e-infrastructures are being developing in North America, Canada, and Europe. E-infrastructures allow neuroscientists to conduct neuroimaging experiments using dedicated computational resources such as grids, high-performance computing (HPC) systems, and public/private clouds. Today, e-infrastructures are the most advanced and the best equipped systems to support the creation of advanced multimodal and multiscale models of the AD brain (chapter 2) or to validate promising imaging biomarkers with sophisticated pipelines, as for cortical thickness, (chapter 3). Indeed, imaging analyses such as those described in chapter 2 and 3 expand the amount of post-processed data per single study. In order to cope with the huge amount of post-processing data generated via e-infrastructures, an automatic quality control environment (QCE) of the cortical delineation algorithms is proposed (chapter 4). QCE is a machine learning (ML) classifier with a supervised learning approach based on Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) estimators. Given its scalability and efficacy, QCE fits well in the e-infrastructures under development, where this kind of sanity check service is still lacking. QCE represents a unique opportunity to process data more easily and quickly, allowing neuroscientists to spend their valuable time do data analysis instead of using their resources in manual quality control work.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2757652876,2962067020", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Political Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:164408008"}

In this paper, a texture feature, Completed Local Binary Patterns (CLBP), which is highly suitable for face recognition, is presented and applied to vegetation classification using high spatial resolution Pleiades satellite imagery in the central zone of Yancheng National Natural Reservation (YNNR) in Jiangsu, China. To demonstrate the potential of CLBP texture features, Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture features were used to compare the classification. Using spectral data alone and spectral data combined with texture features, the image was classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on vegetation types. The results show that CLBP and GLCM texture features yielded an accuracy 6.50% higher than that gained when using only spectral information for vegetation classification. However, CLBP showed greater improvement in terms of classification accuracy than GLCM for Spartina alterniflora. Furthermore, for the CLBP features, CLBP_magnitude (CLBP_m) was more effective than CLBP_sign (CLBP_s), CLBP_center (CLBP_c), and CLBP_s/m or CLBP_s/m/c.

Traditional semi-supervised Non-Parametric Kernel Learning (NPKL) methods usually formulate the learning task as a Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) problem, which is very time consuming. Although some fast semi-supervised NPKL methods have been proposed recently, they usually scale very poorly. Furthermore, many semi-supervised NPKL methods are developed based on the manifold assumption. But, such an assumption might be invalid when handling some high-dimensional and sparse data, which has severely negative effect on the performance of learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a more efficient semi-supervised NPKL method, which can effectively learn a low-rank kernel matrix from must-link and cannot-link constraints. Specially, by virtue of the nonlinear spectral embedded technique based on extreme learning machine (ELM), the proposed method has the ability of coping with data points that do not have a clear manifold structure in a low dimensional space. The proposed method is formulated as a trace ratio optimization problem, which is combined with dimensionality reduction in ELM feature space and aims to find optimal low-rank kernel matrices. The proposed optimization problem can be solved much more efficiently than SDP solvers.

We show in this paper that these two intrinsic properties lead to produce simple conditions for the test error to be bounded by the OOB error. Conditions come with the only required and usual assumptions which are the i.i.d one and the existence of first and second order moments. The main interest is that the OOB error is explicitly known, hence one just needs a training set without any other assumption on the model behind the data. As a practical case, we use Random Uniform Forests (Ciss, 2015a), a variant of Random Forests (Breiman, 2001) that inherits of all properties of the latter, to show how OOB bounds apply. We also provide an R package, randomUniformForest, allowing to experiment all the arguments described in the paper.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2598367266", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["14463568", "1290347", "60993494", "207738357", "50814231", "89141", "62729017", "116929976", "7955044", "16190154", "15137276", "206420153", "2469856", "8869713", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": ["52964908"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126361844"}

Currently, most organizations use cloud computing services (public or private) as part of their computer infrastructure. Virtualization technology is at the core of cloud computing, and virtual resources, such as virtual servers, are commonly used to provide services to the entire organization. Due to their importance and prevalence, virtual servers in an organizational cloud are constantly targeted by cyber-attackers who try to inject malicious code or malware into the server (e.g., ransomware). Many times, server administrators are not aware that the server has been compromised, despite the presence of detection solutions on the server (e.g., antivirus engine). In other cases, the breach is detected after a long period of time when significant damage has already occurred. Thus, detecting that a virtual server has been compromised is extremely important for organizational security. Existing security solutions that are installed on the server (e.g., antivirus) are considered untrusted, since malware (particularly sophisticated ones) can evade them. Moreover, these tools are largely incapable of detecting new unknown malware. Machine learning (ML) methods have been shown to be effective at detecting malware in various domains. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for trusted detection of ransomware in virtual servers on an organization's private cloud. We conducted trusted analysis of volatile memory dumps taken from a virtual machine (memory forensics), using the Volatility framework, and created general descriptive meta-features. We leveraged these meta-features, using machine learning algorithms, for the detection of unknown ransomware in virtual servers. We evaluated our methodology extensively in five comprehensive experiments of increasing difficulty, on two different popular servers (IIS server and an email server). We used a collection of real-world, professional, and notorious ransomware and a collection of legitimate programs. The results show that our methodology is able to detect anomalous states of a virtual machine, as well as the presence of both known and unknown ransomware, obtaining the following results: TPR = 1, FPR = 0.052, F-measure = 0.976, and AUC = 0.966, using the Random Forest classifier. Finally, we showed that our proposed methodology is also capable of detecting an additional type of malware known as a remote access Trojan (RAT), which is used to attack organizational VMs.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2018.02.039", "venue": "Expert Syst.

Predictive models for the determination of TAN using the IR data measured from ashless dispersant oils developed for aviation piston engines (SAE 50) have been developed.

Hepatotoxicity is one of the major reasons for withdrawal of drugs from the market due to the fact that the liver is the major organ involved in drug metabolism and it can generate toxic metabolites. There is a need to screen the molecules for drug-induced hepatotoxicity in human at an earlier stage. Transcriptomics is a technique widely used to screen molecules for toxicity and to unravel toxicity mechanisms. The aim of this study was to classify known hepatotoxicants on their phenotype of toxicity using gene expression profiles ex vivo in human precision-cut liver slices (PCLS). Hepatotoxicants which are known to induce either necrosis (n=5) or cholestasis (n=5) were used at concentrations inducing low ( <20%) and medium (30-50%) toxicity, based on ATP or LDH. Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms were used to classify hepatotoxicants using leave one-compound-out cross-validation method. Optimized biomarkers sets for each of the cross-validation steps were used to derive a consensus list of markers. In this approach, the classification correctly predicts the phenotype of toxicity with an accuracy of 70-80%. The classification is slightly better for the low than for the medium toxicity. The consensus list of markers includes bile acid transporter (SLC10A7), cholesterol and lipid metabolism and transport (HACL1 and SORL1), heat shock and other stress response genes. This study shows that human PCLS are a useful model to predict the phenotype of drug-induced hepatotoxicity.

Cable joints are the weakest point in the XLPE cables and most susceptible to insulation failures. Any cable joint insulation breakdown may cause a huge loss to power companies. Therefore, it is vital to diagnose the insulation quality to detect early signs of insulation failure. Partial discharge (PD) measurement is a vital tool for assessing the insulation quality at cable joints. Since the past, there have been many pattern recognition methods to classify PD, where each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Although many works have been done on PD pattern recognition, it is usually performed in a noise-free environment. Also, works on PD pattern recognition are mostly done on lab fabricated insulators, where works using actual cable joints are less likely to be found in literature. Therefore, in this work, classification of real cable joint defect types using partial discharge measurement under noisy environment was performed. Five cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable joints with artificially created defects were prepared based on the defects commonly encountered on site. A novel high noise tolerance principal component analysis (PCA)-based feature extraction was proposed and compared against conventional input features such as statistical features and fractal features. These input features were used to train the classifiers to classify each PD defect type. Classifications were performed using three different artificial intelligence classifiers, which include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance of each classifier and feature extraction method was evaluated. It was found that SVM and ANN performed well while ANFIS classification accuracy was the weakest.

Especially, estimating the quality of a single protein model, which is important for selecting a few good models out of a large model pool consisting of mostly low-quality models, is still a largely unsolved problem. We introduce a novel single-model quality assessment method DeepQA based on deep belief network that utilizes a number of selected features describing the quality of a model from different perspectives, such as energy, physio-chemical characteristics, and structural information. The deep belief network is trained on several large datasets consisting of models from the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments, several publicly available datasets, and models generated by our in-house ab initio method. Our experiments demonstrate that deep belief network has better performance compared to Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks on the protein model quality assessment problem, and our method DeepQA achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CASP11 dataset.

Moreover, in most cases we consider several factors deciding which route to choose: we need silent and green at the same time, beautiful as well as illuminated and etc. In most studies this factors are taking into account separately. In our research, using an example of Saint-Petersburg, we developed the prototype application suggesting attractive walking route for pedestrians considering the combination of different factors besides it\u2019s length. To estimate true score of places from the point of walking attractiveness we conducted a questionnaire, and collected scores of attractiveness in the different places of the city. The acquired samples were used to create model defining attractiveness of place by combination of different factors such as noise, architecture, density of photos and proximity of water bodies as well as green and industrial zones. The model created by Random Forest algorithm classifies places in three groups: attractive, mid-attractive and non-attractive with f1 - scores about 0.6; Using this model, we determined the attractiveness index of all of the footways in the city.

Understanding the characteristics that may predispose a species to infection by a particular pathogen can help direct conservation efforts. Recent declines in amphibian populations world-wide are a major conservation issue and may be caused in part by a fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). We used Random Forest, a machine learning approach, to identify species-level characteristics that may be related to susceptibility to Bd. Our results suggest that body size at maturity, aspects of egg laying behavior, taxonomic order and family, and reliance on water are good predictors of docu- mented infection for species in the continental United States. These results suggest that, whereas local-scale environmental variables are important to the spread of Bd, species-level characteristics may also influence susceptibility to Bd. The relationships identified in this study suggest future experimental tests, and may target species for conservation efforts.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10531-011-0066-4", "venue": "Biodiversity and Conservation", "journal": "Biodiversity and Conservation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2125911319,2186945695", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["37171589", "19265405", "82833096", "31635270", "37487915", "85365837", "27623476", "89141", "81785803", "25198810", "84759690", "86314655", "24875553", "83647169", "15880873", "85720710", "21276950", "31941830", "2686566", "24559253", "18611733", "84272576", "85746200", "13154309", "21929829", "31214803", "85015019", "1810623"], "inbound_citations": ["215080418", "3829270", "82706398", "214993880", "8790434", "55902979", "352378", "3012184", "30070159", "84971686", "215201792", "206565192", "88047031", "215061729", "2147958", "83469873", "208555501", "18810234", "1349697", "89411354", "8738308", "29370517", "53555585", "46944481", "4626830"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35800472"}

This accurate information about protein locations in a cell facilitates in the understanding of the function of a protein and further interaction in the cellular environment. We proposed a novel GNeg-CEF approach for predicting gram-negative bacterial subcellular locations. In the proposed scheme, we exploited diversity both in feature and decision spaces. In order to exploit diversity in feature space, we used six feature extraction strategies; Amino Acid Composition (AAC), Split Amino Acid Composition (SAAC), Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC) parallel, PseAAC Series, Dipeptide Composition (DC), and Sequential Evolution (PseEvo). Diversity in decision space is exploited using three state of the art classification models; Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Back Propagation Neural Network. First, the performance of individual ensemble classifiers for single feature extraction technique is evaluated. Next, the improved performance of the composite ensemble GNeg-CEF of all individual ensembles is investigated using majority voting scheme for gram-negative bacterial protein dataset.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICET.2012.6375475", "venue": "2012 International Conference on Emerging Technologies", "journal": "2012 International Conference on Emerging Technologies", "mag_id": "2019151124", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22144142"}
