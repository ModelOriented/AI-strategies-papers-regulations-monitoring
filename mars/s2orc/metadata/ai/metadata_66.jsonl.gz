Current diagnosis is based on a set of psychiatrist-applied diagnostic criteria. There can be considerable differences between diagnostic classification based upon either the set of criteria used, or the individual who applies the criteria. For this reason, the development of an objective test to inform the diagnosis could be highly beneficial. Objectives To assess the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a potential diagnostic tool for schizophrenia, with a particular focus on the application of SVM to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. Aims To show the use of SVM on MRI data to be a potentially viable diagnostic test. Method A systematic literature search was carried out using the PubMed database, Web of Knowledge as well as Google Scholar. This search was conducted using the terms \u2018Schizophrenia\u2019, \u2018SVM\u2019/\u2018Support Vector Machine\u2019 and \u2018MRI/fMRI\u2019. This was followed by the application of criteria relating to relevance to the desired search topic (as assesed by the author). Ten publications were identified as relevant. Results Results showed strong evidence that the application of SVM to MRI data can reliably differentiate between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Conclusions The results indicate that using SVM to analyse MRI data can be reliably used to identify schizophrenia, although there is some variability between the results produced.

The DNA binding paired domains of the Pax transcription factors, which are our main focus, show seemingly fuzzy and degenerate binding to various DNA targets, and paired domain-DNA binding is not a problem well suited for previously proposed algorithms. Here, we introduce a simple way to use rule induction for predicting the strength of TFDNA binding. We have created a dataset consisting of 597 example cases for paired domain-DNA binding by collecting information about all published and quantified interactions between TF and DNA sequence variants. Application of the rule induction based method on this dataset yields a high, although far from ideal accuracy of 69.7% (based on cross-validation), but perhaps more importantly, several useful rules for predicting the binding strength have been found. Although the primary motivation for introducing the rule induction based methods is the lack of efficient algorithms for paired domain-DNA binding prediction, we also show that the method can be applied with some success to a more well-studied TF-DNA binding prediction task involving the early growth response (EGR) TF family. Summary The transcription of DNA into mRNA is initiated and aided by a number of transcription factors (TFs), proteins with DNA-binding regions that attach themselves to binding sites in the DNA (transcription factor binding sites, TFBSs). As it has become apparent that both TFs and TFBSs are highly variable, tools are needed to quantify the strength of the interaction resulting from a certain TF variant binding to a certain TFBS. Ideally, one would like to have a method where any combination of TF amino acids are allowed to interact with any TFBS nucleotide, and vice versa. Rule induction algorithms might be such a method. We used a simple way to predict interactions between protein and DNA: given experimental cases from the literature where the interaction strength between two sequences has been quantified, we created training vectors for rule induction by regarding each amino acid and nucleotide position as a single feature in the example vector. The resulting interaction strength was used as the target class or value. These training vectors were then used to build a rule induction model. We applied the rule induction method to two protein families \u2013 transcription factors from the Pax and the early growth response (EGR) families \u2013 and their corresponding DNA targets.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": "q-bio/0505025", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2390/biecoll-jib-2006-42", "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Biomolecules", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2139954320,2950776451", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Computer Science", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["43159111", "14479663", "46237752", "8079925", "14355663", "14628039", "16724801", "5542141", "40174944", "14673621", "39308312", "36118251", "1991062", "16146617", "22373660", "11146056", "24790530", "35118933", "22189746", "5262555", "11804039", "21203096", "9311376", "22401880", "1404745", "24991414", "28220571", "29487591", "20429568", "35043492", "38422342", "42208700", "31426671", "28822126", "7975519", "12802078", "7828519", "18005897", "17378387", "44407025", "21518857", "36423813", "25805439", "8165463", "37429478", "38976620", "11788531", "7260461", "2836159", "2065932"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7222838"}

This ammonia is then measured using a semiconductor gas sensor. The sensor response is given to the proposed architecture for feature extraction and classification. The performance of the architecture is optimized by regulating the parameter values using a PSO algorithm.

So far, a mass of many feature selection approaches have been proposed and applied to analyse expression data of different types. However, most of these methods only are limited to measure the performances on one single type of expression data by accuracy or error rate of classification. In this article, we propose a hybrid feature selection method based on Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) and evaluate the performance on expression datasets of different types. Firstly, the relevance between features and classifying samples is measured by using the optimizing function of MKL. In this step, an iterative gradient descent process is used to perform the optimization both on the parameters of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and kernel confidence. Then, a set of relevant features is selected by sorting the optimizing function of each feature. Furthermore, we apply an embedded scheme of forward selection to detect the compact feature subsets from the relevant feature set. We not only compare the classification accuracy with other methods, but also compare the stability, similarity and consistency of different algorithms.

Identifying genome-wide targets of transcription factors (TFs) provides the basis to discover the involvement of TFs and TF cooperativeness in cellular systems and pathogenesis. Results: We present the Regulatory Interaction Predictor (RIP), a machine learning approach that inferred 73,923 RIs for 301 human TFs and 11,263 target genes with considerably good quality and 4,516 RIs with very high quality. The inference of RIs is independent of any specific condition. Our approach employs Support Vector Machines (SVMs) trained on a set of experimentally proven RIs from a public repository (TRANSFAC). Features of RIs for the learning process are based on a correlation meta-analysis of 4,064 gene expression profiles from 76 studies, in silico predictions of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), and combinations of these employing knowledge about co-regulation of genes by a common TF (TFmodule). The trained SVMs were applied to infer new RIs for a large set of TFs and genes. In a case study, we employed the inferred RIs to analyze an independent microarray dataset. We identified key TFs regulating the transcriptional response upon interferon-alpha stimulation of monocytes, most prominently interferon stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). Furthermore, predicted TF-modules were highly associated to their functionally related pathways.

Performance comparison for p-TAREF was done with other prediction tools for plants with utmost rigor and where p-TAREF was found better performing in several aspects. Further, p-TAREF was run over the experimentally validated miRNA targets from species like Arabidopsis, Medicago, Rice and Tomato, and detected them accurately, suggesting gross usability of p-TAREF for plant species.

These tasks usually require color image segmentation to partition an image into regions, where each region corresponds to a particular material. Due to discontinuities resulting from shadows and specularities, a single material is often segmented into several sub-regions. In this paper, a specularity detection and removal technique is proposed that requires no camera calibration or other a priori information regarding the scene. The approach specifically addresses detecting and removing specularities in facial images. The image is first processed by the Luminance Multi-Scale Retinex [B.V. Funt, K. Barnard, M. Brockington, V. Cardei, Luminance-Based Multi-Scale Retinex, AIC'97, Kyoto, Japan, May 1997]. Second, potential specularities are detected and a wavefront is generated outwards from the peak of the specularity to its boundary or until a material boundary has been reached. Upon attaining the specularity boundary, the wavefront contracts inwards while coloring in the specularity until the latter no longer exists. The third step is discussed in a companion paper [M.D. Levine, J. Bhattacharyya, Removing shadows, Pattern Recognition Letters, 26 (2005) 251-265] where a method for detecting and removing shadows has also been introduced. The approach involves training Support Vector Machines to identify shadow boundaries based on their boundary properties. The latter are used to identify shadowed regions in the image and then assign to them the color of non-shadow neighbors of the same material as the shadow. Based on these three steps, we show that more meaningful color image segmentations can be achieved by compensating for illumination using the Illumination Compensation Method proposed in this paper. It is also demonstrated that the accuracy of facial skin detection improves significantly when this illumination compensation approach is used. Finally, we show how illumination compensation can increase the accuracy of face recognition. ition.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cviu.2005.05.003", "venue": "Comput.

We use a dual discriminator to force the generator to learn more spatial features and segment the edges of the left heart more accurately.

Low quality health information, which is common on the internet, presents risks to the patient in the form of misinformation and a possibly poorer relationship to their physician. To address this, the DISCERN criteria (developed at University of Oxford) are used to evaluate the quality of online health information. However, patients are unlikely to take the time to apply these criteria to the health websites they visit. We built an automated implementation of the DISCERN instrument (Brief version) using machine learning models. We compared the use of a traditional model (Random Forest) with a hierarchical encoder attention-based neural network (HEA) model using two language embeddings based on BERT and BioBERT. The HEA BERT and BioBERT models achieved F1-macro scores averaging 0.75 and 0.74, respectively, on all criteria outperforming the Random Forest model (F1-macro = 0.69). Similarly, HEA BERT and BioBERT scored on average 0.8 and 0.81 (F1-micro) vs. 0.76 for the Random Forest model. Overall, the neural network based models achieved 81% and 86% average accuracy at 100% and 80% coverage, respectively, compared to 94% manual rating accuracy.

To overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, an automated system is introduced which identifies and classifies the rice grains based on digital image processing techniques. Image processing method is most suitable as it is a non-contact technique, where in the image of the rice grains are captured. The captured images are pre-processed, segmented and features are extracted through MATLAB. From the extracted features the quality of rice is assessed based on Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier algorithms.

Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. As the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning researches, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Different from previous surveys, this survey paper reviews over forty representative transfer learning approaches from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, twenty representative transfer learning models are used for experiments.

However, this remains a challenge even for experienced multidisciplinary centers. Objectives We compared the performance of four machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting the risk of locoregional recurrences in patients with OTSCC. These algorithms were Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Boosted Decision Tree (BDT), and Decision Forest (DF). Materials and methods The study cohort comprised 311 cases from the five University Hospitals in Finland and A.C. Camargo Cancer Center, Sao Paulo, Brazil. For comparison of the algorithms, we used the harmonic mean of precision and recall called F1 score, specificity, and accuracy values. These algorithms and their corresponding permutation feature importance (PFI) with the input parameters were externally tested on 59 new cases. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the algorithm that showed the highest prediction accuracy with the prognostic significance of depth of invasion (DOI). Results The results showed that the average specificity of all the algorithms was 71% . The SVM showed an accuracy of 68% and F1 score of 0.63, NB an accuracy of 70% and F1 score of 0.64, BDT an accuracy of 81% and F1 score of 0.78, and DF an accuracy of 78% and F1 score of 0.70. Additionally, these algorithms outperformed the DOI-based approach, which gave an accuracy of 63%. With PFI-analysis, there was no significant difference in the overall accuracies of three of the algorithms; PFI-BDT accuracy increased to 83.1%, PFI-DF increased to 80%, PFI-SVM decreased to 64.4%, while PFI-NB accuracy increased significantly to 81.4%. Conclusions Our findings show that the best classification accuracy was achieved with the boosted decision tree algorithm. Additionally, these algorithms outperformed the DOI-based approach. Furthermore, with few parameters identified in the PFI analysis, ML technique still showed the ability to predict locoregional recurrence. The application of boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm can stratify OTSCC patients and thus aid in their individual treatment planning.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31923822", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.104068", "venue": "International journal of medical informatics", "journal": "International journal of medical informatics", "mag_id": "2998732610", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210150095"}

Analyzing this data however is difficult due to its high dimensionality and the existence of many redundant or noisy features. Many methods have been used, aggregating algorithms have been among the most promising for tackling high dimensional data classification. The most widely used is the Random Forests algorithm. This method is especially attractive because of its prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to other tree based methods. Interestingly, despite its wide use, few theoretical studies investigating the factors that may impact the performance of Random Forests, including the number of informative and noisy features, the sample size, and the number of randomly selected features at each node split, have been reported. In this dissertation I take an initial step to analyze the Random Forests algorithm by considering a two-class classification problem where all the features are normally distributed within a class and a stump-tree classifier is used as the base learner. My analysis shows that the random feature selection improves the overall classification accuracy by adaptively assigning voting weights to the weak classifiers according to their performances on the training set. But the adjustment of the weights induced by changing the random selected subset size is very limited. I also claim that bootstrapping original training set enables a larger variety of possible weak classifiers being generated. But the perturbation introduced by bootstrap may deviate from the underlying true distribution of the samples and result in deteriorated weak classifiers. My motivation is to find alternative ways to generate a rich ensemble of weak classifiers that can keep original information and generalize well, and to find a better way to assign weights to the weak classifiers according to their performances and correlations. I proposed the weighted random subspace method. In this method, I addressed the optimal weight assignment problem and proposed solutions under both the independence and dependence assumptions among weak classifiers. Finally, I compared various algorithms on gene expression and protein expression data and confirmed that the weight assignment procedure improves prediction accuracy.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2527368069", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125889123"}

We, rather, rely on cognitive evidences from eye tracking. TDI is measured as the sum of fixation (gaze) and saccade (rapid eye movement) times of the eye. We then establish that TDI is correlated with three properties of the input sentence, viz. length (L), degree of polysemy (DP) and structural complexity (SC). We train a Support Vector Regression (SVR) system to predict TDIs for new sentences using these features as input.

Existing GZSL approaches either suffer from semantic loss and discard discriminative information at the embedding stage, or cannot guarantee the visual-semantic interactions. To address these limitations, we propose the Dual Adversarial Semantics-Consistent Network (DASCN), which learns primal and dual Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in a unified framework for GZSL. In particular, the primal GAN learns to synthesize inter-class discriminative and semantics-preserving visual features from both the semantic representations of seen/unseen classes and the ones reconstructed by the dual GAN. The dual GAN enforces the synthetic visual features to represent prior semantic knowledge well via semantics-consistent adversarial learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs a novel dual-GAN mechanism for GZSL.

Regular, repeated assessments of canopy intactness are essential to map site-specific forest disturbance and recovery patterns, an essential requirement for forest monitoring and management. However, accessibility to images required for this practice, uncertainty around the levels of accuracy achieved with images of different resolution, and the affordability of the practice challenges its application in many developing regions. This study aimed to compare the accuracy of forest gap detection (in subtropical forests) achieved with lower-resolution (SPOT7 5 m) and higher-resolution (SPOT7 1.5 m) pan-sharpened imagery. Additionally, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) were compared in terms of their ability to increase the accuracy of this detection when used in conjunction with both high and low resolution imagery. Results indicate that the SPOT7 1.5 m imagery produced an overall accuracy of 77.78% and a \u03f0 coefficient of 0.66 compared with the 69.44% accuracy and the 0.59 \u03f0 coefficient achieved with the SPOT7 5 m imagery. Computing image texture analysis within the Random Forest classifier (RF) framework increased classification accuracies to 75.00% for the SPOT 5 m and 86.11% for the SPOT7 1.5 m imagery, validating the usefulness of texture analysis. Variable importance was used to identify wavebands and texture-derived variables that were the most effective in discriminating canopy gaps from intact canopy. In this regard, near infrared, NDVI, SAR, contrast, mean, entropy and second moment were the most important. Collectively the results indicate that the approach adopted in this study, i.e., the use of SPOT7 1.5 m imagery in conjunction with image texture analysis and variable importance, can be used to accurately discriminate between canopy gaps and intact canopy, making it a cost-effective spatial approach for monitoring and managing natural forests.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/f9120781", "venue": null, "journal": "Forests", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2904398343", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["128909438", "55989825", "85830290", "18556307", "86437816", "6565398", "73584316", "4039078", "53688382", "83957942", "86007348", "2881970", "11602535", "18512474", "129925206", "16540876", "18039447", "7197802", "18854319", "53003254", "1103447", "92107057", "132210990", "134996112", "84247323", "129277678", "120293253", "18303730", "132117349", "89141", "3093707", "132384951", "128836887", "40673292", "128570428", "129193609", "53720372", "125842111", "55765391", "2475673", "35843482", "73598762", "17005132", "118853349", "45028242", "18081446"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:92315620"}

Rat (0-24 h old) primary cortical cells were plated in 48 well-MEA plates and exposed to 6 compounds: acetaminophen, bisindolylmaleimide-1 (Bis-1), domoic acid, mevastatin, sodium orthovanadate, and loperamide for a period of 12 days.

Network activity (e.g. mean firing rate [MFR], burst rate [BR], etc), increased between days 5 and 12. Random Forest analysis indicated that across all compounds and times, temporal correlation of firing patterns (r), MFR, BR, number of active electrodes and % of spikes in a burst were the most influential parameters in separating control from treated wells. All compounds except acetaminophen (\u2264 30 \u00b5M) caused concentration-related effects on one or more of these parameters. Domoic acid and sodium orthovanadate altered several of these parameters in the absence of cytotoxicity.

Late diagnosis significantly decreases the survival rate of the patient; however, using mammography for early detection has been demonstrated to be a very important tool increasing the survival rate. The purpose of this paper is to obtain a multivariate model to classify benign and malignant tumor lesions using a computer-assisted diagnosis with a genetic algorithm in training and test datasets from mammography image features. A multivariate search was conducted to obtain predictive models with different approaches, in order to compare and validate results. The multivariate models were constructed using: Random Forest, Nearest centroid, and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) strategies as cost function in a genetic algorithm applied to the features in the BCDR public databases. Results suggest that the two texture descriptor features obtained in the multivariate model have a similar or better prediction capability to classify the data outcome compared with the multivariate model composed of all the features, according to their fitness value.

However, since these are created based on the practitioner's understanding of the problem, they may not capture the most relevant aspects necessary to properly characterize the problem. We propose to overcome this problem by taking advantage of Representation Learning, which is able to create an alternative problem characterizations by having the data guide the design of the representation instead of the practitioner's opinion. Our hypothesis states that such alternative representations can be used to replace standard metafeatures, hence hence leading to a more robust approach to Metalearning.

The goal of this thesis is to add functionality to the robotic arm of the eNHANCE device, so that assistance-as-needed is given during training of the upper extremity. In order to do so, two main concepts were addressed: the behavior of the robotic arm and the adjustment of the support level. ::: The behavior of the robotic arm, on the one hand, concerns the assistance given by the robot, so that it resembles healthy performance in reaching tasks. To do so, a machine learning approach was evaluated to obtain a predicted healthy reaching time which would dictate the behavior of the robot. An experiment investigating different machine learning models and the use of different training dataset \u2013 Experiment I- was carried out so as to determine the validity of the machine learning approach in terms of prediction accuracy. ::: The adjustment of the support level, on the other hand, is related to the motivational functionality of the device. In such a way, assistance-as-needed will increase user engagement and favor motor training. In order to address the adjustment of the support level, a support level controller was postulated. Later, an experimental set-up \u2013Experiment II- observed the behavior of the controller for three different simulated scenarios: when the participants acted normally, fatigued or was lazy. In addition, user perception of the change in support level was documented. ::: The conclusions from Experiment I led to the decision of choosing a Random Forest as a good candidate model. Furthermore, the features and tasks for the training dataset were specified, with a Base-to-Target task being favored. The final conclusion was that the Machine Learning approach is valid for limits of accuracy of less than 0.25 seconds. The conclusions from Experiment II prove that the proposed support level controller can adjust the support level depending on user contribution in the setting of the eNHANCE device. Furthermore, mean user perception was 50.8% accurate in determining support level change. ::: The end result of the work presented in this thesis is a control strategy that combines the results from the robot behavior and the adjustment of support level. From the combined action of the machine learning model and the support level controller, assistance-as-needed is thus delivered in an upper extremity rehabilitation setting. To conclude, future lines of work addressing the limitations of this study were proposed. These included the full implementation of the control strategy, its integration with a motivational platform and the evaluation of the control strategy in an experiment involving stroke patients.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2904130204", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:70231680"}

This paper proposes an improved incremental learning algorithm for a large-scale data stream, which is based on SVM (Support Vector Machine) and is named DS-IILS.

To design a more accurate classifier, the effects of the data volumes of the history sample set and the incremental sample set are handled by weighted processing. Finally, the algorithm is implemented in a cloud computing system and is applied to study user behaviors.

The current state of art is dominated by conditional random field based approaches, defined over pixels or image segments. However, high accuracy segmentation comes at a high computational cost. The best performing methods can barely run at few frames per second and are far from real-time applications. Our goal is to bridge the gap between current state of the art segmentation approaches and real-time applications. In this paper we propose an efficient approach for individual pixel classification. Multiple local descriptors are computed densely and then quantized using visual codebooks. Joint boosting is used to classify each pixel based on the quantized local descriptors. We show that using careful design choices and GPU optimization we can achieve sate of the art segmentation results at over 50 FPS.

Content exists in varied forms such as text appearing in different languages, entity-relationship graph represented as structured knowledge and as a visual embodiment like images/videos. They are often referred to as modalities. In many instances, the different amalgamation of modalities co-exists to complement each other or to provide consensus. Thus making the content either heterogeneous or homogeneous. Having an additional point of view for each instance in the content is beneficial for data-driven learning and intelligent content processing. However, despite having availability of such content. Most advancements made in data-driven learning (i.e., machine learning) is by solving tasks separately for the single modality. The similar endeavor was not shown for the challenges which required input either from all or subset of them. ::: ::: In this dissertation, we develop models and techniques that can leverage multiple views of heterogeneous or homogeneous content and build a shared representation for aiding several applications which require a combination of modalities mentioned above. In particular, we aim to address applications such as content-based search, categorization, and generation by providing several novel contributions. ::: ::: First, we develop models for heterogeneous content by jointly modeling diverse representations emerging from two views depicting text and image by learning their correlation. To be specific, modeling such correlation is helpful to retrieve cross-modal content. Second, we replace the heterogeneous content with homogeneous to learn a common space representation for content categorization across languages. Furthermore, we develop models that take input from both homogeneous and heterogeneous content to facilitate the construction of common space representation from more than two views. Specifically, representation is used to generate one view from another. Lastly, we describe a model that can handle missing views, and demonstrate that the model can generate missing views by utilizing external knowledge. We argue that techniques the models leverage internally provide many practical benefits and lot of immediate value applications. ::: ::: From the modeling perspective, our contributed model design in this thesis can be summarized under the phrase Multi-view Representation Learning( MVRL ). These models are variations and extensions of shallow statistical and deep neural networks approaches that can jointly optimize and exploit all views of the input content arising from different independent representations.

EEG is becoming increasingly useful in the measuring fatigue state. Manual interpretation of EEG signals is impossible, so an effective method for automatic detection of EEG signals is crucial needed. Method: In order to capture the principal features of EEG signals, four feature sets were computed from EEG signals, in which fuzzy entropy (FE), sample entropy (SE), approximate Entropy (AE), spectral entropy (PE) and combined entropies (FE + SE + AE + PE) were included. All these feature sets were used as the input vectors of AdaBoost classifier, a boosting method which is fast and highly accurate. To assess our method, several experiments including parameter setting and classifier comparison were conducted on 28 subjects. For comparison, Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers are used. Results: The proposed method (combination of FE and AdaBoost) yields superior performance than other schemes. Using FE feature extractor, AdaBoost achieves improved area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.994, error rate (ERR) of 0.024, Precision of 0.969, Recall of 0.984, F1 score of 0.976 and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.952, compared to SVM (ERR at 0.035, Precision of 0.957, Recall of 0.974, F1 score of 0.966 and MCC of 0.930 with AUC of 0.990), DT (ERR at 0.142, Precision of 0.857, Recall of 0.859, F1 score of 0.966 and MCC of 0.716 with AUC of 0.916) and NB (ERR at 0.405, Precision of 0.646, Recall of 0.434, F1 score of 0.519 and MCC of 0.203 with AUC of 0.606). It shows that the FE feature set and combined feature set outperform other feature sets. AdaBoost seems to have better robustness against changes of ratio of test samples for all samples and number of subjects, which might therefore aid in the real-time detection of driver fatigue through the classification of EEG signals.

We propose to use data mining techniques to estimate the condition number of a given sparse matrix. In particular, we will use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the condition numbers. That is, after computing the sparsity pattern features of a matrix, we use support vector regression (SVR) to predict its condition number.

Physicians often make the decision based on experiences and trials, which might not always result optimal OAR doses. We herein propose a mathematical model to predict the lowest OAR doses among these three positions, providing a quantitative tool for corresponding clinical decision. ::: Methods: ::: Patients were scanned in FB, DIBH, and prone positions under an IRB approved protocol. Tangential beam plans were generated for each position, and OAR doses were calculated. The position with least OAR doses is defined as the optimal position. The following features were extracted from each scan to build the model: ::: heart, ipsilateral lung, breast volume, in-field heart, ipsilateral lung volume, distance between heart and target, laterality of heart, and dose to heart and ipsilateral lung. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was applied to remove the co-linearity of the input data and also to lower the data dimensionality. Feature selection, another method to reduce dimensionality, was applied as a comparison. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was then used for classification. Thirtyseven patient data were acquired; up to now, five patient plans were available. K-fold cross validation was used to validate the accuracy of the classifier model with small training size. ::: Results: ::: The classification results and K-fold cross validation demonstrated the model is capable of predicting the optimal position for patients. The accuracy of K-fold cross validations has reached 80%. Compared to PCA, feature selection allows causal features of dose to be determined. This provides more clinical insights. ::: Conclusion: ::: The proposed classification system appeared to be feasible.

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plot data are a consistent source of ground-based information that if used appropriately, can be extremely valuable for mapping and modeling forest attributes such as forest type and canopy cover. GEO-object based image analysis, or GEOBIA, is a relatively new subdiscipline of geographic information systems (GIS) focused on developing automated techniques for partitioning remotely sensed imagery into image objects and accessing them for use in a variety of mapping applications (Hay and Castilla 2008). Spatial data mining is an automatic or semiautomatic exploration to identify patterns in data that have a geographic component (Shekhar et. al. 2005). Random Forests\u2122 is an ensemble classifier that uses multiple decision trees to predict target variables from input variables (Breiman and Cutler 2003). To help understand the current status and extent of quaking aspen across the Interior West, efficient and repeatable mapping and modeling techniques need to be further established. This investigation aims at exploring viable methods for creating canopy cover maps of quaking aspen for several different locations across Utah.

In this paper, a new idead to speed up the operation of neural processors for character detection is presented. Such processors are designed based on cross correlation in the frequency domain between the input matrix and the weights of neural networks. This approach is developed to reduce the computation steps required by these faster neural networks for the searching process. The principle of divide and conquer strategy is applied through image decomposition. Each image is divided into small in size sub-images and then each one is tested separately by using a single faster neural processor. Furthermore, faster character detection is obtained by using parallel processing techniques to test the resulting sub-images at the same time using the same number of faster neural networks. In contrast to using only faster neural processors, the speed up ratio is increased with the size of the input image when using faster neural processors and image decomposition. Moreover, the problem of local subimage normalization in the frequency domain is solved. The effect of image normalization on the speed up ratio of character detection is discussed.

The challenge in the conventional online domain-of-stability estimation process is its unscalability and high computational complexity. In this paper, an efficient alternative using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) is described. We demonstrate that the notion of power system stability can be learned by such deep neural networks, and that they can offer a scalable alternative to conventional domain-of-stability estimation methods in islanded distribution systems.

Performance metrics such as precision and recall, true positive rate and true negative rate, F-measure, G-mean and Weighted Accuracy are computed to evaluate the performance of the two algorithms. The study shows that both kd-tree and SVMs are effective automated algorithms to classify point sources. SVMs show slightly higher accuracy, but kd-tree requires less computation time. Given different input patterns based on various parameters(e.g. magnitudes, color information), we conclude that both kd-tree and SVMs show better performance with fewer features. What is more, our results also indicate that the accuracy using the four colors (u-g, g-r, r-i, i-z) and r magnitude based on SDSS model magnitudes adds up to the highest value.

In engineering design, a set of potentially competitive designs is conceived in the early part of the design process. The purpose of this research is to help such a process by investigating algorithm that enables approximate identification of a set of inputs of real variables that return desired responses from a function or a computer simulation. We explore sequential or adaptive sampling methods based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). The proposed method does not rely on parameterized distributions, and can sample from multi-modal and non-convex distributions. Furthermore, the proposed merit function provides infill characteristics by favoring sampling points that lay farther from existing points.The results indicate that multiple feasible solutions can be efficiently obtained by the new adaptive sampling algorithm. The iterative use of the SOM in density learning to identify feasible or good designs is our new contribution and it shows a very rapid increase in number of feasible solutions to total number of function evaluation ratio.

A common use case for genomics data is to answer the question if a specific genetic signature is correlated with some disease manifestations. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a widely used classifier in computational literature. Previous studies have shown success in using these SVMs for the above use case of genomics data. However, SVMs suffer from a widely-recognized scalability problem in both memory use and computational time. It is as yet an unanswered question if training such classifiers can scale to the massive sizes that characterize many of the genomics data sets. We answer that question here for a specific dataset, in order to decipher whether some regulatory module of a particular combinatorial epigenetic \u201cpattern\u201d will regulate the expression of a gene. However, the specifics of the dataset is likely of less relevance to the claims of our work. We take a proposed theoretical technique for efficient training of SVM, namely Cascade SVM, create our classifier called EP-SVM, and empirically evaluate how it scales to the large genomics dataset. We implement Cascade SVM on the Apache Spark platform and open source this implementation1. Through our evaluation, we bring out the computational cost on each application process, the way of distributing the overall workload among multiple processes, which can potentially execute on different cores or different machines, and the cost of data transfer to different cores or different machines.

With this attentive re-weighting, ADDIT can focus on the domain normalization of phonetic components that are more susceptible to domain variability and generates deep features with improved domain-invariance and senone-discriminativity over ADIT. Most importantly, the attention block serves only as an external component to the DNN acoustic model and is not involved in ASR, so AADIT can be used to improve the acoustic modeling with any DNN architectures. More generally, the same methodology can improve any adversarial learning system with an auxiliary discriminator.

Despite many approaches for similarity metric learning have been proposed, there is little theoretical study on the links between similarity met- ric learning and the classification performance of the result classifier. In this paper, we propose a regularized similarity learning formulation associated with general matrix-norms, and establish their generalization bounds. We show that the generalization error of the resulting linear separator can be bounded by the derived generalization bound of similarity learning. This shows that a good gen- eralization of the learnt similarity function guarantees a good classification of the resulting linear classifier.

This demands extraction of all possible features that undergo changes during embedding. The computational complexity due to such large number of features necessitates feature set optimization. Existing research in JPEG image steganalysis tend to extract rich feature sets and reduce them by statistical feature reduction techniques. Compared to these techniques, genetic algorithm based optimization techniques are more promising as they converge to global minima. The objective of this paper is to implement genetic based optimization to reduce the high dimensional image features and hence obtain improved classification accuracy. The method implemented includes the extraction of image features in terms of co-occurrence matrices of the differences of all possible Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients to give 200 \u00d7 23,230 features. These features are optimized by a nature inspired meta-heuristic, Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) which considers the features as ants that move in random space. The fitness function for the antlion to hunt the ants is proportional to the traps built by the antlion. The proposed steganalyser has been tested for classification accuracies with different payloads. The classifiers implemented include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and fusion classifiers based on Bayes, Decision template and Dempster Schafer data fusion schemes. The results show that highest average classification accuracy has been obtained for Bayes fusion classifier followed by Dempster Schafer fusion classifier. It has been noted that the performance of fusion classifiers is better compared to individual classifiers.

This results from factors such as the percentage of dock in the image being low, the presence of other plants such as clover and changes in the level of illumination.

Sentiment may be expressed in writing, in which case determining that sentiment algorithmically is known as sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is often applied to Internet texts such as product reviews, websites, blogs, or tweets, where automatically determining published feeling towards a product, or service is very useful to marketers or opinion analysts. The main goal of sentiment analysis is to identify the polarity of natural language text. ::: ::: This thesis sets out to examine quantitatively the factors that have an effect on sentiment analysis. The factors that are commonly used in sentiment analysis are text features, sentiment lexica or resources, and the machine learning algorithms employed. The main aim of this thesis is to investigate systematically the interaction between sentiment analysis factors and machine learning algorithms in order to improve sentiment analysis performance as compared to the opinions of human assessors. A software system known as TJP was designed and developed to support this investigation. ::: ::: The research reported here has three main parts. Firstly, the role of data pre-processing was investigated with TJP using a combination of features together with publically available datasets. This considers the relationship and relative importance of superficial text features such as emoticons, n-grams, negations, hashtags, repeated letters, special characters, slang, and stopwords. The resulting statistical analysis suggests that a combination of all of these features achieves better accuracy with the dataset, and had a considerable effect on system performance. ::: ::: Secondly, the effect of human marked up training data was considered, since this is required by supervised machine learning algorithms. The results gained from TJP suggest that training data greatly augments sentiment analysis performance. However, the combination of training data and sentiment lexica seems to provide optimal performance. Nevertheless, one particular sentiment lexicon, AFINN, contributed better than others in the absence of training data, and therefore would be appropriate for unsupervised approaches to sentiment analysis. ::: ::: Finally, the performance of two sophisticated ensemble machine learning algorithms was investigated. Both the Arbiter Tree and Combiner Tree were chosen since neither of them has previously been used with sentiment analysis. The objective here was to demonstrate their applicability and effectiveness compared to that of the leading single machine learning algorithms, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines. The results showed that whilst either can be applied to sentiment analysis, the Arbiter Tree ensemble algorithm achieved better accuracy performance than either the Combiner Tree or any single machine learning algorithm.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2611231877", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13590084"}

This paper evaluates landscape change in savanna vegetation along Chobe Riverfront within Chobe National Park Botswana, from 1982 to 2011 to understand what change may be occurring in land cover. Classifying land cover in savanna environments is challenging because the vegetation spectral signatures are similar across distinct vegetation covers. With vegetation species and even structural groups having similar signatures in multispectral imagery difficulties exist in making discrete classifications in such landscapes. To address this issue, a Random Forest classification algorithm was applied to predict land-cover classes. Additionally, time series vegetation indices were used to support the findings of the discrete land cover classification. Results indicate that a landscape level vegetation shift has occurred across the Chobe Riverfront, with results highlighting a shift in land cover towards more woody vegetation. This represents a degradation of vegetation cover within this savanna landscape environment, largely due to an increasing number of elephants and other herbivores utilizing the Riverfront. The forested area along roads at a further distance from the River has also had a loss of percent cover. The continuous analysis during 1982\u20132011, utilizing monthly AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) values, also verifies this change in amount of vegetation is a continuous and ongoing process in this region.

Learning graph representation for network attack detection has become a critical issue which is an across-network machine learning task. However, the challenge of effectively representing graph for network traffic is unmet yet, especially for detecting various threat patterns which is modeled as attributed graph. In the same time, existing methods could not capture higher-order subgraph structures. For these reasons, we propose a new way to model network graph called Deep Graph Feature Learning (DeepGFL) for network attack detection to solve this problem. DeepGFL is a framework studying deep features from attributed network flow graph. We automatically generalize higher-order features from raw features obtained from attributed graphs and then implement network attack detection. We evaluate the proposed framework with raw features threat detection on a real world datasets.

Previous work along these lines mainly focus on homogenous one-class positive feedback, such as likes on Facebook or transactions on Amazon, which might not capture a user's true preferences due to the sparsity of such data. To alleviate this sparsity problem, the authors study positive feedback and implicit examinations simultaneously, coined as heterogeneous one-class collaborative filtering (HOCCF). Specifically, they designed a novel transfer learning algorithm for HOCCF, called transfer via joint similarity learning (TJSL), that jointly learns a similarity between a candidate item and a preferred item, and a similarity between a candidate item and an identified likely-to-prefer examined item. Joint similarity learning has the merit of being able to connect two seemingly unrelated items along sparse positive feedback only.

From performance point of view, the advantages of the framework are as follows: 1) learning episodic features without supervision\u2014for a class of objects without a prior knowledge, the key components, their spatial relations and cover regions can be learned automatically through a deep neural network (DNN); 2) learning semantic features based on episodic features\u2014within the cover regions of the key components, the semantic geometrical values of these components can be computed based on contour detection; 3) forming the general knowledge of a class of objects\u2014the general knowledge of a class of objects can be formed, mainly including the key components, their spatial relations and average semantic values, which is a concise description of the class; and 4) achieving higher level cognition and dynamic updating\u2014for a test image, the model can achieve classification and subclass semantic descriptions.

Smith (smith4@indiana.edu) Department of Psychology; 1101 East Tenth Street Bloomington, IN 47405 USA Abstract Young children generalize nouns in systematic ways. They generalize names for solid things by shape and names for non-solid things by material. Recent evidence suggests that the source of these biases is in the children's lexicon: the bias becomes apparent only after they know names for things that are solid and have a similar shape and they know names for things that are non-solid and similar i n material. In Experiment 1, we train a simple connectionist network with the regularities present in early noun vocabu- laries and show that this network shows generalization pat- terns comparable to those of young children. In Experi- ment 2 we look for other possible biases coming from sta- tistical regularities and find that the network predicts that children will not cross ontological boundaries in their word generalizations. In Experiment 3 we test this prediction i n 30-36 month-old children. We explain this finding i n terms of the statistical regularities present in young chil- dren\u2019s noun vocabularies. Introduction Young children are excellent learners of object names. After hearing a noun used once to name one object, they seem to know the scope of the whole category. To explain this pro- ficiency people have proposed several mechanisms in the form of constraints or biases (Landau, Smith & Jones, 1988; Markman, 1989; Soja, Carey & Spelke, 1991). This paper is about the shape and material biases and about a new \u201cbias\u201d, what one might call an \u201contology bias\u201d. In the end, we propose that all these biases and constraints reduce to associative learning and generalization by similarity. Our starting point is a recent study by Samuelson & Smith (1999). They examined the similarity structure of 300 object categories, the names of which are typically known by 30 month-olds. They found many nouns that name things that are solid and similar in shape and fewer nouns that refer to non-solid substances similar in material. They also showed that children do generalize novel nouns for sol- ids by shape and for non-solids by material, but only after they know many of these words. These results suggest that these biases may be the product of statistical learning. In other words, children\u2019s noun generalizations are themselves generalizations over the nouns the child already knows. In this paper we show that a simple statistical learner, when trained with the regularities present in early noun vo- cabularies, generalizes novel nouns like children do. In Ex- periment 1 we train connectionist networks on the regulari- ties found in early vocabulary by Samuelson and Smith (1999) and show that, like children, the networks generalize by shape for solid objects and by material for non-solid sub- stances. In Experiment 2 we examine this early lexicon for other regularities that might create biases in a statistical learner and find that networks trained on this set exhibit what we call an \u201contology bias\u201d. In Experiment 3 we test for this bias in children. Experiment 1 The goal of Experiment 1 is to determine if the regularities present in early noun vocabularies are sufficient to create word learning biases in a simple associative learner. If this is the case, it would support the idea that the biases are learned as part of learning the regularities in the lexicon. To do this we trained simple connectionist networks with a vocabulary organized using the regularities found in early lexicon by Samuelson and Smith (1999) and then we tested the network\u2019s performance on an adaptation of the novel noun generalization task. Architecture We used a Hopfield network, which is a simple settling network. The network was trained using Contrastive Heb- bian Learning (Movellan, 1990), an algorithm which adjusts weights on the basis of correlations between unit activa- tions. Figure 1. shows the architecture of the network. The network has a Word Layer, in which words are represented locally. That is, each unit corresponds to one word in the network\u2019s vocabulary. Individual objects are represented on what we call the Dimension layer. Activation patterns on this layer represent the shape and material of each individual object or substance presented to the network. More specifi- cally, the shape and material of an object (say the roundness of a particular ball and its yellow rubbery material) are repre- sented by an activation pattern along the whole layer, in a distributed fashion. In the Solidity layer one unit stands for Solid and another for Non-Solid. Finally, there is a hidden layer that is connected to all the other layers and recurrently with itself. Note that the Word Layer and the Dimension and Solidity layers are only connected through the hidden layer, there are no direct connections among them.", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "126935098", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["205117480", "140272371", "14918803", "14144831", "22517977"], "inbound_citations": ["2727254", "23888035", "1967318", "15933471", "18789375"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56041520"}

The past 15 years have seen the development of a radical challenge to this view, derived from a form of computational modelling called Parallel Distributed Processing or connectionism. Connectionist linguistic theory holds that language processing takes place at a subsymbolic level, and that the appearance of rule-driven behaviour is formed by the abstraction of patterns from the environment. The English past tense has become a critical arena of dissent between symbolic and subsymbolic theories of linguistics. There are two current dominant theories of past tense inflection: hybrid dual-route theory, championed by Pinker, posits a symbolic, explicit, default rule for the regularisation process, and an associative memory component for irregular exceptions; single-route theory maintains that regular and irregular inflectional morphology may both be accounted for within a single, subsymbolic, associative system which contains no explicit linguistic rules. This doctoral thesis describes a new classification of phonological similarity between verbs ('neighbourhood density'), which is used to develop mutually-exclusive and empirically-testable hypotheses from the two dominant theoretical perspectives of English past tense inflectional morphology. Empirical research is conducted in the domains of experimental psychology, electrophysiology and Connectionist modelling: four novel verb elicitation tasks are performed on adults; two ERP studies investigate brain activity for regular, irregular and novel verb inflection; and five neural network simulations are built in order to compare human data with network performance.

Kernel methods are suitable for learning from graph-based data such as biological networks, as they only require the abstraction of the similarities between objects into the kernel matrix. One key issue in kernel methods is the selection of a good kernel function. Diffusion kernels, the discretization of the familiar Gaussian kernel of Euclidean space, are commonly used for graph-based data.ResultsIn this paper, we address the issue of learning an optimal diffusion kernel, in the form of a convex combination of a set of pre-specified kernels constructed from biological networks, for protein function prediction. Most prior work on this kernel learning task focus on variants of the loss function based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). Their extensions to other loss functions such as the one based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which is more suitable for mining biological networks, lead to expensive optimization problems. By exploiting the special structure of the diffusion kernel, we show that this KL divergence based kernel learning problem can be formulated as a simple optimization problem, which can then be solved efficiently.

Since early diagnosis could improve treatment outcomes and longer survival times for breast cancer patients, it is significant to develop breast cancer detection techniques. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can extract features from images automatically and then perform classification. To train the CNN from scratch, however, requires a large number of labeled images, which is infeasible for some kinds of medical image data such as mammographic tumor images. A promising solution is to apply transfer learning in CNN. In this paper, we firstly tested three training methods on the MIAS database: 1) trained a CNN from scratch, 2) applied the pre-trained VGG-16 model to extract features from input mammograms and used these features to train a Neural Network (NN)-classifier, 3) updated the weights in several final layers of the pre-trained VGG-16 model by back-propagation (fine-tuning) to detect abnormal regions. We found that method 2) is ideal for study because the classification accuracy of fine-tuning model was just 0.008 higher than that of feature extraction model but time cost of feature extraction model was only about 5% of that of the fine-tuning model. Then, we used method 2) to classify regions: benign vs. normal, malignant vs. normal and abnormal vs. normal from the DDSM database with 10-fold cross validation.

Previous research relied heavily on handcrafted features to analyze tampered regions which were inefficient and time-consuming. This paper introduces a framework that accurately detects manipulated face image using deep learning approach. The original contributions of this paper include (1) a customized convolutional neural network model for Manipulated Face (MANFA) identification; it contains several convolutional layers that effectively extract features of multi-levels of abstraction from a tampered region. (2) A hybrid framework (HF-MANFA) that uses Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to deal with the imbalanced dataset challenge. (3) A large manipulated face dataset that is manually collected and validated. The results from various experiments proved that proposed models outperformed existing expert and intelligent systems which were usually used for the manipulated face image detection task in terms of area under the curve (AUC), computational complexity, and robustness against imbalanced datasets. As a result, the presented framework will motivate the finding of a more powerful altered face images detection method and encourages the integration of the proposed model in applications that have to deal with manipulated images regularly.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2019.04.005", "venue": "Expert Syst.

In this study, we propose a hybrid Ant Colony optimization (ACO) based variable selection approach in conjunction with Support Vector Machines (SVM) to determine informative subsets of process variables that may help detect faults efficiently, making the fault detection model more robust in the process. In addition, we employ a Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) based variable ranking heuristic to guide ACO towards better search spaces.

Its success is based on the diversity of rules generated from decision trees that are built via a procedure that randomizes instances and features. To find additional procedures for increasing the diversity of the trees is an interesting task. It has been considered a new split criterion, based on imprecise probabilities and general uncertainty measures, that has a clear dependence of a parameter and has shown to be more successful than the classic ones. Using that criterion in RF scheme, join with a random procedure to select the value of that parameter, the diversity of the trees in the forest and the performance are increased. This fact gives rise to a new classification algorithm, called Random Credal Random Forest (RCRF). The new method represents several improvements with respect to the classic RF: the use of a more successful split criterion which is more robust to noise than the classic ones; and an increasing of the randomness which facilitates the diversity of the rules obtained. In an experimental study, it is shown that this new algorithm is a clear enhancement of RF, especially when it applied on data sets with class noise, where the standard RF has a notable deterioration. The problem of overfitting that appears when RF classifies data sets with class noise is solved with RCRF.

The learning process of a software defect predictor is difficult due to the imbalanced distribution of software modules between defective and nondefective classes. Misclassification cost of defective software modules generally incurs much higher cost than the misclassification of nondefective one. Therefore, on considering the misclassification cost issue, we have developed a software defect prediction system using Weighted Least Squares Twin Support Vector Machine (WLSTSVM).

First of all, documents are collected from the Web, and then preprocessed using document classification and segmentation. We apply Support Vector Machines for classification and propose a novel method of text segmentation. Then chemical entities in the documents are tagged and indexed to provide fast searches. Simultaneously, chemical structure information are collected, processed, and indexed for fast graph searches. ::: We show how chemical entity searches can improve the relevance of returned documents by avoiding those ambiguous terms. Our search engine first extracts chemical entities from text, performs novel indexing suitable for chemical names and formulae, and supports different query models that a scientist may require. We propose a model of hierarchical conditional random fields for entity tagging that considers long-term dependencies at the sentence level. Then to support efficient and effective entity searches, we propose two feature selection methods for entity index building. One is to select frequent and discriminative subsequences from all the candidate features for chemical formula indexing. The other is to first discover subterms of chemical names with corresponding probabilities using a proposed independent frequent subsequence mining algorithm, and then segment a chemical name hierarchically into a tree structure based on discovered independent frequent subsequences. A unsupervised hierarchical text segmentation (HTS) method is proposed for this. Then subterms on the HTS tree can be indexed. Finally, query models with corresponding ranking functions are introduced for chemical entity searches. Experiments show that our approaches to chemical entity tagging, indexing, and search perform well. ::: In addition to text searches, massive amounts of structured data in Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics raise an issue of effective and efficient structure searches. Graphs are used to model structures for a long time. A typical type of graph search is a subgraph query that retrieves all graphs containing the query graph. To support efficient search, graph features such as subgraphs are extracted from graphs for graph indexing. One of the key issues is, given the set of all the possible subgraphs of the graph set, which subset of features is the optimal to achieve the highest precision for a given query set? To answer this question, first, we introduce a graph search process for subgraph queries. Then, we propose several novel feature selection criteria, Max-Precision, Max-Irredundant-Information, and Max-Information-Min-Redundancy, based on pointwise mutual information. We also propose a greedy feature search algorithm to find a near optimal feature set based on Max-Information-Min-Redundancy. Finally we show empirically that our proposed methods achieve a higher precision than previous methods. ::: Besides subgraph queries, users often execute similarity graph queries to search for graphs similar to the query graph. Previous methods usually use the maximum common edge subgraph (MCEG) to measure the similarity of two graphs. However, MCEG isomorphism is NP-hard and prohibitively slow to scan all graphs in the data set, so that it is not feasible for online searches to use MCEG in the fly to measure the similarity of retrieved graphs. We propose a novel approach to this issue from a different view by ranking search results using a weighted linear graph kernel that can avoid real time MCEG isomorphism tests, but achieve a reasonably high quality of search results. First, subgraphs features are extracted from graphs and indexed. Second, for a given graph query, graphs containing its subgraph features are retrieved and similarity scores are computed based on the indexed subgraph features. Finally, graphs are sorted and returned based on similarity scores. Subgraph weights used by the graph kernel are learned offline from a training set generated using MCEG isomorphism. We show empirically that the proposed methods of learning to rank for similarity graph queries can achieve a reasonably high normalized discounted cumulative gain in comparison with the \"gold standard\" method based on MCEG isomorphism.

Presence and distribution of lesional vessels are associated with specific abnormalities. Therefore, detection and localization of cutaneous vessels provide critical information towards diagnosis and stage status of diseases. However, cutaneous vessels are highly variable in shape, size, color and architecture, which complicate the detection task. Considering the large variability of these structures, conventional vessel detection techniques lack the generalizability to detect different vessel types and require separate algorithms to be designed for each type. Furthermore, such techniques are highly dependent on precise hand-crafted features which are time-consuming and computationally inefficient. As a solution, we propose a data-driven feature learning framework based on stacked sparse auto-encoders (SSAE) for comprehensive detection of cutaneous vessels. Each training image is divided into small patches of either containing or non-containing vasculature. A multilayer SSAE is designed to learn hidden features of the data in hierarchical layers in an unsupervised manner. The high-level learned features are subsequently fed into a classifier which categorizes each patch into absence or presence of vasculature and localizes vessels within the lesion. Over a test set of 3095 patches derived from 200 images, the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance of 95.4% detection accuracy over a variety of vessel patterns; outperforming other techniques by achieving the highest positive predictive value of 94.7%.

Materials and methods: We considered EHRs of $1,608,741$ patients from a diverse hospital cohort comprising of a total of $57,464$ clinical concepts. We introduce a representation learning model based on word embeddings, convolutional neural networks and autoencoders (i.e.,\"ConvAE\") to transform patient trajectories into low-dimensional latent vectors. We evaluated these representations as broadly enabling patient stratification by applying hierarchical clustering to different multi-disease and disease-specific patient cohorts. Results: ConvAE significantly outperformed several common baselines in a clustering task to identify patients with different complex conditions, with $2.61$ entropy and $0.31$ purity average scores. When applied to stratify patients within a certain condition, ConvAE led to various clinically relevant subtypes for different disorders, including type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, largely related to comorbidities, disease progression, and symptom severity.

Finally, we established whether the age-prediction error was genetically determined. Three minutes eyes-closed resting state EEG data from the longitudinal EEG studies of Netherlands Twin Register (n=836) and Washington University in St. Louis (n = 702) were used at ages 5, 7, 12, 14, 16 and 18. Longitudinal data were available within childhood and adolescence. We calculated power in 1 Hz wide bins (1 to 24 Hz). Random Forest regression and Relevance Vector Machine with 6-fold cross-validation were applied. The best mean absolute prediction error was obtained with Random Forest (1.22 years). Classification of childhood vs. adolescence reached over 94% accuracy. Prediction errors were moderately to highly stable over periods of 1.5 to 2.1 years (0.53 < r < 0.74) and signifcantly affected by genetic factors (heritability between 42% and 79%). Our results show that age prediction from low-cost EEG recordings is comparable in accuracy to those obtained with MRI. Children and adolescents showed stable over- or underestimation of their age, which means that some participants have stable brain activity patterns that reflect those of an older or younger age, and could therefore reflect individual brain maturational level. This prediction error is heritable, suggesting that genes underlie maturational level of functional brain activity. We propose that age prediction based on EEG recordings can be used for tracking neurodevelopment in typically developing children, in preterm children, and in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/407049", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2888877531", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["141515206", "4605395", "45412966", "9318812", "41547160", "25005421", "3588977", "1101322", "17137241", "6642898", "13178564", "6615430", "4552603", "45731934", "2002847", "7808055", "9307043", "9291668", "4767587", "14139177", "140460663", "23590924", "16044664", "25360660", "14285986", "3079565", "1315012", "9266398", "1337115", "14209424", "14984716", "28637672", "8935123", "215207683"], "inbound_citations": ["209597912"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196671251"}

According to scientists, the extensive amount of greenhouse gases emissions has caused a tremendous increase in global temperatures in recent years in such a way that August 2017 was the second warmest August in 137 years of record-keeping.Twitter as one of the most popular social networking websites, has become a common platform for climate change conversations. The climate change debates on Twitter is generally categorized into two types of opinion. One group believe that climate change is happening and actions should be taken to fight it and protect the earth. While the second group do not believe in climate change. This group that is known as climate change deniers or skeptics, claim that climate change is not happening or if it is, this is not caused by the human activities and there is no need to take actions.In this thesis a dataset of tweets about climate change is created using Twitter API in order to analyze the public opinion on climate change by means of machine learning techniques as an approach for sentiment analysis. The tweets are collected using popular climate change hashtags and are labeled as positive and negative which correspond to two opinion about climate change discussed earlier. The positive group are those who believe in climate change while the negative group support the climate change denial. Then the classification algorithms are applied on the dataset. The experiments show that Support Vector Machine classifier with $0.97$ accuracy and Logistic Regression classification with $0.95$ accuracy using the unigrams, sentiment lexicon, word embeddings and Twitter features have the best performance metrics.Analysis on the dataset show that more than 70\\% of the tweets are positive and from the negative tweets more than 85\\% are from the United States mainly in Georgia, Kentucky, Texas, Ohio and Arizona. This is while according to the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) and EPA, the U.S is the second biggest $CO_2$ emitters in the world and Texas has the most amount of annual $CO_2$ emission in the U.S. it is obvious that climate change deniers are the biggest $CO_2$ emitters who want to stop the regulations on their activities.As future developments on this work, deep learning techniques could be used for classification.

All sample sites were situated in the West African Savannah zone. These surveys systematically described the status of urban agriculture by collecting soil samples, as well as additional socioeconomic and land use data.

The joint manifold subspace is built using an adaptation of Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) from a data-driven region of interest (ROI). The ROI is learned using sparse regression to perform simultaneous variable selection at multiple levels of alignment to the MNI152 template.

The Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm has previously been used in addressing regression analysis in neuroimaging. However, identifying the regions of the image that the SVR uses to model the dependence of a target variable remains an open problem. It is an important issue when one wants to biologically interpret the meaning of a pattern that predicts the variable(s) of interest, and therefore to understand normal or pathological process. One possible approach to the identification of these regions is the use of permutation testing. Permutation testing involves 1) generation of a large set of 'null SVR models' using randomly permuted sets of target variables, and 2) comparison of the SVR model trained using the original labels to the set of null models. These permutation tests often require prohibitively long computational time. Recent work in support vector classification shows that it is possible to analytically approximate the results of permutation testing in medical image analysis. We propose an analogous approach to approximate permutation testing based analysis for support vector regression with medical imaging data.

Connectionist delay representation of the network traffic is derived by considering a videoconference session among a group of N participants connected via various LAN's or randomly through the Internet. Connections among the collaborative participants are represented by their end-to-end network delays involving the physical transmission delay between two stations and the delay due to network traffic. For a network of N stations, this model becomes an N2 X N2 correlation matrix. When normalized by the delay means and variances of the individual inks, it leads to the N2 X N2 square matrix of delay cross-correlation coefficients with values varying in the range of [-1,1] independent of scale changes in the correlation amplitude. In the experimental study, three LAN's are selected as the test-bed to measure the random traffic in the Internet. Connections among the different workstations of these three physically separate LAN's are established through the Internet for a long period of observation time. Ensemble averaging over the measurement period dictates that the delay correlation matrix tends to be constant for the selected networks.\u00a9 (2001) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Traditional color image compression schemes can be used to save the storage size of the color images. Unfortunately, most of these schemes are lossy in nature, which affects the details of color images. This paper presents a different treatment to the color image storage problem depending on the original color image formation process. In the color image formation process, not all the red, green, and blue components of the color images are acquired, simultaneously. Only, one component at each pixel position is acquired and Color Filter Array (CFA) interpolation is used to estimate the other two components using interpolation algorithms like Minimized-Laplacian Residual Interpolation (MLRI) and Linear Interpolation with Laplacian Second Order Correction (LILSOC). We adopt a similar strategy in this paper for reducing the storage sizes of color images by 66.67% of their original sizes. The sensitivity of the pattern recognition process to the proposed color image storage and interpolation strategy is studied in this paper. A cepstral feature extraction algorithm is adopted in this paper for extracting features from the interpolated patterns for further classification.

In this paper we focus on an interesting and challenging problem, vehicle re-ID of the same/similar model. Previous works mainly focus on extracting global features using deep models, ignoring the individual loa-cal regions in vehicle front window, such as decorations and stickers attached to the windshield, that can be more discriminative for vehicle re-ID. Instead of directly embedding these regions to learn their features, we propose a Regional Structure-Aware model (RSA) to learn structure-aware cues with the position distribution of individual local regions in vehicle front window area, constructing a FW structural map space. In this map sapce, deep models are able to learn more robust and discriminative spatial structure-aware features to improve the performance for vehicle re-ID of the same/similar model.

However, there is only a limited number of research on tackling transfer learning in genetic programming for symbolic regression. This article attempts to fill this gap by proposing a new instance weighting framework for transfer learning in genetic programming-based symbolic regression. In the new framework, differential evolution is employed to search for optimal weights for source-domain instances, which helps genetic programming to identify more useful source-domain instances and learn from them. Meanwhile, a density estimation method is used to provide good starting points to help the search for the optimal weights while discarding some irrelevant or less important source-domain instances before learning regression models. The experimental results show that compared with genetic programming and support vector regression that learn only from the target instances, and learning from a mixture of instances from the source and target domains without any transfer learning component, the proposed method can evolve regression models which not only achieve notably better cross-domain generalization performance in stability but also reduce the trend of overfitting effectively.

As the previous work, we apply persistent homology to extract topological features from the lowest fourth part of the body silhouette to decrease the negative e\ufb00ects of variations unrelated to the gait in the upper body part. The novelty of this paper is the introduction of the use of a metric learning to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric to robust gait recognition, where we use Linear Discriminant Analysis. This learned metric enforces objects for the same class to be closer while objects from di\ufb00erent classes are pulled apart. We evaluate our approach using the CASIA-B dataset and we show the e\ufb00ectiveness of the methods proposed compared with other state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2884550389", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13072740", "2671115", "29629802", "11783552", "14972102", "186755600", "9410918", "18990699", "2567636", "39378027", "4927468", "2354883", "17635718", "10070153", "7575794", "9401632", "40603932", "11369432", "26683498", "10157879", "11704510", "13262103", "15232411", "14124239", "33897888", "15257598", "26821493", "4654536", "765267", "16435300", "3556514", "42380244", "2371570", "8729458", "52054531", "2643381", "4550091", "18115261", "1815453", "11113049", "9873666", "6899929"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69789391"}

By integrating features derived from gene structure, transcript sequence, potential codon sequence and conservation, lncRScan-SVM outperforms other approaches, which is evaluated by several criteria such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and area under curve (AUC).

In particular, support vector machines (SVMs) have been successfully applied, e.g. to evaluate customer credit worthiness in credit scoring or detect tumorous cells in bio-molecular data analysis. However, ordinary SVMs minimize a continuous approximation for the classification error giving similar importance to each error type. While several modifications have been proposed to make SVMs cost-sensitive the impact of the approximate error measurement is normally not considered. Recently, Orsenigo and Vercellis introduced a discrete SVM (DSVM) formulation [1] that minimize mis-classification errors directly and overcomes possible limitations of an error proxy. For example, DSVM facilitates explicit cost minimization so that this technique is a promising candidate for cost-sensitive learning. Consequently, we compare DSVM with a standard procedure for cost-sensitive SVMs and investigate to what extent improvements in terms of mis-classification costs are achievable.

Since IPCA updates a feature space incrementally by rotating the eigen-axes and increasing the dimensions, the inputs of a neural classifier must also change in their values and the number of input variables. To solve this problem, we derive an approximation of the update formula for memory items, which correspond to representative training samples stored in the long-term memory of RAN-LTM. With these memory items, RAN-LTM is efficiently reconstructed and retrained to adapt to the evolution of the feature space. This function is incorporated into our face recognition system.

While an ecological threshold is a widely accepted concept, most empirical methods detect them in time or across geographic space. Although useful, these approaches do not quantify the direct drivers of threshold response. Causal understanding of thresholds detected empirically requires their investigation in a multi-factor domain containing the direct drivers (often referred to as state space). Here, we present an approach to quantify thresholds from response surfaces modeled empirically in state space. We present two indices of shape attributes measured from response surfaces. The response surfaces are built using a regression method in state space. The indices are threshold strength (T) and diagonality (D). We use 48 simulated response surfaces of different shapes to test the efficacy of the indices in 3D. Our results show that T is sensitive to the steepness of the transition from one state to the next, with various forms of abrupt, centralized thresholds yielding the highest values among the simulated surfaces. D represents the orientation of the response surface or the simultaneous influence of more than one predictor in eliciting the response gradient. Strongly diagonal surfaces have the most diagonal surface area demonstrated by sharply undulating diagonal surfaces. Given that the success of T and D requires a regression method to accurately capture any shape of complex data structure, we also test the accuracy of empirical regression methods known to be tractable with complex data. We test classification and regression trees (CART), Random Forest, and non-parametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) for binary and continuous responses. We use the 48 simulated response surfaces to test the methods, and we find that prediction accuracy depends on both the T and D of the simulated data for each method. We choose the most accurate method among those we test for capturing any shape of response surface from real data, NPMR. Finally, we use NPMR to build response surfaces and quantify T and D from real ecological data sets.

Physical-based (first-principle) models have been shown to be difficult to develop for processes such as plasma etching and plasma deposition, which exhibit highly nonlinear and complex multidimensional relationships between input and output process variables. As a result, many researchers have turned to empirical techniques to model many semiconductor processes. This paper presents a neurofuzzy approach as a general tool for modeling chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. A five-layer feedforward neural network is proposed to model the input-output relationships of a plasma-enhanced CVD deposition of a SiN film. The proposed five-layer network is constructed from a set of input-output training data using unsupervised and supervised neural learning techniques. Product space data clustering is used to perform the partitioning of the input and output spaces. Fuzzy logic rules that describe the input-output relationships are then determined using competitive learning algorithms.

The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the training set size, which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because matrix computation is avoided, SMO scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while the standard chunking SVM algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic in the training set size.

The quality and usability of the derived models depend to a large degree on the availability of highly structured models which represent semantics explicitly and provide a priori knowledge to the interpretation process. The usage of formal grammars for modelling man-made objects has gained increasing interest in the last few years. In order to cope with the variety and complexity of buildings, a large number of fairly sophisticated grammar rules are needed. As yet, such rules mostly have to be designed by human experts. This article describes a novel approach to machine learning of attribute grammar rules based on the Inductive Logic Programming paradigm. Apart from syntactic differences, logic programs and attribute grammars are basically the same language. Attribute grammars extend context-free grammars by attributes and semantic rules and provide a much larger expressive power. Our approach to derive attribute grammars is able to deal with two kinds of input data. On the one hand, we show how attribute grammars can be derived from precise descriptions in the form of examples provided by a human user as the teacher. On the other hand, we present the acquisition of models from noisy observations such as 3D point clouds. This includes the learning of geometric and topological constraints by taking measurement errors into account. The feasibility of our approach is proven exemplarily by stairs, and a generic framework for learning other building parts is discussed. Stairs aggregate an arbitrary number of steps in a manner which is specified by topological and geometric constraints and can be modelled in a recursive way. Due to this recursion, they pose a special challenge to machine learning. In order to learn the concept of stairs, only a small number of examples were required. Our approach represents and addresses the quality of the given observations and the derived constraints explicitly, using concepts from uncertain projective geometry for learning geometric relations and the Wakeby distribution together with decision trees for topological relations.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2010.10.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2092733999", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211204747", "54921143", "14873663", "204781807", "26409342", "25753954", "24496526", "203699731", "53643337", "52278940", "56060781"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62635707"}

Many genes have been implicated in these complex traits. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were designed to investigate the association between common genetic variation and complex human traits using high-throughput platforms that measured hundreds of thousands of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). GWAS have successfully identified many novel genetic loci associated with complex traits using a univariate regression-based approach. Even for traits with a large number of identified variants, only a small fraction of the interindividual variation in risk phenotypes has been explained. In biological systems, protein, DNA, RNA, and metabolites frequently interact to each other to perform their biological functions, and to respond to environmental factors. The complex interactions among genes and between the genes and environment may partially explain the \"missing heritability.\" The traditional regression-based methods are limited to address the complex interactions among the hundreds of thousands of SNPs and their environmental context by both the modeling and computational challenge. Random Forests (RF), one of the powerful machine learning methods, is regarded as a useful alternative to capture the complex interaction effects among the GWAS data, and potentially address the genetic heterogeneity underlying these complex traits using a computationally efficient framework. In this chapter, the features of prediction and variable selection, and their applications in genetic association studies are reviewed and discussed. Additional improvements of the original RF method are warranted to make the applications in GWAS to be more successful.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21029849", "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-12-380862-2.00004-7", "venue": "Advances in genetics", "journal": "Advances in genetics", "mag_id": "1491098415", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2251175"}

In this paper, we propose an accurate and flexible framework for abnormal activity recognition from sensor readings that involves less human tuning of model parameters. Our approach first applies a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM), which supports an infinite number of states, to automatically find an appropriate number of states. We incorporate a Fisher Kernel into the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) model to filter out the activities that are likely to be normal. Finally, we derive an abnormal activity model from the normal activity models to reduce false positive rate in an unsupervised manner. Our main contribution is that our proposed HDP-HMM models can decide the appropriate number of states automatically, and that by incorporating a Fisher Kernel into the OCSVM model, we can combine the advantages from generative model and discriminative model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using several real-world datasets to test our algorithm's performance.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "IJCAI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "148010982", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["580047"], "inbound_citations": ["12909735", "34231359", "84831716", "14384762", "40100916", "85524941", "8965990", "15542497", "13943870", "16484761", "16615980", "15782783", "467663", "52055822", "17779564", "5326927", "1506680", "7562977", "49559356", "49677457", "7355043", "3418935", "17700371", "207932508", "49582752", "51987766", "174797386", "14427604", "10682309", "12500367", "3650154", "3032303", "44462129", "11957692", "1114587", "1876398", "30997628", "196176674", "22323565", "36792295", "7223043", "15502580", "198997721", "26540013", "5833723", "17487364", "15723205"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1949001"}

Such methods cannot hold much information about local feature distributions, and simply concatenate RGB and depth features without exploring the correlation and complementarity between raw RGB and depth images. From the human vision perspective, we recognize the category of one unknown scene mainly relying on the object-level information in the scene which includes the appearance, texture, shape, and depth. The structural distribution of different objects is also taken into consideration. Based on this observation, constructing mid-level representations with discriminative object parts would generally be more attractive for scene analysis. In this paper, we propose a new Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based local multi-modal feature learning framework (LM-CNN) for RGB-D scene classification. This method can effectively capture much of the local structure from the RGB-D scene images and automatically learn a fusion strategy for the object-level recognition step instead of simply training a classifier on top of features extracted from both modalities.

The proposed GAN model can also optimize the prosody of synthesize speech because of the prosody discriminator is also designed in our model. For further reduce the cumulative error mentioned above, this paper propose a training strategy called \"random down\" based on Tacotron2. And then demonstrate that the unimportant attention weights could be a contributing factor to cumulative error when the input sequence is too long. For this, a window has been added to the attention weights. Through these method, the length of the speech synthesis is improved to about 1000 encoder output. The prosody of synthetic speech has also been improved.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3364908.3365292", "venue": "SSPS 2019", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2991571120", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6254678", "206742911", "4689304", "49882757", "104292340", "206771128", "4425995", "4349820", "51929577", "13756489", "52815173", "19888176", "2132511", "8858625", "3488631", "8858625"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208608160"}

The CP is a new mode that is recently proposed in Dual Polarimetry (DP) imaging system. It has several important advantages in comparison with Full Polarimetry (FP) mode such as reduction ability in complexity, cost, mass, data rate of a SAR system. Two strategies are employed for PolSAR feature extraction. In first strategy, the features are extracted using 2 \u00d7 2 covariance matrices of CP modes simulated by RADARSAT-2 C-band FP mode. In second strategy, they are extracted using 3 \u00d7 3 covariance matrices reconstructed from the CP modes called Pseudo Quad (PQ) modes. In each strategy, the extracted PolSAR features are combined and optimal features are selected by Genetic Algorithm (GA) and then a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is applied. Finally, the results are compared with the FP mode. Results of this study show that the PolSAR features extracted from \u03c0 / 4 CP mode, as well as combining the PolSAR features extracted from CP or PQ modes provide a better overall accuracy in classification of forest.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asr.2016.02.007", "venue": null, "journal": "Advances in Space Research", "mag_id": "2288010315", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["9456419", "133978115", "33568416", "3811925", "195508232"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123891944"}

It assumes that a smaller \"filter-out\" factor in the SVM-RFE, which results in a smaller number of gene features eliminated in each recursion, should lead to extraction of a better gene subset. Because the SVM-RFE is highly sensitive to the \"filter-out\" factor, our simulations have shown that this assumption is not always correct and that the SVM-RFE is an unstable algorithm. To select a set of key gene features for reliable prediction of cancer types or subtypes and other applications, a new two-stage SVM-RFE algorithm has been developed. It is designed to effectively eliminate most of the irrelevant, redundant and noisy genes while keeping information loss small at the first stage. A fine selection for the final gene subset is then performed at the second stage. The two-stage SVM-RFE overcomes the instability problem of the SVM-RFE to achieve better algorithm utility. We have demonstrated that the two-stage SVM-RFE is significantly more accurate and more reliable than the SVM-RFE and three correlation-based methods based on our analysis of three publicly available microarray expression datasets.

In light of the advantage of range information in object discovery, we first produce initial object hypotheses by clustering the sparse 3D point cloud. The image pixels registered to the clustered 3D points are taken as samples to learn each object's prior knowledge. The priors are represented by Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) of color and 3D location information only, requiring no high-level features.

Meanwhile, the expression dynamics of the GRN is directly influenced by the activity of the neurons in the reservoir. We term this proposed model as GRN-regulated self-organizing RC (GRN-SO-RC). Contrary to a randomly initialized and fixed structure used in most existing RC models, the structure of the reservoir in the GRN-SO-RC model is self-organized to adapt to the specific task using the GRN-based mechanism. To evaluate the proposed model, experiments have been conducted on several benchmark problems widely used in RC models, such as memory capacity and nonlinear auto-regressive moving average. In addition, we apply the GRN-SO-RC model to solving complex real-world problems, including speech recognition and human action recognition.

Distinct feature extraction methods are simultaneously applied to an acoustic emission (AE) signal to extract unique fault features for diagnosing bearing defects. These fault features are composed of time domain, frequency domain statistical parameters, and complex envelope spectrum analysis. Generally, a high-dimensional feature vector is used to train the standard OAA-MCSVM classifier for diagnosis and identification of bearing defects. However, this classification method ignores individual classifier competence when results from multiple classes are agglomerated for the final decision, and therefore, yields undecided and overlapped feature spaces where classification accuracy is severely degraded. To solve this unreliability problem, this paper introduces a dynamic reliability measure (DReM) technique for individual support vector machines (SVMs) in the one-against-all (OAA) framework. This DReM accounts for the spatial variation of the classifier's performance by finding the local neighborhood of a test sample in the training samples space and defining a new decision function for the OAA-MCSVM. The efficacy of the proposed OAA-MCSVM classifier with DReM is tested for identifying single and multiple combined faults in low-speed bearings.

The role of FSHR in tumor progression as well as osteoporosis advancement has also been well established. Currently, steroid preparations of estrogen and progesterone are being used for managing fertility, in spite of the harmful side effects, as there has not been much success in identification of effective FSHR modulators. Structure-based drug design initiatives for identification of potent and specific FSHR modulators have been impeded due to the non-availability of the complete crystal structure of hFSHR complexed with FSH. Methods In this study, we have modeled the 3D structure of transmembrane domain (TMD) of hFSHR and identified molecules that demonstrate good binding affinity by virtual screening of drug-like library of compounds. The 3D structural and pharmacophoric features of the binders and non-binders obtained from virtual screening were further used to develop Support Vector Machine based classifier for TMD binding. Based on the observations from docking and SVM classification, a small molecule was identified for extensive MD simulations and in vitro assays for FSHR modulatory activity. Results The molecule selected based on docking score and SVM prediction was found to inhibit FSH-induced cAMP activity by 80% at 300 \u03bcM concentration.

We present here a novel neural model that can explain temporal order judgments (TOJs) and their recalibration. Our model employs three ubiquitous features of neural systems: 1) information pooling, 2) opponent processing, and 3) synaptic scaling. Specifically, the model proposes that different populations of neurons encode different delays between motor-sensory events, the outputs of these populations feed into rivaling neural populations (encoding \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d), and the activity difference between these populations determines the perceptual judgment. As a consequence of synaptic scaling of input weights, motor acts which are consistently followed by delayed sensory feedback will cause the network to recalibrate its point of subjective simultaneity. The structure of our model raises the possibility that recalibration of TOJs is a temporal analogue to the motion aftereffect. In other words, identical neural mechanisms may be used to make perceptual determinations about both space and time. Our model captures behavioral recalibration results for different numbers of adapting trials and different adapting delays. In line with predictions of the model, we additionally demonstrate that temporal recalibration can last through time, in analogy to storage of the motion aftereffect.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3487422", "pubmed_id": "23130010", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00470", "venue": "Front.

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification integrated with a selection of the features in a kernel space is proposed. The selection criterion is defined by the kernel class separability. Based on this SVM classification, a framework to follow up brain tumor evolution is proposed, which consists of the following steps: to learn the brain tumors and select the features from the first magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the patients; to automatically segment the tumor in new data using a multi-kernel SVM based classification; to refine the tumor contour by a region growing technique; and to possibly carry out an adaptive training. The proposed system was tested on 13 patients with 24 examinations, including 72 MRI sequences and 1728 images.

Despite the significant progress in graph kernels, existing graph kernels focus on either unlabeled or discretely labeled graphs, while efficient and expressive representation and comparison of graphs with continuous high-dimensional vector labels, remains an open research problem. We introduce a novel method, the pyramid quantized Weisfeiler-Lehman graph representation to tackle the graph comparison problem for continuous vector labeled graphs. Our algorithm considers statistics of subtree patterns based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm and uses a pyramid quantization strategy to determine a logarithmic number of discrete labelings.

The data is a subset from the Stockholm EPR Corpus, a data set available within our research group. These are used for the training and evaluation of an automatic system based on the Conditional Random Fields algorithm. Evaluating with four-fold cross-validation on sets of around 4-6 000 annotation instances, we obtained very promising results for both Gold Standards: F-score around 0.80 for a number of experiments, with higher results for certain annotation classes. Moreover, 49 false positives that were verified true positives were found by the system but missed by the annotators.ConclusionsOur intention is to make this Gold standard, The Stockholm EPR PHI Corpus, available to other research groups in the future.

Strong motivation for studying this problem is gained from new, complex and somewhat unspecified robotic tasks such as assembly, machining, and remote handling in an unstructured environment, where automation currently represents one of the most challenging topics in robotics. A common control problem in this type of tasks is how to describe the robot-environment dynamics in a correct way and synthesize control laws, which would stabilize both the desired position and the interactive force. As is well known, many manipulation robots have to operate in uncertain and variable environments. Thus, the characteristics of the environment can be assumed to be unknown and changing significantly dependent on the given task. Besides environmental uncertainties, various system uncertainties, being the result of imprecise position of workpiece, varying stiffness of the environment, robot tool and robot itself, etc., have an essential influence on the system\u2019s behaviour. For example, in the case of using fixed position/force gains for conventional compliance control tasks, these controllers perform satisfactorily when the environment parameters, such as stiffness, are known.

As the depth features are available only in the training data, we treat the depth features as privileged information, and we formulate this task as a distance metric learning with privileged information problem. Unlike the traditional face verification and person re-identification tasks that only use visual features, we further employ the extra depth features in the training data to improve the learning of distance metric in the training process.

In this work, a data-driven method for flight data anomaly detection with enhanced adaptability is proposed based on multimodal regression model. Firstly, a complete flight trajectory is divided by flight mode recognition, and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) regression is used as the basic anomaly detection method. Secondly, the dynamic input parameters of RVM models are automatically extracted by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between different flight parameters in each flight mode. Finally, RVM-based anomaly detection models in different flight modes are established. To deal with different flight trajectories, switching the anomaly detection model according to the flight mode can achieve adaptive anomaly detection. Experiments based on real flight data of UAV verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the adaptability of the anomaly detection approach can be improved.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/I2MTC.2019.8827154", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC)", "journal": "2019 IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2972875482", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15062628", "32557938", "108765061", "52004078", "21156902", "64748358", "19449639", "9627431", "42063929", "51969748", "27870078", "17926933", "49601586", "158470062", "7596571", "30718508"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202158811"}

Early detection of these molecular changes is a key aspect for the success of interventions aimed at slowing down rates of cognitive decline. Recent evidence indicates that of the two established methods for measuring amyloid, a decrease in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) amyloid \u03b21\u221242 (A\u03b21\u221242) may be an earlier indicator of Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk than measures of amyloid obtained from Positron Emission Topography (PET). However, CSF collection is highly invasive and expensive. In contrast, blood collection is routinely performed, minimally invasive and cheap. In this work, we develop a blood-based signature that can provide a cheap and minimally invasive estimation of an individual\u2019s CSF amyloid status using a machine learning approach. We show that a Random Forest model derived from plasma analytes can accurately predict subjects as having abnormal (low) CSF A\u03b21\u221242 levels indicative of AD risk (0.84 AUC, 0.78 sensitivity, and 0.73 specificity). Refinement of the modeling indicates that only APOE\u03b54 carrier status and four analytes are required to achieve a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, we show across an independent validation cohort that individuals with predicted abnormal CSF A\u03b21\u221242 levels transitioned to an AD diagnosis over 120 months significantly faster than those predicted with normal CSF A\u03b21\u221242 levels and that the resulting model also performs reasonably across PET A\u03b21\u221242 status.

One drawback of their approach is that it cannot be applied to either attributed or labeled graphs. In this paper, we aim to define a new Jensen-Shannon diffusion kernel for attributed graphs. We commence by using a tree-index based label strengthening method on an attributed graph with the objection of strengthening the vertex labels. We compute a label entropy to measure the uncertainty of the strengthened labels. With the required label entropies for a pair of graphs to hand, a new kernel for the pair of graphs can be defined by measuring the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the entropies. As the strengthened label of a vertex corresponds to a sub tree rooted at the vertex, the label entropy of a graph is determined by all sub trees identified by the tree-index algorithm.

This research is inclined on two main aspects: first, an in-depth analysis of image-based approaches is given particularly for the situation containing large number of pedestrians (i.e., crowds) and second, our proposed approach which mainly focuses on computing the flow data, modeling, and classifying the corresponding behaviors of pedestrians in a crowd. The dynamic data of underlying crowd scenes establish a large cloud of information (i.e., correlated or un-correlated data). Therefore, it is essential to extract the meaningful information from the data cloud however the selection of criteria is a crucial task which is answered in the first part of the paper. Moreover, in crowded scenes, it is challenging to extract individual characteristics (e.g., head, torso, or leg count) of every pedestrian forming the crowd. Because, the pedestrians do not own these characteristics while moving in the form of groups. Therefore, we can not rely on such individual information of every pedestrian for longer time instances. Based on this fact, in this research, we measure the dynamic contents over consecutive frames. After this, we model this information by computing the Histogram of Flow (HOF) for each time instance. Later, we classify these HOF features according to our behavior-specific classes. We have tested the proposed approach on the dataset recorded with the help of approximately 30 volunteers. In the context of pedestrian behaviors characterization, we have employed Support Vector Machines on our recorded dataset and achieved 91 % classification rate.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-10629-8_22", "venue": "Traffic and Granular Flow '13", "journal": "Traffic and Granular Flow '13", "mag_id": "173681202", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59865986"}

The sparseness of ensemble learning has attracted much attention in recent years. In this paper, a novel multiobjective sparse ensemble learning (MOSEL) model is proposed. Firstly, to describe the ensemble classifiers more precisely the detection error trade-off (DET) curve is taken into consideration. The sparsity ratio (sr) is treated as the third objective to be minimized, in addition to false positive rate (fpr) and false negative rate (fnr) minimization. The MOSEL turns out to be augmented DET (ADET) convex hull maximization problem. Secondly, several evolutionary multiobjective algorithms are exploited to find sparse ensemble classifiers with strong performance. The relationship between the sparsity and the performance of ensemble classifiers on the ADET space is explained. Thirdly, an adaptive MOSEL classifiers selection method is designed to select the most suitable ensemble classifiers for a given dataset. The proposed MOSEL method is applied to well-known MNIST datasets and a real-world remote sensing image change detection problem, and several datasets are used to test the performance of the method on this problem.

On combining the four vital signs with six CFs, the performance was found to be deteriorating.The input feature vectors are expressed as patient independent basis vectors using Fisher Vector Encoding (FVE). In this work we focus on fusing the vital signs with CFs after encoding with an objective of enhancing the performance of the MPM significantly. We obtained an overall classification accuracy of 98.46%, sensitivity of 98.59%, and specificity of 98.01% with FVE-linear SVM which achieved a performance improvement of 1.32% absolute for classification accuracy, 3.19% absolute for sensitivity and 0.78% absolute for specificity with respect to the baseline system with four vital signs.

However, if not being designed properly, carbon market cannot fulfill its original intention of design under the influences of both internal and external disturbances. There is an urgent need for models or tools for ex-ante simulation analysis of the carbon market. Since in a market environment, disturbances will influence the carbon market dynamics through trading behaviors, it is important to accurately model carbon trading behaviors. In this paper, an improved carbon trading behavioral modelling method combining discretized statistical analysis and extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed. Based on the trading samples of human participants, stochastic behavioral model can be constructed by using discretized statistical analysis method. However, the unevenly distributed number of samples make it difficult to obtain reliable statistical results in some discretized value intervals. Thus, based on the results of discretized statistical analysis, ELM is used to further improve modeling accuracy by utilizing its generalization capability.

The marginal cost is required to supply electricity to incremental loads in case where a certain node increases power demands in a balanced power system. LMP plays an important role to maintain economic efficiency in power markets in a way that electricity flows from a low-cost area to high-cost one and the transmission network congestion is alleviated. The power market players are interested in maximizing the profits and minimizing the risks through selling and buying electricity. As a result, it is of importance to obtain accurate information on electricity pricing forecasting in advance so that their desire is reflected. This paper presents the Gaussian Process (GP) technique that comes from the extension of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in a way that hierarchical Bayesian estimation is introduced to express the model parameter as the stochastic variables. The advantage is that the model accuracy of GP is better than others.

This dissertation proposes the application of signal processing methods on physiological signals to extract from them features that can be processed by learning pattern recognition systems to provide cues about a person's affective state. In particular, combining physiological information sensed from a user's left hand in a non-invasive way with the pupil diameter information from an eye-tracking system may provide a computer with an awareness of its user's affective responses in the course of human-computer interactions. In this study an integrated hardware-software setup was developed to achieve automatic assessment of the affective status of a computer user. A computer-based \"Paced Stroop Test\" was designed as a stimulus to elicit emotional stress in the subject during the experiment. Four signals: the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), the Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), the Skin Temperature (ST) and the Pupil Diameter (PD), were monitored and analyzed to differentiate affective states in the user. Several signal processing techniques were applied on the collected signals to extract their most relevant features. These features were analyzed with learning classification systems, to accomplish the affective state identification. Three learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine were applied to this identification process and their levels of classification accuracy were compared. The results achieved indicate that the physiological signals monitored do, in fact, have a strong correlation with the changes in the emotional states of the experimental subjects. These results also revealed that the inclusion of pupil diameter information significantly improved the performance of the emotion recognition system.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1493558482", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58114587"}

In this study we investigate the predictive power of sMRI in ASD using 373 ASD and 361 TDC male subjects from the ABIDE. Brain morphometric features were derived using FreeSurfer and classification was performed using three different techniques: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). Although high classification accuracies were possible in individual sites (with a maximum of 97% in Caltech), the highest classification accuracy across all sites was only 60% (sensitivity = 57%, specificity = 64%). However, the accuracy across all sites improved to 67% when IQ and age information were added to morphometric features. Across all three classifiers, volume and surface area had more discriminative power. In general, important features for classification were present in the frontal and temporal regions and these regions have been implicated in ASD.

In this paper, we develop a new kernel, called centralized GRBF. Further, the two GRBF and centralized GRBF are combined by using a new ensemble kernel technique, called Coupled Ensemble-Kernels (CEK), to improve OCSVM for anomaly detection. Therefore, the final classification model is itself a large-margin classifier while it is actually an ensemble classifier coined with two sub-large-margin models.

Most of the conventional DTA prediction methods are simulation-based, which rely heavily on domain knowledge or the assumption of having the 3D structure of the targets, which are often difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, traditional machine learning-based methods apply various features and descriptors, and simply depend on the similarities between drug-target pairs. Recently, with the increasing amount of affinity data available and the success of deep representation learning models on various domains, deep learning techniques have been applied to DTA prediction. However, these methods consider either label/one-hot encodings or the topological structure of molecules, without considering the local chemical context of amino acids and SMILES sequences. Motivated by this, we propose a novel end-to-end learning framework, called DeepGS, which uses deep neural networks to extract the local chemical context from amino acids and SMILES sequences, as well as the molecular structure from the drugs. To assist the operations on the symbolic data, we propose to use advanced embedding techniques (i.e., Smi2Vec and Prot2Vec) to encode the amino acids and SMILES sequences to a distributed representation. Meanwhile, we suggest a new molecular structure modeling approach that works well under our framework. We have conducted extensive experiments to compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art models including KronRLS, SimBoost, DeepDTA and DeepCPI.

Our method directly learns an end-to-end mapping between the low/high-resolution images. The method is based on depthwise separable convolution super-resolution generative adversarial network (DSCSRGAN). A new depthwise separable convolution dense block (DSC Dense Block) was designed for the generator network, which improved the ability to represent and extract image features, while greatly reducing the total amount of parameters. For the discriminator network, the batch normalization (BN) layer was discarded, and the problem of artifacts was reduced. A frequency energy similarity loss function was designed to constrain the generator network to generate better super-resolution images. Experiments on several different datasets showed that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) was improved by more than 3 dB, structural similarity index (SSIM) was increased by 16%, and the total parameter was reduced to 42.8% compared with the original model.

In one-class image classification, one tries to detect pixels belonging to one of the classes in the image and reject the others. When few labeled pixels of only one class are available, obtaining a reliable classifier is a difficult task. In the particular case of SVM-based classifiers, this task is even harder because the free parameters of the model need to be finely adjusted, but no clear criterion can be adopted. In order to improve the OC-SVM classifier accuracy and alleviate the problem of free-parameter selection, the information provided by unlabeled samples present in the scene can be used. In this paper, we present two state-of-the-art algorithms for semisupervised one-class classification for remote sensing classification problems. The first proposed algorithm is based on modifying the OC-SVM kernel by modeling the data marginal distribution with the graph Laplacian built with both labeled and unlabeled samples. The second one is based on a simple modification of the standard SVM cost function which penalizes more the errors made when classifying samples of the target class. The good performance of the proposed methods is illustrated in four challenging remote sensing image classification scenarios where the goal is to detect one of the classes present on the scene. In particular, we present results for multisource urban monitoring, hyperspectral crop detection, multispectral cloud screening, and change-detection problems.

Term extraction is a prerequisite for all aspects of ontology learning. It is the automatic mining of complete terms from the input document. Another important part of ontology is taxonomy, or the hierarchy of concepts. It presents a tree view of the ontology and shows the inheritance between subconcepts and superconcepts. In this research, two methods were proposed for improving the performance of the extraction result. The first method uses particle swarm optimization in order to optimize the weights of features. The advantage of particle swarm optimization is that it can calculate and adjust the weight of each feature according to the appropriate value, and here it is used to improve the performance of term and taxonomy extraction. The second method uses a hybrid technique that uses multi-objective particle swarm optimization and fuzzy systems that ensures that the membership functions and fuzzy system rule sets are optimized. The advantage of using a fuzzy system is that the imprecise and uncertain values of feature weights can be tolerated during the extraction process. This method is used to improve the performance of taxonomy extraction. In the term extraction experiment, five extracted features were used for each term from the document. These features were represented by feature vectors consisting of domain relevance, domain consensus, term cohesion, first occurrence and length of noun phrase. For taxonomy extraction, matching Hearst lexico-syntactic patterns in documents and the web, and hypernym information form WordNet were used as the features that represent each pair of terms from the texts. These two proposed methods are evaluated using a dataset that contains documents about tourism. For term extraction, the proposed method is compared with benchmark algorithms such as Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency, Weirdness, Glossary Extraction and Term Extractor, using the precision performance evaluation measurement. For taxonomy extraction, the proposed methods are compared with benchmark methods of Feature-based and weighting by Support Vector Machine using the f-measure, precision and recall performance evaluation measurements. For the first method, the experiment results concluded that implementing particle swarm optimization in order to optimize the feature weights in terms and taxonomy extraction leads to improved accuracy of extraction result compared to the benchmark algorithms. For the second method, the results concluded that the hybrid technique that uses multi-objective particle swarm optimization and fuzzy systems leads to improved performance of taxonomy extraction results when compared to the benchmark methods, while adjusting the fuzzy membership function and keeping the number of fuzzy rules to a minimum number with a high degree of accuracy.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2919762328", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86741843"}

As irrigated agriculture accounts for roughly 80% of the state\u2019s managed water supply, agriculture simultaneously shows high vulnerability to a warming climate while also offering the greatest opportunity to mitigate the impact of future droughts through adaptation strategies. This dissertation took advantage of hyperspectral Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and thermal MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) imagery collected by the HyspIRI Airborne Campaign over three years of a multi-year drought to measure agricultural response to changes in water availability and highlight the potential of remote sensing to aid in future agricultural management during water-limited times. In Chapter 2, I used the Random Forest classifier to classify crops into categories of similar water usages, assess the accuracy at which hyperspectral imaging could be of use for agricultural mapping, and evaluate changes in crop plantings with drought. The results showed overall field-level accuracies of 94.4% with AVIRIS, as opposed to 90.4% with Landsat OLI and 91.7% with Sentinel, indicating that hyperspectral imagery has the potential to identify crops by water-use group at a single time step at higher accuracies than multispectral sensors. With these classifications, I quantified shifts in crop plantings over drought and found a prioritization of high-value, perennial crops over lower-valued annual plantings. In Chapter 3, I used paired AVIRIS and MASTER imagery to assess crop stress in fruit and nut orchards using an approach that accounted for thermal complexity within the landscape, without the need for ancillary environmental measurements. I used surface characteristics obtained by AVIRIS data to model expected pixel temperatures. These temperatures were compared to measured temperatures as a way of assessing crop stress. Crop species showed significantly different temperature distributions independent of fractional cover (F(10, 33135) = 735, p l 0.001 for 2013, with similar results in 2014 and 2015). Crop residuals were found to increase as the drought progressed with average residuals of 0.14\u00b0C in 2013, 0.97\u00b0C in 2014, and 1.1\u00b0C in 2015. In addition, crops with the highest LST residuals had the largest reductions in yield during the study period. In Chapter 4, I analyzed spatiotemporal patterns of water vapor as they varied across a diverse and dynamic agricultural scene. I tested a set of hypotheses to better understand surface-atmosphere interactions and their ability to be evaluated through AVIRIS-derived column water vapor estimates. Results showed a positive correlation between crop water use and the frequency with which that crop showed directional alignment between wind and water vapor (r=0.42). We also found patterns of water vapor across the region that support advection of moisture across the scene. Results conclude that accumulation of water vapor above fields in these scenes is observable with water vapor imagery while advection at the field level is obscured by variable winds, differences in field structure and composition, and smaller-scale patterns of vapor. Overall, this dissertation enhances scientific and social ability to monitor and assist in food and water resource management with remote sensing during drought.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2986955876", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210268645"}

In this paper, a novel sensor location approach is proposed for the purpose of fault isolation using population-based incremental learning (PBIL). A directed graph is used to model the fault propagation of a complex engineering system. The multidimensional causal relationships of faults and symptoms were obtained via traversing the directed path in the directed graph. To locate the minimal quantity of sensors for desired fault isolatability, the problem of sensor location was firstly formulated as an optimization problem and then handled using PBIL.

However, the existing Adaboost algorithms take simple threshold weak classifiers, which are too weak to fit complex distributions, as the hypothesis space.

However, current methods of tool fault diagnosis lack accuracy. Therefore, in the present paper, a fault diagnosis method was proposed based on stationary subspace analysis (SSA) and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) using only a single sensor. First, SSA was used to extract stationary and non-stationary sources from multi-dimensional signals without the need for independency and without prior information of the source signals, after the dimensionality of the vibration signal observed by a single sensor was expanded by phase space reconstruction technique. Subsequently, 10 dimensionless parameters in the time-frequency domain for non-stationary sources were calculated to generate samples to train the LS-SVM. Finally, the measured vibration signals from tools of an unknown state and their non-stationary sources were separated by SSA to serve as test samples for the trained SVM. The experimental validation demonstrated that the proposed method has better diagnosis accuracy than three previous methods based on LS-SVM alone, Principal component analysis and LS-SVM or on SSA and Linear discriminant analysis.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/app7040346", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2600291457", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["109800504", "109094289", "54870865", "120244850", "18187079", "109722228", "110624466", "119391599", "138244343", "13396902", "110004135", "106416905", "12041299", "111306724", "119756027", "21976484", "14608423", "17989154", "8337946", "45234673", "120261124", "63613167", "62728341", "14285782", "12003790", "20726552", "123701605", "112266388", "12051918", "5725427", "13586513", "28898256"], "inbound_citations": ["211571656", "53080481", "55739703", "207912035", "58005464", "53302812", "201813429"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15614863"}

We analyze a simple recurrent decision making architecture and show that it leads to a diffusive accumulation process.

It is realized by constructing a prediction model between real-time equipment sensor data and the quality characteristics of wafers that should be measured. The most commonly employed prediction method for VM is a neural network (NN) approach due to its flexibility and fast computation time. However, it can easily suffer from the overfitting problem and is affected by naturally occurring potential outlying observations contained in given data. Moreover, it does not provide prediction intervals for future observations that can be used to detect abnormal process problems. In this paper, an advanced prediction model for VM is developed to resolve these issues. The proposed method is a robust regression model based on relevance vector machine. The proposed method can reduce the effect of outliers by using a weight strategy. Given a prior distribution of weights, it is shown that the weight values can be determined in a probabilistic way and computed automatically during training. We employ the variational inference method to estimate the posterior distribution over model parameters. Therefore, no validation data set is needed to control the model complexity. That is, the complexity of our proposed method can be self-adjusted in the model training phase. Based on the posterior distribution, we can obtain not only point estimates but useful statistical information such as probabilistic intervals which provide us some useful information about the current status of a manufacturing process. If the actual metrology value falls outside of the intervals, it can be a signal which alerts engineers to the need for preventive maintenance or VM model adjustment. The real plasma etching process of semiconductor manufacturing is presented as a case study to compare the predictive performance of our proposed method with that of conventional VM prediction models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve VM prediction accuracy compared to other methods.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSM.2013.2286498", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2115896184", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["27113997", "3544559", "10744932", "8564592", "1194426", "10079548", "27730459", "209831924", "122812414", "34548714", "2703722", "15773336", "52781885", "7596571", "61563242", "390988", "14546073", "16858634", "12948174", "120273037", "97336420", "23369806", "62753680", "10203109", "5985333", "137499107", "7138354", "1900499", "9288920", "64543020", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["22140352", "113811072", "17391377", "58675083", "212651953", "203156985"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20451564"}

We use Bayes' theorem and a curvilinear forward model for the likelihood of the measurements of cluster members in the colour-magnitude space, to infer posterior membership probabilities.

Our study objective was to identify the relative effects of climate, vegetation, topography, and human activity on fire occurrence in Chinese boreal forest landscapes. We used historical fire ignition for 1966-2005 and the statistical method of Kernel Density Estimation to derive fire-occurrence density (number of fires/km(2)). The Random Forest models were used to quantify the relative effects of climate, vegetation, topography, and human activity on fire-occurrence density. Our results showed that fire-occurrence density tended to be spatially clustered. Human-caused fire occurrence was highly clustered at the southern part of the region, where human population density is high (comprising about 75% of the area's population). In the north-central areas where elevations are the highest in the region and less densely populated, lightning-caused fires were clustered. Climate factors (e.g., fine fuel and duff moisture content) were important at both regional and landscape scales. Human activity factors (e.g., distance to nearest settlement and road) were secondary to climate as the primary fire occurrence factors. Predictions of fire regimes often assume a strong linkage between climate and fire but usually with less emphasis placed on the effects of local factors such as human activity. We therefore suggest that accurate forecasting of fire regime should include human influences such as those measured by forest proximity to roads and human settlements.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24960228", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.011", "venue": "The Science of the total environment", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1964208927", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["20683599", "83671305", "85645648", "86391876", "53960403", "54932163", "4418643", "89141", "54000008", "52084217", "52085820", "116746157", "131787325", "40664774", "54762529", "8778514", "53994376", "16693035", "16256385", "88502123", "84416746", "42993590", "8126347", "55882099", "56036038", "11203689", "38636954", "87624253", "3093707", "26410408", "18533885", "84302565", "52949614", "53956261", "86663118", "84527740", "2509411", "51766158", "10660498", "885786", "30243551", "961177", "83863726", "84873013", "154457490", "129855161", "59272536", "10390535", "20545178", "83891019", "59578713"], "inbound_citations": ["21677754", "130421804", "5288252", "55740734", "104293094", "4673800", "125871235", "17219684", "49583762", "133400330", "44049093", "42589257", "22359451", "158450153", "155436382"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3384654"}
{"paper_id": "4864500", "title": "Three fundamental pillars of decision-centered teamwork", "authors": [{"first": "Leandro", "middle": ["Soriano"], "last": "Marcolino", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This thesis introduces a novel paradigm in artificial intelligence: decision-centered teamwork. Decision-centered teamwork is the analysis of agent teams that iteratively take joint decisions into solving complex problems. Although teams of agents have been used to take decisions in many important domains, such as: machine learning, crowdsourcing, forecasting systems, and even board games; a study of a general framework for decisioncentered teamwork has never been presented in the literature before. I divide decision-centered teamwork in three fundamental challenges: (i) Agent Selection, which consists of selecting a set of agents from an exponential universe of possible teams; (ii) Aggregation of Opinions, which consists of designing methods to aggregate the opinions of different agents into taking joint team decisions; (iii) Team Assessment, which consists of designing methods to identify whether a team is failing, allowing a \u201ccoordinator\u201d to take remedial procedures. In this thesis, I handle all these challenges. For Agent Selection, I introduce novel models of diversity for teams of voting agents. My models rigorously show that teams made of the best agents are not necessarily optimal, and also clarify in which situations diverse teams should be preferred. In particular, I show that diverse teams get stronger as the number of actions increases, by analyzing how the agents\u2019 probability distribution function over actions changes. This has never been presented before in the ensemble systems literature. I also show that diverse teams have a great applicability for design problems, where the objective is to maximize the number of optimal solutions for human selection, combining for the first time social choice with number theory. All of these theoretical models and predictions are verified in real systems, such as Computer Go and architectural design. In particular, for architectural design I optimize the design of buildings with agent teams not only for cost and project requirements, but also for energy-efficiency, being thus an essential domain for sustainability. Concerning Aggregation of Opinions, I evaluate classical ranked voting rules from social choice in Computer Go, only to discover that plurality leads to the best results. This happens because real agents tend to have very noisy rankings. Hence, I create a ranking by sampling extraction technique, leading to significantly better results with the Borda voting rule. A similar study is also performed in the social networks domain, in the context of influence maximization. Additionally, I study a novel problem in social networks: I assume only a subgraph of the network is initially known, and we must spread influence and learn the graph simultaneously. I analyze a linear combination of two greedy algorithms, outperforming both of them. This domain has a great potential for health, as I run experiments in four real-life social networks from the homeless population of Los Angeles, aiming at spreading HIV prevention information. Finally, with regards to Team Assessment, I develop a domain independent team assessment methodology for teams of voting agents. My method is within a machine learning framework, and learns a prediction model over the voting patterns of a team, instead of learning over the possible states of the problem. The methodology is tested and verified in Computer Go and Ensemble Learning.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2578492295", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4864500"}

There are many cases in which the simultaneous monitoring or control of two or more related quality characteristics is required. Out-of-control signals in multivariate charts may be caused by one or more variables or a set of variables. One of the challenges in multivariate process control is the interpretation of an out-of- control signal. That is, we have to determine which variable is responsible for the signal. In this study, we formulated the interpretation of out-of- control signal as a classification problem. The proposed system includes a shift detector and a classifier. The traditional multivariate chart works as a mean shift detector. Once an out-of- control signal is generated, an SVM-based classifier will determine which variable is responsible for the mean shift. We propose using subgroup data and extracted features (sample mean and Mahalanobis distance) as the input vectors of classifier. The proposed approach will be demonstrated by multivariate processes with two and three quality characteristics. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated by computing its classification accuracy. The traditional decomposition method is used as a baseline for comparison. Results from simulation studies indicate that the proposed approach is a successful method in identifying the source of mean change. The results reveal that SVM using extracted features as input vector has slightly better classification performance than using raw data as input.

Advantages and disadvantages of the two text classification algorithms are presented in the field of petro-chemical processes. Our tests also show that more attention to the professional vocabulary can significantly improve the F1 value of the two algorithms. These results have reference value for the future information classification in related industry fields.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1515/cait-2016-0078", "venue": null, "journal": "Cybernetics and Information Technologies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2581504428", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2427083", "63407572", "63159890", "214691648", "64218506", "62017163", "30585209", "37707347", "43865785", "17474135", "33758745", "6473756"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63090231"}

Leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground biomass (AGB) were used as indicators of pasture conditions under varying climate and human activities.

Although some computational models have been developed to predict S-nitrosylation sites, their accuracy is still low.

This paper presents a genetic programming (GP) based approach to identifying the primary cause of oyster norovirus outbreaks and predicting oyster norovirus outbreaks in order to reduce the risks. In terms of the primary cause, it was found that oyster norovirus outbreaks were controlled by cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions characterized by low solar radiation, low water temperature, low gage height (the height of water above a gage datum), low salinity, heavy rainfall, and strong offshore wind. The six environmental variables were determined by using Random Forest (RF) and Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) methods within the framework of the GP approach. In terms of predicting norovirus outbreaks, a risk-based GP model was developed using the six environmental variables and various combinations of the variables with different time lags. The results of local and global sensitivity analyses showed that gage height, temperature, and solar radiation were by far the three most important environmental predictors for oyster norovirus outbreaks, though other variables were also important. Specifically, very low temperature and gage height significantly increased the risk of norovirus outbreaks while high solar radiation markedly reduced the risk, suggesting that low temperature and gage height were associated with the norovirus source while solar radiation was the primary sink of norovirus. The GP model was utilized to hindcast daily risks of oyster norovirus outbreaks along the Northern Gulf of Mexico coast. The daily hindcasting results indicated that the GP model was capable of hindcasting all historical oyster norovirus outbreaks from January 2002 to June 2014 in the Gulf of Mexico with only two false positive outbreaks for the 12.5-year period. The performance of the GP model was characterized with the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.86, the true positive rate (sensitivity) of 78.53% and the true negative rate (specificity) of 88.82%, respectively, demonstrating the efficacy of the GP model. The findings and results offered new insights into the oyster norovirus outbreaks in terms of source, sink, cause, and predictors.

In a nuthsell, fooling is an algorithmic task in which the input sample is drawn from some target distribution and the goal is to output a synthetic distribution that is indistinguishable from the target w.r.t to some fixed class of tests. This framework received considerable attention in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a recently proposed approach which achieves impressive empirical results. ::: From a theoretical viewpoint this problem seems difficult to model. This is due to the fact that in its basic form, the notion of foolability is susceptible to a type of overfitting called memorizing. This raises a challenge of devising notions and definitions that separate between fooling algorithms that generate new synthetic data vs. algorithms that merely memorize or copy the training set. ::: The first model we consider is called GAM--Foolability and is inspired by GANs. Here the learner has only an indirect access to the target distribution via a discriminator. The second model, called DP--Foolability, exploits the notion of differential privacy as a candidate criterion for non-memorization. ::: We proceed to characterize foolability within these two models and study their interrelations. We show that DP--Foolability implies GAM--Foolability and prove partial results with respect to the converse. It remains, though, an open question whether GAM--Foolability implies DP--Foolability. ::: We also present an application in the context of differentially private PAC learning. We show that from a statistical perspective, for any class H, learnability by a private proper learner is equivalent to the existence of a private sanitizer for H.

The proposed scheme consists of posing the SVR problem entirely as a Linear Programming (LP) problem and on the development of a sequential optimization method based on variables decomposition, constraints decomposition, and the use of primal-dual interior point methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach has comparable performance with other SV-based classifiers. Particularly, experiments demonstrate that as the problem size increases, the sparser the solution becomes, and more computational efficiency can be gained in comparison with other methods. To reduce the LP-SVR training time, a method is developed that takes advantage of the fact that the support vectors (SVs) are likely to lie on the convex hull of each class. The algorithm uses the Mahalanobis distance from the class sample mean in order to rank each sample in the training set; then the samples with the largest distances are used as part of the initial working set. Experimental results show a reduction in the total training time as well as a significant decrease in the total iterations percentage. Results also suggest that using the speedup strategy, the SVs are found earlier in the learning process. Also, this research introduces a method to find the set of LP-SVR hyper-parameters; experimental results show that the algorithm provides hyper-parameters that minimize an estimate of the true test generalization error. ::: Finally, the SVR scheme shows state-of-the-art performance in various applications such as power load prediction forecasting, texture-based image segmentation, and classification of remotely sensed imagery. This demonstrates that the proposed learning scheme and the LP-SVR model are robust and efficient when compared with other methodologies for large-scale problems.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "138608707", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["43563447", "28089358", "2486035", "729000", "45447900"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59849049"}

In every learning stage, an algorithmic learner takes as input one element of an information sequence for some target concept and its previously made hypothesis and outputs a new hypothesis. The sequence of hypotheses has to converge to a hypothesis describing the target concept correctly.We study the following refinements of this basic scenario. Bounded example-memory inference generalizes iterative inference by allowing an iterative learner to additionally store an a priori bounded number of carefully chosen data elements, while feedback learning generalizes it by allowing the iterative learner to additionally ask whether or not a particular data element did already appear in the input data seen so far.For the case of learning from noise-free data, we show that, when both positive and negative data are available, restrictions on the accessibility of the input data do not limit the learning capabilities if and only if the relevant iterative learners are allowed to query the history of the learning process or to store at least one carefully selected data element. This insight nicely contrasts the fact that, in case only positive data are available, restrictions on the accessibility of the input data seriously affect the learning capabilities of all versions of incremental learners.For the case of learning from noisy data, we present characterizations of all kinds of incremental learning in terms being independent from learning theory. The relevant conditions are purely structural ones. Surprisingly, when learning from noisy text and noisy informant is concerned, even iterative learners are exactly as powerful as unconstrained learning devices.", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S0304-3975(01)00404-2", "venue": "Theor.

The crested ibis had been critically endangered,and currently its population is rapidly recovering.The range of the crested ibis is still small after its recovery from the critical endangered status,so that climate change might be a threat to its long term survival.We used the locations of nest site to represent the distribution of the crested ibis,which have a high accuracy level and has being accumulated from 1981 to 2010.We applied nine modes in BIOMOD(a package of R software) to predict the current(1950\u20142000) and future(i.e.2020,2050,and 2080) distribution ranges of the crested ibis using five climate variables(i.e.annual minimum temperature,annual maximum temperature,seasonal variance of temperature,annual total precipitation,and seasonal variance of precipitation) based on CGCM2 climate model A2a emission scenario in WorldClim database.The nice models are Generalized Linear Models,Generalized Additive Models,Classification Tree Analysis,Artificial Neural Networks,Mixture Discriminant Analysis,Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines,Generalized Boosting Models,Random Forest,and Surface Range Envelope. We compared the current climate conditions with those in 2080,and found that the current habitat of the crested ibis would become warmer and wetter in the future.All nine models indicated that the crested ibis would have a northward range shift(actually a higher elevation shift),and the distribution center would be out of the current nature reserve.Therefore,it is necessary to develop a long term conservation plan for the crested ibis,e.g.adjusting the nature reserve border or design a new nature reserve.The nine models showed differences in predicted ranges,weights of explanatory variables,and goodness-of-fit(based on ROC curves and Cohen\u2032s Kappa indices).Among five climate variables,the seasonal variance of precipitation is the most important variable that associated with distribution of the crested ibis;and seasonal variance of temperature is the secondly important variable.The overall performance of all models are very high,indicated the distribution of the crested ibis had a strong pattern(The crested ibis is well constrained by environmental variables,not scattered randomly).The Random Forest has the highest model performance,and the Artificial Neural Networks ranks the second.The high performance of the two models is partly due to their high complexity. We should be cautious whenever using species distribution models to predict the effect of climate change,because such models are based on the assumption that climate variables are the limiting variables restricting the range of the species,and the current population is in its favorite climate niche.As to the crested ibis,the assumption can hardly be satisfied,because other environmental variables such as human disturbance,wetland,and vegetation are also important to the crested ibis.As a result,the predicted range shift of the crested ibis is only a trend or potential distribution pattern in the future. Because of the difference in model prediction and variability of model performance,we suggest to use ensemble models to deal with complex problem such as biological consequences of climate change to decrease the errors from models.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5846/stxb201103110297", "venue": null, "journal": "Acta Ecologica Sinica", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2332217488", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["4940255", "36864195", "969382", "4648087", "611169", "53649414", "53591420", "24043206", "24288127", "87893656", "130062815", "130188406", "131412528", "44853877", "88003409", "87210446", "83988026", "117796698", "2708071", "60993494", "118694839", "122018810", "33779230", "14723701", "7955044", "89141", "10511727", "11077516", "154865206", "205928164", "308727", "206512315"], "inbound_citations": ["54987059", "26950684", "67800246"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:87234325"}

Therefore, several computational methods have been proposed to predict complexes from the topology and structure of experimental protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. These methods work well to predict complexes involving at least three proteins, but generally fail at identifying complexes involving only two different proteins, called heterodimeric complexes or heterodimers. There is however an urgent need for efficient methods to predict heterodimers, since the majority of known protein complexes are precisely heterodimers. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In this paper, we use three promising kernel functions, Min kernel and two pairwise kernels, which are Metric Learning Pairwise Kernel (MLPK) and Tensor Product Pairwise Kernel (TPPK). We also consider the normalization forms of Min kernel. Then, we combine Min kernel or its normalization form and one of the pairwise kernels by plugging. We applied kernels based on PPI, domain, phylogenetic profile, and subcellular localization properties to predicting heterodimers. Then, we evaluate our method by employing C-Support Vector Classification (C-SVC), carrying out 10-fold cross-validation, and calculating the average F-measures. The results suggest that the combination of normalized-Min-kernel and MLPK leads to the best F-measure and improved the performance of our previous work, which had been the best existing method so far. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: We propose new methods to predict heterodimers, using a machine learning-based approach. We train a support vector machine (SVM) to discriminate interacting vs non-interacting protein pairs, based on informations extracted from PPI, domain, phylogenetic profiles and subcellular localization.

Such methods are also important to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying disease etiology and development, as well as treatment responses. Recently, different predictive models, relying on distinct algorithms (including Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) have been investigated. In this context, deep learning strategies are of special interest due to their demonstrated superior performance over a wide range of problems and datasets. One of the main challenges of such strategies is the \u201csmall n large p\u201d problem. Indeed, omics datasets typically consist of small numbers of samples and large numbers of features relative to typical deep learning datasets. Neural networks usually tackle this problem through feature selection or by including additional constraints during the learning process. We propose to tackle this problem with a novel strategy that relies on a graph-based method for feature extraction, coupled with a deep neural network for clinical outcome prediction. The omics data are first represented as graphs whose nodes represent patients, and edges represent correlations between the patients\u2019 omics profiles. Topological features, such as centralities, are then extracted from these graphs for every node. Lastly, these features are used as input to train and test various classifiers.

This paper discusses the importance of SVM for prediction of longitudinal pressure-wave velocity and its advantages over other conventional methods of computing. Pressure-wave measurement, an indicator of peak particle velocity (PPV) during blasting in a mine is an important parameter to be determined to minimize the damage caused by ground vibrations. A number of previous researchers have tried to use different empirical methods to predict pressure-wave. But these empirical methods are less versatile in their applications. The fracture propagation is not only influenced by the physico-mechanical parameters of rock, but they are also affected by the dynamic wave velocity of rock (e.g. compressional wave velocity). Wave velocity measurements have wide applications in the different fields of geophysics. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is designed to predict the pressure wave velocity of different rocks. To avoid the blindness in man-made choices of parameters of SVM, we use the chaos optimization algorithm to find the optimal parameters which can help the model to enhance the learning efficiency and capability of prediction. The fracture roughness coefficient and physico-mechanical properties are taken as input parameters and pressure wave velocity as output parameters. The mean absolute percentage error for the pressure wave velocity (PrV) predicted value has been found to be the least (0.258%) as compared to values obtained by Multivariate Regression Analysis (MVRA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and generalization capability of the SVM model is found to be very useful for such type of geophysical problems.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.12691/jgg-2-3-9", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2135775110", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["15329250", "130638962", "3736491", "3757436"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55587638"}

In this paper, the task of extracting interesting collocations is achieved through a supervised learning algorithm, exploiting a few collocations manually labelled as interesting/not interesting. From these examples, the ROGER algorithm learns a numerical function, inducing some ranking on the collocations. This ranking is optimized using genetic algorithms, maximizing the trade-off between the false positive and true positive rates (Area Under the ROC curve). This approach uses a particular representation for the word collocations, namely the vector of values corresponding to the standard statistical interestingness measures attached to this collocation.

Motivated by this observation, we propose a new subspace learning method, namely, discriminant manifold learning via sparse coding (DML_SC) for robust feature extraction. Specifically, we first decompose each input image into several components via dictionary learning, and then regroup the components into a more important part (MIP) and a less important part (LIP). The MIP can be considered as the clean portion of the image residing on a low-dimensional submanifold, while the LIP as noise or trivial structure within the image. Finally, the MIP and LIP are incorporated into manifold learning to learn a desired discriminative subspace. The proposed method is general for both cases with and without class labels, hence generating supervised DML_SC (SDML_SC) and unsupervised DML_SC (UDML_SC).

In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we have employed a publicly available phishing web page dataset in literature including screenshots of both 14 different highly phished brands and legitimate web pages posing an open-set problem for researchers. Besides, the aforementioned dataset covers 1313 training and 1539 testing cases in total. The visual signatures extracted by use of GIST and LBP descriptors were then fed to various machine learning models such as SVM, Random Forest and XGBoost (regularized gradient tree boosting). According to the results of comprehensively conducted experiments, XGBoost has been found as the best learner. In line with this finding, we obtained 87.7% (GIST) and 83.1% (LBP) validation accuracy along with the representation of \u201cmulti-level patches\u201d. Consequently, it has been shown that preferred global image descriptors can be successfully employed for detecting and recognizing phishing web pages. In addition, average required time for processing one screenshot (around 1.12 sec.) with GIST descriptors indicates that the proposed scheme and GIST can be effectively used as a browser based plug-in for recognizing brands of phishing web pages.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.31590/ejosat.638397", "venue": "European Journal of Science and Technology", "journal": "European Journal of Science and Technology", "mag_id": "2981707243", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208098520"}

This paper proposes to investigate the effective use of the DSmT for multi-class classification in conjunction with the Support Vector Machines using the One-Against-All (OAA) implementation, which allows offering two advantages: firstly, it allows modeling the partial ignorance by including the complementary classes in the set of focal elements during the combination process and, secondly, it allows reducing drastically the number of focal elements using a supervised model by introducing exclusive constraints when classes are naturally and mutually exclusive. To illustrate the effective use of the DSmT for multi-class classification, two SVM-OAA implementations are combined according three steps: transformation of the SVM classifier outputs into posterior probabilities using a sigmoid technique of Platt, estimation of masses directly through the proposed model and combination of masses through the Proportional Conflict Redistribution (PCR6).

Multiple indexing, which implements many-to-one mapping, can be easily realized by training a network for each key attribute. The neural network approach can be used to train a very large number of pattern associations by dividing a problem into smaller problems. This neural network consists of several subnetworks, each solving a specific mapping task.

Securing these applications against attacks targeting unknown vulnerabilities is an unsolved challenge. Network anomaly detection addresses such zero-day attacks by modeling attributes of attack-free application traffic and raising alerts when new traffic deviates from this model. Content anomaly detection (CAD) is a variant of this approach that models the payloads of such traffic instead of higher level attributes. Zero-day attacks then appear as outliers to properly trained CAD sensors. In the past, CAD was unsuited to cloud environments due to the relative overhead of content inspection and the dynamic routing of content paths to geographically diverse sites. We challenge this notion and introduce new methods for efficiently aggregating content models to enable scalable CAD in dynamically-pathed environments such as the cloud. These methods eliminate the need to exchange raw content, drastically reduce network and CPU overhead, and offer varying levels of content privacy. We perform a comparative analysis of our methods using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Bloom Filter-based classifiers for operation in the cloud or other distributed settings such as wireless sensor networks. We find that content model aggregation offers statistically significant improvements over non-aggregate models with minimal overhead, and that distributed and non-distributed CAD have statistically indistinguishable performance. Thus, these methods enable the practical deployment of accurate CAD sensors in a distributed attack detection infrastructure.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2666652.2666660", "venue": "AISec '14", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2142262896", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6636236", "9483777", "19232355", "6100120", "7931252", "131024", "1578541", "89141", "7553535", "14752788", "20113488", "6416971", "14750257", "10156891", "8497998", "9073519", "10797254", "53925051", "5974584", "9319993", "2190534"], "inbound_citations": ["10173791", "16132778", "57377893", "14341962", "3707458", "16455451"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1148507"}

Solutions to this problem have been either to have additional filtering to select relevant edges or to design specialized edge detectors that highlight iris boundary edges and suppress irrelevant edge types. This description holds ever so more for eyelid boundaries, which are often very subtle. An edge detector that will trigger on an eyelid boundary will also likely trigger on almost any slight intensity gradient in an image. We seek to solve this problem by learning specialized edge detectors for each type of relevant boundary in an iris image.

In this paper, we do the contrary,i.e., we use the fruits achieved in the applications of SVM in feature selection to improve SVM itself. By reducing redundant and non-discriminative features, the computational time of SVM is greatly saved and thus the evaluation speeds up. We propose combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) into multi-class SVM. We found that SVM is invariant under PCA transform, which qualifies PCA to be a desirable dimension reduction method for SVM. On the other hand, RFE is a suitable feature selection method for binary SVM. However, RFE requires many iterations and each iteration needs to train SVM once. This makes RFE infeasible for multi-class SVM if without PCA dimension reduction,especially when the training set is large. Therefore, combining PCA with RFE is necessary.

Based on the variations of the system states under the normal and faulty conditions of different degrees, the faults can be detected efficiently by using the residual analysis method. Furthermore, a multi-layer SVM classifier is developed, and the diagnosis results show that this classifier is effective with high accuracy. As a result, the presented Model-Based Fault Detection and Diagnosis (MBFDD) method can help to maintain the health of the HVAC systems, reduce energy consumption and maintenance cost.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2006.12.012", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Refrigeration-revue Internationale Du Froid", "mag_id": "2050637698", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3159858", "16259310", "28024779", "5663393", "52099109", "52235486", "96427274", "7740296", "13208959", "197409357", "31183442", "10749712", "9804800", "63786474", "88478518", "204823628", "6408620", "56169105", "17303607", "15468532", "18416797", "204701040", "28422355", "15007761", "57688180", "15343090", "40926328", "53530727", "16084534", "4763195", "8581291", "49539472", "29594514", "116247128", "3305875", "21217629", "59364578", "96436862", "195823842", "15690104", "9327306", "52150186", "25035862", "53617143", "15385958", "18168879", "111298829", "1932107", "201320263", "201914704", "1869976", "213470042", "52153371", "109192450", "209376485", "62841461", "116313361"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:121765861"}

In the separable case, there are an in nite number of hyperplanes in version space that will perfectly separate the data. Instead of choosing a solution based on maximizing the margin (as with the SVM), the BPM seeks an approximation to the Bayes Point, the point in version space that is closest in behavior to the Bayes integral over all hyperplanes. Herbrich approximates this point using a stochastic algorithm for an arbitrary kernel (the billiard algorithm) which bounces a ball around the version space in order to estimate the Bayes Point. Because many kernels imply in nite dimensional feature spaces, it is interesting to investigate how long such an algorithm must run before it will converge. In a series of experiments on separable data (i.e., separable in the feature space), we thus test the BPM algorithm with a polynomial kernel (low-dimesional) and a RBF kernel (in nite dimensional). We compare generalization results with the SVM, investigate convergence rates, and examine the di erence between the BPM and SVM solutions under several data conditions. We nd that the BPM does converge rapidly and tightly even for in nite dimensional kernel, and that it has signi cantly better generalization performance only when the number of support vectors is of medium value with respect to the number of training points (i.e., more often with low-dimensional kernels).

Inspired by recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GAN), we present a novel deep learning approach toward joint demosaicing and denoising (JDD) with perceptual optimization in order to ensure the visual quality of reconstructed images. The key contributions of this work include: 1) we have developed a GAN-based approach toward image demosacing in which a discriminator network with both perceptual and adversarial loss functions are used for quality assurance; 2) we propose to optimize the perceptual quality of reconstructed images by the proposed GAN in an end-to-end manner. Such end-to-end optimization of GAN is particularly effective for jointly exploiting the gain brought by each modular component (e.g., residue learning in the generative network and perceptual loss in the discriminator network).

This study presents an automated method to phenotype wheat varieties to Fusarium head blight (FHB) using hyperspectral sensors. In time-series experiments, the optical properties of spikes infected with F. graminearum or F. culmorum were recorded. Two hyperspectral cameras, in visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR, 400\u20131000 nm) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR, 1000\u20132500 nm) captured the most relevant bands for pigments, cell structure, water and further compounds. Correlations between disease severity (DS), spike weight, spectral bands and vegetation indices were investigated. Following, the detectability of infections was assessed by Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. A variety ranking based on AUDPC was performed and compared to a fully-automated approach using Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS). High correlation was found between the spectral signature and DS in 430\u2013525 nm, 560\u2013710 nm and 1115\u20132500 nm. All indices from the VIS-NIR showed high correlation with DS and, for the first time, this was also confirmed for three indices from the SWIR: NDNI, CAI and MSI. Using SVM, differentiation between healthy and infected spikes was possible (acc. > 0.76).

The correlation of the protein's iso-electric point and grand average hydropathy (GRAVY) with crystallizability was analyzed for full length and domain constructs of protein targets.

The mapping task is conducted with WorldView-2, IKONOS and airborne imagery in three different urban study areas in Spain and Greece. Object-based feature extraction and the Random Forests algorithm are applied to the classification problem of separating turf grass, swimming pools, other vegetation and non-vegetated areas. The classifier performance is evaluated against susceptibility to reduced training set size and high-dimensional features spaces, variations in the training set (stability of results), varying feature subspaces, and the inclusion of uncertain \u2013 hence potentially mislabelled \u2013 pixels in the model calibration stage. The results indicate that best discrimination can be obtained if complementing the standard spectral feature space by object features from multi-scale segmentation. Furthermore, it is confirmed that Random Forests can handle high-dimensional feature spaces with large amounts of potentially redundant or irrelevant features.

EnKF is an extension of the Kalman Filter (KF), a well-known tool in prediction updating. In the present research, ground measurements were used to build a SVM-type soil moisture predictor. Subsequent observations and their statistics were assimilated to update predictions from the SVM model by coupling it with EnKF. In this way, both model predictions and ground data, as well as their statistics, are fused thus minimizing the prediction error and making the predictions and observations statistically consistent. The results are shown for two approaches; one in which update is done at every time step and the other which assumes that data is only available at alternate time steps (in window of 10 time steps) and hence update is performed at those occasions.

Solar energy, as one of the great potential clean energies, has widely attracted the attention of researchers. In this paper, an optimized hybrid method by CS (Cuckoo Search) on the basis of the OP-ELM (Optimally Pruned Extreme Learning Machine), called CS-OP-ELM, is developed to forecast clear sky and real sky global horizontal radiation. First, MRSR (Multiresponse Sparse Regression) and LOO-CV (leave-one-out cross-validation) can be applied to rank neurons and prune the possibly meaningless neurons of the FFNN (Feed Forward Neural Network), respectively. Then, Direct strategy and Direct-Recursive strategy based on OP-ELM are introduced to build a hybrid model. Furthermore, CS (Cuckoo Search) optimized algorithm is employed to determine the proper weight coefficients. In order to verify the effectiveness of the developed method, hourly solar radiation data from six sites of the United States has been collected, and methods like ARMA (Autoregression moving average), BP (Back Propagation) neural network and OP-ELM can be compared with CS-OP-ELM.

This important yet difficult intelligent video analysis problem remains a vigorous area of research due to demands for performance improvements. Person re-identification involves two main steps: feature representation and metric learning. Handcrafted features, such as color and texture histograms, are frequently used for person re-identification, but most handcrafted features are limited by not being directly applicable to practical problems. Deep learning methods have obtained the state-of-the-art performance in a wide variety of applications, including image annotation, face recognition, and speech recognition. However, deep learning features are heavily dependent on large-scale labeling of samples. In this paper, by utilizing the Cross-view Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (XQDA) metric learning, we propose a novel scheme called deep multi-view feature learning (DMVFL), which exploits the collaboration between handcrafted and deep learning features in a simple but effective way.

The Support Vector Machine technique will be used to recognize the characters. Digital Dictionary will be used to capture the conflicts of the output. Error correction will be done by using a combined model of noisy channel model and natural language model.

The trend of development of CNN architectures is to increase their depth so as to increase their feature extraction ability. Kernel Support Vector Machines (SVM), on the other hand, are known to give optimal separating surfaces by their ability to automatically select support vectors and perform classification in higher dimensional spaces. We investigate the idea of combining the two such that best of both worlds can be achieved and a more compact model can perform as well as deeper CNNs. In the past, attempts have been made to use CNNs to extract features from images and then classify with a kernel SVM, but this process was performed in two separate steps. In this paper, we propose one single model where a CNN and a kernel SVM are integrated together and can be trained end-to-end.

However, such a correspondence scheme might be too strong for real applications where each cluster in one domain corresponds to many clusters in the other domain.

Specifically, word clusters and document clusters are exploited for each domain using nonnegative matrix factorization, then the word clusters from different domains are corresponded in a many-to-many scheme, with the help of shared word space as a bridge.

In addition, the proposed technique was examined with previous models, exhibiting an R 2 and an MSE of 0.999 and 0.000014, respectively. A significant drawback in the conventional LSSVM is the determination of optimal parameters to attain desired output with a reasonable accuracy.

The proposed algorithm included 4756 datasets to validate the effectiveness of the CSA-LSSVM model using statistical criteria.

A strategy for within-batch effect correction based on the use of quality control (QC) samples and Support Vector Regression (QC-SVRC) with a radial basis function kernel was recently proposed. QC-SVRC requires the optimization of three hyperparameters that determine the accuracy of the within-batch effects elimination: the tolerance threshold (\u03b5), the penalty term (C) and the kernel width (\u03b3).

Results show that QC-SVRC is robust to hyperparameter selection and that a pre-selection of C and \u03b5, followed by optimization of \u03b3 is competitive in terms of accuracy, precision and number of function evaluations with full grid analysis, random search and particle swarm optimization.

In this chapter, we further and significantly extend our previous line of work that has originated, across years, an innovative ensemble-learning framework for mining business process deviances, whose main benefit is that of introducing a sort of multi-view learning scheme. One of the most relevant achievements of this extended work consists in proposing an alternative meta-learning method for probabilistically combining the predictions of different base DDMs, and putting all together in a conceptual system architecture oriented to support common Business Process Management (BPM) scenarios. In addition to this, we here envisage the combination of this approach with a deviance explanation methodology that leverages and extends a previous method still proposed by us in previous research. Basically, the latter method allows to discover accurate and readable deviance-aware trace clusters defined in terms of descriptive rules over both properties and behavioral aspects of the traces.

Compared with other ensemble techniques, it has proved its accuracy and superiority. Many researchers, however, believe that there is still room for enhancing and improving its performance accuracy. This explains why, over the past decade, there have been many extensions of RF where each extension employed a variety of techniques and strategies to improve certain aspect(s) of RF. Since it has been proven empiricallthat ensembles tend to yield better results when there is a significant diversity among the constituent models, the objective of this paper is twofold. First, it investigates how data clustering (a well known diversity technique) can be applied to identify groups of similar decision trees in an RF in order to eliminate redundant trees by selecting a representative from each group (cluster). Second, these likely diverse representatives are then used to produce an extension of RF termed CLUB-DRF that is much smaller in size than RF, and yet performs at least as good as RF, and mostly exhibits higher performance in terms of accuracy.

The vegetation pattern of alkali landscapes shows a high correlation with the position of water table and salt accumulation, which are strongly correlated with topographic variations occurring at a small spatial scale of a few decimetres (micro-topography). In this study we classified eight grassland associations in an alkali landscape based on a DTM generated from ALS data at a pixel size of 0.25 m, and 30 variables derived from the DTM, using an ensemble learning method (Random Forest). Our aim was to identify the micro-topographic variables which could be indicators of vegetation pattern in alkali landscapes. The associations range from Cynodon pastures (short dry grasslands on soil with low salt content) occupying the highest elevations to Beckmannia meadows (wet grasslands on soils with moderate salt content composed of tall grass species) at the lowest elevations, with an elevation difference of approximately 1.2 m between the two. Apart from slope, aspect and curvature, we used Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), and Topographic Position Indices (TPI) at various kernel sizes ranging from 50 cm to 500 m for the classification. The eight associations were also grouped into four aggregated categories \u2014 loess grasslands, alkali steppes, open alkali swards and alkali meadows \u2014 for further analysis. Vegetation of the studied alkali landscape could be classified into the eight associations with an accuracy of \u03ba: 0.56, and into the four aggregated categories with an accuracy of \u03ba: 0.77 using all the variables. Sequential backward and forward selections of variables were implemented to reduce the number of variables while maximising the accuracies, resulting in increased accuracies of \u03ba: 0.72 and \u03ba: 0.83 for the associations and aggregated categories using six and three variables respectively. TPI at different kernel sizes, previously used to explain vegetation distribution in mountainous areas, was found to be a better indicator of vegetation types than absolute elevations in lowlands where the elevation differences are more subtle. Two characteristic features of the study area \u2014 erosional channels and alkali steps \u2014 could also be delineated using micro-topographic variables.

The critical problem of human activity unified learning (HAUL) was not well studied in previous work. One important challenge is the lack of a representation that can be learned from both levels. We introduce a novel approach to address this HAUL problem at the representation level, by simultaneously learning action labels and motion trajectories from publicly available 3D human skeletal datasets, thus avoiding additional human labor for data collection. Our approach builds a subject and body position independent shared skeleton, and extracts features of skeletal activities based on this model. Then the extracted features are encoded by the parameter set of Gaussian Mixture Models to construct the unified representations. The proposed compact representation can be directly applied to identify activity labels when combined with Support Vector Machines, and can be also employed to generate trajectories of the learned activities when combined with Gaussian Mixture Regression on a robot. Finally, an inverse kinematic mapping is developed to transfer human skeletal trajectories to joint angle sequences in the robot's embodiment. Empirical studies using simulation and real humanoid robots demonstrate that our approach achieves promising performance on robot unified learning of human action labels and motion trajectories, effectively addressing the HAUL problem.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ROMAN.2016.7745095", "venue": "2016 25th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)", "journal": "2016 25th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2554539212", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["28817124", "7175200", "14537727", "5679082", "16673680", "14036983", "2579075", "7689769", "9194043", "11964979", "16611886", "11310266", "8488306", "16432287", "3910540", "5726712", "5091727", "6938823", "123722079", "961425", "11810685", "124507519", "14500005", "18159549", "197469"], "inbound_citations": ["52196989", "204862638"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9228241"}

However, most existing transfer learning methods fail to capture the multi-view {nature}, and might not be best suited for such applications. To better leverage both the labeled data from the source domain and the features from different views, {this paper proposes} a general framework: Multi-View Transfer Learning with a Large Margin Approach (MVTL-LM). On one hand, labeled data from the source domain is effectively utilized to construct a large margin classifier; on the other hand, the data from both domains is employed to impose consistencies among multiple views. As an instantiation of this framework, we propose an efficient optimization method, which is guaranteed to converge to e precision in O(1/e) steps.

However, most traditional data-driven prognostics methods are off-line which would be seriously limited in many PHM systems needed on-line predicting or real-time processing. Furthermore, even in some on-line prediction algorithms such as Online Support Vector Regression (Online SVR) and Incremental learning algorithm, there are conflicts and trade-offs between prediction efficiency and accuracy. Therefore, in different PHM applications, prognostics algorithms should be on-line, flexible and adaptive to balance the prediction efficiency and accuracy. An on-line adaptive data-driven prognostics strategy is proposed with five various optimized on-line prediction algorithms based on Online SVR. These five algorithms are improved with kernel combination and sample reduction to realize higher precision and efficiency. These algorithms can achieve more accurate results by data pre-processing and model optimization, moreover, faster operating speed and lower computational complexity can be obtained by optimization of training process with on-line data reduction. With these different improved Online SVR methods, varies of prediction with different precision and efficiency demands could be fulfilled by an adaptive strategy. To evaluate the proposed prognostics strategy, we have executed simulation experiments with Tennessee Eastman (TE) process. In addition, the prediction strategies are also applied and evaluated by traffic mobile communication data from China Mobile Communications Corporation Heilongjiang Co., Ltd.

Despite all the progress, we cannot ignore the fact that the conditions provided by the society for the deaf are still far from being perfect. The communication with deaf by means of written text is not as efficient as it might seem at first. In fact, there is a very deep gap between sign language and spoken/written language. The vocabulary, the sentence construction and the grammatical rules are quite different among these two worlds. These facts bring significant difficulties in reading and understanding the meaning of text for deaf people and, on the other hand, make it quite difficult for people with no hearing disabilities to understand sign language. The deployment of tools to assist the daily communication, in schools, in public services, in museums and other, between deaf people and the rest may be a significant contribution to the social inclusion of the deaf community. The work described in this paper addresses the development of a bidirectional translator between Portuguese Sign Language and Portuguese text. The translator from sign language to text resorts to two devices, namely the Microsoft Kinect and 5DT Sensor Gloves in order to gather data about the motion and shape of the hands. The hands configurations are classified using Support Vector Machines. The classification of the movement and orientation of the hands are achieved through the use of Dynamic Time Warping algorithm. The translator exhibits a precision higher than 90%.

The extension to the discrete case makes use of the strong relation HPF-based planning has to connectionist artificial intelligence (AI). Connectionist AI systems are networks of simple, interconnected processors running in parallel within the confines of the environment in which the planning action is to be synthesized. It is not hard to see that such a paradigm naturally lends itself to planning on weighted graphs where the processors may be seen as the vertices of the graph and the relations among them as its edges. Electrical networks are an effective realization of connectionist AI. The utility of the discrete HPF (DHPF) approach is demonstrated in three ways. First, the capability of the DHPF approach to generate new, abstract, planning techniques is demonstrated by constructing a novel, efficient, optimal, discrete planning method called the M* algorithm. Also, its ability to augment the capabilities of existing planners is demonstrated by suggesting a generic solution to the lower bound problem faced by the A* algorithm. The DHPF approach is shown to be useful in solving specific planning problems in communication. It is demonstrated that the discrete HPF paradigm can support routing on-the-fly while the network is still in a transient state. It is shown by simulation that if a path to the target always exist and the switching delays in the routers are negligible, a packet will reach its destination despite the changes in the network which may simultaneously take place while the packet is being routed.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1608.05931", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/6006", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1554536626", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60750802", "15991657", "85474", "122051942", "109109886", "18498254", "60485880", "142440656", "121902258", "14586611", "143577821", "147387289", "18543529", "106905564", "122508976", "117874999", "16786964", "42451587", "144315300", "18774145", "62337936", "15524909", "9017255", "169549327", "60333792", "10710961", "109300412", "53772075", "121935664", "62106323", "5471851", "72865437"], "inbound_citations": ["53392721"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9733901"}

Normal and abnormal datasets, consisting of real and synthetic T1-weighted, T2-weighted and proton density/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, were used to evaluate the performance of the new method. Comparative analysis with ICA based SVM and other conventional classifiers established the stability and efficiency of SC-ICA based classification, especially in reproduction of small abnormalities. Clinical abnormal case analysis demonstrated it through the highest Tanimoto Index/accuracy values, 0.75/98.8%, observed against ICA based SVM results, 0.17/96.1%, for reproduced lesions.

Generally there is a list of an assortment of factual humanity applications which deals with unequal data sample division in to number of classes. Due to this division of data either of class goes into majority or minority with comparably less data count. This outnumbering of data sample in either of one class directs towards the handling of minority class and target on remarkable reduction in error rate. The standard learning methods do not directly focus on this type of classes. Random Forest Classification (RFC) is an ensemble approach that utilizes a number of classifiers to work together in order to identify the class label for unlabeled instances. This approach has proved its high accuracy and superiority with imbalanced datasets. This classifier provides various techniques to resolve class imbalance problem. This paper summarizes, the literature survey from 2000 to 2016 of various techniques related to RFC to resolve class imbalance. Specifically Weighted Random Forest (WRF), Balanced Random Forest (BRF), Sampling (Under Sampling (US)) and Down Sampling (DS), Cost Sensitive Methods have been adapted more to till date.

Materials and Methods 278 patients with pathologically confirmed lung cancer were collected, including 181 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 97 small cell lung cancers (SCLC) patients. Among the NSCLC patients, 88 patients were adenocarcinomas (AD) and 93 patients were squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). In total, 1695 quantitative radiomic features (QRF) were calculated from the primary lung cancer tumor in each patient. To build radiomic classification model based on the extracted QRFs, several machine-learning algorithms were applied sequentially. First, unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to exclude highly correlated QRFs; second, the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance feature selection algorithm was employed to select informative and nonredundant QRFs; finally, the Incremental Forward Search and Support Vector Machine classification algorithms were used to combine the selected QRFs and build the model. In our work, to study the phenotypic differences among lung cancer histological subtypes, four classification models were built. They were models of SCLC vs NSCLC, SCLC vs AD, SCLC vs SCC, and AD vs SCC. The performance of the classification models was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) estimated by three-fold cross-validation. Results The AUC (95% confidence interval) for the model of SCLC vs NSCLC was 0.741(0.678, 0.795). For the models of SCLC vs AD and SCLC vs SCC, the AUCs were 0.822(0.755, 0.875) and 0.665(0.583, 0.738), respectively. The AUC for the model of AD vs SCC was 0.655(0.570, 0.731).

To address this problem, this paper presents a method for the quantitative estimation of building density using a support vector regression model to establish the relationship between building density and the features extracted from the image, including spectral, morphological, and textural features. The importance and relevance of the different features is investigated by a feature selection method named recursive feature elimination. Tests performed on three representative megacities in China confirm that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results for building density estimation in terms of the low root-mean-square errors (\u223c0.05) and visual effect. It is also found that the combination of feature sets outperforms the single feature set, indicating the need for simultaneous consideration of all the categories of features. The knowledge of the most informative features provides an insight into selecting the most effective parameters for building density mapping. The investigation of the transferability between geographical regions confirms that the self-training achieves the better performance compared to the transfer training. The results with regard to the regression accuracy, feature selection, and the comparison with other methods indicate the effectiveness of the multifeature approach when applied to building density estimation.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2669217", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2592365852", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["129723286", "46380904", "128620214", "36259814", "1366807", "9922084", "129663415", "35884125", "23158151", "15077098", "195714471", "128585803", "11098988", "13242248", "11784324", "29424906", "6629776", "206435750", "130936610", "133358670", "97335081", "18728097", "42700915", "13284902", "44050331", "22398460", "4637792", "207720429", "17204697", "7096208", "28637672", "961425", "16042923", "1313036", "16588111", "131101516", "8312711", "16162039", "39401042", "740063", "84456635", "19810846", "119547455", "12364522"], "inbound_citations": ["52301453", "198430332", "34781397", "50780417", "209481425", "52113883"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44014585"}

Here, we present a simple algorithm to extract mRNA signatures from cancer datasets, where a particular gene has been deleted at the genomic level, ICAro. The process is implemented as a two-step workflow. The first one employs several filters in order to select the two patient subsets: the inactivated one, where the target gene is deleted, and the control one, where large genomic rearrangements should be absent. The second step performs a signature extraction via a Differential Expression analysis and a complementary Random Forest approach to provide an additional gene ranking in terms of information loss. We benchmarked the system robustness on a panel of genes frequently deleted in cancers, where we validated the downregulation of target genes and found a correlation with signatures extracted with the L1000 tool, outperforming random sampling for two out of six L1000 classes. Furthermore, we present a use case correlation with a published transcriptomic experiment. In conclusion, deciphering the complex interactions of the tumor environment is a challenge that requires the integration of several experimental techniques in order to create reproducible results.

To address the issues, we propose a novel self-adversarial learning (SAL) paradigm for improving GANs' performance in text generation. In contrast to standard GANs that use a binary classifier as its discriminator to predict whether a sample is real or generated, SAL employs a comparative discriminator which is a pairwise classifier for comparing the text quality between a pair of samples. During training, SAL rewards the generator when its currently generated sentence is found to be better than its previously generated samples. This self-improvement reward mechanism allows the model to receive credits more easily and avoid collapsing towards the limited number of real samples, which not only helps alleviate the reward sparsity issue but also reduces the risk of mode collapse.

AL10 9AB England Dopamine as a Prediction Error (PE) Signal in Reinforcement Learning Dopamine is a neurotransmitter and disruption to this system has long been associated with the neuropsychiatric disorder, schizophrenia. Current theories of the effects of dopamine on behaviour focus on the role of dopamine in Reinforcement Learning, where organisms learn to organise their behaviour under the influence of goals, and expected future reward is believed to drive action selection. Reward Prediction Hypothesis Schultz and colleagues have demonstrated that dopamine neurons in the midbrain regions are particularly sensitive to rewarding events, and single cell recordings have identified a phasic dopamine burst of activity which is posited to be a reward prediction error (Schultz 2000). Incentive Salience to Reward Prediction via Temporal Difference Learning, while Smith et al. model the role of dopamine in the generation of expected reward, independently of the acquisition process, linking Incentive Salience to Reward Prediction via the Gating Hypothesis. It has been suggested that dopamine generates both learning and gating effects and that both have similar parameters, namely the phasic dopamine signal (Montague, Hyman & Cohen 2004) We will report on our current research into how the various theories map on to each other and how they relate to the seminal connectionist models of Servan-Schreiber, Printz & Cohen (1990) and Cohen and Servan-Schreiber (1992). We will also describe our connectionist implementation of the McClure et al. model, where the role of dopamine will be more biologically plausible than that of a symbolic model. References Gating Hypothesis It is suggested that phasic dopamine signals control the gating of new information to the prefrontal cortex, but at the same time dopamine mediates learning by improving the signal to noise ratio of inputs to receiving units (Cohen, Braver & Brown 2002) Incentive Salience Hypothesis Others believe that dopamine release assigns incentive value to objects or acts, transforming \u2018like\u2019 into \u2018want,\u2019 enabling reward-seeking behaviours (Berridge & Robinson 1998). However, this does not address the problem of how to choose actions. Temporal Difference Learning A computational theory has been proposed by Sutton (1988) of how actions are chosen, explaining that the dopamine phasic signal is used in two ways: (i) As a prediction error or learning signal used to create better estimates of future reward. (ii) Dopamine release also biases action selection towards situations that predict the best reward. The Model The symbolic models of McClure, Daw & Montague (2003) and Smith, Li, Becker & Kapur (2004) have gone some way to unite the psychological and computational theories mentioned above.

Image classification and retrieval are therefore becoming more and more challenging. Discriminant image descriptors and robust classifiers are needed to handle these tasks. Nowadays approaches generally rely on describing images as a set of elementary and independent image patches called visual words, then using a classical classifier such as Support Vector Machines. In this paper, we propose a more precise description of images, called visual sentences, that includes simple spatial information between visual words. We then propose a classification technique based on language modeling. This classifier can exploit the spatial information of the visual sentences.

Model calibration was performed using data between 1985 and 1999 whereas the data between 1999 and 2014 was used for model validation. First of all, Transition Index Maps (TIMs) were computed by means of each model to assess the potential of urban growth for each cell. Using the standard deviation, consensus between the TIMs was evaluated. Because the TIMs of the individual models manifested discrepancies, they were combined using a number of ensemble forecasting approaches including median, mathematical average, principle component analysis, and weighted area under the total operating characteristic. The individual and combined TIMs were then put into Cellular Automata (CA) to simulate the future pattern of urban growth in Tehran. The results were evaluated in two stages. At first, the TIMs were evaluated by means of Total Operating Characteristics (TOC), and then a set of statistical indices was used to evaluate the spatial accuracy of the simulated urban growth maps. The best result was obtained by median ensemble forecasting, whereas the LR model showed the lowest level of accuracy.

Accurate pre-operative prognosis for this cohort can lead to better treatment planning. Conventional survival prediction based on clinical information is subjective and could be inaccurate. Recent radiomics studies have shown better prognosis by using carefully-engineered image features from magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, feature engineering is usually time consuming, laborious and subjective. Most importantly, the engineered features cannot effectively encode other predictive but implicit information provided by multi-modal neuroimages. We propose a two-stage learning-based method to predict the overall survival (OS) time of high-grade gliomas patient. At the first stage, we adopt deep learning, a recently dominant technique of artificial intelligence, to automatically extract implicit and high-level features from multi-modal, multi-channel preoperative MRI such that the features are competent of predicting survival time. Specifically, we utilize not only contrast-enhanced T1 MRI, but also diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), for computing multiple metric maps (including various diffusivity metric maps derived from DTI, and also the frequency-specific brain fluctuation amplitude maps and local functional connectivity anisotropy-related metric maps derived from rs-fMRI) from 68 high-grade glioma patients with different survival time. We propose a multi-channel architecture of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for deep learning upon those metric maps, from which high-level predictive features are extracted for each individual patch of these maps. At the second stage, those deeply learned features along with the pivotal limited demographic and tumor-related features (such as age, tumor size and histological type) are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to generate the final prediction result (i.e., long or short overall survival time). The experimental results demonstrate that this multi-model, multi-channel deep survival prediction framework achieves an accuracy of 90.66%, outperforming all the competing methods.

The term hyperrealism is introduced in this field, which we regard as a novel subform of surgical augmented reality for approaches that involve real-time object transfigurations. For related tasks in the computer vision community, unpaired cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown excellent results on still RGB images.

Synthesized videos show highly realistic results with regard to 1) replacement of the silicone appearance of the phantom valve by intraoperative tissue texture, while 2) explicitly keeping crucial features in the scene, such as instruments, sutures and prostheses.

Rapid plasticity of spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) in the primary (A1) cortical neurons is observed during behavioral tasks that require discrimination of particular sounds. This rapid task-related change is believed to be one of the processing strategies utilized by the auditory cortex to selectively attend to one stream of sound in the presence of mixed sounds. However, the mechanism by which the brain evokes this rapid plasticity in the auditory cortex remains unclear. This paper uses a neural network model to investigate mechanisms by which cortical neurons can change their receptive fields. A sound signal was used as input to a model of the cochlea and auditory periphery, which activated or inhibited integrate-and-fire neuron models to represent networks in the primary auditory cortex. Each neuron in the network was tuned to a different frequency. All neurons were interconnected with excitatory or inhibitory synapses of varying strengths. Action potentials in one of the model neurons were used to calculate the receptive field using reverse correlation, which were directly compared to previously recorded electrophysiological data from ferrets performing behavioral tasks that require discrimination of particular sounds. This neural network model could reproduce complex STRFs observed experimentally through optimizing the synaptic drives in the model. The model predicts that altering synaptic drive between cortical neurons can account for rapid task-related changes observed experimentally by A1 neurons.

This study presents a new AGB estimation method and demonstrates the potential of medium-resolution Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data application as an alternative to hyperspectral data in inaccessible regions. Sentinel-2 performance was evaluated for a buffer zone community forest in Parsa National Park, Nepal, using field-based AGB as a dependent variable, as well as spectral band values and spectral-derived vegetation indices as independent variables in the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate model effectiveness. The effect of the input variable number on AGB prediction was also investigated. The model using all extracted spectral information plus all derived spectral vegetation indices provided better AGB estimates (R2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 25.57 t ha\u22121). Incorporating the optimal subset of key variables did not improve model variance but reduced the error slightly. This result is explained by the technically-advanced nature of Sentinel-2, which includes fine spatial resolution (10, 20 m) and strategically-positioned bands (red-edge), conducted in flat topography with an advanced machine learning algorithm.

Features extracted from feature extraction methods could contain a large number of feature set. In original feature set, some of them can prove to be irrelevant, redundant and even unfavorable to classification accuracy. So it is essential to remove these type of features, which in turn leads to dimensionality reduction and could eventually improve the classification accuracy. The objective of feature selection is carried out in three steps. Firstly, improving the prediction performance of the predictors, secondly for providing faster and more cost-effective predictors, and finally providing a better understanding of the underlying process that generated the data. Considering river ice images, analyzing the different types of ice features and their characteristics is complex in nature. Hence, in this work feature extraction is carried out by computing Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features for 0 0 , 45 0 , 90 0 and 135 0 and feature subset selection is performed with Differential Evolution Feature Selection (DEFS) algorithm. DEFS, utilizes the DE float number optimizer in a combinatorial optimization problem like feature selection. DEFS feature selection method highly reduces the computational cost while at the same time proves to present a powerful performance and provides 93% accuracy with the features selected. Proposed method, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) combined with DEFS (ELM_DEFS) technique selects best feature subset from the original feature set.

Next to commonly employed visualization methods, clustering techniques have been recently considered for the aggregation of SOM nodes into groups in order to facilitate category specific data exploration. In this paper, spectral clustering based on graph theoretic concepts is employed for SOM based data categorization. The results are compared with those from the Neural Gas algorithm and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Using SOMs trained on an eigenspace representation of the Columbia Object Image Library 20 (COIL20), the correspondence of the cluster data to a semantic reference grouping is calculated.

Further we evaluate the algorithm on many other benchmark labeling problems such as stereo, image segmentation, image stitching and image denoising.

As the first self-developed C-band multi-polarized SAR image, the acquisition of massive data and operational operation of Chinese SAR remote sensing has entered the era of big data. Under the era of remote sensing large data, however, SAR image interpretation is a great challenge for scientific applications. At present, big data-based intelligent methods such as computer vision technology have achieved great success. Deep learning such as deep highway unit networks has revolutionized the computer vision area. However, due to the characteristics of SAR microwave band imaging and phase coherence processing, SAR images are very different from ordinary optical images in terms of band, projection direction, data composition and so on. Therefore, deep learning can not be directly used for quad-pol SAR image classification. In this paper, deep learning is applied to land cover type classification with GF-3 quad-pol SAR imagery. A deep highway unit network is employed to automatically extract a hierarchic feature representation from the data, based on which the land cover type classification can be conducted. Our classification model is trained on limited training data from forest resource inventory and planning data, and tested on a Radarsat-2 quad-pol images, which is the image of the same area acquired at different times.

In this paper, we further extend it to supervised learning incrementally. The key idea here is to incorporate label information into the coding process by reformulating that each center in DDRS has multiple output units indicating which class the center belongs to. The supervised learning method seems somewhat similar with random forests (\\cite{breiman2001random}), here we emphasize their differences as follows. (i) Each layer of our method considers the relationship between part of the data points in training data with all training data points, while random forests focus on building each decision tree on only part of training data points independently. (ii) Our method builds gradually-narrowed network by sampling less and less data points, while random forests builds gradually-narrowed network by merging subclasses. (iii) Our method is trained more straightforward from bottom layer to top layer, while random forests build each tree from top layer to bottom layer by splitting. (iv) Our method encodes output targets implicitly in sparse codes, while random forests encode output targets by remembering the class attributes of the activated nodes. Therefore, our method is a simpler, more straightforward, and maybe a better alternative choice, though both methods use two very basic elements---randomization and nearest neighbor optimization---as the core.

However, the high computation cost of existing trajectory similarity measures has become the key bottleneck for trajectory analysis at scale. While there have been many research efforts for reducing the complexity, they are specific to one similarity measure and often yield limited speedups. We propose NeuTraj to accelerate trajectory similarity computation. NeuTraj is generic to accommodate any existing trajectory measure and fast to compute the similarity of a given trajectory pair in linear time. Furthermore, NeuTraj is elastic to collaborate with all spatial-based trajectory indexing methods to reduce the search space. NeuTraj samples a number of seed trajectories from the given database, and then uses their pair-wise similarities as guidance to approximate the similarity function with a neural metric learning framework. NeuTraj features two novel modules to achieve accurate approximation of the similarity function: (1) a spatial attention memory module that augments existing recurrent neural networks for trajectory encoding; and (2) a distance-weighted ranking loss that effectively transcribes information from the seed-based guidance. With these two modules, NeuTraj can yield high accuracies and fast convergence rates even if the training data is small. Our experiments on two real-life datasets show that NeuTraj achieves over 80% accuracy on Fre chet, Hausdorff, ERP and DTW measures, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines consistently and significantly.

However, this treatment is controversial for larger VS. One of its drawbacks is that VS can present a radiation-induced transient tumor enlargement (TTE). For larger VS, such a swelling may cause symptoms related to mass effect, necessitating microsurgery. Currently, it is not possible to predict this adverse effect. We evaluated the predictability of TTE by quantitatively analyzing the tumor appearance on MRI. The goal is to determine the optimal treatment strategy, i.e. radiosurgery or microsurgery, on an individual basis. MethodsFrom our database, patients with large VS (>4cc) and minimum follow-up of three years, were identified. The TTE classification was based on evaluation of MRI scans at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months, according to strict volumetric criteria. We evaluated the influence of MRI tumor texture characteristics on TTE. These texture characteristics were quantified by calculating features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM), computed on T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRIs. Correlation was determined between these characteristics and TTE using machine-learning methods. ResultsBetween 2002 and 2015, 795 VS patients received GKRS as primary treatment at our center. The strict criteria for TTE and non-TTE led to the inclusion of 67 patients, of which 26 exhibited TTE. By employing GLCM-based features, we developed a model to predict TTE. We obtained a prediction sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 79%, respectively, using Support Vector Machines. These results improved for larger tumor volumes, i.e. in 7cc or larger, the results obtained were 85% and 87%, respectively. ConclusionResults from this research clearly show that MRI differences in VS tumor texture can be exploited to predict TTE in large VS.

It consists of three major components as outlined below. First, a machine learning based segmentation using Support Vector Machine (SVM) is introduced to segment the 3D MRM images of five C57BL/6J mouse brains into 21 neuroanatomical structures. To apply SVM on segmenting mouse brain images, a multiclass imbalance problem needs to be handled. To address these issues, a mix-ratio sampling approach for SVM is proposed to determine various over-sampling ratios for different minority classes. Based on a comparison study, mix-ratio sampling method relieves the imbalance problem in multiclass more effectively and efficiently than the simple over-sampling method. ::: Secondly, a novel automated segmentation method, extended Markov Random Field (eMRF), is proposed for the mouse brain images. eMRF employs the posterior probability distribution obtained from SVM, which in general has a stronger discriminative power, to generate a classification based on the MR intensity information, uses a location prior for modeling location information and MRF for contextual information. To maximize the classification performance, eMRF uses the contribution weights optimally determined for each of the three kinds of information. Based on a comparison experiment, eMRF outperforms the three different existing methods: mix-ratio sampling SVM, the atlas based segmentation method and MRF. ::: Finally, another automated segmentation method, prior feature SVM-MRF (pSVMRF), is introduced to segment the mouse brain. The earlier work, extended MRF successfully showed that integration of SVM and MRF improves the segmentation performance compared with the existing methods. However, the computation of eMRF is very intensive, partly due to the computing demands of SVM training and testing. In this research, prior feature SVM (pSVM) is used to reduce the training and testing time of SVM and boost the classification performance. While the MR intensity information modeled by SVM and the location prior modeling the location information are linearly combined in eMRF, pSVM combines the two important pieces of information in a nonlinear fashion and, hence, enhances the discriminative ability of the algorithm. pSVMRF reduces the testing time substantially while improving the segmentation performance.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2275185217", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61241985"}

While many clustering algorithms constrain objects to single clusters, K-means overlapping partitioning clustering based methods assign objects to multiple clusters by relaxing the constraints and allowing objects to belong to more than one cluster to better fit hidden structures in the data. However, when datasets contain outliers, they can significantly influence the mean distance of the data objects to their respective clusters, which is a drawback. Therefore, most researchers address this problem by simply removing the outliers. This can be problematic especially in applications such as autism screening, fraud detection, and cybersecurity attacks among others. ::: ::: ::: In this thesis, an alternative solution to this problem is proposed that captures outliers and stores them on the fly within a new cluster, instead of discarding. The new algorithm is named Outlier-based Multi-Cluster Overlapping K-Means Extension (OMCOKE). The algorithm addresses an issue previously ignored by other work in overlapping clustering and therefore benefits various stakeholders as these outliers could have real-life applications. The proposed solution has been evaluated on a crucial behavioural science problem called screening of autistic traits to improve the performance of detecting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) traits and reduce features redundancy. OMCOKE was integrated as a learning algorithm with a semi-supervised ML framework approach called Clustering based Autistic Trait Classification (CATC) in Chapter 5. Based on the experimental results obtained on real datasets related to autism screening OMCOKE was able to identify potential autism cases based on their similarity traits as opposed to conventional scoring functions used by ASD screening tools. Moreover, the empirical results obtained by OMCOKE on different datasets involving children, adolescents, and adults were compared to other results produced by common ML techniques. The results showed that our semi-supervised framework offers models with higher predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates than those of other intelligent classification approaches such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest, and Random Trees, and Rule Induction. These models are useful since they are exploited by diagnosticians and other stakeholders involved in ASD screening besides highlighting the most influential features.

The main goal is to encode temporal data into a global and low-dimensional latent vector that captures the dynamics of the spatio-temporal signal. To this end, we incorporate auto-regressive RNNs, Wasserstein GAN loss, spectral norm weight constraints and a semi-supervised learning scheme into InfoGAN, a method for retrieval of meaningful latents in adversarial learning. To demonstrate the modeling capability of our method, we encode full-body skeletal human motion from a large dataset representing 60 classes of daily activities, recorded in a multi-Kinect setup.

By fast growth of the semantic web and also, the variety of its applications, ontology mapping (ontology alignment) has been transformed into a crucial issue in the realm of computer science. Several approaches are introduced for ontology alignment during these last years, but developing more accurate and efficient algorithms and finding new effective techniques and algorithms for this problem is an interesting research area since real-world applications with respect to their more complicated concepts need more efficient algorithms. In this paper, we illustrated a new ontology mapping method based on learning using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), and show how the ILP can be used to solve the ontology mapping problem. As a matter of fact, in this approach, an ontology which is described in OWL format is interpreted to first-order logic. Then, with the use of learning based on inductive logic, the existing hidden rules and relationships between concepts are discovered and presented. Since the inductive logic has high flexibility in solving problems such as discovering relationships between concepts and links, it also can be performed effectively in solving the ontology alignment problem.

A possible solution is resorting to self-management, as fostered by autonomic computing. However, the abstraction layer provided by cloud computing obfuscates several details of the provided services, which, in turn, hinders the effectiveness of autonomic managers. Data-driven approaches, particularly those relying on service clustering based on machine learning techniques, can assist the autonomic management and support decisions concerning, for example, the scheduling and deployment of services. One aspect that complicates this approach is that the information provided by the monitoring contains both continuous (e.g. CPU load) and categorical (e.g. VM instance type) data. Current approaches treat this problem in a heuristic fashion. This paper, instead, proposes an approach, which uses all kinds of data and learns in a data-driven fashion the similarities and resource usage patterns among the services. In particular, we use an unsupervised formulation of the Random Forest algorithm to calculate similarities and provide them as input to a clustering algorithm. For the sake of efficiency and meeting the dynamism requirement of autonomic clouds, our methodology consists of two steps: (i) off-line clustering and (ii) on-line prediction. Using datasets from real-world clouds, we demonstrate the superiority of our solution with respect to others and validate the accuracy of the on-line prediction.

However, due to a large number of measurement data, an efficient compression method is needed. Meanwhile, the requirements of real-time rendering should be met. Under this background, this paper mainly does some exploratory research on BRDF modeling methods based on the qualitative measurements of textures. By conducting BRDF modeling on the measurements derives with different acquisition devices, it obtains the illumination properties of textures. Finally, combined with the property information of textures on the surface of object, under a new light source, from a new viewpoint, it renders the relighting effect of the object under a new light source. Introduction Animations, TV and films, advertising, product CAD, fashion CAD and other fields all require a highly realistic 3D representation of objects. A highly realistic representation of objects depends on their geometric modeling and texture modeling. Geometric models describe the shape of objects, while texture modeling describes the reflection of objects under illuminations. Due to different surface geometries, materials, densities, colors and other properties, different objects with the same geometric model present complex and rich optical phenomena under different illuminations. Geometry reconstruction enables us to obtain the geometrical structure of objects, with active reconstruction methods, such as 3D structure light scanners, 3D laser scanners or passive reconstruction methods, such as reconstructing 3D models from multi-angle pictures. By contrast, it is very difficult to reconstruct the properties of textures on the surface of object. This is because measurements of the accurate surface reflection properties of the whole object need to be described with very high dimensional data. In the case of high dimensional data, data collection, modeling and real-time rendering will bring great difficulties. Therefore, how to realize texture modeling efficiently has been a hot issue of research and a focus of attention in academic and application fields. Although in recent years, research on surface texture modeling and rendering has made substantial progress, the modeling of complex surface textures, especially the modeling of the surface reflection properties of objects still face great challenges. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Improved K-nearest Neighbors Algorithm Support Vector Machine Algorithm Support vector machine algorithm (SVM) is an epitome of machine learning and research, which is applicable to the solution of small sample, high dimensional and other nonlinear decomposition problems. The goal of recognition is to find an optimalseparating hyperplane, separate all data points and try to make the distance betweenpoints and hyperplanes the farthest when all constraints are met, as shown in Figure 1. 4th International Conference on Machinery, Materials and Computing Technology (ICMMCT 2016) \u00a9 2016.

According to the principle of risk minimization, the optimal hyperplane of SVM is represented as: ( ) T y x b \uf077 \uf03d \uf046 \uf02b (1) Where \uf077 is the weight vector and b is the offset vector. It is difficult to solve a linearly inseparable problemdirectly using SVM.

Such methods are also important to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying disease etiology and development, as well as treatment responses. Recently, different predictive models, relying on distinct algorithms (including Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) have been investigated. In this context, deep learning strategies are of special interest due to their demonstrated superior performance over a wide range of problems and datasets. One of the main challenges of such strategies is the \u201csmall n large p\u201d problem. Indeed, omics datasets typically consist of small numbers of samples and large numbers of features relative to typical deep learning datasets. Neural networks usually tackle this problem through feature selection or by including additional constraints during the learning process. We propose to tackle this problem with a novel strategy that relies on a graph-based method for feature extraction, coupled with a deep neural network for clinical outcome prediction. The omics data are first represented as graphs whose nodes represent patients, and edges represent correlations between the patients\u2019 omics profiles. Topological features, such as centralities, are then extracted from these graphs for every node. Lastly, these features are used as input to train and test various classifiers. We apply this strategy to four neuroblastoma datasets and observe that models based on neural networks are more accurate than state of the art models (DNN: 85%-87%, SVM/RF: 75%-82%). We explore how different parameters and configurations are selected in order to overcome the effects of the small data problem as well as the curse of dimensionality.

Unfortunately, GANs do not offer an \"inverse model\", a mapping from data space back to latent space, making it difficult to infer a latent representation for a given data sample. In this paper, we introduce a technique, inversion, to project data samples, specifically images, to the latent space using a pre-trained GAN.

Data-driven technologies aim to abandon complex IES modeling, instead mining the mapping relationships between different parameters based on massive volumes of operating data. However, integrated energy system construction is still in the initial stage of development and operational data are difficult to obtain, or the operational scenarios contained in the data are not enough to support data-driven technologies.

We estimate the quality of the generated data, in both visual and quantitative aspects. Secondly, we propose a control strategy based on the Q-learning algorithm for a renewable energy and storage system with high uncertainty.

In brief, this problem is concerned with how each of these two paradigms interacts with the other and how each complements the other: how one may give a logical interpretation of neural networks, how one may interpret connectionism within a logical framework, and how one may combine the advantages of each within a single integrated system. In this paper, the computation and approximate computation by neural networks of semantic operators T P determined by logic programs P is studied; the converse of this problem, namely, the extraction of logic programs from given neural networks is also briefly considered. The foundations of the relevant notions employed in this problem are revisited and clarified and new definitions are presented which avoid embedding spaces of interpretations in the real line. In particular, such definitions are formulated relating to (1) pointwise and uniform approximation of T P , and (2) approximation and computation of (least) fixed points of T P . There are related notions of approximation and convergence of neural networks, and related notions of approximation and convergence of programs and these are discussed briefly, although the focus here is on (1) and (2). Necessary and sufficient conditions for uniform approximation of T P by neural networks are given in terms of continuity. Finally, the class of programs for which these methods can be employed to compute fixed points is greatly extended from the rather small class of acyclic programs to the (computationally adequate) class of all definite programs.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.entcs.2006.04.028", "venue": "Electron.

Positive definite kernel functions allow us to quantitatively capture similarity between a pair of instances over these arbitrary domains.

Every year IT companies recruit fresh graduates through their campus selection programs after examining their skills by conducting tests, group discussion and a number of interviews. The recruitment process requires enormous amount of effort and investment. During each phase of the recruitment process, candidates are filtered based on some performance criteria. Intense analysis on the system indicates that a pattern exists among the candidates selected for an industry. The problem domain is complex and the aspects of candidates that impact the recruitment process is not explicit. In this research, the domain knowledge is extracted through knowledge acquisition techniques. Data mining techniques that fit the problem are determined. A study has been made by applying K-means and fuzzy C-means clustering and decision tree classification algorithms to the recruitment data of an industry. Experiments were conducted with the data collected from an IT industry to support their hiring decisions. Pruned and unpruned trees were constructed using ID3, C4.5 and CART algorithms. From the comparative study, it has been observed that the clustering algorithms are not much suitable for the problem and performance of the C4.5 decision tree algorithm is high. Using the constructed decision trees, discussions were made with the domain experts to deduce viable decision rules. candidate among those who graduate becomes a herculean task. The process involves lot of effort by the recruiting team and money spent for the process is phenomenal. One of the mechanisms used by the industries is to conduct tests and group discussions during the filtration process. The selection process uses different criteria that comprise the average of their semester marks, marks obtained in the aptitude, programming and technical tests conducted by the company, group discussion, technical and HR interviews. These criteria are common for all the students, but the skill level of the students vary since they are from different disciplines and backgrounds. With a varying curriculum, mode of delivery and the evaluation methodologies followed in the educational system, the recruitment process becomes much more challenging. The time taken and expenditure for conducting group discussions and interviews consumes more than 90% of the total effort for the recruitment process. It has been observed that 1 among 120 students who apply get selected and the ratio of number of candidates selected against the number of candidates interviewed after tests is approximately 1:20. Reducing these ratios will immensely help the industries to save the effort. Lot of effort is put to analyze the profiles of the applicants to determine the ones that suit the needs of the industry.

Our objectives are to alleviate mode collapse in GAN and improve the quality of the generated samples. First, we propose neighbor embedding, a manifold learning-based regularization to explicitly retain local structures of latent samples in the generated samples. This prevents generator from producing nearly identical data samples from different latent samples, and reduces mode collapse. We propose an inverse t-SNE regularizer to achieve this. Second, we propose a new technique, gradient matching, to align the distributions of the generated samples and the real samples. As it is challenging to work with high-dimensional sample distributions, we propose to align these distributions through the scalar discriminator scores. We constrain the difference between the discriminator scores of the real samples and generated ones. We further constrain the difference between the gradients of these discriminator scores. We derive these constraints from Taylor approximations of the discriminator function. We perform experiments to demonstrate that our proposed techniques are computationally simple and easy to be incorporated in existing systems. When Gradient matching and Neighbour embedding are applied together, our GN-GAN achieves outstanding results on 1D/2D synthetic, CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets, e.g. FID score of 30.80 for the STL-10 dataset.

Such a system makes it possible to monitor the ongoing stream of messages on social media, offering actionable insights into public hesitance with respect to vaccination. At the moment, such monitoring is done by means of regular sentiment analysis with a poor performance on detecting negative stance towards vaccination. For Dutch Twitter messages that mention vaccination-related key terms, we annotated their stance and feeling in relation to vaccination (provided that they referred to this topic). Subsequently, we used these coded data to train and test different machine learning set-ups. With the aim to best identify messages with a negative stance towards vaccination, we compared set-ups at an increasing dataset size and decreasing reliability, at an increasing number of categories to distinguish, and with different classification algorithms. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We found that Support Vector Machines trained on a combination of strictly and laxly labeled data with a more fine-grained labeling yielded the best result, at an F1-score of 0.36 and an Area under the ROC curve of 0.66, considerably outperforming the currently used sentiment analysis that yielded an F1-score of 0.25 and an Area under the ROC curve of 0.57. We also show that the recall of our system could be optimized to 0.60 at little loss of precision. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The outcomes of our study indicate that stance prediction by a computerized system only is a challenging task. Nonetheless, the model showed sufficient recall on identifying negative tweets so as to reduce the manual effort of reviewing messages.

In order to predict the TDC thickness of coal beds, we propose a new quantitative predicting method using an extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm, a principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm, and seismic attributes. At first, we build an ELM prediction model using the PCA attributes of a synthetic seismic section. The results suggest that the ELM model can produce a reliable and accurate prediction of the TDC thickness for synthetic data, preferring Sigmoid activation function and 20 hidden nodes. Then, we analyze the applicability of the ELM model on the thickness prediction of the TDC with real application data. Through the cross validation of near-well traces, the results suggest that the ELM model can produce a reliable and accurate prediction of the TDC. After that, we use 250 near-well traces from 10 wells to build an ELM predicting model and use the model to forecast the TDC thickness of the No. 15 coal in the study area using the PCA attributes as the inputs. Comparing the predicted results, it is noted that the trained ELM model with two selected PCA attributes yields better predication results than those from the other combinations of the attributes. Finally, the trained ELM model with real seismic data have a different number of hidden nodes (10) than the trained ELM model with synthetic seismic data. In summary, it is feasible to use an ELM model to predict the TDC thickness using the calculated PCA attributes as the inputs. However, the input attributes, the activation function and the number of hidden nodes in the ELM model should be selected and tested carefully based on individual application. We use extreme learning machine to estimate tectonically deformed coal (TDC).The inputs are linearly uncorrelated PCs calculated from seismic attributes.The inputs, the activation function and the hidden nodes affect the estimate.Sigmoid function, in this case, is the best for the estimate of the TDC thickness.The signal-to-noise ratio of input data affects the estimate.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cageo.2017.02.001", "venue": "Comput.

Long-term unmanned automatic monitoring may provide unique unbiased data from a whole season, but the large amount of data presents serious challenges for the automatic processing of the measurements. To demonstrate feasibility of automatic multi-channel surveying using a new prototype hardware, we carried out a 2-month study of echolocating bats requiring high data sampling rates (500 kHz). Using a sound energy threshold criterion for triggering recording, we collected 236 GB (Gi = 1024 3 ) of data at full bandwidth. We implemented a simple automatic method using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on a combina- tion of temporal and spectral analyses to classify events into bat calls and non-bat events. After experimentation we selected duration, energy, bandwidth, and entropy as classification features to identify short high energy structured sounds in the right frequency range. The spectral entropy makes use of the orderly arrangement of frequencies in bat calls to reject short noise pulses, e.g. from rain. The SVM classifier reduced our dataset to 162 MB of candidate bat calls with an estimated accuracy of 96% for dry nights and 70% when it was raining. The automatic survey revealed calls from two species of bat not previously recorded in the area, as well as an unexpected abundance of social calls. The recordings provide data which can be used to correlate bat activity with rain, temperature, and sunset/sunrise.

In this paper, TG-2 WIS image was used to extract the cotton in Xinjiang area with field experimental validation. RF along with support vector machine (SVM) and maximum likelihood classification (MLC) were utilized and compared in the cotton classification study. Three types of features of principal component, texture feature and spectral index are extracted for the three classifiers. A total of 29 features are used as input bands for MLC, SVM and RF. The results showed that RF was superior to the other methods. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients of RF are 91.2% and 0.871, respectively. This paper proves that the RF classification method has a good effect in the vegetation extraction of TG-2 data and positive significance for expanding the application of TG-2 data.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-13-3501-3_25", "venue": "Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering", "journal": "Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering", "mag_id": "2903936297", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69498945"}

Model development was carried out using retrospective data from 476 individuals who wore one of the five orthosis designs bilaterally.

Among limbs with an orthosis, the model agreed with the prescription only 14% of the time. For 56% of limbs without an orthosis, the model agreed that no orthosis was expected to provide benefit. Using the current standard of care orthosis ( i.e. existing orthosis prescriptions), \u0394GDI is only +0.4 points on average. Using the orthosis prediction model, average \u0394GDI for orthosis users was estimated to improve to +5.6 points.

Two key criteria are explicitly considered for the magic closet system. One criterion is to wear properly, e.g., compared to suit pants, it is more decent to wear a cocktail dress for a banquet occasion. The other criterion is to wear aesthetically, e.g., a red T-shirt matches better white pants than green pants. To narrow the semantic gap between the low-level features of clothing and the high-level occasion categories, we adopt middle-level clothing attributes (e.g., clothing category, color, pattern) as a bridge. More specifically, the clothing attributes are treated as latent variables in our proposed latent Support Vector Machine (SVM) based recommendation model. The wearing properly criterion is described in the model through a feature-occasion potential and an attribute-occasion potential, while the wearing aesthetically criterion is expressed by an attribute-attribute potential. To learn a generalize-well model and comprehensively evaluate it, we collect a large clothing What-to-Wear (WoW) dataset, and thoroughly annotate the whole dataset with 7 multi-value clothing attributes and 10 occasion categories via Amazon Mechanic Turk.

As Allen and Bickhard suggest in their target article (this issue), empiricist and nativist perspectives have dominated the scientific landscape in pendulum-like alternation across the centuries. Most recently, from the 1970s into the present, theories and data consistent with nativism have assumed positions of prominence in the Developmental Psychology literature (Baillargeon, 1987; Meltzoff & Moore, 1977; Spelke & Kinzler, 2007; Wynn, 1992). However, for more than 50 years, several theorists have been arguing forcefully that nativism in all its variations is inherently non-developmental (Beach, 1955; Blumberg, 2005; Gottlieb, 1981; Johnston, 1987; Moore, 2001). Although there are nativists who disagree with this assessment (Carey, 2009; Spelke & Newport, 1998), the rise of nativism has been accompanied by a growing number of critics. Among these critics have been those arguing that systems theories such as Dynamic Systems Theory (Thelen & Smith, 1994), Connectionism (Elman et al., 1996), and Developmental Systems Theory (Oyama, Griffiths, & Gray, 2001; Spencer et al., 2009) can help us dispense with the nativist\u2013empiricist debate, and thereby facilitate the study of development. I, too, believe transcendence of the nativist\u2013empiricist debate is a worthy goal (Moore, 2001, 2009), so Allen, Bickhard, and I agree on this point. But even though achieving transcendence is likely to entail utilizing an approach similar in some ways to Allen and Bickhard\u2019s, certain aspects of their arguments could nonetheless hinder progress toward our goal. In their introduction, Allen and Bickhard define emergent-constructivism as \u201cthe assumption that representational knowledge can be emergent in the construction of action systems\u201d (Allen & Bickhard, this issue, p. 97).

Instead of a time window over incoming instances, or an aged based forgetting - as used by most ensemble based nonstationary learning algorithms - a strategic weighting mechanism is employed that tracks the classifiers' performances over drifting environments to determine appropriate voting weights. Specifically, the proposed approach generates a single classifier for each dataset that becomes available, and then combines them through a dynamically modified weighted majority voting, where the voting weights themselves are computed as weighted averages of classifiers' individual performances over all environments.

The statistical rigour and interpretability of ecological assessments is strongly affected by how well we predict the biological assemblages expected to occur in the absence of human-caused stress, i.e. the reference condition. In this study, we examined how the specific method used to predict the reference condition affected the performance of two commonly used types of ecological index: RIVPACS-based O/E indices and multimetric indices (MMIs). ::: ::: 2. These two types of index have generally relied on different approaches to predicting the reference condition. For MMIs, some type of regionalisation is typically used to describe the range of metric values among reference sites and hence the expected range at assessed sites. For O/E indices, continuous modelling is used to predict how the biota varies among sites both among and within regions. Because the prediction method differs for these two types of index, it has been impossible to judge if differences in index performance (accuracy, precision, responsiveness and sensitivity) are caused by differences in the way reference condition biota are predicted or by differences in what the indices measure. ::: ::: 3. We used a common data set of 94 reference sites and 255 managed sites and the same potential set of predictor variables to compare the performance of five different MMIs and three O/E indices that were derived from different prediction methods: null models, multiple linear regression (MLR), classification and regression trees, Random Forests (RF) and linear discriminant functions models (LDM). We then calculated values of these indices for samples collected from the managed catchments as well as samples collected from 13 reference sites that were progressively altered in known ways by a simulation programme. ::: ::: 4. Both the type of predictor used and the type of index affected overall index performance. Modelled indices generally had the greatest sensitivity in assessing managed sites as biologically different from reference. Index sensitivity was determined by both an aspect of index precision (10th percentile of reference condition values) and responsiveness. The O/E indices showed the best scope of response to known biological alteration. All three O/E indices decreased linearly in response to simulated alteration in both overall assemblage structure (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) and taxa loss. The MMIs declined linearly from low to intermediate levels of assemblage alteration but were less responsive between intermediate and high levels of biological alteration. ::: ::: 5. Insights gained from simulations can aid in testing assumptions regarding index response to stress and help ensure that we select indices that are ecologically interpretable and most useful to resource managers.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02357.x", "venue": null, "journal": "Freshwater Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2078269303", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["88623364", "85548284", "4792988", "53801431", "58921978", "86072461", "55908849", "84889615", "86086006", "59130233", "490024", "86324267", "212615458", "2211863", "25603852", "90254791", "16085166", "54447770", "18712472", "86205369", "195187903", "3359941", "8459437", "54717345", "3463551", "86330377", "58897741", "86294667", "167210327", "14730952", "85920515", "84599464", "55603943", "56166167", "201832073"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85270750"}

However, these approaches typically assume that all words in a document are generated from a single event. While this may be true for short text such as tweets, such an assumption does not generally hold for long text such as news articles. Moreover, Bayesian graphical models often rely on Gibbs sampling for parameter inference which may take long time to converge. To address these limitations, we propose an event extraction model based on Generative Adversarial Nets, called Adversarial-neural Event Model (AEM). AEM models an event with a Dirichlet prior and uses a generator network to capture the patterns underlying latent events. A discriminator is used to distinguish documents reconstructed from the latent events and the original documents.

The second aim is to evaluate the Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LU LC) from 2001 to 2013 in El-Gharbia governorate as a case study. Three temporal data sets of images from two different sensors: Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) with 30 m resolution acquired in 2001 and Landsat 8 acquired in 2013 with 30 m resolution, and Egypt sat acquired in 2010 with 7.8 m resolution, consequently were used. Four different supervised classification techniques (Maximum Likelihood (ML), Minimum Distance, Neural Networks (NN); and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied to monitor the changes of LULC in the investigated area. The results showed that the agricultural soils of the investigated area are characterized by high soil productivity depending on its chemical and physical properties.

The occurrences of knots in proteins play an important role in biological systems and processes. How the polypeptide chain is able to \"knot\" itself during the folding process to form these highly complicated protein topologies is not known and it is a new challenge to the research community. As of now, 278 known knotted proteins are identified in PDB. In the current investigation, features which characterize knot proteins are identified using computational methods. Using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), comparable spectral signatures were found for knot proteins and nonhub proteins (proteins which interact with less number of proteins) and its quantification led to the conclusion that knot proteins exhibit nonhub nature. Crosscorrelation of knot protein sequences with synthetic sequences revealed that a definite occurrence of hydrophobic domains exist in knot proteins. Using Chaos Game Representation (CGR) theory, we found that knot proteins exhibit special pattern in their CGR and these patterns were quantified by setting a ratio of CGR points clustering in the two opposite corners of their CGR (representing hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids). These characteristics can in turn be used as indicators for identifying knot proteins. The quantified parameters obtained from the above mentioned steps have been used as feature vectors to classify knot proteins and unknot proteins.

A model that accurately predicts, at the time of admission, the Length of Stay (LOS) for hospitalized patients could be an effective tool for healthcare providers. It could enable early interventions to prevent complications, enabling more efficient utilization of manpower and facilities in hospitals. In this study, we apply a regression tree (Cubist) model for predicting the LOS, based on static inputs, that is, values that are known at the time of admission and that do not change during patient's hospital stay. The model was trained and validated on de-identified administrative data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals in Pittsburgh, PA. We chose to use a Cubist model because it produced more accurate predictions than did alternative techniques. In addition, tree models enable us to examine the classification rules learned from the data, in order to better understand the factors that are most correlated with hospital LOS. Cubist recursively partitions the data set as it estimates linear regressions for each partition, and the error level differs for different partitions, so that it is possible to deduce what are the characteristics of patients whose LOS can be accurately predicted at admission, and what are the characteristics of patients for whom the LOS estimate at that point in time is more highly uncertain. For example, our model indicates that the prediction error is greater for patients who had more admissions in the recent past, and for those who had longer previous hospital stays. Our approach suggests that mapping the cases into a higher dimensional space, using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, helps to separate them by their level of Cubist error, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2017.02.023", "venue": "Expert Syst.

Such aspects include ecological, economic, livelihood, and security-based and well-being benefits. The development of techniques for mapping and monitoring ETS is thus critical for understanding functioning of ecosystems. The advent of advanced imaging systems and supervised learning algorithms has provided an opportunity to map ETS over fragmenting areas. Recently, vegetation maps have been produced using advanced imaging systems such as WorldView-2 (WV-2) and robust classification algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). However, delineation of ETS in a fragmenting ecosystem using high-resolution imagery has largely remained elusive due to the complexity of the species structure and their distribution. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the utility of the advanced WV-2 data for mapping ETS in the fragmenting Dukuduku indigenous forest of South Africa using SVM and ANN classification algorithms. Specifically, the study looked at testing the advent of the additional WV-2 bands in mapping six ETS. WV-2 image was spectrally resized to separate four standard bands (SB) and four additional bands (AB). WV-2 image (8 bands: 8B) together with the SB and AB subsets was classified using SVM and ANN methods. The results showed the robustness of the two machine learning algorithms with an overall accuracy (OA) of 77.00% for SVM and 75.00% for ANN using 8B. The SB produced OA of 65.00% for SVM and 64.00% for ANN. The AB produced almost the same OA of 70.00% for both SVM and ANN. There were significant differences between the performances of the two algorithms as demonstrated by the results of McNemar\u2019s test ( ${\\text Z}\\;\\text {score} \\geq {1}.{96}$ ). This study concludes that SVM and ANN classification algorithms with WV-2 8B have the potential to map ETS in the Dukuduku indigenous forest.

Two DR methods namely Attribute Overlap Minimization (AOM) and Outlier Elimination (OE) are applied for downsizing the features representation space, on the numbers of attributes and amount of instances respectively, prior to training a decision model for text classification. AOM works by swapping the membership of the overlapped attributes (which are also known as features or keywords) to a group that has a higher occurrence frequency. Dimensionality is lowered when only significant and unique attributes are describing unique groups. OE eliminates instances that describe infrequent attributes. These two DR techniques can function with conventional feature selection together to further enhance their effectiveness.

In the prediction phase, the label of a test document vector is assigned to that of its nearest class prototype. Recently there has been revived interest in reformulating the prototype/centroid to improve classification performance. In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of the recently proposed Class Feature Centroid (CFC) classifier by considering the rate of change of each prototype vector with respect to individual dimensions (terms). The implication of our theoretical finding is that CFC is inherently biased towards large (dominant majority) classes, which means it is destined to perform poorly for highly class-imbalanced data. Another practical concern about CFC lies in its overly-aggressive design in weeding out terms that appear in all classes. To overcome these CFC limitations while retaining its intrinsic and worthy design goals, we propose an improved and robust centroid-based classifier that uses precise term-class distribution properties instead of simple presence or absence of terms in classes. Specifically, terms are weighted based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure between pairs of class-conditional term probabilities, we call this the CFC-KL centroid classifier. We then generalized CFC-KL to handle multi-class data by summing pair wise class-conditioned word probability ratios. Our proposed approach has been evaluated on 5 datasets, on which it consistently outperforms CFC and the baseline Support Vector Machine classifier. We also devise a word cloud visualization approach to highlight the important class-specific words picked out by our CFC-KL, and visually compare it with other popular term weigthing approaches. Our encouraging results show that the centroid based generalized CFC-KL classifier is both robust and efficient to deal with real-world text classification.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2011.156", "venue": "2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Data Mining", "journal": "2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2162439834", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["117000403", "5246200", "6688577", "1206678", "6340813", "196020088", "207155218", "566311", "21634132", "32800624", "15054846", "15020047", "388", "613410", "3091"], "inbound_citations": ["15917001", "2341000", "16540675"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6903718"}

Previous research has attempted to produce viable detection solutions in order to filter SQL Injection Attacks from regular queries. Unfortunately it has proven to be a challenging problem with many solutions suffering from disadvantages such as being unable to process in real time as a preventative solution, a lack of adaptability to differing types of attack and the requirement for access to difficult-to-obtain information about the source application. This paper presents a novel solution of classifying SQL queries purely on the features of the initial query string. A Gap-Weighted String Subsequence Kernel algorithm is implemented to identify subsequences of shared characters between query strings for the output of a similarity metric. Finally a Support Vector Machine is trained on the similarity metrics between known query strings which are then used to classify unknown test queries. By gathering all feature data from the query strings, additional information from the source application is not required. The probabilistic nature of the learned models allows the solution to adapt to new threats whilst in operation. The proposed solution is evaluated using a number of test datasets derived from the Amnesia testbed datasets. The demonstration software achieved 97.07% accuracy for Select type queries and 92.48% accuracy for Insert type queries. This limited success rate is due to unsanitized quotation marks within legitimate inputs confusing the feature extraction.

Image data was captured at 3 m above ground, with a camera (multiSPEC 4C, AIRINOV, Paris) mounted on a pole kept manually. For each image, the field of view was approximately 4 m \u00d7 3 m and the resolution was 6 mm/pix. The row crop arrangement was first used to discriminate between some crop and weed pixels depending on their location inside or outside of crop rows. Then, these pixels were used to automatically build the training dataset concerning the multispectral features of crop and weed pixel classes. For each image, a specific training dataset was used by a supervised classifier (Support Vector Machine) to classify pixels that cannot be correctly discriminated using only the initial spatial approach. Finally, inter-row pixels were classified as weed and in-row pixels were classified as crop or weed depending on their spectral characteristics. The method was assessed on 14 images captured on maize and sugar beet fields. The contribution of the spatial, spectral and combined information was studied with respect to the classification quality. Our results show the better ability of the spatial and spectral combination algorithm to detect weeds between and within crop rows. They demonstrate the improvement of the weed detection rate and the improvement of its robustness. On all images, the mean value of the weed detection rate was 89% for spatial and spectral combination method, 79% for spatial method, and 75% for spectral method. Moreover, our work shows that the plant in-line sowing can be used to design an automatic image processing and classification algorithm to detect weed without requiring any manual data selection and labelling. Since the method required crop row identification, the method is suitable for wide-row crops and high spatial resolution images (at least 6 mm/pix).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs10050761", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2803969185", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["209458317", "198317637", "208224334", "53116940", "139108518", "85499017", "56482176"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51965578"}

Since the exact resolution is often intractable, many approaches have been proposed to approximate the value function (for example, TD-Gammon (Tesauro 1995)) or to approximate directly the policy by gradient methods (Russell & Norvig 2002). Such approaches provide a policy on all the state space whereas classical reinforcement learning algorithms do not guarantee in finite time the exploration of all states. However, these approaches often need a manual definition of the parameter for approximation functions. Recently, (Lagoudakis & Parr 2003) introduced the problem of approximating policy by a policy iteration algorithm using a mix between a rollout algorithm and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The work presented in this paper is an extension of Lagoudakis\u2019 idea. We propose a new and more general formalism which combines reinforcement learning and supervised learning formalism. To learn an approximation of an optimal policy, we propose some combinations of various algorithms (reinforcement and supervised learning). Contrary to Lagoudakis\u2019 approach, we are not restricted to an approximated policy iteration but we can use any reinforcement learning algorithms. One of the arguments for this approach is that in reinforcement learning, the most important result to obtain is the optimal policy, i.e a total order of actions for each state.

It measures quantitative fluorescence and morphological features at high sensitivity, high resolution, and is able to relocate events of interest for further investigation. An automated classification method, using Random Forests, was developed that eliminates the need for manual review of events and that classifies events as intact CTC, apoptotic CTC, CTC debris, leukocytes or debris, with a high agreement in classification between the automated classifier and 5 expert reviewers. Furthermore, we developed microstructures in PDMS that mechanically concentrate cells onto an analysis surface, thereby reducing the imaging- and image analysis times for a CTC sample. We also determined the quantitative and qualitative effect of free ferrofluid on imaging of cells in CTC samples that are processed by the CellTracks AutoPrep system. We found that the total fluorescence intensity of beads and cells is reduced by 11-67%, with the highest reductions in the blue region.

Finally, these pre-images are appended to the original minority class data set to train a SVM.

Therefore, while taking Beijing as the study area, this paper aims to establish an integrated framework for the identification of the DFP types, which consists of an indicator calculation system, imbalance dataset learning (borderline-Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (borderline-SMOTE)), and classification model selection (Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting (GBDT)). The classification accuracies of the models were compared and the significance of parameters was then assessed. The results indicate that Random Forest has the highest accuracy (0.752), together with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC = 0.73), and the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE = 0.544). This study confirms that the catchment shape and the relief gradient features benefit the identification of the DFP types. Whereby, the roughness index (RI) and the Relief ratio (Rr) can be used to effectively describe the DFP types.

Building detection using low resolution satellite images is a challenging task due to effects such as point Spread Function (PSF), mixed pixels, and vague determination of the building boundaries. Hence precise determination of the boundaries requires robust and novel mechanisms. Because of the information in a pixel of a coarser resolution satellite data within the instantaneous field of view of the sensor is a mixture of different classes and the individual components can be computed using soft classification techniques.The aim is to extract buildings by using Fuzzy C-Mean clustering and morphological filtering. Fuzzy C-Mean clustering is fulfilled by using Brovey pan sharpened image. This image is an input for the Fuzzy C-Mean clustering for image classification. Then rectilinear buildings are extracted using morphological filtering methods.

Many strategies exist to combat these problems, including feature selection (which chooses only the most relevant genes for building models) and ensemble learners (which combine multiple weak classification learners into one collection which should give a broader view of the data). However, these techniques present a new challenge: choosing which combination of strategies is most appropriate for a given collection of data.

The model is called Multi-View Least Squares Support Vector Machines (MV-LSSVM) Classification and is based on solving a constrained optimization problem. The primal objective includes a coupling term, which minimizes a combination of the errors from all views. The model combines the benefits from both early and late fusion, it is able to incorporate information from all views in the training phase while still allowing for some degree of freedom to model the views differently. Experimental comparisons with similar methods show that using multiple views improves the results with regard to the single view classifiers and that it outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of classification accuracy.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2017.12.029", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2771872406", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["67752914", "201139739", "208213339", "56175139", "164830183", "195878411", "53236610"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46856891"}

The term \u2018Biometrics\u2019 is used to refer to identification techniques based on physical or behavioural characteristics. As biometric recognition becomes increasingly popular, the fear of circumvention, obfuscation and replay attacks is a rising concern. Since the traditional biometric modalities (face, iris and fingerprint) are not able to supply the needs of every possible security requirement, numerous emerging biometric modalities are presented, trying to fill the gap. Biomedical signals, like electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG), have been proposed as emerging biometric modalities. The advantages of using the ECG for biometric recognition can be summarized as universality, permanence, uniqueness, robustness to attacks, liveness detection. According to the utilized features, the existing ECG based biometric systems can be classified to fiducial, non-fiducial and hybrids systems. This papers analyses the impact of some feature selection strategies like Genetic Algorithm, Memetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization on the performance of Biometric Systems based on ECG using K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines, Optimum Path Forest and a Euclidean Distance Classifier for classification task.

The network data structures are user-extensible allowing arbitrary state variables to be associated with each unit, site and link. The base simulator is written in C and the user has a choice of C, C++, Lisp or Scheme as the language for network specification, using simulator primitives to create units, sites and links. Update functions are taken from the library or written by the user. The X11 graphics interface provides multiple display windows, customizable mouse actions and the ability to arbitrarily extend functionality. Other forms of control are exercised via a user-extensible command language. A parallel version exhibiting near-linear speedup on a shared-memory multiprocessor is described.

This paper presents a discriminative data representation learning framework by employing a simple yet powerful marginal regression function with probabilistic graphical structure adaptation. A marginally structured representation learning (MSRL) method is proposed by seamlessly incorporating distinguishable regression targets analysis, graph structure adaptation, and robust linear structural learning into a joint framework. Specifically, MSRL learns marginal regression targets from data rather than exploiting the conventional zero-one matrix that greatly hinders the freedom of regression fitness and degrades the performance of regression results. Meanwhile, an optimized graph regularization term with self-improving adaptation is constructed based on probabilistic connection knowledge to improve the compactness of the learned representation. Additionally, the regression targets are further predicted by utilizing the explanatory factors from the latent subspace of data, which can uncover the underlying feature correlations to enhance the reliability. The resulting optimization problem can be elegantly solved by an efficient iterative algorithm. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated by eight diverse but related tasks, including object, face, texture, and scene, categorization data sets. The encouraging experimental results and the explicit theoretical analysis demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed representation learning method in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29990209", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2772264", "venue": "IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems", "journal": "IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems", "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["174802588", "57375784", "59620436", "145820585", "149444982", "60442294", "54436049", "211835690", "52291847", "195783814"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195665509"}
