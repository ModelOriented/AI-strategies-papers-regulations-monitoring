Although many methods have been proposed for SSL, it still remains a challenging task to achieve accurate localization under adverse acoustic scenarios. In this paper, a novel binaural SSL method based on time-frequency convolutional neural network (TF-CNN) with multitask learning is proposed to simultaneously localize azimuth and elevation under unknown acoustic conditions. First, the interaural phase difference and interaural level difference are extracted from the received binaural signals, which are taken as the input of the proposed SSL neural network. Then, an SSL neural network is designed to map the interaural cues to sound direction, which consists of TF-CNN module and multitask neural network. The TF-CNN module learns and combines the time-frequency information of extracted interaural cues to generate the shared feature for multitask SSL. With the shared feature, a multitask neural network is designed to simultaneously estimate azimuth and elevation through multitask learning, which generates the posterior probability for candidate directions. Finally, the candidate direction with the highest probability is taken as the final direction estimation. The experiments based on public head-related transfer function (HRTF) database demonstrate that the proposed method achieves preferable localization performance compared with other popular methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2905617", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2921741089", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["43140365", "14689627", "384581", "12903482", "62145330", "121803300", "31251598", "10130537", "1359393", "109767634", "14032173", "121072493", "9987802", "27138083", "36855764", "17328873", "6330522", "15078450", "1275954", "15156712", "1534678", "1010190", "37376702", "2394486", "42551813", "15115772", "15722462", "34282061", "7672501", "4563092", "13437499", "206742218", "7859087", "4367247", "7451727", "11069489", "115908237", "16154317", "13908665", "202769755", "11650271", "15539264", "5808102", "2492447", "13051257", "6404642", "207752942", "10175374", "61074283", "28789393", "6287870", "62245742"], "inbound_citations": ["211106842"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88484916"}

Unfortunately, there are few gender-labelled databases available which make state of the art techniques, such as deep learning, difficult to use. An alternative source of data to train these algorithms are synthetic images. Methods based on Generative Adversarial Network are widely used for generating synthetic images. However, low features, such as gender, are not preserved in the images generated by these methods. In this paper, a novel GAN-based algorithm that preserves gender information while generating synthetic images is presented. It uses a latent vector that encodes gender information within the conditional GAN algorithm. Resulting synthetic images were tested using a gender classifier algorithm (CNN). Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can be a useful tool for the synthesis of gender-labelled images to be used in training Deep Learning gender-classification algorithms.

Laplacian Support Vector Machines (LapSVM) is one of such approaches applied to this task. However, LapSVM uses a squared hinge loss function for the labeled examples, which is not twice differentiable and may penalize noisy labeled examples too much. Thus, the accuracy decreases when the training data contains outliers or the labeled data is heavily contaminated by noise. We propose to use a continuously differentiable loss function called Huber hinge loss, which gives a milder penalty than the squared hinge loss. Furthermore, we build on the primal formulation of LapSVM and use a preconditioned conjugate gradient method to make the approach more efficient. In this way the training time can be reduced but still a very accurate approximation of the original problem can be obtained.

When the labeled data is scarce, models tend to struggle to achieve satisfactory performance. However, human beings can distinguish new categories very efficiently with few examples.

Inspired by human intelligence, we propose to introduce external knowledge into few-shot learning to imitate human knowledge. A novel parameter generator network is investigated to this end, which is able to use the external knowledge to generate relation network parameters.

Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become the mainstream solution for sound event detection. Because RNNs make a prediction at every frame, it is necessary to provide exact starting and ending times of the sound events in the training data, making data annotation an extremely time-consuming process. Connectionist temporal classification (CTC), as a sequence-to-sequence model, can relax this constraint, because it suffices to provide ordered sequences of sound events without exact starting and ending times. This paper presents a first attempt at using CTC for sound event detection. In the polyphonic situation, sound events may overlap with each other, making it hard to define ordered sequences of sound events. We propose to use the boundaries (i.e. starts and ends) of the sound events as tokens for CTC.

This paper proposes a method to predict non-support vectors with high accuracy by the use of strict- constrained gradient ascent optimisation. Unlike other data preselection methods, the proposed gradient based method is itself a training algorithm for SVM, and is also very simple to implement.

It was observed that Learn++ based data fusion consistently outperforms a similarly configured ensemble classifier trained on any of the individual data sources across several applications. Furthermore, even if the classifiers trained on individual data sources are fine tuned for the given problem, Learn++ can still achieve a statistically significant improvement by combining them, if the additional data sets carry complementary information. The algorithm can also identify-albeit indirectly-those data sets that do not carry such additional information.

The community content- and knowledge-capturing, management and sharing portal of the European project \u201cRealising an Applied Gaming Eco-system\u201d (RAGE) \u2020 combines such tools. The goal of the RAGE project is to boost the collaborative knowledge asset management for software development in European applied gaming (AG) research and development (R&D). To support this process, the so-called RAGE ecosystem implements a portal to support the related asset, content and knowledge exchange between diverse actors in AG communities. Therefore, the community portal in RAGE is designed as a so-called ecosystem and is intended to provide its users different tools for the capturing, management, and sharing of knowledge. In this study, we rely on the term and model definition of spiraling knowledge exchange between explicit and tacit knowledge given by Nonaka and Takeuchi.1 To achieve the goal of extracting, i.e., externalizing and explicitly representing and sharing this knowledge to its users, we propose to generate a taxonomy for faceted search automatically by extracting named entities form the knowledge sources and to classify documents using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Five-fold cross-validation method and an independent evaluation set are used to test SVM model.

It has seen that even Naive Bayes classifier performs well in many cases, it may be improved by introducing some dependency relationships among variables (Augmented Naive Bayes).

When data is presented in short chunks of instances, there is an obvious need for incrementally improving the performance of the classifiers as new data is available. It would be too costly, in computing time and memory space, to use the batch algorithms processing again the old data together with the new one.

In this study, we have employed Support Vector Regression, Artificial Neural Network, and Generalized Regression Neural Network based Computational Intelligent (CI) techniques to predict LC of cubic and monoclinic perovskites. Due to their interesting physiochemical properties, investigations in modeling the structural properties of perovskites have gained considerable attention. A dataset of a reasonable number of cubic and monoclinic perovskites are collected from the current literature. The CI techniques can efficiently correlate the LC of the perovskites materials with the ionic radii of constituent elements. A performance analysis of CI techniques is carried out with Multiple Linear Regression techniques, SPuDS software, and Density-Functional Theory.

Such systems require effective sensing and collaborative decision-making to operate in highly dynamic environments with demanding time constraints. The Pervasive Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm that enables detailed characterization of the real physical applications. To this end, a pervasive IoT surveillance applications can offer an effective framework to collect situation-aware knowledge that is vital for planning effective security measures. Nevertheless, most state-of-the-art focus only on visual abnormal event recognition using centralized systems, thus, ignoring the need for distributed operation to enable large-scale IoT surveillance systems. This paper presents a novel Sensor Management (SM) framework for pervasive IoT acoustic surveillance, IntelliSurv, that automatically detects and localizes abnormal acoustic events in a distributed collaborative manner. The proposed framework coordinates the sensing resources using a novel team-theoretic SM, based on the Belief\u2013Desire\u2013Intention (BDI) model, for autonomous decision-making and resource allocation. The proposed abnormal event recognition module, using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) classifiers, relies on audio information to recognize human screams or high-stress speech signals. The simulation scenario in this work is the surveillance of the Waterloo International Airport implemented using Jadex platform and Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) database. The simulation results show the merits of the proposed IntelliSurv framework, compared to the popular centralized systems, over varying network size, number of threats, Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR), tracking quality, and energy consumption.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.future.2018.01.020", "venue": "Future Gener.

However, it is often the case that data are abundant in some domains but scarce in others. Domain adaptation deals with the challenge of adapting a model trained from a data-rich source domain to perform well in a data-poor target domain. In general, this requires learning plausible mappings between domains. CycleGAN is a powerful framework that efficiently learns to map inputs from one domain to another using adversarial training and a cycle-consistency constraint. However, the conventional approach of enforcing cycle-consistency via reconstruction may be overly restrictive in cases where one or more domains have limited training data. In this paper, we propose an augmented cyclic adversarial learning model that enforces the cycle-consistency constraint through an external task specific model, which encourages the preservation of task-relevant content as opposed to exact reconstruction. We explore digit classification with MNIST and SVHN in a low-resource setting in supervised, semi and unsupervised situation. In low-resource supervised setting, the results show that our approach improves absolute performance by $14\\%$ and $4\\%$ when adapting SVHN to MNIST and vice versa, respectively, which outperforms unsupervised domain adaptation methods that require high-resource unlabeled target domain. Moreover, using only few unsupervised target data, our approach can still outperforms many high-resource unsupervised models. In speech domains, we also adopt a speech recognition model from each domain as the task specific model.

In the first part of the thesis, we address the problem of traffic prediction and classsification by means of advanced statistical tools. We analyze the problem of online prediction of the load on a link based only on past measurements and without assuming any particular model. Concerning traffic classification, and motivated by the widespread use of P2P systems, we focus on the identification of P2P applications, considering more precisely the case of P2P television (P2P-TV). For both cases, our framework makes use of Support Vector Machines (SVM). The algorithms we propose provide very accurate results, they are robust and their computational cost is extremely low. These properties make our solutions specially adapted to an online application. Self-organized systems such as MANETs, are of particular importance in today\u2019s world. In the second part of the thesis, we address two different problems related to MAC mechanisms in MANETs (in particular, we concentrate on CSMA). Firstly, an analysis of the existing models for CSMA, with special emphasis on their correlation with the real protocol, is presented. Some weakness are identified and possible solutions are proposed. The use of stochastic geometry tools allows us to obtain analytical results where other techniques cannot. Secondly, we address the problem of lack of QoS in CSMA and we propose two different mechanisms that guarantee a minimum rate for each accepted transmission.

Distance metric learning can optimize a metric over a set of triplets, each one of which is defined by a pair of same class instances and an instance in a different class. However, the number of possible triplets is quite huge even for a small dataset. Our safe triplet screening identifies triplets which can be safely removed from the optimization problem without losing the optimality.

We define a models limitations as encompassing assessment of overall prediction accuracy, applicability domain and chance correlation. A general guideline is presented in this review for assessing a models limitations with emphasis on and examples of application with consensus modeling methods. More specifically, we discuss the commonalities and differences between external validation and cross-validation for assessing a models limitations. We illustrate two common ways of assessing overall prediction accuracy, depending on whether or not the intended application domain is predefined. Since even a high quality model will have different confidence in accuracy for predicting different chemicals, we further demonstrate using the novel Decision Forest consensus modeling method a means to determine prediction confidence (i.e., certainty for an individual chemicals prediction) and domain extrapolation (i.e., the prediction accuracy for a chemical that is outside the chemistry space defined by the training chemicals). We show that prediction confidence and domain extrapolation are related measures that together determine the applicability domain of a model, and that prediction confidence is the more important measure. Lastly, the importance of assessing chance correlation is emphasized, and illustrated with several examples of models having a high degree of chance correlations despite cross-validation indicating high prediction accuracy. Generally, a dataset with a skewed distribution, small data size and/or low signal/noise ratio tends to produce a model with high chance correlation.

{"paper_id": "21054462", "title": "Connectionist Models of CPG Networks.", "authors": [{"first": "Sharmila", "middle": [], "last": "Venugopal", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are neural networks that can produce coordinated patterns of rhythmic activity to orchestrate repetitive behaviors such as feeding, locomotion, and respiration. CPGs are known to be composed of phylogenetically conserved connectional units that are typically organized into chains to enable coordinated activation of the effector organs (muscles). Through integration of experimental and computational approaches at the cellular and network levels, essential connectional elements of CPGs have been revealed (Grillner 2006). Network Topology: At the connectional level, a CPG network consists of \u201cunit CPGs\u201d representing the nodes of the network, and the reciprocal connections between unit CPGs correspond to the branches of the network. Physiologically, a unit CPG represents a group of neurons that can generate a recurrent burst of activity (Grillner 2006). Simple inputs such as tonic excitation can produce rhythmic outputs in these networks. Increasing the stimulus strength typically increases the frequency of the network rhythm. Two unit CPGs are reciprocally coupled by mutual inhibition to generate alternating activity patterns (Fig. 1a) or by mutual excitation to generate synchronized bursts (Fig. 1b). Many unit CPGs connected in a chain with mutual excitation can generate a progressive phase lag in the bursts of activity along the CPG chain (Fig. 1c). It is generally accepted that rhythmogenesis is intrinsic to the neurons forming the unit CPG. However, connectionist models of CPG networks have unequivocally demonstrated that rhythmic patterns can be a resultant of a topology of connections among unit CPGs (Buchanan 1992). Hence, based on the nature of connections between unit CPGs, a CPG network can generate and shape patterns of activity. Reconfiguration of CPGs: Central pattern generators can reconfigure to switch from one activity pattern to another to produce multiple forms of the same behavior (e.g., walking, running, and galloping as different forms of locomotion) or functionally distinct behaviors (e.g., normal breathing versus gasping). Mathematical and simulation models suggest that the mechanisms underlying the reconfiguration of CPGs may include (1) altered strength and duration of the excitatory drive to the CPG network (e.g., Jung et al. 1996), (2) altered strength and duration of the mutual connections between unit CPGs (e.g., Venugopal et al. 2007), and (3) recruitment and de-recruitment of unit CPGs (e.g., Nasse et al. 2008). Such reconfiguration of a given CPG network architecture can confer multifunctionality. Unit CPG Models: Biophysical models of unit CPGs are typically based on conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley formalism to model the constituent neurons with one or more compartments (e.g., see review Grillner et al. 2005). In models that exclusively focused on network properties, nonlinear oscillators have been widely used to represent unit CPGs (e.g., see review Ijspeert 2008). It appears that the network activity pattern of interest can be produced irrespective of the type of the oscillator model (e.g., Collins and Richmond 1994). This provides various options for choosing a suitable oscillator to represent the unit CPGs/nodes, particularly when mathematical analyses are adopted for", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4614-7320-6_122-1", "venue": "Encyclopedia of Computational Neuroscience", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1016408950", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21054462"}

Different experimental and computational methods have been developed to identify the ubiquitination sites in protein sequences. This paper aims at exploring computational machine learning methods for the prediction of ubiquitination sites using the physicochemical properties (PCPs) of amino acids in the protein sequences.ResultsWe first establish six different ubiquitination data sets, whose records contain both ubiquitination sites and non-ubiquitination sites in variant numbers of protein sequence segments. In particular, to establish such data sets, protein sequence segments are extracted from the original protein sequences used in four published papers on ubiquitination, while 531 PCP features of each extracted protein sequence segment are calculated based on PCP values from AAindex (Amino Acid index database) by averaging PCP values of all amino acids on each segment. Various computational machine-learning methods, including four Bayesian network methods (i.e., Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), Feature Selection NB (FSNB), Model Averaged NB (MANB), and Efficient Bayesian Multivariate Classifier (EBMC)) and three regression methods (i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)), are then applied to the six established segment-PCP data sets. Five-fold cross-validation and the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) are employed to evaluate the ubiquitination prediction performance of each method. Results demonstrate that the PCP data of protein sequences contain information that could be mined by machine learning methods for ubiquitination site prediction. The comparative results show that EBMC, SVM and LR perform better than other methods, and EBMC is the only method that can get AUCs greater than or equal to 0.6 for the six established data sets.

However, there are some problems which are well suited for analysis with inductive logic programming (ILP), a class of machine learning methods based on first-order predicate logic. The principal strength of ILP is that input, background knowledge and output can contain first-order logic statements. Two results of this is that ILP in contrast to other common methods is capable of learning common substructures in a set of graphs, and that it has the ability to use graph-structured background knowledge in analysis. Particularly the growing set of biomedical ontologies is an interesting research area in this respect. This thesis first contain an introduction to ILP together with a review of chemical and biochemical problems where the method have been applied until now. Most papers on the topic have been published in the machine learning literature, and this paper serves as an overview to the parts of the literature that are most relevant for chemistry. The most well-studied problem is structure\u2013activity relationships (SAR) for diverse sets of molecules, because the relational atom\u2013bond structure is well suited for relational representation and hence also ILP learning. The next part of the thesis is a further enhancement of using ILP for SAR problems. A method is implemented which use descriptors from quantum topology instead of atoms and bonds as the molecular representation. This method performs equally well to the previous atom\u2013bond representation, but have the advantage of being rooted in quantum theory while keeping the representational simplicity of the concepts of atoms and bonds. Two articles are devoted to the main aim of this thesis; the use of the gene ontology as background information in microarray analysis. The first article introduces the method, presents the setup and compare it to traditional analysis methods. ILP performs similar to other methods in terms of predictive performance. The advantage of ILP is in the possibility of a classification theory to include both ontological information and expression information for single genes. After asserting that ILP can be used for such analysis, the next article studies how the variable selection performed on the microarray data before running ILP will affect the result.

But for the continuous value data sets, it is inevitable for P-ELM1 and P-ELM2 to evaluate the probability distributions of the data sets with discretization methods for calculating \u03c72 and information gain, while the discretization will lead to information loss. Furthermore, the discretization will result in high computational complexity. In order to deal with the problems, based on tolerance rough sets, this paper proposed an improved pruned-ELM algorithm, which can overcome the drawbacks mentioned above. Experimental results along with statistical analysis on 8 UCI data sets show that the improved algorithm outperforms the pruned-ELM in computational complexity and testing accuracy.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1142/S0218488516500161", "venue": "International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems", "journal": "International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems", "mag_id": "2439924743", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35703025"}

A few studies pay attention to matching recommendations which are based on the visual features of items. Identifying and understanding relationships between items is the base of the matching recommendation tasks. A distance between items can be defined to measure the relationships. Therefore, we explore a novel recommendation framework to integrate visual features with category features based on Siamese architecture and metric learning. The distance between items can be learnt in target space (matching space) rather than in the input space (original space). In the matching space, the matching items are close to each other while the mismatching items are far away. Compared with the baselines, our methods show great superiority which demonstrates that the matching space defined in our framework is more suitable for learning the matching relationship between items.

Classification 1 was defined deductively, based on expert-defined rules. Classifications 2 to 6 were defined inductively using hydrological indices calculated from 321 natural daily flow records. Classifications 2 to 4 were defined by first clustering the gauges based on the hydrological indices and then predicting the class of each segment of the network using a Random Forest classifier. Classifications 5 and 6 were defined by first predicting the indices for each segment of the network using Random Forest regression models. Cluster analysis was then used to group the network segments into classes. Further differences between classifications were due to differences in the standardisation of the hydrological indices and clustering algorithms. Correspondence (extent to which the patterns defined by the classifications were similar) was assessed formally using the adjusted Rand index and visually. The performance of the classifications was assessed using classification strength calculated using the hydrological indices and ANOVA calculated for individual indices. Correspondence between the classifications was low (adjusted Rand index range, 0.1\u20130.5). Classification strength and ANOVA statistics assessed using cross validation indicated that the inductive classifications performed better than the deductively defined classification and that there were some significant differences in performance between the inductive classifications. However, these differences were not large from a practical point of view. Our results indicate that there are many credible classifications of the flow regimes of a study region. When considering methods for defining flow regime classifications, aspects other than the predictive performance, such as flow data requirements and how easily the final classification can be explained, should be considered.

The first contribution is to clear the noise with discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The second contribution is to transfer the noiseless pattern into the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) domain. PCA is exploited not only for decorrelation but for explicit dimensionality reduction as well. This goal cannot be achieved by simple raw data sampling. The last contribution is to expand the principal components with a local maximum (Lmax) parameter. It strengthens the classification accuracy by emphasizing the undercarriage height variation of the vehicle. These parameters are fed into the three-layered backpropagation neural network (BPNN).

In this work, we propose an adversarial training method in learning common features and representations that can be shared across multiple domains. Model that produces such shared representations can be combined with models trained on individual domain SLU data to reduce the amount of training samples required for developing a new domain. In our experiments using data sets from multiple domains, we show that adversarial training helps in learning better domain-general SLU models, leading to improved slot filling F1 scores.

In this work, we advance the use of a latent representation based on a product space of Orthogonal Spheres PrOSe. The PrOSe model is motivated by the reasoning that latent-variables related to the physics of image-formation can under certain relaxed assumptions lead to spherical-spaces. Orthogonality between the spheres is motivated via physical independence models. Imposing the orthogonal-sphere constraint is much simpler than other complicated physical models, is fairly general and flexible, and extensible beyond the factors used to motivate its development. Under further relaxed assumptions of equal-sized latent blocks per factor, the constraint can be written down in closed form as an ortho-normality term in the loss function.

Kernel-based classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) have become highly popular in the task of text mining.

Recently, there is an increased interest in the exploitation of background knowledge such as ontologies and corpus-based statistical knowledge in text categorization. It has been shown that, by replacing the standard kernel functions such as linear kernel with customized kernel functions which take advantage of this background knowledge, it is possible to increase the performance of SVM in the text classification domain. Based on this, we propose a novel semantic smoothing kernel for SVM. The suggested approach is based on a meaning measure, which calculates the meaningfulness of the terms in the context of classes. The documents vectors are smoothed based on these meaning values of the terms in the context of classes. Since we efficiently make use of the class information in the smoothing process, it can be considered a supervised smoothing kernel. The meaning measure is based on the Helmholtz principle from Gestalt theory and has previously been applied to several text mining applications such as document summarization and feature extraction. However, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to use meaning measure in a supervised setting to build a semantic kernel for SVM. We evaluated the proposed approach by conducting a large number of experiments on well-known textual datasets and present results with respect to different experimental conditions. We compare our results with traditional kernels used in SVM such as linear kernel as well as with several corpus-based semantic kernels. Our results show that classification performance of the proposed approach outperforms other kernels.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.engappai.2015.03.015", "venue": "Eng.

Real time intrusion detection has become a major challenge for the power community and energy stakeholders. Current conventional methods have continued to exhibit shortfalls in tackling these security issues. In order to address this security issue, this paper proposes a hybrid Support Vector Machine and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (SVMNN) algorithm that involves the combination of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron neural network (MPLNN) algorithms for predicting and detecting cyber intrusion attacks into power system networks. In this paper, a modified version of the IEEE Garver 6-bus test system and a 24-bus system were used as case studies. The IEEE Garver 6-bus test system was used to describe the attack scenarios, whereas load flow analysis was conducted on real time data of a modified Nigerian 24-bus system to generate the bus voltage dataset that considered several cyberattack events for the hybrid algorithm. Sising various performance metricion and load/generator injections, en included in the manuscriptmulation results showed the relevant influences of cyberattacks on power systems in terms of voltage, power, and current flows.

Initially, the image database is segmented using level set approach. In order to retrieve the feature vectors from the segmented image, extraction of features from those datasets are carried out. Hence, the feature vectors are extracted using histogram and Local binary pattern (LBP) method.

Therefore, it is required to take early steps in detection and diagnosis of breast cancer to decrease the associated death rate. Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) is useful in mass screening of breast cancer datasets. Data mining and machine learning technologies have already achieved significant success in many knowledge engineering areas including classification, regression and clustering, and most recently, have been employed to assist the diagnosis of cancers with promising outcomes. Traditional machine learning models are characterized by training and testing data with the same input feature space and data distribution. But when distribution changes, most machine learning models need to be modified or rebuilt from scratch to work on newly collected data. In many real world applications, it is expensive or impossible to recollect the needed data and rebuild the models. Therefore, there is a need to create high-performance learners trained with more easily obtained data from different domains. This methodology is referred as Transfer Learning. In this paper, we explore the usage of transfer learning, specially, unsupervised domain adaptation for breast cancer diagnosis to address the issues of fewer training data on target image dataset. On the strength of recent developed deep descriptors, we are able to adapt recent transfer learning methodologies, e.g., TCA (Transfer Component Analysis), CORAL (Correlation Alignment), BDA(Balanced Distribution Adaptation) to breast cancer diagnosis across multiple mammographic image databases including CBIS-DDSM, InBreast, MIAS, etc, and evaluate their performance.

The second method is based on the linear programming approach suggested by Vapnik to build a separating hyperplane with the minimum number of support vectors (heuristic SVM). Using synthetic data from two classes, we compare the classification performance of these SVMs, with an in-depth geometrical comparison of their separating hyperplanes and support vectors. We show that both classifiers achieve practically identical classification accuracy and generalization performance. However, the heuristic SVM has many fewer support vectors than the optimal SVM. In addition, in contrast to the optimal SVM, its support vectors lie on the furthermost borders of the classes, at the maximum distance from the opposite class. In our future work, we will seek to find a theoretical basis to explain these geometrical patterns of the heuristic SVM.

Our approach is as follows. We first identify several key aspects of social media conversations, distinct from both online forum discussions and other social networks. These aspects include intrinsic and extrinsic network factors. There are three factors intrinsic to the network: social awareness, community characteristics and creator reputation. The factors extrinsic to the network include: media context and conversational interestingness. Thereafter we test the effectiveness of each factor type in accounting for the observed participation of individuals using a Support Vector Regression based prediction framework. Our findings indicate that factors that influence participation depend on the media type: YouTube participation is different from a weblog such as Engadget. We further show that an optimal factor combination improves prediction accuracy of observed participation, by ~9--13% and ~8--11% over using just the best hypothesis and all hypotheses respectively.

Accordingly, proficient algorithms/computational strategies are required for mining and condensing tweets as well as finding sentiment bearing words.

The PET component features a full ring made of 18 detectors, each one consisting of twelve 8x8 Silicon PhotoMultipliers (SiPMs) tiles coupled to two segmented LYSO crystal matrices with staggered layers. In each module, the crystals belonging to the bottom layer are coupled one to one to the SiPMs, while each crystal of the top layer is coupled to four crystals of the bottom layer. This configuration allows to increase the crystal thickness while reducing the depth of interaction uncertainty, as photons interacting in different layers are expected to produce different light patterns on the SiPMs. The PET scanner will implement the pixel/layer identification on a front-end FPGA. This will allow increasing the effective bandwidth, setting at the same time restrictions on the complexity of the algorithms to be implemented. In this work two algorithms whose implementation is feasible directly on an FPGA are presented and evaluated. The first algorithm implements a method based on adaptive thresholding, while the other uses a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained to distinguish the light pattern coming from two different layers. The validation of the algorithm performance is carried out by using simulated data generated with the GAMOS Monte Carlo.

We incorporate reconstruction error and identity label information in the loss function of SiGAN in a pairwise manner.

For classification, SVMs are popularly used because of their simplicity and efficiency; however the common multi-class SVM approaches applied suffer from limitations including having easily confused classes and been computationally inefficient. We propose using a binary tree SVM to address the shortcomings of multi-class SVMs in activity recognition. We proposed constructing a binary tree using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), where activities are repeatedly allocated to subnodes until every new created node contains only one activity. Then, for each internal node a separate SVM is learned to classify activities, which significantly reduces the training time and increases the speed of testing compared to popular the `one-against-the-rest' multi-class SVM classifier.

We have reconsidered the patient data within the framework of an existing connectionist model of word recognition and spatial attention. We show that the effects of damage to the model resemble the reading impairments observed in neglect dyslexia. In simulation experiments, we account for a broad spectrum of behaviors including the following: (1) when two noncontiguous stimuli are presented simultaneously, the contralesional stimulus is neglected (extinction); (2) explicit instructions to the patient can reduce the severity of neglect; (3) stimulus position in the visual field affects reading performance; (4) words are read much better than pronounceable nonwords; (5) the nature of error responses depends on the morphemic composition of the stimulus; and (6) extinction interacts with lexical knowledge (if two words are presented that form a compound, e.g., COW and BOY, the patient is more likely to report both than in a control condition, e.g., SUN and FLY).

Classification is accomplished by procedures based on discriminant analysis tools that well suit hyperspectrality, circumventing what in statistics is called \u201cthe curse of dimensionality\u201d. As a byproduct of classification, a full assessment of the spectral bands of the sensor is obtained, ranking them with the purpose of understanding their role in segmentation and classification. The methodology has been validated on two independent image datasets gathered by the MIVIS (Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer) sensor for which ground validations were available. A comparison with the popular multiclass SVM (Support Vector Machines) classifier is also presented. Results show that a good classification (minimum global success rate 95% through all experiments) is achieved by using the 10 spectral bands selected as the most discriminant by the proposed procedure; moreover, it also appears that nonparametric techniques generally outperform parametric ones.

The Crosta technique [1] is selected as a basement in the experimental comparisons for the conventional approach. The Crosta technique utilizes the characteristic bands of the searched target for principal component transformation in order to determine the components characterizing the target in interest. Desired Target Detection and Classification Algorithm (DTDCA), Spectral Matched Filter (SMF), and Normalized Correlation (NC) are employed for signature based target detection. Signature based target detection algorithms are applied to the whole spectrum benefiting from the information stored in all spectral bands. The selected methods are applied to a multispectral Advanced SpaceBorne Thermal Emission and Radiometer (ASTER) image of the study region, with an atmospheric correction prior to the realization of the algorithms. ASTER provides multispectral bands covering visible, short wave, and thermal infrared region, which serves as a useful tool for the interpretation of the areas with hydrocarbon anomalies. The exploration area is selected as Gemrik Anticline which is located in South East Anatolia, Adiyaman, Bozova Oil Field, where microseeps can be observed with almost no vegetation cover. The spectral signatures collected with Analytical Spectral Devices Inc. (ASD) spectrometer from the reference valley [2] have been utilized as an input to the signature based detection algorithms. The experiments have indicated that DTDCA and MF outperforms the Crosta technique by locating the microseepage patterns along the mitigation pathways with a better contrast. On the other hand, NC has not been able to map the searched target with a visible distinction.

Antibodies remain an attractive class of biomarkers given their amplification by the immune system, stability, and current clinical use. While the antibody repertoire represents a rich source for biomarker discovery, it has been difficult to impartially identify which molecules from this repertoire are associated with disease. This work demonstrates three molecular discovery processes centered on the utility of bacterial displayed peptide libraries and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for identifying novel antibody biomarkers and their targets. We applied these methods to discover and characterize disease-associated antibodies for pre-eclampsia (PE), a condition with unknown etiology that affects 5-8% of pregnancies, using an unbiased approach. Applying three quantitative screening strategies against a set of PE and healthy-outcome pregnancies (HOP) identified unique disease-associated antibody binding peptides from a fully random 15 amino acid peptide library. With a two-color screening method, we used antibody fractions enriched from plasma to isolate significantly PE cross-reactive and specific peptides distinct from a previously identified PE-associated antibody specificity. We used a panel of these antibody-detecting peptides to train and validate an Adaptive Boosting classification algorithm that achieved high specificity (95%) and a validated overall 80% diagnostic accuracy. To more closely replicate the native antibody binding environment, a second screening method used unprocessed, diluted plasma. This approach sequentially enriched peptides binding to PE antibodies and removed HOP antibody binders, resulting in a strong consensus motif that we further expanded through directed evolution. Importantly, we linked this motif to a region of a common viral antigen, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1, and a human G protein-coupled receptor, GPR50, presenting a novel case for molecular mimicry. Thus, this method enabled unbiased identification of a disease-associated antibody and characterization of its targets. Finally, we developed and applied a unique methodology that combines bacterial displayed library screening with next-generation sequencing to profile the antibody repertoire of individual PE patients and HOP samples. This analysis re-identified the viral antigen-linked motif among several distinct PE- and HOP-associated antibody specificities, providing broader insights into alterations to the immune repertoire in PE. This work demonstrates the utility of screening bacterial displayed peptide libraries to profile the antibody repertoire and identify new markers of disease. These disease-associated antibody-detecting peptide reagents enable development of molecular diagnostics and discovery of antibody binding target(s) to improve understanding of disease etiology and potentially elucidate therapeutic targets.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2519807968", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:89385445"}

This novel automatic method does not require prior knowledge of the terrain or the assignment of training samples. The ALCC method is based on unsupervised classification methods, which is performed over the spectral indices rasters and six Landsat-8 30 m spatial resolution bands. The method was tested in three different study areas. Furthermore, all three study areas were classified by common supervised classification methods, namely, the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) and the Random Forests (RF) method. For comparison accuracy, assessment of the three applied classification methods, namely, the figure of merit, overall agreement, omission and commission, were used. The results show that the overall agreement of the new automatic classification method for the Rijeka, Zagreb and Sarajevo study areas is 90.0%, 89.5% and 89.9%, respectively, and the overall agreement always falls between the overall agreement of the MLC method (88.1%, 88.9% and 86.7%, respectively) and the overall agreement of the RF method of classification (91.7%, 90.4% and 90.2%, respectively).

As an emerging technology, the extreme learning machine (ELM) and its variants, including the weighted ELM (WELM) and the boosting weighted ELM (BWELM), have been recently developed for the classification of imbalanced data. However, the WELM suffers the following deficiencies: (i) the sample weight matrix is manually chosen and fixed during the learning phase; (ii) the representation capability, namely the capability to extract features or useful information from the original data, is insufficiently explored due to its shallow structure. The BWELM employs the AdaBoost algorithm to optimize the sample weights. But the representation capability is still restricted by the shallow structure. To alleviate these deficiencies, we propose a novel deep weighted ELM (DWELM) algorithm for imbalanced data classification in this paper. An enhanced stacked multilayer deep representation network trained with the ELM (EH-DrELM) is first proposed to improve the representation capability, and a fast AdaBoost algorithm for imbalanced multiclass data (AdaBoost-ID) is developed to optimize the sample weights. Then, the novel DWELM for the imbalance learning is obtained by combining the above two algorithms. Experimental results on nine imbalanced binary-class datasets, nine imbalanced multiclass datasets, and five large benchmark datasets (three for multiclass and two for binary-class) show that the proposed DWELM achieves a better performance than the WELM and BWELM, as well as several state-of-the-art multilayer network-based learning algorithms.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12559-018-9602-9", "venue": "Cognitive Computation", "journal": "Cognitive Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2895604200", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["26893209", "682660", "9429312", "13465751", "14723701", "55782254", "2120854", "15947919", "12987308", "206757279", "3570420", "116858", "15037168", "17128241", "207148609", "8031115", "549956", "7442888", "17951183", "19028028", "3936439", "207321848", "11413908", "8327677", "5170601", "116176040", "22746154", "61811788", "20220120", "6842315", "9866416", "17081124", "18370956", "14272714", "1554582", "29618379", "207878852", "8223142", "5878360", "32670512", "206742563", "15428347", "14500607", "13463620", "207547900", "2275135", "5557359", "11461261", "10802494", "14813066", "206594692", "2640788", "1658773", "1658773"], "inbound_citations": ["208211901", "208338203", "207988138", "202688842", "53084322"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52898881"}

For a robust spoken dialogue system, it is important to classify if a user's utterance is in the task or out of the task.

On many generative tasks, GANs achieve state-of-the-art performance but are often unstable to train and sometimes miss modes. A typical failure mode is the collapse of the generator to a single parameter configuration where its outputs are identical. When this collapse occurs, the gradient of the discriminator may point in similar directions for many similar points. We hypothesize that some of these shortcomings are in part due to primitive and redundant features extracted by discriminator and this can easily make the training stuck. We present a novel approach for regularizing adversarial models by enforcing diverse feature learning. In order to do this, both generator and discriminator are regularized by penalizing both negatively and positively correlated features according to their differentiation and based on their relative cosine distances. In addition to the gradient information from the adversarial loss made available by the discriminator, diversity regularization also ensures that a more stable gradient is provided to update both the generator and discriminator.

In this paper, we present a new and robust approach for detecting presentation attacks on finger-vein biometric systems exploiting the 3D Shape (normal-map) and material properties (diffuse-map) of the finger. Observing the normal-map and diffuse-map exhibiting enhanced textural differences in comparison with the original finger-vein image, especially in the presence of varying illumination intensity, we propose to employ textural feature-descriptors on both of them independently. The features are subsequently used to compute a separating hyper-plane using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for the features computed from normal-maps and diffuse-maps independently. Given the scores from each classifier for normal-map and diffuse-map, we propose sum-rule based score level fusion to make detection of such presentation attack more robust. To this end, we construct a new database of finger-vein images acquired using a custom capture device with three inbuilt illuminations and validate the applicability of the proposed approach. The newly collected database consists of 936 images, which corresponds to 468 bona fide images and 468 artefact images. We establish the superiority of the proposed approach by benchmarking it with classical textural feature-descriptor applied directly on finger-vein images.

The objective of this thesis is to accelerate an implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) using a heterogeneous computing system programmed using OpenCL in C/C++. LIBSVM, a widely-available, popular and open source implementation of SVM is chosen, allowing the presented work to be integrated seamlessly into existing systems. The proposed framework is evaluated in terms of speed and accuracy when performing training and classification on a number of standard data sets. Testing was based on two work station GPUs, the NVIDIA GTX 480 and Tesla K20, and a modern, work station CPU (Intel i5 Quad Core, 3 GHz). We find that, for large data sets, training is accelerated by a factor ranging from 9 to 22. In general, speedup increases with the total number of training samples in the data set until the GPU device is fully utilized. While these gains in speedup are significant, they do not match the ideal parallel speedup, that is the total number of cores in the parallel system. Our findings indicate that performance is hampered by the portions of the SVM training algorithm that are sequential. In addition, we find that the classification phase of the SVM system is accelerated by a factor of up to 12. During classification only a relatively small number of samples are classified compared to the typical number of training samples, and the computational complexity of classification grows only linearly with the number of samples processed, as opposed to the training phase where it grows quadratically.

The novelty of this work is that, it focuses on a KELM learning algorithm with parameter optimization for exact solar irradiance forecasting. The exact prediction of irradiance is highly essential for system level stability and future large scale PV installations. The GSA based optimized KELM (GSA-KELM) is implemented for short term solar irradiance forecasting based on various weather conditions. A hit and trial method was used for the selection of kernel function parameters which affects the forecasting model performance. The optimized kernel structure not only minimizes the arbitrariness of the variables but also makes the process fast by extenuating the choice of parameter on the basis of the user which has to experience the repeated trial method for various kernel functions.

This paradigm, known as Hypothesis Transfer Learning (HTL), has been successfully exploited in empirical works, but only recently has received a theoretical attention. Here, we try to understand when HTL facilitates accelerated generalization -- the goal of the transfer learning paradigm. Thus, we study a broad class of algorithms, a Hypothesis Transfer Learning through Regularized ERM, that can be instantiated with any non-negative smooth loss function and any strongly convex regularizer. We establish generalization and excess risk bounds, showing that if the algorithm is fed with a good source hypotheses combination, generalization happens at the fast rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/m)$ instead of usual $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{m})$. We also observe that if the combination is perfect, our theory formally backs up the intuition that learning is not necessary. On the other hand, if the source hypotheses combination is a misfit for the target task, we recover the usual learning rate. As a byproduct of our study, we also prove a new bound on the Rademacher complexity of the smooth loss class under weaker assumptions compared to previous works.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": "1412.1619", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "mag_id": "247078589", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["1904506"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207793955"}

In hybridized SVR-WNN, optimal kernel and wavelet coefficients are generated using hybrid algorithm. Here, artificial bee colony (ABC) and genetic algorithm (GA) are hybridized and used to this purpose.

In hybrid model, wavelet neural network with ARX modeling and support vector regression (SVR) model is effectively hybridized to time series rainfall prediction. The performance of the hybrid model is analyzed with the help of real datasets taken from Assam, Chhattisgarh, East Rajasthan, Gangetic West Bengal, Gujarath, Haryana, Telangana, Rajalaseema regions.

Water objects are essential elements of a geographic map. While modern dense labeling methods perform robust segmentation of such objects like roads, buildings, and vegetation, dense labeling of hydrographic regions remains a challenging problem. Water objects change their surface albedo, color, and reflection in different weather and different seasons. Moreover, rivers and lakes can change their boundaries after floods or droughts. Robust documentation of such seasonal changes is an essential task in the field of analysis of satellite imagery. Due to the high variance in water object appearance, their segmentation is usually performed manually by a human operator. Recent advances in machine learning have made possible robust segmentation of static objects such as buildings and roads. To the best of our knowledge, there is little research in the modern literature regarding dense labeling of water regions. This paper is focused on the development of a deep-learning-based method for dense labeling of hydrographic in aerial and satellite imagery. We use the GeoGAN framework and MobileNetV2 as the starting point for our research. The GeoGAN framework uses an aerial image as an input to generate pixel-level annotations of five object classes: building, low vegetation, high vegetation, road, and car. The GeoGAN framework leverages two deep learning approaches to ensure robust labeling: a generator with skip connections and Generative Adversarial Networks. A generator with skip connections performs image\u2192label translation using feed-forward connections between convolutional and deconvolutional layers of the same depth. A GAN framework consists of two competing networks: a generator and a discriminator. The adversarial loss improves the quality of the resulting dense labeling. We made the following contributions to the GeoGAN framework: (1) new MobileNetV2-based generator, (2) adversarial loss function. We term the resulting framework as HydroGAN. We evaluate our HydroGAN model using a new HydroViews dataset focused on dense labeling of areas that are subject to severe flooding during the spring season. The evaluation results are encouraging and demonstrate that our HydroGAN model competes with the state-of-the-art models for dense labeling of aerial and satellite imagery. The evaluation demonstrates that our model can generalize from the training data to previously unseen samples. The developed HydroGAN model is capable of performing dense labeling of water objects in different seasons.

Since cognitive problems do not specify how this representation is to be done, an important part of connectionist cognitive modeling is specifying such a representation. ; Complex cognitive processing requires representation of complex structured data.

Experimental results, with a prototype multichannel biosensor used for discriminating strains of E. coli (K12 and O157 : H7) and Salmonella enterica serovar Thompson, show an accuracy of 98% for concentration levels, 100-108 colony forming units per milliliter, and total detection time of less than 6 min", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSEN.2006.884445", "venue": "IEEE Sensors Journal", "journal": "IEEE Sensors Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2132659828", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["16464620", "19313323", "94591683", "71013967", "23737326", "2076093", "2304887", "30519021", "7359186", "15874442", "1845191"], "inbound_citations": ["5912544", "42033663", "9037196", "8576682", "38943952", "377704", "202613121", "40818891", "9294839", "211520410"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32851091"}

Since the learned representation is tuned to contain only phonetic content, we resort to using a high capacity WaveNet decoder to infer information discarded by the encoder from previous samples. Moreover, the behavior of autoencoder models depends on the kind of constraint that is applied to the latent representation. We compare three variants: a simple dimensionality reduction bottleneck, a Gaussian Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and a discrete Vector Quantized VAE (VQ-VAE). We analyze the quality of learned representations in terms of speaker independence, the ability to predict phonetic content, and the ability to accurately reconstruct individual spectrogram frames. Moreover, for discrete encodings extracted using the VQ-VAE, we measure the ease of mapping them to phonemes.

Until now, existing studies formulated GS as the problem of modeling an individual\u2019s breeding value for a particular trait of interest, i.e., as a regression problem. To assess predictive accuracy of the model, the Pearson correlation between observed and predicted trait values was used. ::: ::: ::: Contributions ::: In this paper, we propose to formulate GS as the problem of ranking individuals according to their breeding value. Our proposed framework allows us to employ machine learning methods for ranking which had previously not been considered in the GS literature. To assess ranking accuracy of a model, we introduce a new measure originating from the information retrieval literature called normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). NDCG rewards more strongly models which assign a high rank to individuals with high breeding value. Therefore, NDCG reflects a prerequisite objective in selective breeding: accurate selection of individuals with high breeding value. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: We conducted a comparison of 10 existing regression methods and 3 new ranking methods on 6 datasets, consisting of 4 plant species and 25 traits. Our experimental results suggest that tree-based ensemble methods including McRank, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Regression Trees achieve excellent ranking accuracy. RKHS regression and RankSVM also achieve good accuracy when used with an RBF kernel. Traditional regression methods such as Bayesian lasso, wBSR and BayesC were found less suitable for ranking. Pearson correlation was found to correlate poorly with NDCG. Our study suggests two important messages. First, ranking methods are a promising research direction in GS.

For example, the cause of multiple sclerosis (MS), one of the most common neurodegenerative autoimmune diseases, is still unknown and treatment approaches are limited. In most cases, interferon-\u03b2 is an effective medication for MS Hartung et al. (2013); Sitzer and Steinmetz (2011). However, within time a large percentage of the patients treated with interferon-\u03b2 produce binding antibodies (BABs) or neutralizing antibodies (NABs) which either bind or neutralize interferon-\u03b2 and lead to therapy failure Creeke and Farrell (2013). ::: The aim of this thesis is to predict therapy response for interferon-\u03b2 therapy by analyzing patients' genotypes. The data of MS patients treated with interferon-\u03b2 as well as data on antibody development subsequent to medication and the genotype information were provided by the Neurological Department of Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Munich. We analyzed the data with a machine learning approach and discovered candidate genes that may be involved in antibody production in response to interferon-\u03b2 treatment and might lead to a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism. So far the HLA-DRB1 gene and the SNP rs9272105, localized in close proximity to the HLA-DQA1 gene on chromosome 6, have been associated with antibody production against interferon-\u03b2 Barbosa et al. (2006); Buck et al. (2011); Buck and Hemmer (2014); Hoffmann et al. (2008); Link et al. (2014); Soelberg Sorensen (2008); Weber et al. (2012). The SNPs rs4961252, localized on chromosome 8, and rs5743810, within the TLR6 gene on chromosome 4, also showed genome-wide significance, yet the latter was only the case in males whereas not in females Weber et al. (2012); Buck and Hemmer (2014); Enevold et al. (2010). ::: In this project, prediction models were created using machine learning techniques through the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). I wanted to go beyond single SNP effects and include SNP x SNP interactions in order to create a model based on candidate SNPs to predict a patient's response to medication for treatment of MS. Compared to other machine learning techniques, SVMs have the advantage of also accounting for SNP x SNP interactions. ::: In order to keep the number of SNP variants manageable for the SVM calculations, I partitioned the data in gene-wise subsets. For each gene-wise dataset, prediction models containing the SNPs that were ranked by their ability to predict antibody production were generated. These calculations resulted in a list of significant genes including the predictive features (SNPs). From these results I was able to identify the SNPs that achieved the best performance. ::: The results included HLA genes as well as the HCG23 and BTNL2 genes in close proximity on chromosome 6 to reveal significance. The SNP rs34784936, localized within the HLA region, achieved the best single SNP performance. Genome-wide, we found 78 genes with significant results based on 315 SNPs. Of those, only the most relevant 166 SNPs need to be included in the final prediction model, since at that point the performance of the pruning calculation reaches its maximum. It is important to note that only a small set of selected genotype information of an individual patient is needed to predict therapy response.

Intuitively, more aggressive treatment options should lead to improved survival rates, however, studies have shown no difference in breast cancer mortality between women treated with wide excision only versus those with excision plus radiation and treatments can be costly, lengthy and associated with side effects. To avoid over-treating women with indolent disease, while intensively treating women with aggressive disease, new molecular tools must be developed to supplement pathological information to classify DCIS lesions and predict clinical outcome. Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) pure DCIS biopsy specimens were collected from the pathology archives of the Anne Arundel Medical Center. Samples included those with poor prognosis characterized by either recurrence of DCIS or progression to invasive cancer (n=7) and those good prognosis, having \u22655-year disease-free survival (n=10). RNA was isolated after laser-microdissection of pure tumor cells and hybridized to Breast Cancer DSA\u2122 microarrays (Almac Diagnostics). S-way ANOVA was used to account for batch effects and then Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to identify candidate genes effective at discriminating good from poor prognosis DCIS. Pathway analysis was performed using MetaCore (GeneGeo). Results: 328 genes were found to be differentially expressed between good and poor prognosis specimens (P Conclusions: While studies have attempted to identify molecular profiles associated with aggressive DCIS by comparing DCIS co-occurring with invasive disease to pure DCIS, to our knowledge, this is the first study that identified a candidate molecular signature of prognosis in pure DCIS. Although many of the 70 genes found to differ between favorable and poor prognosis DCIS have not been previously associated with breast cancer or have unknown function, MEF2C and PTK2 have been implicated in invasion and migration, while ZBTB2 is a master regulator of p53 and stimulates cellular proliferation. These data demonstrate aggressive DCIS do differ from indolent DCIS at the genetic level and that these differences may be useful in developing molecular tools to classify DCIS lesions and guide appropriate treatment.

Numerous methods focused on how to estimate MVs have been proposed in the past few years. Recent studies show that those imputation algorithms made little difference in classification. Thus, some scholars believe that how to select the informative genes for downstream classification is more important than how to impute MVs. However, most feature-selection (FS) algorithms need beforehand imputation, and the impact of beforehand MV imputation on downstream FS performance is seldom considered. (2) Method: A modified chi-square test-based FS is introduced for gene-expression data. To deal with the challenge of a small sample size of gene-expression data, a heuristic method called recursive element aggregation is proposed in this study. Our approach can directly handle incomplete data without any imputation methods or missing-data assumptions. The most informative genes can be selected through a threshold. After that, the best-first search strategy is utilized to find optimal feature subsets for classification. (3) Results: We compare our method with several FS algorithms. Evaluation is performed on twelve original incomplete cancer gene-expression datasets. We demonstrate that MV imputation on an incomplete dataset impacts subsequent FS in terms of classification tasks. Through directly conducting FS on incomplete data, our method can avoid potential disturbances on subsequent FS procedures caused by MV imputation.

A K-means network maps the input data into a feature representation by finding the nearest centroid for each input point, which has attracted researchers' great attention recently due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and scalability. However, one drawback of this feature mapping is that it tends to be unreliable when the training data contains noise. To address this issue, we propose a SVDD based feature learning algorithm that describes the density and distribution of each cluster from K-means with an SVDD ball for more robust feature representation. For this purpose, we present a new SVDD algorithm called C-SVDD that centers the SVDD ball towards the mode of local density of each cluster, and we show that the objective of C-SVDD can be solved very efficiently as a linear programming problem. Additionally, traditional unsupervised feature learning methods usually take an average or sum of local representations to obtain global representation which ignore spatial relationship among them. To use spatial information we propose a global representation with a variant of SIFT descriptor. The architecture is also extended with multiple receptive field scales and multiple pooling sizes.

Given numerous component trees from the original random forests, DRFS selects and combines tree classifiers adaptively via diversity learning and sample weight learning. By designing a matrix for the data distribution creatively, a unified optimization model is formulated to learn and select diverse trees, where tree weights are learned through a convex quadratic programming problem with sample weights.

Results show that the proposed method can achieve a high correct defection rate.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/02564602.2014.892739", "venue": null, "journal": "Iete Technical Review", "mag_id": "1985766674", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211228002", "30856139", "210931105", "199012664", "114945682"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58751508"}

These systems are necessary for an organism to adapt its behavior when an important environmental event occurs. A value system constitutes a basic assumption of what is good and bad for an agent. These value systems have been effectively used in robotic systems to shape behavior. For example, many robots have used models of the dopaminergic system to reinforce behavior that leads to rewards. Other modulatory systems that shape behavior are acetylcholine's effect on attention, norepinephrine's effect on vigilance, and serotonin's effect on impulsiveness, mood, and risk. Moreover, hormonal systems such as oxytocin and its effect on trust constitute as a value system. A recent Research Topic in Frontiers of Neurorobotics explored value and reward based learning. The topic comprised of nine papers on research involving neurobiologically inspired robots whose behavior was shaped by value and reward learning, adapted through interaction with the environment, or shaped by extracting value from the environment. ::: ::: Value systems are often linked to reward systems in neurobiology and in modeling. For example, Jayet Bray and her colleagues developed a neurorobotic system that learned to categorize the valence of speech through positive verbal encouragement, much like a baby would (Jayet Bray et al., 2013). Their virtual robot, which interacted with a human partner, was controlled by a large-scale spiking neuron model of the visual cortex, premotor cortex, and reward system. An important issue in both biological and artificial reward systems is the credit assignment problem that is, how can a distal cue be linked to a reward. In other words, how can you extract the stimulus that predicts a future reward from all the noisy stimuli that you are faced with? Soltoggio and colleagues introduce the principle of rare correlations to resolve this issue (Soltosggio et al., 2013). By using Rarely Correlating Hebbian Plasticity, they demonstrated classical and operant conditioning in a set of human-robot experiments with the iCub robot. ::: ::: The notion of value and reward has often been formalized in reinforcement learning systems. For example, Li and colleagues show that reinforcement learning, in the form of a dynamic actor-critic model, can be used to tune central pattern generators in a humanoid robot (Li et al., 2013). Through interaction with the environment, this dynamical system developed biped locomotion on a NAO robot that could adapt its gaits to different conditions. Elfwing and colleagues introduced a scaled version of free-energy reinforcement learning (FERL) and applied it to visual recognition and navigation tasks (Elfwing et al., 2013). This novel algorithm was shown to be significantly better than standard FERL and feedforward neural network RL. Another related method, Linearly solvable Markov Decision Process (LMDP) has been shown to have advantages over RL in optimal control policy (Kinjo et al., 2013). Kinjo and colleagues demonstrated the power of LMDP for robot control by applying the method to a pole balancing task, and a visually guided navigation problem using their Spring Dog robot which has six degrees-of-freedom. ::: ::: Value does need not be reward-based; curiosity, harm, novelty, and uncertainty can all carry a value signal. For example, in a biomimetic model of the cortex, basal ganglia and phasic dopamine, Bolado-Gomez and colleagues (Bolado-Gomez and Gurney, 2013) showed that intrinsically motivated operant learning (i.e., action discovery) could replicate rodent experiments, in a virtual robot. In this case, phasic dopaminergic neuromodulation carried a novelty salience signal, rather than the more conventional reward signal. In a model called CURIOUSity-DRiven, Modular, Incremental Slow Feature Analysis (Curious Dr. MISFA), Luciw and colleagues showed that curiosity could shape the behavior of an iCub robot in a multi-context environment (Luciw et al., 2013). Their model was inspired by cortical regions of the brain involved in unsupervised learning, as well as neuromodulatory systems responsible for providing intrinsic rewards through dopamine and regulating levels of attention through norepinephrine. Different neuromodulatory systems in the brain may be related to different aspects of value (Krichmar, 2013). In a model of multiple neuromodulatory systems, Krichmar showed that interactions between the dopaminergic (reward), serotoninergic (harm aversion), and the cholinergic/noradrenergic (novelty) systems could lead to interesting behavioral control in an autonomous robot. Finally, in an interesting position paper, Friston, Adams, and Montague suggest that value is evidence, specifically log Bayesian evidence (Friston et al., 2012). They propose that reward or cost functions that underlie value in conventional models of optimal control can be cast as prior beliefs about future states, which is simply accumulation of evidence through Bayesian updating of posterior beliefs. ::: ::: As can be gleaned from reading the papers in the Research Topic, as well as the empirical evidence and studies they are built on, Value and Reward Based Learning is an active and broad area of research. The application to neurorobotics is important for several reasons: (1) It provides an embodied platform for testing hypotheses regarding the neural correlates of value and reward, (2) it provides a means to test more theoretical hypotheses on the acquisition of value and its function for biological and artificial systems, and (3) it may lead to the development of improved learning systems in robots and other autonomous agents.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3772325", "pubmed_id": "24062683", "doi": "10.3389/fnbot.2013.00013", "venue": "Front.

In this paper, we propose a pedestrian detection method that efficiently combines multiple local experts by means of a Random Forest ensemble.

In particular, the resulting detector operates at five frames per second using a laptop machine.

A new analysis model for evaluating the quality level of logistics management based on support vector machine theory is put forward. Through analyzing the influence factors in the logistics business process, the proposed model forecasts management efficiency of logistics operations implementation, and provide theoretical support for logistics management system optimization. Compared with the BP neural network model, the support vector machine has a more accuracy and efficiency, which is feasible for the quality evaluation of logistics management. Introduction In the development and construction of logistics information system, the existing logistics system design approach is usually based on work flow mode, which the business process designing is limited to personal management experience, the development cycle is shorter, the impact of the success of logistics and cost savings are not fully considered. These defects result in the original data can not be fully used in evaluation and forecasting of the logistics activities, and the data are wasteful [1,2]. Reverse logistics include the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient, cost effective flow of raw materials, in-process inventory, finished goods and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption for the purpose of conforming to customer requirements. Reverse logistics was attracting more and more attention in recent years. Even many firms were putting up or had put up the system already to manage their reverse logistics. These firms shared the same opinion that the reverse logistics could help them perform better with enhancing the firm\u2019s core competence. According to the literature review, researches had made many contributions in this field. The reverse logistics theory had been fully developed and the framework of the reverse logistics had been built already. The methods and the significance of managing reverse logistics had been investigated by many academicians. Many of them were centering on how to construct the reverse logistics system and operate the system efficiently. The performance evaluation of the RL management system was few discussed in the literatures at hand[3-5]. It is a big problem need to be solved that how to fully inspire the parties involved in the logistics information system, analyze the various risk factors, correctly evaluate the influence of various factors, establish the quality evaluation model of logistics system management and achieve the maximum benefit [6]. Support vector machine (SVM) can get the optimal solution under the existing information in the limited sample space [7]. Through using the appropriate kernel functions and parameters, SVM can replace the inner product algorithm in the high-dimensional feature space, which can avoid the dimensionality curse occurred in the high dimensional space inner product, and can be effectively utilized for multi-dimensional quality evaluation of logistics management [8-10]. Quality evaluation index system of logistics management In the logistics business implementation process, the main objects involves logistics enterprises and staff in each sectors. Due to the implementation of the logistics business is not done by a single person, but collaboration is done by multiple logistic personnel, so only set a post evaluation when International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (ICCSE 2015) \u00a9 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 157 considering the impact of human factors. Therefore, logistics management quality evaluation index system in the designing process contains two major factor: the logistics enterprises evaluation index system and logistics individual evaluation system, which is shown as follows: (1) Basic information: Storage quality (X1), The number of loading and unloading equipment (X2), Freight vehicle mass (X3), The average age of employees employed (X4), The proportion of college education (X5). (2) Human factors: The driver working years (X6), The number of traffic violations (X7), Traffic accident rate (X8), The number of road congestion (X9), Service attitude (X10). (3) Logistics quality: Distribution correct rate (X11), On-time delivery rate (X12), Commodity good rates (X13), Packaging intact rate (X14), Back to a single complete rate (X15). (4) Service quality: Remind inspection rate (X16), Promise to honor the rate (X17), Customer complaint rate (X18), Credit scores (X19), Service innovation rate (X20). Support vector machine SVM is a new learning method based on structural risk minimization principle of the machine, which can make full use of the limited sample learning acquisition decision function with high generalization ability.

With the exact same experiment environment, activated brain regions of each subjects are totally different. In that case, a simple approach is to use as many channels as possible when measuring brain signals. However the problem is that using many channels also causes other problems. When applying a CSP (Common Spatial Pattern), which is an EEG extraction method, many channels cause an overfitting problem, and in addition there is difficulty using this technique for medical analysis.

The rapid classification of the varieties of walnut powder is important to protect the consumers against potential fraud, since different varieties of walnut powder vary dramatically in quality, taste and sale price. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a promising technology for on-line application, which is no or little sample preparation, fast analysis speed (usually seconds to minutes), remote detection available. In this study, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy and multi-variable analysis methods were applied to classify varieties of walnut powder for the first time. Before LIBS analysis, a fairly flat surface was provided to reduce fluctuation, and no other sample preparation was needed. After acquiring the LIBS spectra, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to make qualitative discrimination, and classification models were developed with Partial Least Squares Discrimination Analysis (PLS-DA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Three origins and different varieties from same origin were discriminated by LIBS. It was shown that origins as well as different varieties from the same origin could be differentiated successfully by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy and chemometrics. Support vector machines can help to handle complex LIBS dataset, which improved the classified rate of model.

However, such projections are often subjected to large uncertainties which make implementation of climate change strategies on water resources system a challenging job. Major uncertainty sources are General Circulation models (GCMs), post-processing and climate heterogeneity based on catchment characteristics (e.g. scares data and high-altitude). Here we presents the comparisons between different GCMs, statistical downscaling and bias correction approaches and finally climate projections, with the integration of gridded and converted (monthly to daily) data for a high-altitude, scarcely-gauged Jhelum River basin, Pakistan. Current study relies on climate projections obtained from factorial combination of 5-GCMs, 2 statistical downscaling and 2 bias correction methods. In addition, we applied bias corrected APHRODITE, converted daily data using MODAWEC model and observed data. Further, five GCMs (CGCM3, HadCM3, CCSM3, ECHAM5 and CSIRO-MK3.5) were tested to scrutinize two suitable GCMs integrated with Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) and Smooth Support Vector Machine (SSVM). Results illustrate that the CGCM3 and HadCM3 were suitable GCMs for selected study basin. Both downscaling techniques are able to simulate precipitation, however, SSVM performed slightly better than SDSM. We found that the integration of CGCM3 with SSVM (SSVM-CGCM3) generates precipitation and temperature better than the CGCM3 (SDSM-CGCM3) and HadCM3 (SDSM-HadCM3) with SDSM. Furthermore, the low elevation stations were influenced by monsoon, significantly prone to rise in precipitation and temperature, while high-altitude stations were influenced by westerlies circulations, less prone to climate change.

ML photo-z solutions have traditionally ignored the morphological information available in galaxy images or partly included it in the form of hand-crafted features, with mixed results. We train a morphology-aware photometric redshift machine using modern deep learning tools. It uses a custom architecture that jointly trains on galaxy fluxes, colors and images. Galaxy-integrated quantities are fed to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) branch while images are fed to a convolutional (convnet) branch that can learn relevant morphological features. This split MLP-convnet architecture, which aims to disentangle strong photometric features from comparatively weak morphological ones, proves important for strong performance: a regular convnet-only architecture, while exposed to all available photometric information in images, delivers comparatively poor performance. We present a cross-validated MLP-convnet model trained on 130,000 SDSS-DR12 galaxies that outperforms a hyperoptimized Gradient Boosting solution (hyperopt+XGBoost), as well as the equivalent MLP-only architecture, on the redshift bias metric.

The high sequence homology of plant miRNAs to their targets has been the mainstay of miRNA prediction algorithms, which are limited in their predictive power for other kingdoms because miRNA complementarity is less conserved yet transitive processes (production of antisense smRNAs) are active in eukaryotes. We hypothesize that antisense transcription and associated smRNAs are biomarkers which can be computationally modeled for gene discovery. ::: Principal Findings ::: We explored rice (Oryza sativa) sense and antisense gene expression in publicly available whole genome tiling array transcriptome data and sequenced smRNA libraries (as well as C. elegans) and found evidence of transitivity of MIRNA genes similar to that found in Arabidopsis. Statistical analysis of antisense transcript abundances, presence of antisense ESTs, and association with smRNAs suggests several hundred Arabidopsis \u2018orphan\u2019 hypothetical genes are non-coding RNAs. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found novel Arabidopsis homologues of some MIRNA genes on the antisense strand of previously annotated protein-coding genes. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied using thermodynamic energy of binding plus novel expression features of sense/antisense transcription topology and siRNA abundances to build a prediction model of miRNA targets.

Agricultural areas undergo dynamic changes throughout the year, which manifest varying radar backscatter due to crop phenology. Certain crops can show similar backscatter if their phenology intersects, but vary later when their phenology differs. Hence, classification techniques based on single-date remote sensing images may not offer optimal results for crops with similar phenology. Moreover, methods that stack images within a cropping season as composite bands for classification limit discrimination to one feature space vector, which can suffer from overlapping classes. Nonetheless, phenology can aid classification of crops, because their backscatter varies with time. This paper fills this gap by introducing a crop sequence-based ensemble classification method where expert knowledge and TerraSAR-X multitemporal image-based phenological information are explored. We designed first-order and higher order dynamic conditional random fields (DCRFs) including an ensemble technique. The DCRF models have a duplicated structure of temporally connected CRFs, which encode image-based phenology and expert-based phenology knowledge during classification. On the other hand, our ensemble generates an optimal map based on class posterior probabilities estimated by DCRFs. These techniques improved crop delineation at each epoch, with higher order DCRFs (HDCRFs) giving the best accuracy. The ensemble method was evaluated against the conventional technique of stacking multitemporal images as composite bands for classification using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and CRFs. It surpassed MLC and CRFs based on class posterior probabilities estimated by both first-order DCRFs and HDCRFs.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2017.2695326", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2612420228", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["39113503", "15128952", "89141", "129585373", "4666060", "4346486", "18635151", "107686064", "120489597", "37012877", "9779450", "16011771", "122598442", "135002936", "20343384", "18224047", "8789703", "25352834", "19604418", "122568152", "132108692", "120524400", "14160628", "63184390", "1991617", "14638730", "207251944", "277918", "27474336", "13375632", "42670095", "129329221", "6546667", "16236757", "14584597", "38895408", "6337400", "14334697", "31824234", "16462148", "22311998", "46060724", "61503518", "25842396", "242941", "11259833", "8705996", "6190348", "53072420", "53329924", "128814357", "6038991", "59702528", "13666676", "6934721", "25085630", "4131026", "15317173", "15673091", "8813867", "11098988", "206688291"], "inbound_citations": ["59231002", "171095217", "53232961", "202899497", "52110678", "198907300", "52234465", "104293450", "61154005", "61811205", "26028896", "135049319"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28436772"}

The predominant anomaly due to the blood flow dynamics leads to the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias in the cardiac system. In this work, estimation of cardiac output (CO) parameter using blood flow rate analysis is carried out, which is a vital parameter to identify the subjects with left- ventricular arrhythmias (LVA). In particular, LVA is a resultant component of characteristic changes in blood rheology (blood flow rate). The CO is an intrinsic parameter derived from the stroke volume (SV) characterized by end-diastolic/systolic volumes (EDV/ESV) and heart rate. The pumping of blood from left ventricle (LV) reconciles in to R-R intervals depicted on ECG, which are used for heart rate estimation. The deviation from the nominal values of CO implies that, the subject is more prone to LVA. Further, the identification of subjects with LVA is accomplished by computing the features from the ECG signals. The proposed Feature Ranking Score (FRS) algorithm employs different statistical parameters to label the score of the extracted features.

The paper uses CI-310 portable photosynthesis measurement system made by American CID Company and measures the net photosynthetic rate of a group of soybean plant. M_D and C_D are normalized by the normalization method [0,1]. Then, the normalization data M_D1 and C_D1 are gained . Based on the different test time, M_D1 is divided of M_D11 and M_D12. C_D1 is divided of C_D11 and C_D12.

Based on the formula epsilon-SVR and the formula nu-SVR with Support Vector Machine, the paper constructs the prediction model on the net photosynthetic rate of a group of soybean plant by using of the cross combination with four kernel functions, three optimization methods and two formulas. The test results are as follows: in the condition of S=17 m2 which is the test plan area of soybean plant and the H=2 m which is the high on MSR-16 portable multispectral radiometer above the canopy of soybean plant, the prediction accuracy is up to 85% on the No.1 prediction set C_D12 and the prediction accuracy is up to 82% on the No.2 prediction set C_D12 based on the model epsilon-SVR-bio-selfadaption-grid-search.

There exist a handful of research work that focus on feature extraction to obtain gender specific information from facial images. However, analyzing different facial regions and their fusion help in deciding the gender of a person from facial images. In this paper, we propose a new approach to identify gender from frontal facial images that is robust to background, illumination, intensity, and facial expression. In our framework, first the frontal face image is divided into a number of distinct regions based on facial landmark points that are obtained by the Chehra model proposed by Asthana et al. The model provides 49 facial landmark points covering different regions of the face, e.g. forehead, left eye, right eye, lips. Next, a face image is segmented into facial regions using landmark points and features are extracted from each region. The Compass LBP feature, a variant of LBP feature, has been used in our framework to obtain discriminative gender-specific information. Following this, a Support Vector Machine based classifier has been used to compute the probability scores from each facial region. Finally, the classification scores obtained from individual regions are combined with a genetic algorithm based learning to improve the overall classification accuracy. The experiments have been performed on popular face image datasets such as Adience, cFERET (color FERET), LFW and two sketch datasets, namely CUFS and CUFSF.

Experimental results show that SMOTE doesn't increase predictive performance. In addition, the results show that the application of ensemble learning has brought a significant improvement for individual base learners in terms of three performance indicators i.e., AUC, sensitivity, and specificity.

The sensing mechanisms used in occupancy estimation such as cameras and wearable sensors are generally intrusive and expensive. Alternatively, the effect that occupants have on environmental parameters such as CO 2 , temperature, humidity and pressure can be utilized to extract information about the occupancy levels. Environmental sensors are relatively inexpensive and are non-intrusive. From these sensor data, we need to extract and select relevant features that may yield occupancy information. The filter model feature selection approach used in previous works compromises on the classification accuracy in order to limit the computational burden. An alternative is the wrapper model of feature selection, which uses the inference algorithm itself to search for the best features. It guarantees better classification accuracy but is computationally expensive, especially with slow iterative machine learning techniques such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) used in previous works. To address this problem, this work capitalizes on the fast learning speed of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to implement a wrapper model of feature selection.

Machine learning methods such as Random Forests may help identify system characteristics with the potential to affect flight safety from the large number of candidate predictors that results when multiple system levels are considered simultaneously.METHODS: There were 54 pilot-related and occupational candidate predictors of simulator flight performance in 2 malfunction scenarios completed by 51 male European helicopter emergency medical services pilots derived from pilots' self-report questionnaires and aeromedical examination records. In a cross-sectional explorative analysis, the Random Forest method was used to screen for informative predictors. Predictors scoring above the critical threshold for the conditional permutation variable importance (VI) statistic were selected.RESULTS: In five predictors, the VI statistic averaged across 2000 Random Forest runs exceeded the selection threshold: higher perceived rewards (VI = 0.0691) and predictability (VI = 0.0501) at work were associated with higher performance scores, and higher physiological dysregulation (VI = 0.0495) and alanine aminotransferase (VI = 0.0224) with lower scores. Performance also differed between the simulators at the two training sites (VI = 0.0298).DISCUSSION: Random Forests may usefully complement previously applied methods for the identification of human factors safety hazards.

The induction and refinement of structural knowledge is not new in Machine Learning. Recently, in Inductive Logic Programming, attempts have been made to extend the classic relational learning techniques toward hybrid representations [5]. In order to cope with the problem complexity, former methods are based on a heuristic search and generally implement bottom-up algorithms, such as the least common subsumer (lcs) [3], that tend to induce overly specific definitions which may suffer for poor predictiveness (overfitting). Hence, in some approaches maximal generalizations are preferred [4]. Moreover, like the least general generalizations for clausal representations, lcs\u2019s sizes tend to increase exponentially. Other approaches have shown that also a top-down search is feasible [2], yet the refinement is less operational: it is intended to show the properties of the related search space rather than specifying how to exploit the heuristics based on the assertions in the A-box.

Although research in Machine Translation dates back to the 1950\u201fs, the area still has many problems. One of the main problems is that of lexical ambiguity, that is, the need for lexical choice when translating a source language word that has several translation options in the target language. This problem is even more complex when only sense variations are found in the translation options, a problem named \u201csense ambiguity\u201d.

The goal of this PhD work is the proposal and development of a novel approach for word sense disambiguation which is specifically designed for machine translation, follows a hybrid methodology (knowledge and corpus-based), and employs a relational formalism to represent various kinds of knowledge sources and disambiguation examples, by using Inductive Logic Programming.

The first stage of processing involves color-segmentation in the HSV space by using Neural Networks and RUS-Boosted Decision Trees. The latter is used to alleviate the effects of class-imbalance between the pixels belonging to the AFB and the background.

Experimental results with small samples show that random aggregating, implemented through subsampled bagging, reduces the variance component of the error by about 90%, while bagging, as expected, achieves a lower reduction. Bias\u2013variance analysis explains also why ensemble methods based on subsampling techniques can be successfully applied to large data mining problems.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-25966-4_26", "venue": "Multiple Classifier Systems", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1580876721", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["7879207", "10433837", "16538236", "18456775"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33463232"}

But this is becoming increasingly difficult with the growing numbers of published articles. There is a clear need for better tools to improve clinician's ability to search the primary literature. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the most reliable source of evidence documenting the efficacy of treatment options. This paper describes the retrieval of key sentences from abstracts of RCTs as a step towards helping users find relevant facts about the experimental design of clinical studies.MethodUsing Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), a popular and successful method for natural language processing problems, sentences referring to Intervention, Participants and Outcome Measures are automatically categorized. This is done by extending a previous approach for labeling sentences in an abstract for general categories associated with scientific argumentation or rhetorical roles: Aim, Method, Results and Conclusion. Methods are tested on several corpora of RCT abstracts. First structured abstracts with headings specifically indicating Intervention, Participant and Outcome Measures are used. Also a manually annotated corpus of structured and unstructured abstracts is prepared for testing a classifier that identifies sentences belonging to each category.ResultsUsing CRFs, sentences can be labeled for the four rhetorical roles with F-scores from 0.93\u20130.98. This outperforms the use of Support Vector Machines. Furthermore, sentences can be automatically labeled for Intervention, Participant and Outcome Measures, in unstructured and structured abstracts where the section headings do not specifically indicate these three topics. F-scores of up to 0.83 and 0.84 are obtained for Intervention and Outcome Measure sentences.ConclusionResults indicate that some of the methodological elements of RCTs are identifiable at the sentence level in both structured and unstructured abstract reports. This is promising in that sentences labeled automatically could potentially form concise summaries, assist in information retrieval and finer-grained extraction.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2657779", "pubmed_id": "19208256", "doi": "10.1186/1472-6947-9-10", "venue": "BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "journal": "BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2035682999", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["42887897", "33996914", "40512040", "23592841", "25398395", "10976937", "22178141", "60709701", "16991652", "210363", "1500891", "13537797", "7047204", "12153428", "41897214", "65485", "16821134", "6162105", "32595527", "10038417", "3562975", "3594252", "12943282", "277918", "11473206", "9483510", "59921147", "194951", "206592413"], "inbound_citations": ["15932276", "10567910", "18397509", "14021373", "15051994", "17460271", "3725148", "1641530", "477778", "14504930", "19034856", "21633237", "2320744", "2380553", "14247934", "9341862", "59222793", "1449745", "54448151", "16484295", "214912556", "209852179", "7249218", "12803314", "14347466", "1420939", "14094659", "208639707", "32099780", "15982310", "198489096", "12341031", "13339227", "86833974", "6871571", "53112813", "1182891", "14965114", "15920850", "10886046", "11231869", "127994835", "32231516", "6105163", "28455311"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1751478"}

Feature learning is important to deep multi-task learning for sharing common information among tasks. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) to learn augmented features for deep multi-task learning. The HGNN consists of two-level graph neural networks. In the low level, an intra-task graph neural network is responsible of learning a powerful representation for each data point in a task by aggregating its neighbors. Based on the learned representation, a task embedding can be generated for each task in a similar way to max pooling. In the second level, an inter-task graph neural network updates task embeddings of all the tasks based on the attention mechanism to model task relations. Then the task embedding of one task is used to augment the feature representation of data points in this task. Moreover, for classification tasks, an inter-class graph neural network is introduced to conduct similar operations on a finer granularity, i.e., the class level, to generate class embeddings for each class in all the tasks use class embeddings to augment the feature representation. The proposed feature augmentation strategy can be used in many deep multi-task learning models. we analyze the HGNN in terms of training and generalization losses.

They play a vital role in the gene expression of transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. However, abnormality of their expression has been observed in cancer, heart diseases and nervous system disorders. Therefore for basic research and microRNA based therapy, it is imperative to separate real pre-miRNAs from false ones (hairpin sequences similar to pre-miRNA stem loops). Different conservation and machine learning methods have been applied for the identification of miRNAs. However, machine learning algorithms have gained more popularity than conservative based algorithms in terms of sensitivity and overall performance. Due to the avalanche of RNA sequences discovered in a post-genomic age, it is necessary to construct a predictor for the identification of pre-microRNAs in humans. We have developed a predictor called MicroR-Pred in which the RNA sequences are formulated by a hybrid feature vector. The novelty of the new predictor is in the use of the partial least squares technique followed by the Random Forest and SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithms for dimension reduction and classification. The performance of the MicroR-Pred model is quite promising compared to other state-of-the-art miRNA predictors. It has achieved 88.40% and 93.90% accuracies for RF and SVM.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28686281", "doi": "10.1039/c7mb00115k", "venue": "Molecular bioSystems", "journal": "Molecular bioSystems", "mag_id": "2626965194", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["90351559", "215167398", "57189714"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4816580"}

These methods can be used to infer cognitive states, so-called brain decoding. Using such approaches, it is possible to predict the mental state of a subject or a stimulus class by analyzing the spatial distribution of neural responses. In addition it is possible to identify the regions of the brain containing the information that underlies the classification. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most popular methods used to carry out this type of analysis. The aim of the current study is the evaluation of SVM and Maximum uncertainty Linear Discrimination Analysis (MLDA) in extracting the voxels containing discriminative information for the prediction of mental states. The comparison has been carried out using fMRI data from 41 healthy control subjects who participated in two experiments, one involving visual\u2013auditory stimulation and the other based on bi-manual fingertapping sequences. The results suggest that MLDA uses significantly more voxels containing discriminative information (related to different experimental conditions) to classify the data. On the other hand, SVM is more parsimonious and uses less voxels to achieve similar classification accuracies. In conclusion, MLDA is mostly focused on extracting all discriminative information available, while SVM extracts the information which is sufficient for classification.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "19457392", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.01.032", "venue": "NeuroImage", "journal": "NeuroImage", "mag_id": "2056734048", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["4404168", "17922015", "1204673", "561574", "6840802", "16272670", "31347374", "17915973", "4001502", "13958809", "7879207", "1096968", "14551969", "4944746", "18358305", "7328589", "9451707", "199006410", "11528638", "59340463", "214726991", "16845784", "255389", "3898447", "215387423", "12639927", "11816182"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27574611"}

The modeling of real-world time series is a particularly difficult task because they are generally composed of linear and nonlinear patterns that are combined in some form. Several hybrid systems that combine linear and nonlinear techniques have obtained relevant results in terms of accuracy in comparison with single models. However, the best combination function of the forecasting of the linear and nonlinear patterns is unknown, which makes this modeling an open question. This work proposes a hybrid system that searches for a suitable function to combine the forecasts of linear and nonlinear models. Thus, the proposed system performs: (i) linear modeling of the time series; (ii) nonlinear modeling of the error series; and (iii) a data-driven combination that searches for: (iii.a) the most suitable function, between linear and nonlinear formalisms, and (iii.b) the number of forecasts of models (i) and (ii) that maximizes the performance of the combination. Two versions of the hybrid system are evaluated.

We estimated three types of models based on: (1) all regional brain volumes, (2) the 18 top factors or (3) the 36 complete factors. We used Scikit-Learn\u2019s grid search method to search the hyperparameter spaces of eight different machine learning algorithms. The best model, a Nu support vector regression model (NuSVR) using 36 factor scores as features, yielded the highest validation score (R2 = 0.048) and a relatively low training score (0.22), the latter of which was important for reducing the degree of over-fitting. The mean squared errors (MSEs) for the training and validation samples were 68.2 and 68.6, respectively; the correlation coefficients were 0.54 and 0.21 (p < 0.0001 for both). The final MSE for the test set was 95.63. Learning curve analysis suggests that the current training sample size is still too small; increasing sample size should improve predictive accuracy. Overall, our results suggest that, given a large enough sample, machine learning methods with structural MRI data may be able to accurately estimate fluid intelligence.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-31901-4_11", "venue": "ABCD-NP@MICCAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2979307356", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204027892"}

Failure to do so can be very costly, not only in terms of market share lost, but also in the investment made to develop a product. Given that traditional product development methods are very slow, and cannot fulfill today's needs, a methodology is presented here to efficiently design new product formulations based on a combination of experimental designs, neural networks and optimization techniques. The methodology is applied on a case study that involves disinfectants' formulations. The framework takes advantage of all previous experiments for the next product formulation design, and archives experimental results of the existing project and uses them to retrain a model for future projects.

A realistic implementation of this approach requires a parallel computing architecture which consists of a hierarchy of functionally different nodes.

This systematic analysis provides strong evidence to guide future research in machine learning applied to real-time analysis of brain states using EEGs. The main goal of this research is to understand how the construction of data sets used in training models affects the accuracy of prominent machine learning algorithms, specifically: Random Forest, Boosting, Naive Bayesian Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Herein, we present a systematic method (N = 153) to test the accuracy of prominent machine learning algorithms when varying three main components of the training data set: the permutations of subjects, the number of unique data sets used to generate the training data set, and the number of samples in each training data set. Our results strongly indicate that Random Forest consistently yields superior results when analyzing EEG data compared to other prominent machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, a pilot investigation was conducted on a mean-normalized feature for EEG data analysis.

Although many designs are proposed, they seem to ignore the negative influence of domain-specific characteristics in transferring process. Besides, they also tend to obliterate these characteristics when extracted, although they are useful for other tasks and somehow help preserve the data. Take into account these issues, in this paper, we want to design a novel domain-adaptation architecture which disentangles learned features into multiple parts to answer the questions: what features to transfer across domains and what to preserve within domains for other tasks. Towards this, besides jointly matching domain distributions in both image-level and feature-level, we offer new idea on feature exchange across domains combining with a novel feed-back loss and a semantic consistency loss to not only enhance the transfer-ability of learned common feature but also preserve data and semantic information during exchange process. By performing domain adaptation on two standard digit data sets, we show that our architecture can solve not only the full transfer problem but also partial transfer problem efficiently. The translated image results also demonstrate the potential of our architecture in image style transfer application.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "mag_id": "2780339608", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196125388"}

When we consider existing protocols, however, many of these were not subjected to formal analysis during their design, and many are not implemented in a manner consistent with their formal documentation. Determining a grammar for such protocols is the first step in analyzing them, which places this problem in the domain of grammatical inference, for which a deep theoretical literature exists.

Whitened Principal Component Analysis (WPCA) is further utilized to reduce the feature dimension, which leads to our Spatial Face Region Descriptor (SFRD) (resp.

Remote sensing technology is of significant advantages for monitoring and analysing ecological environment. By using of automatic extraction algorithm, various environmental resources information of tourist region can be obtained from remote sensing imagery. Combining with GIS spatial analysis and landscape pattern analysis, relevant environmental information can be quantitatively analysed and interpreted. In this study, taking the Chaohu Lake Basin as an example, Landsat-8 multi-spectral satellite image of October 2015 was applied. Integrated the automatic ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) classification results with the data of digital elevation model and slope information, human disturbance degree, land use degree, primary productivity, landscape evenness , vegetation coverage, DEM, slope and normalized water body index were used as the evaluation factors to construct the eco-sensitivity evaluation index based on AHP and overlay analysis. According to the value of eco-sensitivity evaluation index, by using of GIS technique of equal interval reclassification, the Chaohu Lake area was divided into four grades: very sensitive area, sensitive area, sub-sensitive areas and insensitive areas. The results of the eco-sensitivity analysis shows: the area of the very sensitive area was 4577.4378 km 2 , accounting for about 37.12 %, the sensitive area was 5130.0522 km 2 , accounting for about 37.12 %; the area of sub-sensitive area was 3729.9312 km 2 , accounting for 26.99 %; the area of insensitive area was 382.4399 km 2 , accounting for about 2.77 %. At the same time, it has been found that there were spatial differences in ecological sensitivity of the Chaohu Lake basin. The most sensitive areas were mainly located in the areas with high elevation and large terrain gradient. Insensitive areas were mainly distributed in slope of the slow platform area; the sensitive areas and the sub-sensitive areas were mainly agricultural land and woodland. Through the eco-sensitivity analysis of the study area, the automatic recognition and analysis techniques for remote sensing imagery are integrated into the ecological analysis and ecological regional planning, which can provide a reliable scientific basis for rational planning and regional sustainable development of the Chaohu Lake tourist area.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-3-1015-2018", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "mag_id": "2802464253", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135261322"}

By using shorter time series, systems similar to [1] will be able to handle the data faster and efficiently hence real time publishing of wave conditions can be achieved. The classification model for the wave conditions are trained using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) because it promises to provide a suitable model for nonlinear classification.

The ramp loss allows a maximum error of 2 for each training observation, while the hard margin loss calculates error by counting the number of training observations that are in the margin or misclassified outside of the margin. SVM with these loss functions is shown to be a consistent estimator when used with certain kernel functions. In computational studies with simulated and real-world data, SVM with the robust loss functions ignores outlier observations effectively, providing an advantage over SVM with the traditional hinge loss when using the linear kernel. Despite the fact that training SVM with the robust loss functions requires the solution of a quadratic mixed-integer program (QMIP) and is NP-hard, while traditional SVM requires only the solution of a continuous quadratic program (QP), we are able to find good solutions and prove optimality for instances with up to 500 observations.

RL-based recommender systems have two key advantages: (i) they can continuously update their recommendation strategies according to users' real-time feedback, and (ii) the optimal strategy maximizes the long-term reward from users, such as the total revenue of a recommendation session. However, directly training and evaluating a new RL-based recommendation algorithm needs to collect users' real-time feedback in the real system, which is time and efforts consuming and could negatively impact on users' experiences. Thus, it calls for a user simulator that can mimic real users' behaviors where we can pre-train and evaluate new recommendation algorithms. Simulating users' behaviors in a dynamic system faces immense challenges -- (i) the underlining item distribution is complex, and (ii) historical logs for each user are limited. In this paper, we develop a user simulator base on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). To be specific, we design the generator to capture the underlining distribution of users' historical logs and generate realistic logs that can be considered as augmentations of real logs; while the discriminator is developed to not only distinguish real and fake logs but also predict users' behaviors.

The main task of the paper is to attribute an employment status to individuals that did not fully report entrepreneur status in earlier censuses (1851\u20131881). The paper assesses the accuracy of different classifiers and machine learning algorithms, including Deep Learning, for this classification problem. We first adopt a ground-truth dataset from the later censuses to train the computer with a Logistic Regression (which is standard in the literature for this kind of binary classification) to recognize entrepreneurs distinct from non-entrepreneurs (i.e. workers). Our initial accuracy for this base-line method is 0.74. We compare the Logistic Regression with ten optimized machine learning algorithms: Nearest Neighbors, Linear and Radial Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Process, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. The best results are boosting and ensemble methods. AdaBoost achieves an accuracy of 0.95. Deep-Learning, as a standalone category of algorithms, further improves accuracy to 0.96 without using the rich text-data that characterizes the OccString feature, a string of up to 500 characters with the full occupational statement of each individual collected in the earlier censuses. Finally, and now using this OccString feature, we implement both shallow (bag-of-words algorithm) learning and Deep Learning (Recurrent Neural Network with a Long Short-Term Memory layer) algorithms. These methods all achieve accuracies above 0.99 with Deep Learning Recurrent Neural Network as the best model with an accuracy of 0.9978. The results show that standard algorithms for classification can be outperformed by machine learning algorithms.

SVM has used as a supervised learning machine that analyses data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression analysis whereas the noticeable problem may be stated for big dimensional data which decreases performance of SVM. So the new model has used a feature selection method based on Genetic with an innovation in fitness function which is formed from True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR) and the number of selected features. The new fitness function reduced the dimension of the data, increased true positive detection and simultaneously decreased false positive detection. In addition, the computation time for training will also have a remarkable reduction. Results show that the proposed method can reach high accuracy and low false positive rate (FPR) simultaneously, though it had earlier been achieved in earlier studies separately. This study proposes a method which can achieve more stable features in comparison with other techniques. The proposed model experiment and test on KDD CUP 99 and UNSW-NB15 datasets.

It can provide the retrieval results with various types of media at the same time by submitting a query of any media type. In cross-media retrieval research, feature learning for different media types is a key challenge. In the existing graph-based methods, the similarity matrix denoting the affinities of data is usually constant matrix. Actually, calculating the similarity matrix based on the distances between the instances can more accurately represent the relevance of multimedia data. Furthermore, the dimensions of the original features are usually very high, which affects the computational time of algorithms. To address the above problems, we propose a novel feature learning algorithm for cross-media data, called cross-media feature learning frame-work with semi-supervised graph regularization (FLGR). FLGR calculates the similarity matrix based on the distances between the projected instances, which can not only accurately protect the relevance of multimedia data, but also effectively reduce the computational time of the algorithm. It explores the sparse and semi-supervised regularization for different media types, and integrates them into a unified optimization problem, which boosts the performance of the algorithm. Furthermore, FLGR studies the semantic information of the original data and further improve the retrieval accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a sampling-based approximate approach for scaling SAIL algorithm to deal with the large-scale of texts. Particularly, an instance-level random sampling is invoked to reduce the number of instances to be examined during each iteration, which substantially speeds up the clustering on big text data.

This is harder than standard instance mining due to differences in the artistic media (oil, pastel, drawing, etc), and imperfections inherent in the copying process. Our key technical insight is to adapt a standard deep feature to this task by fine-tuning it on the specific art collection using self-supervised learning. More specifically, spatial consistency between neighbouring feature matches is used as supervisory fine-tuning signal. The adapted feature leads to more accurate style invariant matching, and can be used with a standard discovery approach, based on geometric verification, to identify duplicate patterns in the dataset. The approach is evaluated on several different datasets and shows surprisingly good qualitative discovery results. For quantitative evaluation of the method, we annotated 273 near duplicate details in a dataset of 1587 artworks attributed to Jan Brueghel and his workshop.

Objective: To develop a content and sentiment analysis of tobacco-related Twitter posts and build machine learning classifiers to detect tobacco-relevant posts and sentiment towards tobacco, with a particular focus on new and emerging products like hookah and electronic cigarettes. Methods: We collected 7362 tobacco-related Twitter posts at 15-day intervals from December 2011 to July 2012. Each tweet was manually classified using a triaxial scheme, capturing genre, theme, and sentiment. Using the collected data, machine-learning classifiers were trained to detect tobacco-related vs irrelevant tweets as well as positive vs negative sentiment, using Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Finally, phi contingency coefficients were computed between each of the categories to discover emergent patterns. Results: The most prevalent genres were first- and second-hand experience and opinion, and the most frequent themes were hookah, cessation, and pleasure. Sentiment toward tobacco was overall more positive (1939/4215, 46% of tweets) than negative (1349/4215, 32%) or neutral among tweets mentioning it, even excluding the 9% of tweets categorized as marketing. Three separate metrics converged to support an emergent distinction between, on one hand, hookah and electronic cigarettes corresponding to positive sentiment, and on the other hand, traditional tobacco products and more general references corresponding to negative sentiment. These metrics included correlations between categories in the annotation scheme (phi hookah-positive =0.39; phi e-cigs-positive =0.19); correlations between search keywords and sentiment (\u03c7 2 4 =414.50, P <.001, Cramer\u2019s V =0.36), and the most discriminating unigram features for positive and negative sentiment ranked by log odds ratio in the machine learning component of the study. In the automated classification tasks, SVMs using a relatively small number of unigram features (500) achieved best performance in discriminating tobacco-related from unrelated tweets ( F score=0.85). Conclusions: Novel insights available through Twitter for tobacco surveillance are attested through the high prevalence of positive sentiment. This positive sentiment is correlated in complex ways with social image, personal experience, and recently popular products such as hookah and electronic cigarettes. Several apparent perceptual disconnects between these products and their health effects suggest opportunities for tobacco control education. Finally, machine classification of tobacco-related posts shows a promising edge over strictly keyword-based approaches, yielding an improved signal-to-noise ratio in Twitter data and paving the way for automated tobacco surveillance applications.

Several UCI datasets have been used to evaluate the performance of EABC-SVM and the experimental results show that this approach has better classification accuracy and convergence performance than the ABC-SVM and other ABC variants-based SVM. Furthermore, the EABC-SVM can achieve a significant detection accuracy of 95% and reduce the amount of features about 65% in the conveyor belt fault detection.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2015/638926", "venue": null, "journal": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2168685736", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["109196903", "36092935", "122154361", "10879945", "11462943", "10745913", "104263", "121723107", "15659009", "20500547", "1202264", "53955671", "3330504", "55438735", "59434352", "10242452", "30431243", "206794197", "8215393", "205699912", "18955626", "52874011", "11225382", "207103912", "961425", "209099422", "122925634", "40660392"], "inbound_citations": ["127509285", "210931997", "26210180", "52084071"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54800293"}

In this paper, Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel (KSVM) and the spectral angle mapper (SAM) are used for performance comparison in terms of classification accuracy in Hyperspectral image classification. Kernel support vector machine is more preferable for the mastery to generalize better hyperplane when limited availability of training samples and separate the classes competently in a new dimension feature space.

In the present paper, the authors considered 4 heavy rainfall events that affected the area in 2009\u20132011.

Event landslides occurrences permitted to build four event-specific RFc training sets, considering a large number of predictors reliable to characterize landslide susceptibility. Furthermore, the analysis took into account some relevant meteorological variables directly linked to the events themselves. An exploratory evaluation of the skills of a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model was conducted, to give a reliable supply to the RFc framework by using its weather forecast.

In this competition, we participated and submitted the results in the RTE-6 Main Task (3 runs), Novelty Task (3 runs) and RTE-6 KBP task (3 runs for generic task and 3 runs for tailored task). For the Main and the Novelty Tasks, the corpus was a collection of news wire documents from various sources and arranged into particular topics, a hypothesis H and a set of \"candidate\" sentences retrieved by Lucene from that corpus for the hypothesis H. Each sentence in the set of documents associated with a given topic was involved in an entailment relationship with each hypothesis for the topic. RTE systems are required to identify all the sentences that entail H among the candidate sentences. For the Main and the Novelty Tasks, the system is based on the composition of lexical entailment module, lexical distance module, Chunk module, Named Entity module and syntactic text entailment (TE) module. Our TE system is based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) that uses twenty five features for lexical similarity, the output tag from a rule based syntactic two-way TE system as a feature and the outputs from a rule based Chunk Module and Named Entity Module as the other features. For the Main task test set, the following micro-average results were obtained for Run 1: F-Score 34.79, Run 2: F-Score 26.78 and Run 3 : F-score 31.19. For the novelty task test set, the following micro-average results were obtained for Run 1: Novelty Evaluation FScore 81.77 and Justification Evaluation F-Score 34.35, Run 2: Novelty Evaluation F-Score 78.18 and Justification Evaluation 26.87 and Run 3: Novelty Evaluation F-score 78.69 and Justification Evaluation 24.57 were obtained. The KBP Slot Filling task is focused on the searching a collection of news wire and Web documents and extracting values for a predefined set of attributes (\u201cslots\u201d) for the target entities.

Remote Sensing meets this demand, as it provides periodic and spatially continuous data on forest status. In this context, MySustainableForest (MSF) H2020 project aims at providing remote sensing-based geo-information services through a web service platform. One of MSF products is a classification of main forest types, whose preliminary development was tested over a 950 km2 area located in Northern Spain. A Random Forest model was trained with data delineated with the help of local forest data. The output was validated using stratified k-fold cross-validation. Validation metrics were computed from the confusion matrix for each class separately and for the total set of classes. Although overall metrics were high (OA = 95%; DC = 85.1%), they varied significantly for different classes (e.g., Fagus sylvatica was classified with higher accuracy than Pinus nigra, which was mainly confused with other Pinus species), showing that species with higher seasonal variations were easier to identify.

Since most individual loci contribute little to complex trait variations, it remains a challenge for traditional statistical methods to identify minor QTLs with subtle phenotypic effects. Here we applied a new framework which combined the GWAS analysis and machine learning feature selection to explore new ways for the study of minor QTLs mining. Results We studied the soybean branching trait with the 2,137 accessions from soybean (Glycine max) diversity panel, which was sequenced by 50k SNP chips with 42,080 valid SNPs. First as a baseline study, we conducted the GWAS GAPIT analysis, and we found that only one SNP marker significantly associated with soybean branching was identified. We then combined the GWAS analysis and feature importance analysis with Random Forest score analysis and permutation analysis. Our analysis results showed that there are 36,077 features (SNPs) identified by Random Forest score analysis, and 2,098 features (SNPs) identified by permutation analysis. In total, there are 1,770 features (SNPs) confirmed by both of the Random Forest score analysis and the permutation analysis. Based on our analysis, 328 branching development related genes were identified. A further analysis on GO (gene ontology) term enrichment were applied on these 328 genes. And the gene location and gene expression of these identified genes were provided. Conclusions We find that the combined analysis with GWAS and machine learning feature selection shows significant identification power for minor QTLs mining. The presented research results on minor QTLs mining will help understand the biological activities that lie between genotype and phenotype in terms of causal networks of interacting genes. This study will potentially contribute to effective genomic selection in plant breeding and help broaden the way of molecular breeding in plants.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/712190", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["1431889", "11128159", "707284", "21420311", "4408491", "3472463", "2709064", "12376488", "26580409", "59205310", "41695246", "7309473", "206970176", "11942561", "2468472", "5555155", "16174451", "2719945", "2878459", "8336769", "15271366", "64739538", "205218517", "7188610", "4886901", "13934648"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214725525"}

We try to fill this gap and compare several metric learning loss functions in a systematic manner on the VoxCeleb dataset. The first family of loss functions is derived from the cross entropy loss (usually used for supervised classification) and includes the congenerous cosine loss, the additive angular margin loss, and the center loss. The second family of loss functions focuses on the similarity between training samples and includes the contrastive loss and the triplet loss.

Based on a combination of SincNet trainable features and the x-vector architecture, the network used in this paper brings us a step closer to a really-end-to-end speaker verification system, when combined with the additive angular margin loss, while still being competitive with the x-vector baseline.

Traditional SVM approaches to facial feature detection typically extract features from images (e.g. multiband filter, SIFT features) and learn the SVM parameters.

When modifying a function, developers may update the comment associated with the function or may not update it. For example, comments associated with a complex function are likely to be updated more often when the function is modified to prevent the code and the comments from drifting apart. Nevertheless, the rationale behind updating a comment has never been studied. In this paper, we present a large empirical study to better understand the rationale for updating comments. We recover the code change history for four large open source projects (GCC: a compiler, FreeBSD: an operation system, PostgreSQL: a database management system, and GCluster: a clustering framework) with an average code history of 10 years. Using the Random Forests algorithm, we investigate the rationale for updating comments along three dimensions: characteristics of the changed function, characteristics of the change itself and time and code ownership characteristics. Our case study shows that we can predict with an accuracy of 80%; the likelihood of updating the comment associated with a modified function. We perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the most important attributes. Our analysis shows that the percentage of changed call dependencies and control statements, the age of the modified function and the number of co-changed functions which depend on it are the most important attributes in determining the likelihood of updating comments.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSM.2008.4658065", "venue": "2008 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance", "journal": "2008 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2113509293", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12737356", "30026641", "14526326", "30853777", "7730498", "10181716", "17904304", "62224036", "18810230", "1908828", "16017158", "89141", "5262555", "6437835", "207738357", "7801483", "5331136"], "inbound_citations": ["10396446", "18345837", "10141946", "22619205", "9004670", "201130938", "14679583", "11340188", "2912956", "5813874", "18067970", "9865030", "1550449", "8607609", "11189276", "15547629", "23462251"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6291534"}

Previous confidence estimators were based on perceptrons which had the limitation of learning only linearly separable functions,[2, 24]. But sometimes linear inseparability may arise when a correct prediction on a past instruction causes the current instruction to predict incorrectly [25]. As Support Vector Machines belong to a family of generalized linear classifier and can be interpreted as extension of perceptron, they are both linear and non linear classifiers and are computationally more efficient than perceptrons. Thus, we propose a confidence estimator using SVM\u2019s in which the prediction accuracy of previous instructions is used to estimate the confidence of current prediction and decide based on its results whether or not the prediction is likely to be correct.

Graph classification is one of the most important graph data analysis problems, which choose the most probable class labels of graphs using models based on the training dataset. It has wildly applications in protein group identification, chemical compounds classification and so on. Many existing research of graph learning suffer from high computation cost as large scale graph data are dramatically increased. In order to realize big graph classification with real-time learning ability and good scalability, efficient feature extraction approaches and ELM variants are utilized in this paper. To be specific, we present three frameworks of big graph classification based on ELMs: (1) a framework with a compression-based frequent subgraph mining method to reduce graph size; (2) an incremental framework to handle dynamic graphs; (3) a distributed framework with distributed ELMs to provide good scalability and easy implementation on cloud platforms. Extensive experiments are conducted on clusters with large real-world graph datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our frameworks are efficient in big graph classification applications, and well suitable for dynamic networks. The results also validate that ELM and its variants have good classification performance on large-scale graphs.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2018.11.035", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2901016324", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208338203"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67776088"}

To tackle these problems, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end Compositional Generative Adversarial Network (Comp-GAN) that is able to synthesize new face images with specified poses and desired facial expressions; and such synthesized images can be further utilized to help train a robust and generalized expression recognition model. Essentially, Comp-GAN can dynamically change the expression and pose of faces according to the input images while keeping the identity information. Specifically, the generator has two major components: one for generating images with desired expression and the other for changing the pose of faces. Furthermore, a face reconstruction learning process is applied to re-generate the input image and constrains the generator for preserving the key information such as facial identity. For the first time, various one/zero-shot facial expression recognition tasks have been created.

However, this information is usually not available or is incomplete. In this study, we present a statistically-based methodology to classify river segments from a whole river network (Deva-Cares catchment, Northern Spain) as temporary or perennial. This method is based on an a priori classification of a subset of river segments as temporary or perennial, using field surveys and aerial images, and then running Random Forest models to predict classification membership for the rest of the river network. The independent variables and the river network were derived following a computer-based geospatial simulation of riverine landscapes. The model results show high values of overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for the evaluation of the fitted model to the training and testing dataset (\u22650.9). The most important independent variables were catchment area, area occupied by broadleaf forest, minimum monthly precipitation in August, and average catchment elevation. The final map shows 7525 temporary river segments (1012.5 km) and 3731 perennial river segments (662.5 km). A subsequent validation of the mapping results using River Habitat Survey data and expert knowledge supported the validity of the proposed maps.

In this paper we introduce a novel MIL algorithm using Gaussian processes (GP). The bag labeling protocol of the MIL can be effectively modeled by the sigmoid likelihood through the max function over GP latent variables. As the non-continuous max function makes exact GP inference and learning infeasible, we propose two approximations: the soft-max approximation and the introduction of witness indicator variables. Compared to the state-of-the-art MIL approaches, especially those based on the Support Vector Machine, our model enjoys two most crucial benefits: (i) the kernel parameters can be learned in a principled manner, thus avoiding grid search and being able to exploit a variety of kernel families with complex forms, and (ii) the efficient gradient search for kernel parameter learning effectively leads to feature selection to extract most relevant features while discarding noise.

We propose an incremental learning methodology, enabling to learn segmenting new classes without hindering dense labeling abilities for the previous classes, although the entire previous data are not accessible. The key points of the proposed approach are adapting the network to learn new as well as old classes on the new training data, and allowing it to remember the previously learned information for the old classes. For adaptation, we keep a frozen copy of the previously trained network, which is used as a memory for the updated network in the absence of annotations for the former classes. The updated network minimizes a loss function, which balances the discrepancy between outputs for the previous classes from the memory and updated networks, and the misclassification rate between outputs for the new classes from the updated network and the new ground-truth. For remembering, we either regularly feed samples from the stored, little fraction of the previous data or use the memory network, depending on whether the new data are collected from completely different geographic areas or from the same city.

In this paper, we introduce a general framework to enhance the embeddings of nodes acquired by means of the random walk-based approaches. Similar to the notion of topical word embeddings in NLP, the proposed method assigns each vertex to a topic with the favor of various statistical models and community detection methods, and then generates the enhanced community representations.

The current rapid development of technology leads to the supply of a vast amount of information that enables us to properly process valuable knowledge. Smart watches, wristbands, mobile phone applications, shoes and clothes sensors, etc. have provided practitioners the tools to collect numerous data regarding their fitness levels. The recent challenge data mining is about to serve, lies to the fact of how one can combine and analyze the abundance of data from daily activities, nutrition habits and fitness activities into one, unified model that could explain the underlying patterns of a subject's physical capacity. The current work deals with collecting heterogeneous fitness and nutrition facts from students of various athletic background and skills within the University of the Aegean campus, using hi-tech GPS smartwatches and calories monitoring smartwatch applications. Upon data collection, we apply Gradient Boosting Machines to forecast the finishing time of two different running tasks, namely 800m and 5000m. The algorithm is trained and evaluated using different attribute sets, focusing on features that describe either fitness skills, nutrition habits or both. The results demonstrate an impressive ability of the aforementioned method to predict the finishing time which surpasses many other Machine Learning algorithms and traditional models such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks and Linear Regression. Note that, based on current literature on the task at hand, prediction is almost exclusively relied to Linear Regression models, mentioning results far worse than GBM.

On the other hand, kinetic factors (e.g. speed, acceleration) can be obtained by monitoring the movement of vehicles through video cameras installed on the infrastructure or through on-board devices installed on the vehicles. Hence, the problem of interest is to develop models to predict RLR violations using kinetic information of vehicles. A monitoring period was defined to extract data from each vehicle before reaching the intersection. Machine learning techniques, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were adopted to develop prediction models. The minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection method was used to identify the most important factors for model development. To evaluate the performance of the models the K-fold cross-validation and out-of-bag (OOB) errors were used for the SVM and RF models, which contributed to high prediction accuracies of 97.9 and 93.6 percent, respectively. It was shown that other than the critical instant at which the traffic signal changes to yellow, an appropriate monitoring period with respect to the yellow onset can provide additional useful information ensuring that the driver decision occurs during that period.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ITSC.2015.112", "venue": "2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems", "journal": "2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1931605281", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["121254816", "122219598", "29113347", "110411713", "53602881", "111328632", "109978714", "108020491", "129189459", "108449934", "111283682", "106740611", "110552353", "20070649", "109632402", "117118261", "16881441", "106701779", "107978209", "14849054", "7396157", "111346807", "108083488", "15874442", "2443126", "27713597", "1831347", "108004560", "2702042", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["57190773", "203925306", "53024641", "52932061", "208633147", "3896972", "14783487"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10808282"}

Though many intrusion detection systems have been proposed in the past, the existing network intrusion detections have limitations in terms of detection time and accuracy. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a new intrusion detection system in this paper by developing a new intelligent Conditional Random Field (CRF) based feature selection algorithm to optimize the number of features. In addition, an existing Layered Approach (LA) based algorithm is used to perform classification with these reduced features.

This research compared the remote sensing results derived with the Google Earth Engine with those reported by the Queensland Government, using their standard remote sensing methods. Four change detection approaches were investigated using the Landsat-5 TM and 7 ETM+ time-series and algorithms available through the Google Earth Engine Application Programming Interface: (1) Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and (2) Random Forest classifiers; and a normalised time-series of (3) Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and (4) Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) combined with a spectral index, used to predict woody vegetation change between two image composites.

Extrapolation to epochs without training data reduced the mapping accuracies. The normalised FPC and NDVI time-series approaches were more robust for calculating clearing probability, as no training data were required, and can hence be tuned to provide automated alerts for large woody vegetation clearing events by selecting suitable thresholds.

The Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia's (VT's), especially the Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) are the primary cause of the SCD's. This paper presents a classification method using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for predicting if there is an SCD occurrence in a signal. This is carried out by comparing certain characteristic features of the ECG signal of a normal healthy person with that of the unhealthy patient prone to SCD. In the time domain, the ECG signal has to be monitored continuously for long hours, which is not feasible and moreover the cardiac arrest in SCD cases occurs for a very short time which is preceded and followed by normal ECG. The noise and some electrical disturbances during measurement also affect the signal feature measurements. So, the signal is transformed into another domain using Wavelet Transformation method (Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to be precise) to extract certain features of the signal and study their pattern while comparing the abnormal ECG signal with that of a normally running ECG signal. The main features that were extracted are the R-peaks, R to R intervals, QRS complexes, QRS complex durations, T-Wave durations and the QT intervals. CWT was used to extract the features information from the ECG signals providing the base.

While there are many techniques for learning local patch descriptors for 2D images, recently efforts have been made for learning local descriptors for 3D points. The recent progress towards solving this problem in 3D leverages the strong feature representation capability of image based convolutional neural networks by utilizing RGB-D or multi-view representations. However, in this paper, we propose to learn 3D local descriptors by directly processing unstructured 3D point clouds without needing any intermediate representation. The method constitutes a deep network for learning permutation invariant representation of 3D points. To learn the local descriptors, we use a multi-margin contrastive loss which discriminates between similar and dissimilar points on a surface while also leveraging the extent of dissimilarity among the negative samples at the time of training. With comprehensive evaluation against strong baselines, we show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for matching points in 3D point clouds.

Experiment results on three large-scale data sets indicate that the proposed method speeds up the decision-tree-based support vector machines multi-class classifiers and yields higher precision.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-74205-0_90", "venue": "ICIC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1533264283", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["11878501"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:41795978"}

The previous studies mostly focus on collaborative filtering by considering user similarity. Trust is one of the most important factors in decision-making that has been neglected by the existing studies of personalized route query. In this paper, we propose a new type of personalized route query by incorporating trust. We propose a social trust-based optimal trip selection (STOTS) framework for personalized route query. STOTS consists of three key components. The first component predicts social trust based on extreme learning machine (ELM), denoted STP-ELM, that exploits social information and user behavioral patterns as features. In the second component, we propose a novel model to incorporate social trust into personalized route query. Additionally, we propose an index to speed up query processing. In the third component, we propose an optimal route query algorithm called RouteHunter that aims to find an appropriate route satisfying the user-specified constraints. The experiment results show that (1) our social trust prediction approach based on ELM attains superior regression efficiency compared to other traditional methods; (2) our proposed index can efficiently accelerate personalized route query processing; and (3) our route query approach can achieve a better performance than the baseline approach. This paper studies a novel personalized route query incorporating social trust in location-based social networks. We propose a social trust-based optimal trip selection (STOTS) framework that uses ELM to evaluate social trust, applies a ranking model to incorporate social trust, and includes an algorithm to find the required route.

We present Dynamic Self-Attention Network (DySAT), a novel neural architecture that learns node representations to capture dynamic graph structural evolution. Specifically, DySAT computes node representations through joint self-attention along the two dimensions of structural neighborhood and temporal dynamics. Compared with state-of-the-art recurrent methods modeling graph evolution, dynamic self-attention is efficient, while achieving consistently superior performance. We conduct link prediction experiments on two graph types: communication networks and bipartite rating networks.

However, it is difficult to detect anomaly and get the useful information if we want to apply the traditional algorithms in graph data. Statistical pattern recognition and structural pattern recognition are two main methods in pattern recognition. The disadvantage of statistical pattern recognition is that it is difficult to represent the relationship. In the structural pattern recognition, the object is generally expressed as a graph, and the key point is the similarity or matching of the graphs. However, graph matching is complex and NP-hard. Recently, graph kernel is proposed to solve the graph matching problem, so we can map the graphs into vector space. As a result, the operations in the vector space are applicable to graph data. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to detect anomaly for graph data. Firstly, we use graph kernel to define the similarity of the graphs, and then we convert graph data into vector data. After that, we use the Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) to reduce the dimension, and then train these data by one-class classifier to get the model for anomaly detection.

However, in many real-world applications such as spam prediction and classification of news articles, the best target function may be drifting over time. We introduce a novel model of concept drift in which an adversary is given control of both the distribution over input at each time step and the corresponding labels. The goal of the learner is to maintain an average loss close to the 0/1 loss of the best slowly changing sequence of functions with no more than K large shifts.

Spectra, however, may contain non-linearities for various reasons such as differences in viscosity, temperature, pH, particle size and chemical composition of the sample matrix. In such cases, PLS might not predict the parameter of interest sufficiently well, and one must find other methods for the calibration task. Support vector machine regression (SVR) has been gaining interest within chemometrics in recent years. SVR is capable of modelling highly non-linear data, also when data are of very high dimensions. The aim of this study was to develop calibration models of NIR spectra from four different process steps in a raw-sugar factory.

They are inspired by Biological Neural Networks (BNNs) and provide an intuitive and abstract representation of how BNNs work. Derived from the more generic Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the recurrent ones are meant to be used for temporal tasks, such as speech recognition, because they are capable of memorizing historic input. However, such networks are very time consuming to train as a result of their inherent nature. Recently, Echo State Networks and Liquid State Machines have been proposed as possible RNN alternatives, under the name of Reservoir Computing (RC). RCs are far more easy to train. In this paper, Cellular Automata are used as reservoir, and are tested on the 5-bit memory task (a well known benchmark within the RC community). The work herein provides a method of mapping binary inputs from the task onto the automata, and a recurrent architecture for handling the sequential aspects of it. Furthermore, a layered (deep) reservoir architecture is proposed. Performances are compared towards earlier work, in addition to its single-layer version. Results show that the single CA reservoir system yields similar results to state-of-the-art work. The system comprised of two layered reservoirs do show a noticeable improvement compared to a single CA reservoir. This indicates potential for further research and provides valuable insight on how to design CA reservoir systems.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1703.02806", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2604511101", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1843485", "62374310", "537138", "18470994", "1045112", "15073928", "10717914", "7654843", "31213144", "33255632", "10796709", "15731552", "24244845", "6630233", "2625066", "27054014", "125493283", "51772341", "14591427", "53064806", "39559358", "5386559", "24097764", "1915014", "15166956", "2970397", "6453539", "10530917", "2009318", "6915137", "10659969", "34472727"], "inbound_citations": ["189928271", "21847503", "22690605", "49182946", "211242629", "208127748", "195776278", "201140669", "204900962", "51614496", "199541604"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2881535"}

A diagnostic difficulty arises when parents hear wheezing that is no longer present during the medical consultation. Thus, an outpatient objective tool for recognition of wheezing is of clinical value. MethodWe developed a wheezing recognition algorithm from recorded respiratory sounds with a Smartphone placed near the mouth. A total of 186 recordings were obtained in a pediatric emergency department, mostly in toddlers (mean age 20 months). After exclusion of recordings with artefacts and those with a single clinical operator auscultation, 95 recordings with the agreement of two operators on auscultation diagnosis (27 with wheezing and 68 without) were subjected to a two phase algorithm (signal analysis and pattern classifier using machine learning algorithms) to classify records. ResultsThe best performance (71.4% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity) was observed with a Support Vector Machine-based algorithm. We further tested the algorithm over a set of 39 recordings having a single operator and found a fair agreement (kappa=0.28, CI95% 0.12, 0.45) between the algorithm and the operator. ConclusionsThe main advantage of such an algorithm is its use in contact-free sound recording, thus valuable in the pediatric population. We recorded by Smartphone respiratory sounds at the mouth in pediatric population.Two clinical operators validated the presence or absence of wheezing in 97 toddlers.We used Short-Time Fourier Transform and SVM classifier for wheeze recognition.71.4% Sensitivity and 88.9% Specificity were observed for wheeze detection.An independent test found a fair agreement with a clinical operator.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26802543", "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.01.002", "venue": "Computers in biology and medicine", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "mag_id": "2227571529", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["214624738", "9994261", "209480178", "19712587", "53096018", "54939125", "6577870", "207822251", "202724936", "209373248", "203654779", "13351032", "85500472", "207610080", "24197939"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43018887"}

Formerly the advances in computer technology have led to an increase in number of seismic attributes and thus better geological interpretation. Nowadays, the overwhelming number and variety of seismic attributes make the interpretation less unequivocal and can lead to slow performance. Using the correlation coefficients, similarities and hierarchical grouping the analysis of seismic attributes was carried out on several real datasets. We try to identify key seismic attributes (also the weak ones) that help the most with machine learning seismic attribute analysis and test the selection with Random Forest algorithm. Obtained quantitative factors help with the overall look at the data. Initial tests have shown some regularities in the correlations between seismic attributes. Some attributes are unique and potentially very helpful with information retrieval while others form non-diverse groups.

Both criteria place a statistical, spline-based, algorithm called POLYCLSSS at the top, although it is not statistically significantly different from twenty other algorithms. Another statistical algorithm, logistic regression, is second with respect to the two accuracy criteria. The most accurate decision tree algorithm is QUEST with linear splits, which ranks fourth and fifth, respectively. Although spline-based statistical algorithms tend to have good accuracy, they also require relatively long training times. POLYCLASS, for example, is third last in terms of median training time. It often requires hours of training compared to seconds for other algorithms. The QUEST and logistic regression algorithms are substantially faster.

These studies ignore abundant user interaction data on social media, which is an important source to understand consumer need, as well as advanced methods to deal will multivariate data in the forecasting model. Thus, this study aims to fill this research gap by applying Bayesian Neural Networks model and incorporating user interaction data, especially emojis, into the model.

ELM randomly chooses the input weights and biases and determines analytically the weights as output. The random selection of biases and the input weight produce an unforeseen result which causes training error and also produces lesser prediction accuracy.

A system predicting these seizures could give a patient sufficient time to bring himself to safety and to apply a fast-working anti-epileptic treatment to suppress the upcoming seizure. Many seizure detection techniques claim to be able to detect seizures before the marked seizure onset on the EEG. In this work we study the predictions of such a seizure detection system. ::: Materials: ::: For the experiments the MIT Scalp EEG dataset was used, which contains at least 20 hours of EEG and 3 seizures for 24 pediatric patients [1]. ::: Methods: ::: The data is preprocessed using a filter-bank of 8 Butterworth filters of 3 Hz wide between 0.5 and 24.5 Hz [1]. Next the energy is determined for windows of 2 seconds wide with 1 second overlap. This data is presented as input for the machine learning component based on Reservoir Computing (RC) [1]. RC uses a randomly created recurrent artificial neural network, the reservoir, to map the input to a higher dimensional space. The system is trained using a linear readout of the reservoir. After this readout a simple thresholding technique is applied for classification [1]. ::: Experiments and results: ::: For each patient, the system is trained on the data of the 23 other patients. During training, the 2 minutes of EEG prior or following a seizure is not used. Next the system is evaluated on the data of the considered patient. Detections which occurred 10 minutes before the marked seizure onset were considered as true positives. This resulted in a system that was able to detect 75% of the seizures with about 6 false positives per correctly detected seizure. For 11 out of 24 patients some seizures were detected before the marked seizure onset. Furthermore, in 4 of these patients at least half of the seizures were detected before the marked onset, and in a single patient all seizures were detected before the marked onset. ::: Discussion: ::: However, in retrospect, 65% of the early detections are caused by EEG artifacts. Most others can be attributed to inter-ictal spike and wave discharges in the EEG preceding the seizure. Only 3% of the early detections have currently an unknown cause and could be actual early detections. Although nearly all early detections can be considered as false positives. However such false positives have a significantly greater occurrence right before marked seizure onsets, but further research is needed to analyze the cause of this correlation. It might be that these artifacts contain predictive information or for example that the selection criteria for adding EEG sections to the dataset were less strict for EEG sections containing a seizure. These pitfalls call for common guidelines and datasets to evaluate early seizure detection methods. ::: References: ::: [1] Buteneers, P. (2012).

In this paper, we propose a fully automatic method to segment both liver and tumor using an array of Gabor Filter (Gabor Bank(GB)) and Machine Learning (ML) classifiers: Random Forest (RF) and Deep Neural Network (DNN).

Various studies have been dedicated to building the predictive models for improved AM quality control.

This paper presents a data-driven predictive model by taking into account the printing process in a deep learning network structure, using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) as a representative case study. Temperature and vibration data are measured to reveal the layer-wise thermal and mechanical activities as well as the process variation, and the inter-relationship among different printing layers is characterized by a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network. The sensing data, combined with process parameters and material property, are then fused for predicting the tensile strength of manufactured parts. To quantify the influence of each process parameters on the prediction result, a modified Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is investigated. Experimental evaluation has shown that the LSTM-based predictive model outperforms several machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Regression and Random Forest.

In order to prepare the data source for table search, accurately detecting the table boundary plays a crucial role for the later table structure decomposition. Table boundary detection and content extraction is a challenging problem because tabular formats are not standardized across all documents. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective preprocessing method to improve the table boundary detection performance by considering the sparse-line property of table rows. Our method easily simplifies the table boundary detection problem into the sparse line analysis problem with much less noise. We design eight line label types and apply two machine learning techniques, Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), on the table boundary detection field.

A proactive prediction of safety accidents is the best way to prevent them, but a dynamic change in particular conditions of a construction project makes the prediction very tricky and complicated. Moreover, preventive work for any safety accident at a construction site mainly depends on the intuitive and subjective opinions of practitioners with limited experience. The stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) approach may be an attractive alternative to conventional methods for predicting safety accidents because of its superior predictive performance. Therefore, SGB is applied to an early prediction of safety accidents at a construction site in order to examine its applicability to the construction safety domain.

The value of information is a decision analytic metric quantifying the incremental monetary value that would be created by collecting information prior to making a decision under uncertainty. It has to be computed before collecting the information and can be used to justify its collection. Previous work on estimating the value of information of geophysical data has involved explicit approximation of the posterior distribution of reservoir properties given the data and then evaluating the prospect values for that posterior distribution of reservoir properties. Here, we propose to directly estimate the prospect values given the data by building a statistical relationship between them using regression and machine learning techniques. For a 2D reservoir case, the value of information of time-lapse seismic data has been evaluated in the context of spatial decision alternatives and spatial heterogeneity of reservoir properties. Different approaches are employed to regress the values on the data: Partial Least Squares Regression and Principal Components Regression regress the values on the important linear combinations of the seismic data. Random Forests Regression is employed to regress the values on a few features extracted from the seismic data. The uncertainty in the estimation of the value of information has been quantified using bootstrapping. Estimating the value of information by simulation-regression is much less computationally expensive than other approaches that fully describe the posterior distribution.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113436", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Energy", "mag_id": "2949893591", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207977238"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197435403"}

{"paper_id": "19557453", "title": "Neurorobotics: An Experimental Science of Embodiment", "authors": [{"first": "Frederic", "middle": [], "last": "Kaplan", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "At the interface of neuroscience and robotics, neurorobotics is the science and technology of embodied autonomous neural systems. Neural systems include brain-inspired algorithms (e.g. connectionist networks, artificial spiking neural nets), computational models of biological neural networks (e.g. large-scale simulations of neural microcircuits) and actual biological systems (e.g. in vivo and in vitro neural nets). Such neural systems can be embodied in machines with mechanic, pneumatic, electromagnetic or any other forms of physical or virtual actuation. This includes robots, prosthetic, wearable systems, virtual reality environments but at also, at smaller scale, micro-machines and, at the larger scales, furniture and infrastructures. ::: ::: Neurorobotics is at the confluence of different research trends that emancipated from their original disciplines in the 1980s and 1990s: artificial neural network and computational neuroscience models that are neural systems but not embodied, embodied developmental robotic systems that are embodied and autonomous but not brain-like, and research studies in hybrid biological \u2013 artificial systems that are embodied neural systems but with very little autonomy. In each of these fields great progresses have been recently made. Most advanced computing machineries permit now to simulate huge realistic neural network. Promising experiments in epigenetic robotics move from traditional learning of isolated tasks to open-ended developmental trajectories. Pioneering research in hybrid systems permit to investigate symbiotic biological-artificial systems that were previously only in the realm of science fiction. Neurorobotics is the natural meeting point of these converging trends. ::: ::: The grand challenge of neurorobotics is to build a well-founded experimental science of embodiment. Considered in isolation, neural systems tend to be intrinsically generic, plastic and versatile. However, once embodied and coupled with a given internal or external environment, they become specific and adapted. Neurorobotics offers a novel methodology to understand this process by considering both neural systems and embodiment as experimental variables. ::: ::: Since the 1950s, robots were essentially seen as fixed bodies on which different programs could be plugged in, like the software and hardware parts of a computer. This dualism has led to a prejudicial divergence between artificial intelligence researchers building intelligent programs and roboticists building sophisticated bodies. In the last 1980s, a handful of researchers tried to escape from what appeared to be a technological dead-end and pushed forward a reunited view of intelligence, under the name of embodied artificial intelligence or new A.I. They argued that physical bodies and control systems should be intrinsically linked, like two sides of the same coin. The return to the design of complete agents undoubtedly led to some successes, notably for locomotion, sensorimotor learning and navigation in unknown complex environments. However, if such kind of holistic approaches proved to be efficient for designing complex adapted behavior, they were not sufficient to articulate a clear view of developmental processes. For instance, in just a few months, children learn to crawl, stand, walk, jump, hop, run, etc. As they learn these new skills in a continuous incremental manner, their sensorimotor space changes permitting them to investigate novel domains of exploration. This is even clearer with the use of tools or the acquisition of communication skills. This has lead researchers in developmental and epigenetic robotics to present models in which an agent is essentially constituted on the one hand, of a kernel, a set of stable processes that drive developmental dynamics and, on the other hand, of variable body envelopes that change over time. This novel view reverses the classic notion of a fixed body on which different software can be applied to consider a fixed software that can be applied to different kinds of embodiment, potentially changing over time. ::: ::: Experiments in neurorobotics permit to progress in understanding how the interplay between neural learning dynamics, physical embodiment and environment factors shape developmental trajectories in specific ways, leading, in some circumstances, to open-ended acquisition of new competences but also, in other cases, to abnormal trajectories. In addition, neurorobotics is expected to provide the technological basis for self-developing devices of a new kind, capable of acquiring new know-how in a continuous and open-ended manner.

Specifically, the dihedral angles are firstly computed as a surface roughness indexes and so a structural information descriptors. Then, a visual masking modulation is applied to this angles according to the main characteristics of the human visual system. The well known statistical Gamma model is used to fit the dihedral angles distribution.

Another finding was that our experiments indicated that spectral features were the most important in classification of land cover, followed by temporal, thermal, and spatial features, respectively. As to the spectral features, red channels were the most important, followed by short-wave infrared, near-infrared, and green channels.

In GISVM, skin of convex hulls is defined and an efficient method is designed to find the best skin approximation given available examples. The set of extreme points are found by recursively searching along the direction defined by a pair of known extreme points. By identifying the skin of the convex hulls, the incremental learning will only employ a much smaller number of samples with comparable or even better accuracy. When additional samples are provided, they will be used together with the skin of the convex hull constructed from previous dataset.

Given that one important step for functional genomic annotation is the promoter identification, several studies have been taken in order to propose computational approaches to predict promoters. Different classifiers and characteristics of the promoter sequences have been used to deal with this prediction problem. However, several works in literature have addressed the promoter prediction problem using datasets containing sequences of 250 nucleotides or more. As the sequence length defines the amount of dataset attributes, even considering a limited number of properties to characterize the sequences, datasets with a high number of attributes are generated for training classifiers. Once high-dimensional datasets can degrade the classifiers predictive performance or even require an infeasible processing time, predicting promoters by training classifiers from datasets with a reduced number of attributes, it is essential to obtain good predictive performance with low computational cost. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work in literature that verified in a systematic way the relation between the sequences length and the predictive performance of classifiers. Thus, in this work, we have evaluated the impact of sequence length variation and training dataset size (number of sequences) on the predictive performance of classifiers. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We have built sixteen datasets composed of different sized sequences (ranging in length from 12 to 301 nucleotides) and evaluated them using the SVM, Random Forest and k-NN classifiers. The best predictive performances reached by SVM and Random Forest remained relatively stable for datasets composed of sequences varying in length from 301 to 41 nucleotides, while k-NN achieved its best performance for the dataset composed of 101 nucleotides. We have also analyzed, using sequences composed of only 41 nucleotides, the impact of increasing the number of sequences in a dataset on the predictive performance of the same three classifiers. Datasets containing 14,000, 80,000, 100,000 and 120,000 sequences were built and evaluated. All classifiers achieved better predictive performance for datasets containing 80,000 sequences or more. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The experimental results show that several datasets composed of shorter sequences achieved better predictive performance when compared with datasets composed of longer sequences, and also consumed a significantly shorter processing time. Furthermore, increasing the number of sequences in a dataset proved to be beneficial to the predictive power of classifiers.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4686783", "pubmed_id": "26695879", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-16-S19-S5", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2295126306", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["11977433", "8883887", "7574637", "22548642", "27563684", "6994993", "8360685", "23591715", "7452165", "17912228", "30929441", "2696614", "2217978", "1962714", "52874011", "5246200", "60246745", "31015609", "11077516"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17558910"}

We also preprocess the images with a bank of Gabor filters, so that important features in the face images are identified. Subsequently the faces are classified using a Support Vector Machine. We show that it is possible to differentiate faces with a neutral expression from those with a happy expression and neutral expression from those of angry expressions and neutral expression with better accuracy.

The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing.

Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task.

To tackle the problems, we propose a robust unsupervised multi-view feature learning method with a dynamic graph. The dynamic graph structure is constructed adaptively and the robust projection matrix is learned simultaneously. Specifically, we adaptively learn a dynamic graph which captures the intrinsic multiple view-specific relations of samples. Robust projection matrix learning suppresses the adverse noises and preserves the intrinsic graph structure. Moreover, the assigned weights are learned automatically for each view without any extra parameter.

In accomplishing this task, how to construct a proper model to describe the behavior of human meridian systems is one of the very important issues. From experiments, it has been found that the hysteresis phenomenon occurs in the relations between stimulation input and the corresponding response of meridian systems. Therefore, the modeling of hysteresis in a human meridian system is an unavoidable task for the construction of model based digital human meridian systems. As hysteresis is a nonsmooth, nonlinear and dynamic system with a multi-valued mapping, the conventional identification method is difficult to be employed to model its behavior directly. In this paper, a neural network based identification method of hysteresis occurring in human meridian systems is presented. In this modeling scheme, an expanded input space is constructed to transform the multi-valued mapping of hysteresis into a one-to-one mapping. For this purpose, a modified hysteretic operator is proposed to handle the extremum-missing problem. Then, based on the constructed expanded input space with the modified hysteretic operator, the so-called Extreme Learning Machine ELM neural network is utilized to model hysteresis inherent in human meridian systems. As hysteresis in meridian system is a dynamic system, a dynamic ELMneural network is developed. In the proposed dynamic ELMneural network, the output state of each hidden neuron is fed back to its own input to describe the dynamic behavior of hysteresis. The training of the recurrent ELM neural network is based on the least-squares algorithm with QR decomposition.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2478/v10006-012-0051-4", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1543812370", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["83502849", "135667415", "116858", "2891159", "29542974", "46140252", "51832903", "5151554", "44697037"], "inbound_citations": ["53611185", "21711084", "4814767", "36990926", "9249619", "23003052", "55848386"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12880453"}

BackgroundInvasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are associated with considerable health and economic costs. Surveillance of the more diagnostically challenging invasive fungal diseases, specifically of the sino-pulmonary system, is not feasible for many hospitals because case finding is a costly and labour intensive exercise. We developed text classifiers for detecting such IFDs from free-text radiology (CT) reports, using machine-learning techniques. MethodWe obtained free-text reports of CT scans performed over a specific hospitalisation period (2003-2011), for 264 IFD and 289 control patients from three tertiary hospitals. We analysed IFD evidence at patient, report, and sentence levels. Three infectious disease experts annotated the reports of 73 IFD-positive patients for language suggestive of IFD at sentence level, and graded the sentences as to whether they suggested or excluded the presence of IFD. Reliable agreement between annotators was obtained and this was used as training data for our classifiers. We tested a variety of Machine Learning (ML), rule based, and hybrid systems, with feature types including bags of words, bags of phrases, and bags of concepts, as well as report-level structured features. Evaluation was carried out over a robust framework with separate Development and Held-Out datasets. ResultsThe best systems (using Support Vector Machines) achieved very high recall at report- and patient-levels over unseen data: 95% and 100% respectively. Precision at report-level over held-out data was 71%; however, most of the associated false-positive reports (53%) belonged to patients who had a previous positive report appropriately flagged by the classifier, reducing negative impact in practice.

Sequential-sampling models such as the race model and the drift-diffusion model that are grounded in simplicity, analytical tractability, and optimality remain popular, but some of their more recent counterparts have instead been designed with an aim for more feasibility as architectures to be implemented by actual neural systems. Connectionist models are proposed herein at an intermediate level of analysis that bridges mental phenomena and underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. Several such models drawing elements from the established race, drift-diffusion, feedforward-inhibition, divisive-normalization, and competing-accumulator models were tested with respect to fitting empirical data from human participants making choices between foods on the basis of hedonic value rather than a traditional perceptual attribute. Even when considering performance at emulating behavior alone, more neurally plausible models were set apart from more normative race or drift-diffusion models both quantitatively and qualitatively despite remaining parsimonious. To best capture the paradigm, a novel six-parameter computational model was formulated with features including hierarchical levels of competition via mutual inhibition as well as a static approximation of attentional modulation, which promotes \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d processing. Moreover, a meta-analysis encompassing several related experiments validated the robustness of model-predicted trends in humans\u2019 value-based choices and concomitant reaction times.

Two such methods are presented in this paper by integrating a machine learning algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM), and the random effect model. Without any brain response modeling, SVM was used to extract a whole brain spatial discriminance map (SDM), representing the brain response difference between the contrasted experimental conditions. Population inference was then obtained through the random effect analysis (RFX) or permutation testing (PMU) on the individual subjects' SDMs. Applied to arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion fMRI data, SDM RFX yielded lower false-positive rates in the null hypothesis test and higher detection sensitivity for synthetic activations with varying cluster size and activation strengths, compared to the univariate general linear model (GLM)-based RFX. For a sensory\u2013motor ASL fMRI study, both SDM RFX and SDM PMU yielded similar activation patterns to GLM RFX and GLM PMU, respectively, but with higher t values and cluster extensions at the same significance level.

The main idea behind such an ensemble of models, which outperforms a single model, is to combine a set of diverse classifiers. This work concentrates on neural networks as base classifiers and explores the influence of the parameters of neural networks, whose randomization leads to generating diverse ensembles with better generalisation ability compared to a single model. For stimulating disagreement among the members of an ensemble of neural networks, we apply the sampling strategy similar to one implemented by Random Forests together with the variation of the network parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that by random varying different network parameters it is possible to induce diversity to an ensemble of neural networks, but it does not necessarily lead to an accuracy improvement.

In this paper, we analyze the shortcomings of imELM-kde and then propose an improved version of imELM-kde. The Parzen window method used in imELM-kde leads to multiple intersection points between p.d.f.s of majority and minority classes. In addition, it is unreasonable to update the real outputs with intersection point, because the p.d.f.s are estimated based on the predictive outputs. Thus, in order to improve the shortcomings of imELM-kde, an imbalanced ELM based on normal density estimation imELM-nde is proposed in this paper. In imELM-nde, the p.d.f.s of predictive outputs corresponding to majority and minority classes are computed with normal density estimation and the intersection point is used to update the predictive outputs instead of real outputs. This makes the training of probability density estimation-based imbalanced ELM simpler and more feasible.

The current major problems with these methods are over-fitting and the existence of too many free parameters. The way to select the parameters can directly affect the generalization performance (test error) of theses models. Current practice in how to choose the model parameters is an art, rather than a science in this research area. Often, some parameters are predetermined, or randomly chosen. Other parameters are selected through repeated experiments that are time consuming, costly, and computationally very intensive. In this dissertation, we provide a two-stage analytical hybrid-training algorithm by building a bridge among regression tree, EM algorithm, and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks together. Information Complexity (ICOMP) criterion of Bozdogan along with other information based criteria are introduced and applied to control the model complexity, and to decide the optimal number of kernel functions. In the first stage of the hybrid, regression tree and EM algorithm are used to determine the kernel function parameters. In the second stage of the hybrid, the weights (coefficients) are calculated and information criteria are scored. Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) using EM algorithm for feature selection and data preprocessing is also introduced and studied.

Nevertheless, it is noted that the phenomenon, that data in different classes from same view are more similar than that in same class from different views, is usually presented for cross-view multimedia data. The intrinsic imperfection leads disappointing performance for cross-view multimedia recognition or classification. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel discriminative learning framework with low-rank constraint, which can be applied for view-invariant low-dimensional subspace learning. The advantages of our framework include three aspects. Firstly, to unlock the latent class structure and view structure, a self-expressed model by dual low-rank constraints are presented, which can separate the two manifold structures in the learned subspace. Secondly, two effective discriminative graphs are constructed to guide the affinity relationship of data in the above two low-dimensional projected subspaces respectively. Finally, the joint semantic consensus constraint is designed to be integrated into the learning framework, which can explore the shared and view-specific information for enforcing the view-invariant character in semantic space.

While research on automated information extraction from multimedia data has yielded significant progress in areas such as the extraction of entities, links, and events, less progress has been made in the development of automated tools for analyzing the results of information extraction to \u201cconnect the dots.\u201d Hence, our Counter-Terror Social Network Analysis and Intent Recognition (CT-SNAIR) work focuses on development of automated techniques and tools for detection and tracking of dynamically-changing terrorist networks as well as recognition of capability and potential intent. In addition to obtaining and working with real data for algorithm development and test, we have a major focus on modeling and simulation of terrorist attacks based on real information about past attacks. We describe the development and application of a new Terror Attack Description Language (TADL), which is used as a basis for modeling and simulation of terrorist attacks. Examples are shown which illustrate the use of TADL and a companion simulator based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) structure to generate transactions for attack scenarios drawn from real events. We also describe our techniques for generating realistic background clutter traffic to enable experiments to estimate performance in the presence of a mix of data. An important part of our effort is to produce scenarios and corpora for use in our own research, which can be shared with a community of researchers in this area. We describe our scenario and corpus development, including specific examples from the September 2004 bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta and a fictitious scenario which was developed in a prior project for research in social network analysis. The scenarios can be created by subject matter experts using a graphical editing tool. Given a set of time ordered transactions between actors, we employ social network analysis (SNA) algorithms as a filtering step to divide the actors into distinct communities before determining intent. This helps reduce clutter and enhances the ability to determine activities within a specific group. For modeling and simulation purposes, we generate random networks with structures and properties similar to real-world social networks. Modeling of background traffic is an important step in generating classifiers that can separate harmless activities from suspicious activity.

Since priming experiments using English and French morphologically related prime-target pairs reveal stronger priming when complex words are semantically transparent (e.g., refill\u2013fill) compared to semantically more opaque pairs (e.g., restrain\u2013strain), localist models set up connections between complex words and their stems only for semantically transparent pairs. Connectionist models have argued that the effect of transparency should arise as an epiphenomenon in PDP networks. However, for German, a series of studies has revealed equivalent priming for both transparent and opaque prime-target pairs, which suggests mediation of lexical access by the stem, independent of degrees of semantic compositionality. This study reports a priming experiment that replicates equivalent priming for transparent and opaque pairs. We show that these behavioral results can be straightforwardly modeled by a computational implementation of Word and Paradigm Morphology (wpm), Naive Discriminative Learning (ndl). Just as wpm, ndl eschews the theoretical construct of the morpheme. Ndl succeeds in modeling the German priming data by inspecting the extent to which a discrimination network pre-activates the target lexome from the orthographic properties of the prime. Measures derived from an ndl network, complemented with a semantic similarity measure derived from distributional semantics, predict lexical decision latencies with somewhat improved precision compared to classical measures, such as word frequency, prime type, and human association ratings.

The accurate quantification of biomass is important to better understand forest productivity and carbon cycling dynamics. Stand-based inventories (SBIs) are widely used for quantifying forest characteristics and for estimating biomass, but information may quickly become outdated in dynamic forest environments. Satellite remote sensing may provide a supplement or substitute. We tested the accuracy of aboveground biomass estimates modeled from a combination of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery and topographic data, as well as SBI-derived variables in a Picea abies forest in the Western Carpathian Mountains. We employed Random Forests for non-parametric, regression tree-based modeling. Results indicated a difference in the importance of SBI-based and remote sensing-based predictors when estimating aboveground biomass. The most accurate models for biomass prediction ranged from a correlation coefficient of 0.52 for the TM- and topography-based model, to 0.98 for the inventory-based model. While Landsat-based biomass estimates were measurably less accurate than those derived from SBI, adding tree height or stand-volume as a field-based predictor to TM and topography-based models increased performance to 0.36 and 0.86, respectively.

Reliable planning requires accurate models of the effects of actions--models which are often more appropriately learned through experience than design. This thesis describes TRAIL (Teleo-Reactive Agent with Inductive Learning), an integrated agent architecture which learns models of actions based on experiences in the environment. These action models are then used to create plans that combine both goal-directed and reactive behaviors. ::: Previous work on action-model learning has focused on domains that contain only deterministic, atomic action models that explicitly describe all changes that can occur in the environment. The thesis extends this previous work to cover domains that contain durative actions, continuous variables, nondeterministic action effects, and actions taken by other agents. Results have been demonstrated in several robot simulation environments and the Silicon Graphics, Inc. flight simulator. ::: The main emphasis in this thesis is on the action-model learning process within TRAIL. The content begins the learning process by recording experiences in its environment either by observing a trainer or by executing a plan. Second, the agent identifies instances of action success or failure during these experiences using a new analysis demonstrating nine possible causes of action failure. Finally, a variant of the Inductive Logic Programming algorithm DINUS is used to induce action models based on the action instances. As the action models are learned, they can be used for constructing plans whose execution contributes to additional learning experiences.

Using species distribution models to predict the biogeographical distribution of species is regularly used in conservation and other management activities. However, the uncertainty in the data and models inevitably reduces their prediction power. The major purpose of this study is to assess the impacts of predictor variables and species distribution models on simulating T. ramosissima distribution, to explore the relationships between predictor variables and species distribution models and to model the potential distribution of T. ramosissima in this basin. Methods Three models\u2014the generalized linear model (GLM), classification and regression tree (CART) and Random Forests\u2014were selected and were processed on the BIOMOD platform. The presence/absence data of T. ramosissima in the Tarim Basin, which were calculated from vegetation maps, were used as response variables. Climate, soil and digital elevation model (DEM) data variables were divided into four datasets and then used as predictors. The four datasets were (i) climate variables, (ii) soil, climate and DEM variables, (iii) principal component analysis (PCA)-based climate variables and (iv) PCA-based soil, climate and DEM variables. Important Findings The results indicate that predictive variables for species distribution models should be chosen carefully, because too many predictors can reduce the prediction power. The effectiveness of using PCA to reduce the correlation among predictors and enhance the modelling power depends on the chosen predictor variables and models. Our results implied that it is better to reduce the correlating predictors before model processing. The Random Forests model was more precise than the GLM and CART models. The best model for T. ramosissima was the Random Forests model with climate predictors alone. Soil variables considered in this study could not significantly improve the model\u2019s prediction accuracy for T. ramosissima.

Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications, affecting many critical functions of proteins, including cellular communication, and their tertiary structure. In order to computationally predict N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation sites, we developed three kinds of support vector machine (SVM) model, which utilize local information, general protein information and/or subcellular localization in consideration of the binding specificity of glycosyltransferases and the characteristic subcellular localization of glycoproteins. Results: In our computational experiment, the model integrating three kinds of information achieved about 90% accuracy in predictions of both N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation sites. Moreover, our model was applied to a protein whose glycosylation sites had not been previously identified and we succeeded in showing that the glycosylation sites predicted by our model were structurally reasonable.

Solutions to the problem would be valuable to a number of applications, ranging from bioinformatics and cheminformatics to Web-related tasks, structural pattern recognition for image processing, etc. Several approaches have been proposed so far, e.g. inductive logic programming and kernels for graphs. Connectionist models were introduced too, namely recursive neural nets (RNN) and graph neural nets (GNN). Although their theoretical properties are sound and thoroughly understood, RNNs and GNNs suffer some drawbacks that may limit their application. This paper introduces an alternative connectionist framework for learning discriminant functions over graphical data. The approach is simple and suitable to maximum-a-posteriori classification of broad families of graphs, and overcomes some limitations of RNNs and GNNs. The idea is to describe a graph as an algebraic relation, i.e. as a subset of the Cartesian product. The class-posterior probabilities given the relation are then reduced (under an iid assumption) to products of probabilistic quantities, estimated using a multilayer perceptron. Empirical evidence shows that, in spite of its simplicity, the technique compares favorably with established approaches on several tasks involving different graphical representations of the data. In particular, in the classification of molecules from the Mutagenesis dataset (friendly+unfriendly) the best result to date (93.91%) is obtained.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2008.07.021", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "1981666390", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["51611119"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37711747"}

Vaccinations have numerous health benefits for immunized individuals as well as for the general public through herd immunity. Given the rise in immunization-preventable diseases, a consequence of people opting out of their routine vaccinations, we determined that Canadian health data can identify individuals over the age of 60 who chose not to get vaccinated (80.1% negative predictive value) and individuals under the age of 60 who have recently been vaccinated (96.4% positive predictive value). Using the 2009-2014 Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS), a probit model identified the variables that were most commonly associated with flu vaccination outcomes. Of 1,381 variables, 47 with the most significant marginal effects were selected, including the presence of diseases (e.g. diabetes and cancer), behavioral characteristics (e.g. smoking and exercise), exposure to the medical system (e.g. whether the individual gets a regular check-up), and a person's living situation (e.g. having young children in the household). These variables were then used to generate a Random Forest classification model, trained on the 2009-2013 dataset, and tested on the 2014 dataset. We achieved an overall accuracy of 87.8% between the two final models, each using 25 classification trees with bounded depth of 20 nodes, randomly selecting from all 47 variables. With the two proposed policies, this model can be leveraged to efficiently allocate vaccination promotion efforts. Additionally, it can be applied to future surveys, only requiring 3.6% of the variables in the CCHS for successful prediction.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1607.08656", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.7490/f1000research.1112796.1", "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2951531009,2963288337,2491518671", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["89141", "121039238", "13861754"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14926159"}

The most common method for nonresponse adjustments to compensate for the potential bias in estimates has been logistic and probit regression models.

As the generalization performance of the SVM-boundaries was strongly affected by the signal transmission path, this paper is then concerned with the integration of Spectral Kurtosis (SK) analysis in the diagnosis procedure to improve efficiency in such cases. We validate the use of both Time Synchronous Averaging and Spectral Kurtosis analysis, as signal processing tools that will automatically highlight bearing defect frequencies in the envelope spectrum. Twenty-one features (rms, peak, crest factor, band spectral energy, etc...) are extracted from the envelope of signals obtained from these two analyses and are used in the learning scheme. Results show that the generalization performance is less affected by the signal transmission path and the faulty bearing location, thus demonstrating that the modified diagnosis procedure can actually find some underlying patterns that are common to each type of bearing failure.

Several methods of machine learning have been applied to the task of predicting dementias. Given its diagnostic complexity, the great challenge lies in distinguishing patients with some type of dementia from healthy people. Particularly in the early stages, the diagnosis positively impacts the quality of life of both the patient and the family. This work presents a hybrid data mining model, involving the mining of texts integrated to the mining of structured data. This model aims to assist specialists in the diagnosis of patients with clinical suspicion of dementia. Methods The experiments were conducted from a set of 605 medical records with 19 different attributes about patients with cognitive decline reports. Firstly, a new structured attribute was created from a text mining process. It was the result of clustering the patient's pathological history information stored in an unstructured textual attribute. Classification algorithms (naive bayes, bayesian belief networks and decision trees) were applied to obtain Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment predictive models. Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests) were used in order to improve the accuracy of the generated models. These methods were applied in two datasets: one containing only the original structured data; the other containing the original structured data with the inclusion of the new attribute resulting from the text mining (hybrid model).

Label propagation is equivocally one of the most used approaches for generating sentiment lists based on annotated seed words in a manual manner. Words which are situated many hops away from the seed words tend to get low sentiment values. Such inherent property of the Label Propagation algorithm poses a controversial challenge in sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an iterative approach based on the theory of Active Learning [1] that attempts to remedy to this problem without any need for additional manual labeling. Our algorithm is bootstrapped with a limited amount of seeds. Then, at each iteration, a fixed number of \u201cinformative words\u201d are selected as new seeds for labeling according to different criteria that we will elucidate in the paper. Subsequently, the Label Propagation is retrained in the next iteration with the additional labeled seeds. A major contribution of this article is that, unlike the theory of Active Learning that prompts the user for additional labeling, we generate the additional seeds with an Artificial Oracle. This is radically different from the main stream of Active Learning Theory that resorts to a human (user) as oracle for labeling those additional seeds. Consequently, we relieve the user from the cumbersome task of manual annotation while still achieving a high performance. The lexicons were evaluated by classifying product and movie reviews.

In this work, we propose a novel and effective filtration strategy based on the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model to enhance image retrieval. As the CRF model is used to depict the dependencies of adjacent components, we regard the essential components of an image as the basic structure of CRF.

The results of experiments indicate that the simultaneous implementation of feature selection, instance selection and support vector machines parameters optimization leads to better results in terms of execution time in comparison with the stepwise implementation. In the stepwise implementation, performing instance selection process before feature selection leads to better results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, as well as reduction of execution time. The results show that the proposed methods achieve noteworthy accuracy in comparison with other methods that were used to diagnose epilepsy.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2775524119", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67249692"}

The auscultation of the heart is still an important method in the medical process because it is very simple and cheap. To detect possible heart anomalies at an early stage, an automatic method enabling cardiac health low-cost screening for the general population would be highly valuable. By analyzing the phonocardiogram signals, it is possible to perform cardiac diagnosis and find possible anomalies at an early-term. Therefore, the development of intelligent and automated analysis tools of the phonocardiogram is very relevant. In this work, we use simultaneously collected electrocardiograms and phonocardiograms from the Physionet Challenge database with the main objective of determining whether a phonocardiogram corresponds to a \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cabnormal\u201d physiological state. Our main contribution is the methodological combination of time domain features and frequency domain features of phonocardiogram signals to improve cardiac disease automatic classification. This novel approach is developed using both features. First, the phonocardiogram signals are segmented with an algorithm based on a logistic regression hidden semi-Markov model, which uses electrocardiogram signals as a reference. Then, two groups of features from the time and frequency domain are extracted from the phonocardiogram segments. One group is based on motifs and the other on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. After that, we combine these features into a two-dimensional time-frequency heat map representation. Lastly, a binary classifier is applied to both groups of features to learn a model that discriminates between normal and abnormal phonocardiogram signals. In the experiments, three classification algorithms are used: Support Vector Machines, Convolutional Neural Network, and Random Forest. The best results are achieved when both time and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients features are considered using a Support Vector Machines with a radial kernel.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31056720", "doi": "10.1007/s10916-019-1286-5", "venue": "Journal of Medical Systems", "journal": "Journal of Medical Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2944104203", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["27182742", "62181522", "18062618", "6202464", "206615265", "6405815", "15627202", "32926754", "19181744", "5826530", "16065421", "62341368", "62242590", "206882933", "61822638", "8844326", "22101272", "114914643", "13970810", "207748203", "29324453", "13432095", "7140641", "1866067", "72190159", "13649220", "13448434", "71734036", "18109896"], "inbound_citations": ["210961695", "211244573"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:145799234"}

When the network is lesioned it demonstrates many of the characteristics of the neuropsychological disorder of pure alexia. Firstly, the number of letters and words recognised is reduced, though correct phonologies are produced for more letters than words. Secondly, covert reading effects demonstrated by some pure alexic patients are apparent in the model: competence at lexical decision and semantic categorisation is superior to word naming. As with many neuropsychological patients, superordinate categorisation generates more correct responses than subordinate. Word frequency has a notable effect on the performance of both the model and pure alexic patients, with more correct judgements being made for high frequency words. Finally, degraded input can be shown to have the same effect on the model as mixed case presentation has on the performance of patients. The similarity of so many performance characteristics of the model to those of pure alexic patients leads to the conclusion that there may be a resemblance in the architectures of the two systems.", "year": 1992, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-444-89488-5.50101-9", "venue": "Artificial Neural Networks", "journal": "Artificial Neural Networks", "mag_id": "2189995086", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62091206"}

We consider caching mechanism in those networks that deliver contents to end users. The challenge comes from the dynamic content distribution problem. The distribution of data popularity is highly skewed and changing over time. Besides, the access pattern of the user requests also varies over time. Some learning algorithms for edge caching problems need to rebuild a new model periodically to adapt to system dynamics, where the knowledge learned from the past is discarded. Besides, each model updating needs a large amount of data, leading to outdated models for consecutive user requests. Inspired by the success of incremental learning approaches in processing massive data in real time, we propose an incremental learning based framework at an edge caching server.

As single-view depth estimation is an ill-posed problem, and photometric loss is incapable of discriminating distortion artifacts of warped images, the estimated depth is vague and pose is inaccurate. In contrast to previous methods, our framework learns a compact representation of frame-to-frame correlation, which is updated by incorporating sequential information. The updated representation is used for depth estimation. Besides, we tackle VO as a self-supervised image generation task and take advantage of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The generator learns to estimate depth and pose to generate a warped target image. The discriminator evaluates the quality of generated image with high-level structural perception that overcomes the problem of pixel-wise loss in previous methods.

This research focuses on steganalysis of JPEG images, because of its ubiquitous nature and low bandwidth requirement for storage and transmission. JPEG image steganalysis is generally addressed by representing an image with lower-dimensional features such as statistical properties, and then training a classifier on the feature set to differentiate between an innocent and stego image. Our approach is two fold: first, we propose a new feature reduction technique by applying Mahalanobis distance to rank the features for steganalysis. Many successful steganalysis algorithms use a large number of features relative to the size of the training set and suffer from a \u201dcurse of dimensionality\u201d: large number of feature values relative to training data size. We apply this technique to state-of-the-art steganalyzer proposed by Tomas Pevn\u00fd (54) to understand the feature space complexity and effectiveness of features for steganalysis. We show that using our approach, reduced-feature steganalyzers can be obtained that perform as well as the original steganalyzer. Based on our experimental observation, we then propose a new modeling technique for steganalysis by developing a Partially Ordered Markov Model (POMM) (23) to JPEG images and use its properties to train a Support Vector Machine. POMM generalizes the concept of local neighborhood directionality by using a partial order underlying the pixel locations. We show that the proposed steganalyzer outperforms a state-of-the-art steganalyzer by testing our approach with many different image databases, having a total of 20000 images.

They were first used in speech recognition in 1970s and have been successfully applied to the analysis of biological sequences since late 1980s as in finding protein secondary structure, CpG islands and families of related DNA or protein sequences [1]. In a HMM, the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unknown parameters, and the challenge is to determine the hidden parameters from the observable parameters. In this chapter, we described two applications using HMMs to predict gene functions in yeast and DNA copy number alternations in human tumor cells, based on gene expression microarray data. The first application employed HMMs as a gene function prediction tool to infer budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene function from time-series microarray gene expression data. The sequential observations in HMM were the discretized expression measurements at each time point for the genes from the time-series microarray experiments. Yeast is an excellent model organism which has reasonably simple genome structure, well characterized gene functions, and huge expression data sets. A wide variety of data mining methods have been applied for inferring yeast gene functions from gene expression data sets, such as Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs) [2-4]. However those methods achieved only about 40% prediction precision in function prediction of un-annotated genes [2-4]. Based on our observations, there are three main reasons for the low prediction performance. First, the computational models are too simple to address the systematic variations of biological systems. One assumption is that genes from the same function class will show a similar expression pattern. However, clustering results have shown that functions and clusters have many-to-many relationship and it is often difficult to assign a function to an expression pattern (Eisen et al., supplementary data) [5]. Second, the measurements of expression value are generally not very accurate and show experimental errors (or noise). The observed expression values may not reflect the real expression levels of genes. For example, a correlation as low as 60% was reported between measurements of the same sample hybridized to two slides [6].

However, a persistent challenge in DNA methylome analysis is the accurate identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between samples. Sensitive and specific identification of DMRs among different conditions requires accurate and efficient algorithms, and while various tools have been developed to tackle this problem, they frequently suffer from inaccurate DMR boundary identification and high false positive rate. We present a novel Histogram Of MEthylation (HOME) based method that takes into account the inherent difference in the distribution of methylation levels between DMRs and non-DMRs to discriminate between the two using a Support Vector Machine. We show that generated features used by HOME are dataset-independent such that a classifier trained on, for example, a mouse methylome training set of regions of differentially accessible chromatin, can be applied to any other organism\u2019s dataset and identify accurate DMRs. We demonstrate that DMRs identified by HOME exhibit higher association with biologically relevant genes, processes, and regulatory events compared to the existing methods. Moreover, HOME provides additional functionalities lacking in most of the current DMR finders such as DMR identification in non-CG context and time series analysis. HOME is freely available at . HOME produces more accurate DMRs than the current state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and biological datasets.

Furthermore, the visible light positioning kernel is proposed as a method to reduce the size of the fingerprint database and thus reduce the training time exponentially. Both the simulation and the experiment results show that the proposed system achieves real-time 3-D positioning with high anti-interference. Therefore, this scheme can be considered as one of the effective methods for indoor 3-D positioning.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2961939", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2996886713", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["218033", "5476476", "9431491", "44216130", "3769156", "52148117", "71568", "46981265", "1023383", "7452631", "24529922", "10874032", "115132457", "49869256", "27921309", "13547900", "2423181", "10381303", "5089796", "15037168", "116858", "15589402", "11124791", "206631525", "7058739", "202155679", "206108166", "4559027"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210971254"}

While previous research mostly focuses on the idiomatic usage detection of English verb-noun combinations and the semantic analysis of Noun Compounds (NCs), the idiomaticity issues of Chinese NCs have been rarely studied. In this work, we aim at classifying Chinese NCs into four idiomaticity degrees. Each idiomaticity degree refers to a specific paradigm of how the NCs should be interpreted. To address this task, a Relational and Compositional Representation Learning model (RCRL) is proposed, which considers the relational textual patterns and the compositionality levels of Chinese NCs. RCRL learns relational representations of NCs to capture the semantic relations between two nouns within an NC, expressed by textual patterns and their statistical signals in the corpus. It further employs compositional representations to model the compositionality levels of NCs via network embeddings. Both loss functions of idiomaticity degree classification and representation learning are jointly optimized in an integrated neural network. Experiments over two datasets illustrate the effectiveness of RCRL, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Before the 1960s, clinical examination, behavioral observation (including batteries of neuropsychological tests), and electroencephalography (EEG) were the primary research tools. Since then, new additions to the repertoire have included genetic analysis, and importantly for our purposes, brain imaging (both structural and functional). Furthermore, the amount of data that can be acquired by the genetic and neuroimaging tools has grown to such levels that advanced and intensive computational methods are required to analyze the data. However, computational techniques can be used for more than data analysis, as a recent paper in this issue by Wendling et al. (2010) demonstrates. In an article that reviews a variety of computational methods for characterizing functional brain connectivity from electrophysiological data, specifically in the context of partial epilepsy, Wendling et al. also employ a physiologically plausible neural model to generate simulated data and illustrate how such modeling can be used to help interpret the experimental data. This Wendling et al. study, along with some others (Horwitz et al., 1995; Schlosser et al., 2006; Husain, 2007; Alstott et al., 2009; Kim and Horwitz, 2009; van Albada et al., 2009; Rowe, 2010; Seghier et al., 2010), suggests that neural modeling may soon become a useful addition to the clinical research toolkit for investigating brain disorders. ::: ::: The particular issue addressed by Wendling et al. (2010) centers on identifying, prior to brain surgery, the epileptogenic zone (EZ) responsible for seizures in patients with partial epilepsy. The data come from depth electrode EEG recordings obtained during pre-surgical evaluation. What makes such data hard to interpret is that the spatial organization of the EZ corresponds to a network of distributed neural populations \u201cshowing \u2018hyperexcitability\u2019 and \u2018hypersynchronization\u2019 properties\u201d (Wendling et al., 2010). In an attempt to unravel the relationships between these various populations, a variety of signal processing techniques have been proposed to determine the functional connectivities among the epileptogenic network neural populations. Wendling et al. illustrate one such functional connectivity method in detail, non-linear regression analysis. ::: ::: However, the availability of large numbers of potential methods for evaluating the statistical relationships between time-varying signals, each resting on specific assumptions about the underlying neural relationship between the signals, makes it imperative to have a way to see whether a given method actually produces a result that properly reflects the underlying neural relationships (for a recent review, see Banerjee et al., 2012a). For this purpose, Wendling et al. (2010) demonstrate how a biologically realistic model of coupled neuronal populations can be employed to simulate EEG data similar to the data that are experimentally acquired. They apply the non-linear regression analysis method to the simulated data and show that this particular connectivity method captures the \u201cground truth\u201d of the relationships embedded in the model. Because in an actual brain from which data are collected we have no way of knowing the relationships among the network elements, this use of neural modeling thus allows one to partially verify that a functional connectivity method permits an interpretation that corresponds to the underlying relationship between the neural elements. ::: ::: Using neural modeling to help assess the interpretability of various functional and effective brain connectivity methods has started to become an important component for analyzing connectivity analysis techniques. Examples of previous studies that utilized this approach include Kim and Horwitz (2009), Wendling et al. (2009), and Banerjee et al. (2012b). However, there are other uses by which neural modeling can play a significant role in the clinical research of brain disorders. One type of neural modeling, what has been called systems-level neural modeling (Horwitz et al., 1999), attempts to evaluate the strengths of the direct connections between brain regions (i.e., the interregional effective connectivity), and has been applied to functional neuroimaging data in a number of studies to assess differences between patients and healthy subjects (e.g., Horwitz et al., 1995; Schlosser et al., 2006; Rowe, 2010; Seghier et al., 2010). This approach takes the acquired data and utilizes it to fit the parameters of the model. However, one can turn the approach around and simulate data (at the brain region level) and explore the simulated data to determine how parameter modification that may characterize a brain disorder alters the simulated neuroimaging signals. A good example of this can be found in Alstott et al. (2009), where the impact of brain lesions on simulated resting fMRI data was assessed. ::: ::: A third way in which neural modeling is beginning to contribute as a clinical neuroscience tool is in terms of helping understand the neural basis of a disorder. Here, one would use a large-scale neural model consisting of multiple neuronal units in several brain regions. Specific proposals concerning the neural substrate of a disorder could be incorporated into the neural model by explicit changes in model parameter values; simulated data could then be generated and compared with corresponding experimental data. An fMRI example is found in Husain\u2019s (2007) work on tinnitus and an EEG illustration comes from a study by van Albada et al. (2009) related to Parkinson's disease. ::: ::: Obviously, neural modeling, like any other method, has limitations. For example, an important simplification of the class of neural models used by Wendling et al. (2010) arises from the use of a mean-field assumption: the activity of a brain region is represented by the summed membrane potentials rather than neural spiking activity. Computational work is currently in progress to relate the more realistic neural spiking approach to the mean-field modeling framework (Coombes, 2010). Overcoming such limitations should result in greater use of neural modeling as a useful clinical research tool.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3412278", "pubmed_id": "22888313", "doi": "10.3389/fnsys.2012.00057", "venue": "Front.

However, most of these architectures require a large amount of training data and employ random initialization. In this paper, we propose to stack feature learning modules for the design of deep architectures. Specifically, marginal Fisher analysis (MFA) is stacked layer-by-layer for the initialization and we call the constructed deep architecture marginal deep architecture (MDA). When implementing the MDA, the weight matrices of MFA are updated layer-by-layer, which is a supervised pre-training method and does not need a large scale of data.

Due to this environment, the world is now facing a revolution in the process that data is searched, collected, stored, and shared. Abundance of data gives us several opportunities to knowledge discovery and data mining techniques. In recent years, data mining methods as a solution to discovery and extraction of available knowledge in database has been more popular in many fields such as movie recommendation of e-commerce service. However, most of classification approaches for predicting movie popularity have used only several types of information of the movie such as actor, director, rating score, language and countries etc. In this study, we propose a classification-based support vector machine (SVM) model for predicting the movie popularity based on movie\u2019s genre data and social network data. Social network analysis (SNA) is used for improving the classification accuracy. This study builds the movies\u2019 network (one mode network) based on initial data which is a two mode network as user-to-movie network. For the proposed method we computed degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality as centrality measures in movie\u2019s network. Those four centrality values and movies\u2019 genre data were used to classify the movie popularity in this study. The logistic regression, neural network, naive Bayes classifier, and decision tree as benchmarking models for movie popularity classification were also used for comparison with the performance of our proposed model. To assess the classifier\u2019s performance accuracy this study used MovieLens data as an open database.

Due to the large number of transcripts, relatively limited number of samples, and high variability of data, identification of predictive biomarkers is a challenge for data analysis. Furthermore, many genes may be responsible for drug response differences, but often only a few are sufficient for accurate prediction. Here we present an analysis approach, the Convergent Random Forest (CRF) method, for the identification of highly predictive biomarkers. The aim is to select from genome-wide expression data a small number of non-redundant biomarkers that could be developed into a simple and robust diagnostic tool. Our method combines the Random Forest classifier and gene expression clustering to rank and select a small number of predictive genes. We evaluated the CRF approach by analyzing four different data sets. The first set contains transcript profiles of whole blood from rheumatoid arthritis patients, collected before anti-TNF treatment, and their subsequent response to the therapy. In this set, CRF identified 8 transcripts predicting response to therapy with 89% accuracy. We also applied the CRF to the analysis of three previously published expression data sets. For all sets, we have compared the CRF and recursive support vector machines (RSVM) approaches to feature selection and classification. In all cases the CRF selects much smaller number of features, five to eight genes, while achieving similar or better performance on both training and independent testing sets of data.

Computational methods that provide structural details of these interactions are needed since, despite their importance, relatively few structures of membrane protein complexes are available.ResultsWe present a method for predicting which residues are in protein-protein binding sites within the transmembrane regions of membrane proteins. The method uses a Random Forest classifier trained on residue type distributions and evolutionary conservation for individual surface residues, followed by spatial averaging of the residue scores. The prediction accuracy achieved for membrane proteins is comparable to that for non-membrane proteins. Also, like previous results for non-membrane proteins, the accuracy is significantly higher for residues distant from the binding site boundary. Furthermore, a predictor trained on non-membrane proteins was found to yield poor accuracy on membrane proteins, as expected from the different distribution of surface residue types between the two classes of proteins. Thus, although the same procedure can be used to predict binding sites in membrane and non-membrane proteins, separate predictors trained on each class of proteins are required. Finally, the contribution of each residue property to the overall prediction accuracy is analyzed and prediction examples are discussed.ConclusionGiven a membrane protein structure and a multiple alignment of related sequences, the presented method gives a prioritized list of which surface residues participate in intramembrane protein-protein interactions.

For one-class learning scheme with the kernel function, such as one-class Support Vector Machine and Support Vector Data Description, besides the parameters involved in the kernel, there is another one-class specific parameter: the rejection rate v. In this paper, we proposed a general framework to involve the majority class in solving the parameter selection problem. In this framework, we first use the minority target class for training in the one-class classification stage; then we use both minority and majority class for estimating the generalization performance of the constructed classifier. This generalization performance is set as the optimization criteria. We employed the Grid search and Experiment Design search to attain various parameter settings. Experiments on UCI and Reuters text data show that the parameter optimized one-class classifiers outperform all the standard one-class learning schemes we examined.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4304/jcp.1.7.32-40", "venue": "JCP", "journal": "JCP", "mag_id": "1986563448", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["51985458", "12223943", "18057587", "13017894", "768554", "51800507", "3615360", "135065115", "51886683", "20573023", "39868010", "6886973", "17123336", "56895500", "925096", "7491035", "17686631", "157367275", "221809", "30876112", "9560720", "41955301", "120550001", "14878919", "16564527", "39436988", "3584513", "16780476", "7416560", "52816695", "202618731", "214746223"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38289819"}

Methods: Twenty-three neurosurgeons and senior neurosurgery residents comprising the\"skilled\"group and 92 junior neurosurgery residents and medical students the\"novice\"group. The task involved removing a series of virtual brain tumors without causing injury to surrounding tissue. Over 100 features were extracted and 68 selected using t-test analysis.

Results: Ratios of train set size to test set size from 10% to 90% and 5 to 30 features, chosen by the forward feature selection algorithm, were employed. A working point of 50% train to test set size ratio and 15 features resulted in an equal error rates as low as 8.3% using the Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.

The proposed method is used to select the optimal parameter combination with less time to achieve the better performance of SVR. Firstly, trisection is adopted according to the span of each parameter, thus, three medians as test points could be available for each parameter. Totally 27 parameter combinations (c,g,p) and MSEs of corresponding SVRs could be achieved. Then the mapping relationship between the 27 combinations (c,g,p) and their MSEs could be established.

Water regions are extracted from the MODIS images using image classification (based on spectral information) and image segmentation (based on spatial information). Multi-temporal MODIS images from \u201cnormal\u201d (non-flood) and flood time-periods are processed in two steps. In the first step, image classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) separate the image pixels into water and non-water groups based on their spectral features. The classified image is then segmented using spatial features of the water pixels to remove the misclassified water.

With respect to such observation, we propose a novel learning paradigm for hashing, called Discriminatively Local Hashing for Preserving Semantic Manifold (DLH for short), in a more general Manifold space. More specifically, appropriate nearest neighbors are firstly selected for Graph semantics with Euclidean metric in order to preserving semantic manifold; then supervised labels are further leveraged to distinguish which are real neighbors in the previous selected ones for fine-tuning the semantic embedding.

The focus of this research was to assess the potential to operationalize shoreline sensitivity mapping to inform oil spill response and contingency planning. The impact of varying the training sample size and reducing model data load were evaluated. Results showed that acceptable accuracies could be achieved with relatively few training samples, but that higher accuracies and greater probabilities of correct class assignment were observed with larger sample sizes.

The ILES aggregates multiple sublearning machines by different weights for better accuracy. When new data set arrives, a new submachine will be trained and aggregated into ensemble soft sensor model according to its weight. The other submachines' weights will be updated at the same time. Then a new updated soft sensor ensemble model can be obtained. The weight updating rules are designed by considering the prediction accuracy of submachines with new arrived data. So the update can fit the data change and obtain new information efficiently. The sizing percentage soft sensor model is established to learn the information from the production data in the sizing of industrial processes and to test the performance of ILES, where the ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) is selected as the sublearning machine. The comparison is done among new method, single ELM, AdaBoost.R ELM, and OS-ELM, and the test of the extensions is done with three test functions.

However, the challenge in predicting the Bitcoin exchange rate is its high volatility. Therefore, the prediction of its behavior is of great importance for financial markets. In this way, recent studies have been carried out on what internal and/or external Bitcoin information is relevant to its prediction. The increased use of machine learning techniques to predict time series and the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments motivated the present study to seek more accurate predictions for the Bitcoin exchange rate. In this way, in a first stage of the proposed methodology, different feature selection techniques were evaluated in order to obtain the most relevant attributes for the predictions. In the sequence, it was analyzed the behavior of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Ensemble algorithms (based on Recurrent Neural Networks and the k-Means clustering method) for price direction predictions. Likewise, the ANN and SVM were employed for regression of the maximum, minimum and closing prices of the Bitcoin. Moreover, the regression results were also used as inputs to try to improve the price direction predictions. The results showed that the selected attributes and the best machine learning model achieved an improvement of more than 10%, in accuracy, for the price direction predictions, with respect to the state-of-the-art papers, using the same period of information. In relation to the maximum, minimum and closing Bitcoin prices regressions, it was possible to obtain Mean Absolute Percentage Errors between 1% and 2%.

Safety technologies, such as air bags or antilock-braking systems (ABS), have been providing a much higher level of safety to road traffic participants. Intelligent vehicles that can actively help to prevent accidents are also being investigated and developed. One area of research is in speed sign detection systems that alert the driver to the current speed limit. Vision-based systems that are able to detect and classify speed signs have been under investigation since the late 1980s [1]. Many techniques have been explored, including artificial neural network (ANN) [2, 3], Support Vector Machine (SVM) [4], gradient-based detection [5\u20137], geometric labeling [8] and signature (FFT) matching [9]. Most of those algorithms perform well in a limited range of lightning conditions, which are normally restricted to daytime lighting conditions. In order to be reliably integrated into an automobile, any vision system needs to be able to run accurately and in real-time regardless of weather and lighting conditions. Detecting speed signs in nighttime driving conditions is a challenging task. The major reasons for this are the low contrast of the objects under low illumination and distortions introduced by the camera used in the vision system. Generally, a camera reduces its shutter speed and/or increases its sensitivity (ISO) index to record images in low light. As a result, the noise level in the images increases significantly. The term noise here refers to the graininess of the image due to high ISO, motion blur due to slow shutter speed, low contrast due to under-illuminated objects, saturation due to direct head lights and color distortions (in the case of color camera used). In modern video cameras, distortion may be reduced by the prudent use of the gain control (which amplifies both signal and noise) and high dynamic range mode (which reduces the over-saturation problem but compresses information at bright", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-0-387-74938-9_31", "venue": "Advances in Communication Systems and Electrical Engineering", "journal": "Advances in Communication Systems and Electrical Engineering", "mag_id": "21866004", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["2090272"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59772593"}
