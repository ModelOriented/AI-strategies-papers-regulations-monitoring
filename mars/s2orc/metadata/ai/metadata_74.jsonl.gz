Given a new testing image, the challenge requires an identify for the image and the corresponding confidence score.

This is a prevalent setting in real-world classification problems and numerous well-established theoretical results in the classical supervised learning paradigm will break down under this setting. In addition, the increasing privacy protection awareness restricts access to source domain samples and poses new challenges for the development of privacy-preserving transfer learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private multiple-source hypothesis transfer learning method for logistic regression. The target learner operates on differentially private hypotheses and importance weighting information from the sources to construct informative Gaussian priors for its logistic regression model. By leveraging a publicly available auxiliary data set, the importance weighting information can be used to determine the relationship between the source domain and the target domain without leaking source data privacy. Our approach provides a robust performance boost even when high quality labeled samples are extremely scarce in the target data set. The extensive experiments on two real-world data sets confirm the performance improvement of our approach over several baselines.

Deep learning of similarities is often based on relationships between pairs or triplets of samples. Many of these relations are unreliable and mutually contradicting, implying inconsistencies when trained without supervision information that relates different tuples or triplets to each other. To overcome this problem, we use local estimates of reliable (dis-)similarities to initially group samples into compact surrogate classes and use local partial orders of samples to classes to link classes to each other. Similarity learning is then formulated as a partial ordering task with soft correspondences of all samples to classes.

The first one is based on the fact that in the minimax game which is played to optimize the GAN objective the generator network keeps on changing even after the network can be considered optimal. As such ensembles of GANs can be constructed based on the same network initialization but just taking models which have different amount of iterations. These so-called self ensembles are much faster to train than traditional ensembles. The second method, called cascade GANs, redirects part of the training data which is badly modeled by the first GAN to another GAN.

This geometric flow indicates directions in which the image gray levels have regular variations. Feature vector is formulated by computing the mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the Bandelet coefficients. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is chosen as the classifier.

Therefore, features based on shape are suitable to be used for recognizing Arabic subword handwriting since each of the character has various characteristics such as diacritics, thinning and strokes. These characteristics can contribute to particular a shape that is unique and can represent Arabic subword handwriting. Currently, geometry shape such as triangle has been adopted to extract useful features based on triangle properties without implicating any triangle form. In order to increase classification accuracy, these properties have been categorized into several zones where the number of features produced is directly proportional to the number of zones. Nevertheless, shape representation does not implicate any triangle properties such as ratio of side, angle and gradient. By using shape representation, it helps in reducing the number of features. Thus, this paper presents feature based on triangle shape that can represent the identity of Arabic subword handwriting. The method based on triangle shape identifies three main coordinates of triangle formed based on selected centroids. The AHDB dataset is used as a testing data. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), respectively were used to measure the accuracy of the proposed method using triangle shape as a feature. The accuracy results have shown better outcome with 77.65% (SVM) and 76.43% (RF), which prove the feature based on triangle shape is applicable for Arabic subword handwriting recognition.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14569/ijacsa.2018.091224", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2906875450", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8148915", "22625307", "1735894", "46039683", "64172667", "52051000", "112985205", "17582829", "16673453", "16174386", "4025242", "17550731", "17965494", "53136775", "15326934"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59552950"}

The computational power of the reservoir is contingent on this temporal multiplexing. Here, we learn optimal temporal multiplexing by means of a biologically inspired homeostatic plasticity mechanism. Plasticity acts locally and changes the distances between the subunits along the delay, depending on how responsive these subunits are to the input. After analytically deriving the learning mechanism, we illustrate its role in improving the reservoir's computational power. To this end, we investigate, first, the increase of the reservoir's memory capacity.

Keywords: systematicity; classicism; connectionism; compo- sitionality; category theory; product; functor; adjunction Abstract Classical and Connectionist theories of cognitive architec- ture \u201cexplain\u201d systematicity, whereby the capacity for some cognitive behaviors is intrinsically linked to the capacity for others, as a consequence of syntactically and functionally combinatorial representations, respectively. However, both theories depend on ad hoc assumptions to exclude specific architectures\u2014grammars, or Connectionist networks\u2014that do not account for systematicity. By analogy with the Ptole- maic (i.e., geocentric) theory of planetary motion, although either theory can be made to be consistent with the data, both nonetheless fail to explain it (Aizawa, 2003b). Category theory provides an alternative explanation based on the for- mal concept of adjunction, which consists of a pair of struc- ture preserving maps, called functors. A functor generalizes the notion of a map between representational states to in- clude a map between state transformations (processes). In a formal sense, systematicity is a necessary consequence of a \u201chigher-order\u201d theory of cognitive architecture, in contrast to the \u201cfirst-order\u201d theories derived from Classicism or Con- nectionism. Category theory offers a re-conceptualization for cognitive science, analogous to the one that Copernicus provided for astronomy, where representational states are no longer the center of the cognitive universe\u2014replaced by the relationships between the maps that transform them. Introduction For more than two decades since Fodor and Pylyshyn\u2019s sem- inal paper on the foundations of a theory of cognitive archi- tecture (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988), the problem of explaining systematicity remains unresolved (Aizawa, 2003b) despite numerous Classicist and Connectionist claims to the contrary (Fodor & McLaughlin, 1990; van Gelder, 1990; Smolensky, The problem of systematicity for a theory of cognition is to explain why the capacity for some cognitive behaviours is intrinsically linked to some other cognitive capacities. The systematicity problem is actually three problems: 1. Systematicity of representation\u2014why is it the case that the capacity to generate some representations (e.g., the repre- sentation John loves Mary) is intrinsically linked to the 2. Systematicity of inference\u2014why is it the case that the ca- pacity to make some inferences (e.g., that John is the lover in the proposition John loves Mary ) is intrinsically linked to the capacity to make some other inferences (e.g., that Mary is the lover in the proposition Mary loves John )? 3. Compositionality of representation\u2014why is it the case that the capacity for some semantic content (e.g., the thought that John loves Mary , however that thought may be repre- sented) is intrinsically linked to the capacity for some other semantic context (e.g., the thought that Mary loves John , however that thought may also be represented)? These problems are logically independent\u2014one does not nec- essarily follow from another (Aizawa, 2003a), and so a theory is required it explain all three. Classicists and Connectionists employ some form of com- binatorial representations to explain systematicity. For Clas- sicists, representations are combined in such a way that to- kening of representations of complex entities entails tokening of representations of their constituent entities, so that the syn- tactic relationships between the constituent representations mirror the semantics ones\u2014systematicity is a result of a com- binatorial syntax and semantics (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988). For Connectionists, representations of complex entities are constructed more generally so that their tokening does not necessarily imply tokening constituent entity representations (van Gelder, 1990; Smolensky, 1987). We refer to the for- mer as classical compositionality, and the latter as functional compositionality. In general, a Classical or Connectionist architecture can demonstrate systematicity by having the \u201cright\u201d collection of grammatical rules, or functions such that one capacity is indivisibly linked to another. Suppose, for example, a Classical system with the following three production rules: G1: P \u2192 Agent loves Patient Agent \u2192 John | Mary Patient \u2192 John | Mary. The capacities to generate all four representations (i.e., John loves John, John loves Mary, etc.) are indivisibly linked, because the presence of all three, or absence of any one of those rules means the system is only capable of generating either all or none of those representations.

Then we propose an Allocation algorithm to distribute the VMs among the PMs, which is based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The ultimate goal that not only minimizes the VM migration probability but also maximizes the PM resources as much as possible. According to the training data in a period time, the classified VMs can be allocated into the PMs with the lowest VM migration probability by the proposed Allocation algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve lower VM migration probability and reduce the cost for the cloud environments.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.202", "venue": "2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications & 2013 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing", "journal": "2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications & 2013 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1995395541", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5915977", "41003703", "34461586", "207401409", "37680391", "64122362", "6478144", "35055811", "16868464", "15299808", "2705898", "14592680", "17889054", "12048645", "8322831", "599570", "207165665", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["38178708", "23202419", "211088660", "13755241", "18574777", "2288025"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7977601"}

Vision systems are typically used to determine the position and orientation of objects in the workstation, enabling them to be transported and assembled by a robotic cell (e.g. industrial manipulator). These systems commonly resort to CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) Cameras fixed and located in a particular work area or attached directly to the robotic arm (eye-in-hand vision system). Although it is a valid approach, the performance of these vision systems is directly influenced by the industrial environment lighting. Taking all these into consideration, a new approach is proposed for eye-on-hand systems, where the use of cameras will be replaced by the 2D Laser Range Finder (LRF). The LRF will be attached to a robotic manipulator, which executes a pre-defined path to produce grayscale images of the workstation. With this technique the environment lighting interference is minimized resulting in a more reliable and robust computer vision system. After the grayscale image is created, this work focuses on the recognition and classification of different objects using inherent features (based on the invariant moments of Hu) with the most well-known machine learning models: k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Neural Networks (NNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In order to achieve a good performance for each classification model, a wrapper method is used to select one good subset of features, as well as an assessment model technique called K-fold cross-validation to adjust the parameters of the classifiers. The performance of the models is also compared, achieving performances of 83.5% for kNN, 95.5% for the NN and 98.9% for the SVM (generalized accuracy). These high performances are related with the feature selection algorithm based on the simulated annealing heuristic, and the model assessment (k-fold cross-validation). It makes possible to identify the most important features in the recognition process, as well as the adjustment of the best parameters for the machine learning models, increasing the classification ratio of the work objects present in the robot's environment.

Furthermore, while there have been works addressing the computational challenge with respect to the length of string, most of them still experience quadratic complexity in terms of the number of training samples when used in a kernel-based classifier. In this paper, we present a new class of global string kernels that aims to (i) discover global properties hidden in the strings through global alignments, (ii) maintain positive-definiteness of the kernel, without introducing a diagonal dominant kernel matrix, and (iii) have a training cost linear with respect to not only the length of the string but also the number of training string samples. To this end, the proposed kernels are explicitly defined through a series of different random feature maps, each corresponding to a distribution of random strings. We show that kernels defined this way are always positive-definite, and exhibit computational benefits as they always produce \\emph{Random String Embeddings (RSE)} that can be directly used in any linear classification models.

Perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers. Almost all CSTSs are involved in regulating the expression of certain genes and leading to signature changes in gene expression. Therefore, the gene expression profile of a cell is the readout of the state of its CSTS and could be used to infer CSTS. However, a gene expression profile is a convoluted mixture of the responses to all active signaling pathways in cells. Therefore it is difficult to find the genes associated with an individual pathway. An efficient way of de-convoluting signals embedded in the gene expression profile is needed. ::: At the beginning of the thesis, we applied Pearson correlation coefficient analysis to study cellular signals transduced from ceramide species (lipids) to genes. We found significant correlations between specific ceramide species or ceramide groups and gene expression. We showed that various dihydroceramide families regulated distinct subsets of target genes predicted to participate in distinct biologic processes. However, it\u2019s well known that the signaling pathway structure is hierarchical. Useful information may not be fully detected if only linear models are used to study CSTS. More complex non-linear models are needed to represent the hierarchical structure of CSTS. This motivated us to investigate contemporary deep learning models (DLMs). ::: Later, we applied various deep hierarchical models to learn a distributed representation of statistical structures embedded in transcriptomic data. The models learn and represent the hierarchical organization of transcriptomic machinery. Besides, they provide an abstract representation of the statistical structure of transcriptomic data with flexibility and different degrees of granularity. We showed that deep hierarchical models were capable of learning biologically sensible representations of the data (e.g., the hidden units in the first hidden layer could represent transcription factors) and revealing novel insights regarding the machinery regulating gene expression.

Modern high-content-screening devices easily produce thousands of cell images, but the resulting data is usually unlabelled and it requires extra effort to construct a visual representation that supports the grouping according to the presented morphological characteristics. Results We introduce a novel approach to visual representation learning that is guided by metadata. In high-context-screening, meta-data can typically be derived from the experimental layout, which links each cell image of a particular assay to the tested chemical compound and corresponding compound concentration. In general, there exists a one-to-many relationship between phenotype and compound, since various molecules and different dosage can lead to one and the same alterations in biological cells. Our empirical results show that metadata-guided visual representation learning is an effective approach for clustering biomedical images. We have evaluated our proposed approach on both benchmark and real-world biological data.

There are various kinds of fuzzers with different fuzzing strategies, and most of them perform well on their targets. However, in industry practice and empirical study, the performance and generalization ability of those well-designed fuzzing strategies are challenged by the complexity and diversity of real-world applications. ::: In this paper, inspired by the idea of ensemble learning, we first propose an ensemble fuzzing approach EnFuzz, that integrates multiple fuzzing strategies to obtain better performance and generalization ability than that of any constituent fuzzer alone. First, we define the diversity of the base fuzzers and choose those most recent and well-designed fuzzers as base fuzzers. Then, EnFuzz ensembles those base fuzzers with seed synchronization and result integration mechanisms. For evaluation, we implement EnFuzz , a prototype basing on four strong open-source fuzzers (AFL, AFLFast, AFLGo, FairFuzz), and test them on Google's fuzzing test suite, which consists of widely used real-world applications. The 24-hour experiment indicates that, with the same resources usage, these four base fuzzers perform variously on different applications, while EnFuzz shows better generalization ability and always outperforms others in terms of path coverage, branch coverage and crash discovery. Even compared with the best cases of AFL, AFLFast, AFLGo and FairFuzz, EnFuzz discovers 26.8%, 117%, 38.8% and 39.5% more unique crashes, executes 9.16%, 39.2%, 19.9% and 20.0% more paths and covers 5.96%, 12.0%, 21.4% and 11.1% more branches respectively.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1807.00182", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2810405994", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["29430742", "207738357", "15868670", "6644398", "14087760", "16821651", "12516527", "5846986", "14317314", "2594813", "678316", "23369575", "1616522", "4835415", "19261171", "49299870", "868674"], "inbound_citations": ["203902397", "53082715", "52115104", "84186957", "84183446"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49557490"}

Color features are extracted using a novel approach based on Speeded-up Robust Features (SURF).

The CO2/CO ratio is generally considered as an indicator for paper involvement in a transformer fault. The ratio CO2/CO < 3 indicates excessive paper degradation. These can be confirmed by complementing DGA analysis with HPLC (High performance liquid chromatography). HPLC is a well-known analytical technique for the purification, identification, separation and quantification of organic compounds from mixtures. HPLC is the most commonly used method for detection of five furan derivatives, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF), 2-furfurylalcohol (2- FOL), 2-furfural (2-FAL), 2-acetylfuran (2-ACF) and 5- methyl-2-furfural (5-MEF), dissolved in transformer oil (5). To assess the stability of the furan compounds under the experimental conditions, 2-furfuryl alcohol, 2-furaldehyde, 2-acetylfuran and 5-methylfurfural were added to oil at a level of about 20mg/l, heated in a sealed ampoule and analyzed periodically for furans. The oil was prepared to contain about 1% of oxygen and 10mg/l water (6). Material and methods 1. Material We have used in this study one hundred and sixteen transformers mentioned in reference (7).

However, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work develops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference, which is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We propose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs with quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image into superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels depends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF is an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as superpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an intuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF. For efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an approximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller domain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion moves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly lower energy compared to that of mean field inference.

Various stages of processing are undergone such as pre- processing for noise removal, nuclei segmentation, feature extraction, classification and feature selection. Since, the textural analysis of the nucleus structure plays an important strategy for the classification among the cell, the densitometry features of nuclei such as Energy, Entropy, Contrast, Correlation, Cluster Shade, and Cluster Prominence is being utilized. In classification phase, optimal features are selected from the textural features of nuclei which is been used as the inputs for the Support Vector Machine.

The classification performance of the SVM was experimented with original combinational feature that results within 90%.

To this end we propose a general-purpose reading architecture that is employed prior to a task-specific NLU model. It is responsible for refining context-agnostic word representations with contextual information and lends itself to the introduction of additional, context-relevant information from external knowledge sources. We demonstrate that previously non-competitive models benefit dramatically from employing contextual representations, closing the gap between general-purpose reading architectures and the state-of-the-art performance obtained with fine-tuned, task-specific architectures.

A standard data collection and classification work-flow requires significant manual effort for segment size tuning, feature selection and rule-based classifier design. In this paper, we propose an alternative learning-based approach using feature learning to minimise the manual effort required. We apply this system to the classification of invasive weed species. Small UAVs are suited to this application, as they can collect data at high spatial resolutions, which is essential for the classification of small or localised weed outbreaks. In this paper, we apply feature learning to generate a bank of image filters that allows for the extraction of features that discriminate between the weeds of interest and background objects. These features are pooled to summarise the image statistics and form the input to a texton-based linear classifier that classifies an image patch as weed or background. We evaluated our approach to weed classification on three weeds of significance in Australia: water hyacinth, tropical soda apple and serrated tussock.

Its potential uses in the field of geotechnical engineering are not fully explored with sufficient vigour,probably due to economic reasons and highly heterogeneous nature of soil. Taking this into account, if the instrument can be calibrated specifically for geotechnical purposes, it can reduce the number of experimental analyses that needs to be carried on soil and can also reduce the necessity of undisturbed samples of soil to a good extend. The present study discusses the calibration of GPR, through clay content of soil with some of its properties like particle density, bulk density, porosity, void ratio with the dielectric permittivity and peak wave frequency which are obtained from GPR data. Based on the database available in literature, the detection of clay content in three different grades of soil A1,A2 and A3, classified as per American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials(AASHTO) are done using some recently developed AI techniques, multigene genetic programming (MGGP) and feature selection using NSGA-II, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Gaussian process regression (GPR)and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The predictive capabilities of these methods are discussed through coefficient of correlation(R2), Nash Sutecliffe coefficient of efficiency (E) root mean square ::: error(RMSE), average absolute error (AAE) and maximum absolute error(MAE).

Deep polynomial network (DPN) is well-suited to integrate these modalities since it can represent any function on a finite sample dataset via the supervised deep learning algorithm. We propose a multimodal DPN (MDPN) algorithm to effectively integrate these modalities to enhance prediction performance.

Here we build upon previous work on airborne species detection by using a two-stage support vector machine (SVM) classifier to first predict species from hyperspectral data at the pixel scale. Tree crowns are segmented from the lidar imagery such that crown-level information, such as maximum tree height, can then be combined with the pixel-level species probabilities to predict the species of each tree. An overall prediction accuracy of 76% was achieved for 15 species. We also show that bidirectional reflectance distribution (BRDF) effects caused by anisotropic scattering properties of savanna vegetation can result in flight line artifacts evident in species probability maps, yet these can be largely mitigated by applying a semi-empirical BRDF model to the hyperspectral data.

An attempt to mitigate this problem is to estimate the health status of colonies and indicate an imminent collapsing state to beekeepers. To estimate the health status of bee colonies, we propose a method for calibrating a classification algorithm based on a supervised machine learning approach.

We used internal temperature and beehive weight as well as weather data (temperature, dew point, wind direction, wind speed, rainfall, and daylight). We also used 703 in loco apiary inspections made on a weekly basis to add to the data from sensors for the labeling needed in the training phase of supervised learning algorithms.

Defect prediction models can be developed using software metrics in combination with defect data for predicting defective classes. Various studies have been conducted to find the relationship between software metrics and defect proneness, but there are few studies that statistically determine the effectiveness of the results. ObjectiveThe main objectives of the study are (i) comparison of the machine-learning techniques using data sets obtained from popular open source software (ii) use of appropriate performance measures for measuring the performance of defect prediction models (iii) use of statistical tests for effective comparison of machine-learning techniques and (iv) validation of models over different releases of data sets. MethodIn this study we use object-oriented metrics for predicting defective classes using 18 machine-learning techniques. The proposed framework has been applied to seven application packages of well known, widely used Android operating system viz. Contact, MMS, Bluetooth, Email, Calendar, Gallery2 and Telephony. The results are validated using 10-fold and inter-release validation methods. The reliability and significance of the results are evaluated using statistical test and post-hoc analysis.

The results also depict that the difference between the ML techniques is statistically significant. However, it is also proved that the Support Vector Machines based techniques such as Support Vector Machines and voted perceptron do not possess the predictive capability for predicting defects. ConclusionThe results confirm the predictive capability of various ML techniques for developing defect prediction models. The results also confirm the superiority of one ML technique over the other ML techniques. Thus, the software engineers can use the results obtained from this study in the early phases of the software development for identifying defect-prone classes of given software.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2016.04.032", "venue": "Appl.

Thus, it leads to project cost reduction and time schedule improvement. Previous studies on this topic have been based on single sources of data (e.g., kinematic, audio, video signals) for automated activity-detection purposes. However, relying on only one source of data is not appropriate, as the selected data source may not be applicable under certain conditions and fails to provide accurate results.

On one hand, the complete training process is separated into two stages. The Stage-I generator is trained for decreasing the Earth-Mover distance between real and generated distributions. The Stage-II generator aims at explicitly reducing the distance further based on the Stage-I generator. On the other hand, the discriminator is treated as a projector from image to scalar. The discriminator tries to make the boundary between real and generated distributions clear in scalar space. Thus the generator synthesizes more realistic images, thanks to the extra adversarial boundary information.

First, the number of shared electric vehicles that check out from parking stations is predicted based on the random forest algorithm. Then, a mobile model of the shared electric vehicle is established. Based on the mobile model, the number of shared electric vehicles that check in within the target period is calculated and whether they reach the starvation state are determined.

Species classification with DNA Barcode sequences has been proven effective on different organisms. Indeed, specific gene regions have been identified as Barcode: COI in animals, rbcL and matK in plants, and ITS in fungi. The classification problem assigns an unknown specimen to a known species by analyzing its Barcode. This task has to be supported with reliable methods and algorithms.MethodsIn this work the efficacy of supervised machine learning methods to classify species with DNA Barcode sequences is shown. The Weka software suite, which includes a collection of supervised classification methods, is adopted to address the task of DNA Barcode analysis. Classifier families are tested on synthetic and empirical datasets belonging to the animal, fungus, and plant kingdoms. In particular, the function-based method Support Vector Machines (SVM), the rule-based RIPPER, the decision tree C4.5, and the Na\u00efve Bayes method are considered. Additionally, the classification results are compared with respect to ad-hoc and well-established DNA Barcode classification methods.ResultsA software that converts the DNA Barcode FASTA sequences to the Weka format is released, to adapt different input formats and to allow the execution of the classification procedure. The analysis of results on synthetic and real datasets shows that SVM and Na\u00efve Bayes outperform on average the other considered classifiers, although they do not provide a human interpretable classification model. Rule-based methods have slightly inferior classification performances, but deliver the species specific positions and nucleotide assignments. On synthetic data the supervised machine learning methods obtain superior classification performances with respect to the traditional DNA Barcode classification methods. On empirical data their classification performances are at a comparable level to the other methods.ConclusionsThe classification analysis shows that supervised machine learning methods are promising candidates for handling with success the DNA Barcoding species classification problem, obtaining excellent performances.

There have been numerous studies on question classification in accordance to Bloom taxonomy in assessments to measure cognitive level of learners in higher learning institutions. But it has not been effective yet to resolve overlapping issue of Bloom taxonomy verb keywords being assigned to more than one category of Bloom taxonomy. The presence of this poses a problem in respect of classifying a particular question into a right category of Bloom taxonomy. And feature extraction plays an important role in improving the accuracy of classifier such as Support Vector Machine in question classification. Much of the past related research work focus on feature extraction methods such as bag of word (BOW) and syntactic analysis to classify questions and to address the issue, an improvement in feature extraction is needed. In view of this, this study proposes an integrated approach in feature extraction involving semantic aspect in classifying questions in accordance to Bloom taxonomy.

However, conventional solutions generally rely on a manually defined affinity graph matrix, which is hard to capture the intrinsic sample relations in multiple views. In addition, the graph construction and feature extraction are separated into two independent processes which may result in sub-optimal results. Furthermore, the raw data may contain adverse noises that reduces the reliability of the affinity matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel Unsupervised Multi-view Feature Extraction with Dynamic Graph Learning (UMFE-DGL) to solve these limitations. We devise a unified learning framework which simultaneously performs dynamic graph learning and the feature extraction. Dynamic graph learning adaptively captures the intrinsic multiple view-specific relations of samples. Feature extraction learns the projection matrix that could accordingly preserve the dynamically adjusted sample relations modelled by graph into the low-dimensional features.

The Ab-Initio module leverages upon a genetic algorithmic approach to generate a set of candidate sites on the basis of their microRNA-mRNA duplex stability properties. Then, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning module evaluates the impact of microRNA recognition elements on the target gene. As a result the prediction takes into account information regarding both miRNA-target structural stability and accessibility.ResultsThe proposed method significantly improves the state-of-the-art prediction tools in terms of accuracy with a better balance between specificity and sensitivity, as demonstrated by the experiments conducted on several large datasets across different species. miREE achieves this result by tackling two of the main challenges of current prediction tools: (1) The reduced number of false positives for the Ab-Initio part thanks to the integration of a machine learning module (2) the specificity of the machine learning part, obtained through an innovative technique for rich and representative negative records generation. The validation was conducted on experimental datasets where the miRNA:mRNA interactions had been obtained through (1) direct validation where even the binding site is provided, or through (2) indirect validation, based on gene expression variations obtained from high-throughput experiments where the specific interaction is not validated in detail and consequently the specific binding site is not provided.ConclusionsThe coupling of two parts: a sensitive Ab-Initio module and a selective machine learning part capable of recognizing the false positives, leads to an improved balance between sensitivity and specificity. miREE obtains a reasonable trade-off between filtering false positives and identifying targets. miREE tool is available online at http://didattica-online.polito.it/eda/miREE/", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3265527", "pubmed_id": "22115078", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-12-454", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2077505366", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["7764343", "17081596", "41229429", "16147648", "39981115", "7191008", "2550102", "17488410", "206341150", "35633135", "1997170", "7326425", "7764682", "4429008", "9661746", "14537604", "961425", "11443913", "1721807", "4340449", "17118078", "14179309", "8321235", "15049054", "6780384", "5527157", "12749133", "205274229", "1933238", "7340481", "8425979", "1237747", "5582797"], "inbound_citations": ["5214068", "2221232", "53101560", "1961175", "52850014", "16044331", "38204441", "3171781", "15621433", "51715377", "5582797", "21621627", "51610770", "52895352", "15026140"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5582797"}

Machine learning methods are keys for efficient processing of the complex data. One major class are prototype based algorithms. Prototype based vector quantizers or classifiers are intuitive approaches realizing the principle of characteristic representatives for data subsets or decision regions between them. Examples for such tools are Support Vector Machines (SVM) [1], Kohonens Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) [2], Self-Organizing Map (SOMs) [2], Supervised Relevance Neural Gas (SRNG) [3] and respective variants. Depending on the task one can distinguish between unsupervised methods for data representation and supervised methods for classification. New developments include the utilization of non-standard metrics (functional norms, scaled Euclidean) and task-dependent automatic metric adaptation (feature selection), fuzzy classification, and similarity based visualization of data. These properties offer new possibilities for analysis of mass spectrometric data. In this contribution we concentrate on recent extensions of SOMs as universal tools in the light of clinical proteomics. We focus on non-standard metrics and biomarker patterns discovery. We consider extensions of the standard SOM and LVQ for handling of more general metrics. In particular, we demonstrate applications of the weighted Euclidean metric and the weighted functional norm (based on weighted L p -norm) or kernelized metrics taking the specific nature of mass-spectra into account. This allows an efficient feature selection, which may be used for biomarker identification. The adaptation of the algorithms to these specific requirements leads to effective tools for knowledge discovery keeping the robustness of the original simple approaches. Further we consider fuzzy classification and regression within the determination of clinical proteomics models. This topic deals with the widely ranged problem of uncertainty of data. Particularly in medicine, the classification of mass spectra may be subject of individual human assessment (based on some expert knowledge), multi-impairment diseases, and incomplete patient/proband information. This leads to the problem of uncertainty of training data in machine learning data bases. We developed a semi-supervised approach based on SOM to process such data.

Many researchers have developed algorithms that estimate visual quality. These algorithms can either make use of the full pristine content (full-reference metrics), partial aspects of the pristine content (reduced-reference metrics) or only the assessed content (referenceless or no-reference metrics). These three approaches have advantages and drawbacks. Nevertheless, although the design of a referenceless metric is more challenging, they have greater applicability in different scenarios.

Contacting residue pair frequencies, residue propensities, evolutionary conservation, and shape complementarity score for each docking conformation are used as input data to a Random Forest classifier. The performance of the Random Forest approach for selecting correctly docked conformations was assessed by cross-validation using a nonredundant benchmark set of X-ray structures for 93 heterodimer and 733 homodimer complexes.

State-of-the-art airborne LiDAR can provide data in large spatial extents with varying temporal resolution and can be deployed more or less anywhere and anytime, even in cloudy weather and at night. Thus, occluded vehicle detection in forested terrain from airborne LiDAR data can be potentially applied to many fields such as military surveillance, homeland security, global warming, disaster rescue, emergency road service, and criminal searching. In this study, we finished a system with a goal to detect vehicles underneath canopy in forested terrain from LiDAR point clouds. This system covers three important parts and is described as follows. First, the thermal imaging cameras can see the heat signature of people, boats, and vehicles in total darkness as well as through smoke, haze, and light fog, but not through forest canopy. LiDAR employs an active optical modality or laser ranging that provides primarily geometric information to detect natural surface features and other hard targets that may be spectrally inseparable in multi-spectral passive optical imagery. Accordingly, the first part of this work is that we developed a novel algorithm to help detect obscure targets underneath forest canopy and mitigate the vegetation problem for bare ground point extraction filters as well. By examining the processed results, the forest canopy was successfully removed and all obscure vehicles or buildings underneath canopy can be easily seen. The occluded rate or transparency of forest canopy and the detailed underneath x-y point distribution can be easily obtained accordingly which is very useful for predicting the performance of occluded target detection with respect to various object locations. For the second part of this work, although a variety of algorithms have been developed for extracting the digital terrain model (DTM) from point clouds generated by LiDAR systems, most filters perform well in flat and uncomplicated landscapes, while landscapes containing steep slopes and discontinuities are still problematic. Therefore, we designed a novel bare-Earth extraction algorithm including morphological filtering, segmentation modeling, and surface modeling to automatically classify ground points and non-ground points from LiDAR point clouds. The obtained filtering result has been compared to twelve filters working on the same fifteen study sites which were provided by the ISPRS (International Society for Photogrammetry and Sensing). The average total error and kappa index of agreement of this work in the automated process is 4.6% and 84.5%, respectively, which outperforms all other twelve proposed filters. In addition, we develop another novel slope-based statistical algorithm which is appropriate for any mixed or complicated terrain types. Initially, most objects are removed and initial terrains can be obtained in our object detection algorithm. Slope differences can be assumed to be from a zero-mean normal distribution in all kinds of terrains. Based on slope difference variations, the Chi distribution measurement is used to decide the adaptive slope threshold. Accordingly, the adaptive growing height threshold of each pixel is derived by 8-connected neighbored pixels which can be used to iteratively correct classified points in the initial terrain. The testing results show that this algorithm is even better than our previous algorithm which has outperformed all other twelve algorithms working on the same study sites. In the last part, the obtained canopy-free LiDAR points are clustered into individual objects by the proposed bare-earth extraction algorithm and associated morphological image processing. The clustered LiDAR points of each object are analyzed and classified into the vehicle class or non-vehicle class by many theories such as Spin image, non-parametric Parzen-window estimation, Bayesian decision, and relative entropy. Finally, the results are demonstrated, discussed, and verified by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. In addition, we propose another occluded vehicle detection approach, which combines five features extracted from Spin image, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and LiDAR Intensity (SPI) and applies them to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This SPI (Spin image, PCA, and Intensity) method is compared to a simple method and two other vehicle detection methods proposed by other authors\u2019 papers published by ISPRS. With ten simulations each in different downsampling rates, testing on independent 580 vehicles and 580 non-vehicle objects, our experiments show that this SPI method outperforms all other methods, especially in low sampling rates.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "605198975", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126923772"}

The use of a machine learning method for ice detection is a promising solution. However, it is costly and infeasible to establish a well-trained model for each individual unit. This paper proposes an inductive transfer learning method to address this problem. The inductive transfer learning aims to improve the detection performance by transferring knowledge from a well-established model. As there is a distribution divergence between the source and target domain, most instance-transfer-based learning methods realize the knowledge transfer by re-weighting the instance in the source domain. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive inductive transfer learning (adaptive ITL) method for wind turbine ice detection. The knowledge transfer is achieved by offering a relatively stable prediction for the target task through the established model trained in source task.

A novel solution that investigators have undertaken is combining advanced machine learning algorithms with resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to unveil hidden pathological brain connectome patterns to uncover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Recently, state-of-the-art deep learning techniques are outperforming traditional machine learning methods and are hailed as a milestone for artificial intelligence. However, whole brain classification that combines brain connectome with deep learning has been hindered by insufficient training samples. Inspired by the transfer learning strategy employed in computer vision, we exploited previously collected resting-state functional MRI data for healthy subjects from existing databases and transferred this knowledge for new disease classification tasks. We developed a deep transfer learning neural network (DTL-NN) framework for enhancing the classification of whole brain functional connectivity patterns. Briefly, we trained a stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) prototype to learn healthy functional connectivity patterns in an offline learning environment. Then, the SSAE prototype was transferred to a DTL-NN model for a new classification task. To test the validity of our framework, we collected resting-state functional MRI data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repository. Using autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification as a target task, we compared the performance of our DTL-NN approach with a traditional deep neural network and support vector machine models across four ABIDE data sites that enrolled at least 60 subjects. As compared to traditional models, our DTL-NN approach achieved an improved performance in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under receiver operating characteristic curve. These findings suggest that DTL-NN approaches could enhance disease classification for neurological conditions, where accumulating large neuroimaging datasets has been challenging.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6066582", "pubmed_id": "30087587", "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2018.00491", "venue": "Front.

This helps us to detect the pattern of 3D moving objects, its depth, speed and direction estimation, etc. The research in connectionism is inspired by complexity of neural interactions and their organisation in the brain that can allow us to propose a feasible neuromimetic model to imitate the capacities of human brain. Although visual perception of motion has been an active research field for the scientific community (since motion is fundamental for most machine perception tasks) [McCane, 2001], recent research on computational neuroscience has provided an improved understanding of human brain functionality. In the human brain, the motion is perceived as an interaction between several cortical areas and in two main pathways : the dorsal pathway formed by primary visual area (V1), middel temporal area (MT), middel superior area (MST), etc., specialized on the detection of motion. The ventral pathway, formed by primary visual area (V1), secondary visual area (V2), third visual area (V3), inferotemporal area (IT), etc., which processes characteristics related to the form of the visual information. This visual information has been taken to create the so called bio-inspired algorithms, which are based on or inspired by functions of some areas in the brain. This bio-inspired algorithms have been proposed to mimic the abilities of the brain for motion perception and understanding [Castellanos-Sanchez, 2005]. There are several bio-inspired models for visual perception of motion, some of them inspired by V1 neurons with a strong neural cooperative-competitive interactions that converge to a local, distributed and oriented autoorganisation [Fellez & Taylor, 2002; Moga, 2000]. Some others are inspired by MT neurons with cooperative-competitive interactions between V1 and MT and an influence range [Derrington & Henning, 1993; Mingolla, 2003]. And the others are inspired by MST for coherent motion and egomotion detection [Pack et al., 2000; Zemel & Sejnowski, 1998], see [Castellanos-Sanchez, 2005] for a more detailed explanation. All these works are based on a specific cortical area. However, for our proposal we considered that all these specializations might be integrated to make a more robust process. Here we present a bio-inspired connectionist approach, called CONEPVIM model (Neuromimetical Coneccionist Model for the Visual Perception of Motion), which not only considers the higher areas of processing, but also the information from V1, since it might add descriptors for the motion detection problem, based on a particular adaptation of the", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/6044", "venue": "Brain, Vision and AI", "journal": "Brain, Vision and AI", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1595457645", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5248006", "23087475", "12192571", "22964718", "126382852", "1932949", "17055992", "16809045", "23364863", "5696884", "11912279", "21780411", "15909385"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9603982"}

There is an extensive list of genes shown to be differentially expressed in surgically obtained oral tumor tissue versus normal, non-malignant, tissue. These have been catalogued over the years and have the potential to inform OSCC characterization. At the same time noninvasive detection and diagnosis of OSCC is a goal that is being explored using a number of methods including brush oral cytology. Using RNA from oral cells obtained with brush cytology we tested levels of mRNAs of 22 genes shown to be differentially expressed in surgically obtained OSCC and normal tissue. Of these 10 showed differential expression in our training set of 12 tumor versus 18 non-malignant lesion samples all from tobacco users. Using Support Vector Machines an algorithm was developed that provided class prediction based on a subset 5 of these mRNAs. With the exception of one case, cross validation during training revealed that this OSCC classifier showed greater than 92% accuracy in differentiating OSCC from non-malignant oral lesions. We will report on its accuracy for correctly identifying OSCC samples in a validation set of RNA from brush cytology samples from an independent set of samples. This test of this methodology using RNA from brush cytology in identifying OSCC highlights the possibility of developing an RNA based classifier from brush cytology to screen for OSCC and perhaps pre-malignancies. ::: ::: Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

However, the performance of material decomposition is limited by the accuracy of the decomposition model. Due to the presence of nonideal effects in x-ray imaging systems, it is difficult to explicitly build the imaging system models for material decomposition. As an alternative, this paper explores the feasibility of using machine learning approaches for material decomposition tasks. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: In this work, we propose a learning-based pipeline to perform material decomposition. In this pipeline, the step of feature extraction is implemented to integrate more informative features, such as neighboring information, to facilitate material decomposition tasks, and the step of hold-out validation with continuous interleaved sampling is employed to perform model evaluation and selection. We demonstrate the material decomposition capability of our proposed pipeline with promising machine learning algorithms in both simulation and experimentation, the algorithms of which are artificial neural network (ANN), Random Tree, REPTree and Random Forest. The performance was quantitatively evaluated using a simulated XCAT phantom and an anthropomorphic torso phantom. In order to evaluate the proposed method, two measurement-based material decomposition methods were used as the reference methods for comparison studies. In addition, deep learning-based solutions were also investigated to complete this work as a comprehensive comparison of machine learning solution for material decomposition. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In both the simulation study and the experimental study, the introduced machine learning algorithms are able to train models for the material decomposition tasks. With the application of neighboring information, the performance of each machine learning algorithm is strongly improved. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, the performance of ANN in the simulation study is an improvement of over 24% in the noiseless scenarios and over 169% in the noisy scenario, while the performance of the Random Forest is an improvement of over 40% and 165%, respectively. Similarly, the performance of ANN in the experimental study is an improvement of over 42% in the denoised scenario and over 45% in the original scenario, while the performance of Random Forest is an improvement by over 33% and 40%, respectively. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The proposed pipeline is able to build generic material decomposition models for different scenarios, and it was validated by quantitative evaluation in both simulation and experimentation.

Diabetes is due to one of two mechanisms such as inadequate production of insulin and inadequate sensitivity of cells to the action of insulin. The purpose of this study is to diagnose the diabetes mellitus by using data mining algorithms. Methods There are many ways to diagnose the diabetes. One of the methods is data mining algorithms. The use of data mining on medical data has fetched about valuable, important and effective achievements, which can enhance the medical knowledge to make necessary decisions. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach of Farthest First (FF) clustering algorithm and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) classifier algorithm for diagnosing the DM. Farthest first clustering algorithm is used to groups the data in to number of clusters. The computation time was reduced greatly due to shrink the size of dataset. The clustering output is given as input to SVM classifier. It classifies the patients into diabetic and non-diabetic i.e. tested positives and negatives with high accuracy. Result The dataset used for the diagnosis of diabetes includes 768 samples from diabetic patients taken from Pima Indians Dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed integrated approach achieved 99.4% classification accuracy for predicting the diabetes mellitus. Conclusion Experimental results proved that our proposed integrated approach achieved a classification accuracy of 99.4% for diagnosing the patient with diabetic and non-diabetic. The experimental results proved that, hybrid approach of data-mining method could help the doctors to make better clinical decisions for diagnosing diabetic patients.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.obmed.2019.100152", "venue": null, "journal": "Obesity Medicine", "mag_id": "2982494647", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208131895"}

In TER-GAN, we combine the capabilities of generative models to generate synthetic images, while learning important information about the input images during the reconstruction process. More specifically, two encoders are used in TER-GAN to encode identity and expression information from two input images, and a synthetic expression image is generated by the decoder part of TER-GAN. To improve the feature disentanglement and extraction process, we also introduce a novel expression consistency loss and an identity consistency loss which exploit extra expression and identity information from generated images.

In this paper, Self-adaptive Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and a SSA-based diagnosis framework are proposed to solve these problems. Firstly, signals are decomposed into components with better analyzability. Then, SSA is developed to extract fault features adaptively and construct non-fixed dimension feature vectors. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to classify different fault features. Data collected under different working conditions are selected for experiments. Results show that the diagnosis method based on the proposed diagnostic framework has better performance. In conclusion, combined with signal decomposition methods, the SSA method proposed in this paper achieves higher reliability and robustness than other tested feature extraction methods.

These weaknesses include susceptibility to shoulder ::: surfing attacks and to smudge attacks. These kinds of security mechanics work on an ::: all-or-nothing basis, meaning that once a password is entered correctly, the user has ::: access to everything. Another weakness comes from the discrepancy between security ::: and usability; users tend to intentionally use weak passwords for the sake of usability. ::: The reason for this comes from the fact that the usage pattern of mobile devices is ::: characterized by small bursts of activity. This in turn leads the users to type their ::: passwords/PIN every time they want to use the phone. Moreover, users tend to not ::: use a password or PIN at all in some occasions. Advanced techniques like face and ::: fingerprint recognition can also be circumvented, they hinder usability, and they might ::: need special hardware. For example, fingerprint recognition needs a special sensor ::: and a fingerprint can be reconstructed relatively easy from a surface or even from a ::: photograph. Then, it can be used to access any fingerprint-secured device. ::: The solution to these problems is authenticating owners of mobile phones implicitly ::: using context. Implicitly means not requiring the user to perform any additional task, ::: but instead using the available data a mobile phone produces when users interact with ::: their phones. Context can include rich information such as location and device fingerprints, ::: but the interesting type of context is behavior analysis, which takes advantage ::: of the relation between a phone and its owner. Hence, contextual authentication aims ::: to increase both security and usability by authenticating users through the way they ::: interact with their phones rather than requiring them to perform specific tasks, such as ::: entering a password. ::: The purpose of this work is to explore the possibility of providing continuous ::: and implicit authentication from owner to mobile phone while assuring high accuracy ::: that can be acceptable in practical situations. We focus on utilizing movements that ::: are natural to phone usage. Natural movements happen when users are interacting ::: with their phones. This means that the solution should not require users to perform ::: any additional tasks to authenticate themselves, they should only use their phones. ::: Movements that are natural to the phone usage that we will investigate are (1) the way ::: users pick up their phones from a table, and (2) the micro-movements of the phone ::: when users interact with them. Both mentioned movements serve one of the established ::: goals which is \"implicit authentication\". The micro-movements serve another goal ::: which is \"continuous authentication\". Continuous authentication means that the user ::: is always being authenticated in the background, especially when the user wants to ::: access a critical function such as a banking app. An important aspect of the pick-up ::: motion is that it usually precedes any other interaction, meaning that the user needs ::: to first pick up the phone before starting to use it. Thus, the pick-up motion can serve ::: as a first line of defense. On the other hand, the micro-movements authentication can ::: serve as a second, and continuous, line of defense. ::: An important objective to accomplish is to extract features from the collected ::: data (such as average, standard deviation, amplitude, etc) that can be informative ::: of this data and then select some of these features that give a distinction to the two ::: motions and can be utilized to identify the owner of a mobile device. Another important ::: objective is to choose the right classification algorithm that suits these two types of ::: movements. In addition, classification algorithms usually have specific parameters ::: that need to be chosen carefully to get the best out of the produced model. The last ::: objective is to build a pattern recognition process that can correctly detect a pick-up ::: motion (regardless of the user) at the right time, otherwise the pick-up authentication ::: mechanism would be useless. ::: The first step of this work was to build a simple Android app to collect sensor ::: data (accelerometer and orientation sensor). A group of participants were asked to ::: pick up the phone from a table and type on the phone multiple times while the app ::: collected the acceleration on X, Y, and Z axes and the orientation angles Yaw, Pitch, ::: and Roll. This data then was manually analyzed and it was apparent that there are noticeable differences between different users. Then, machine learning was used to ::: build a classification model. The model included two classes: owner and non-owner. ::: When new data is supplied to the model, it can predict to which class the current user ::: belongs. To this end, two algorithms were used: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for ::: the pick-up motion, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the micro-movements. ::: Raw sensor data were used with DTW to build a model. In the case of SVM, multiple ::: features were extracted from sensor data to help build the model. Subsequently, a test ::: was performed to evaluate the accuracy of the model. For this purpose, a prototype ::: was created (Android app) to perform the tests. During the test, participants would ::: pick up the phone or type, and the app would display the algorithm decision. The ::: results showed that those two motions can successfully be used to differentiate between ::: the owner of the device and intruders. The pick-up motion achieved 3.3% FRR and ::: 0% FAR.

It involves several ::: subproblems, such as subject recognition, gender classi\ufffdcation or subject veri\ufffdcation. ::: The interest for developing automatic face classi\ufffdcation systems has grown rapidly ::: in the past years. The reason is that they can be applied in several situations, for ::: example in security devices or in user-friendly interfaces. However, current methods ::: are still nowadays far from the human ability to classify faces. ::: The main di\ufffdculty of the automatic face classi\ufffdcation is caused by the high intraclass ::: variability. This intra-class variability is due to the changes of the imaging ::: conditions produced by the presence of highlights, partial occlusions or facial expressions, ::: which are very common in images acquired in non-controlled environments. ::: The solution of the high intra-class variability handicap seems to rely on getting a ::: large amount of training data, to represent as much variability as possible of each ::: class. However to obtain labeled data is usually a di\ufffdcult issue. For this reason, it is ::: essential the research on methods that just need a small sized training set to robustly ::: learn a face classi\ufffdcation task. ::: In this context, we propose to use Multitask Learning techniques for automatic ::: face classi\ufffdcation as a possible solution to the lack of training samples or the high ::: variability among elements of the same class. Multitask Learning is an emergent ::: subtopic of Machine Learning, focused on simultaneously learning multiple related ::: tasks in order to achieve an improvement in the overall performance, when compared ::: to independent training strategies. For appropriate applications, Multitask Learning ::: algorithms need less training samples per task to achieve the same classi\ufffdcation results ::: as independent learning strategies. On the other hand, a Multitask Learning system ::: trained with a su\ufffdcient number of related tasks should be able to \ufffdnd good solutions ::: to a novel related task. ::: This thesis explores, proposes and tests some Multitask Learning methods specially ::: developed for face classi\ufffdcation problems, with the aim of overcoming the e\ufffdects ::: of the small sample sized problem. ::: First of all, after a literature overview on Multitask Learning, we develop a method ::: for learning a classi\ufffder that jointly selects, during the training process, the most ::: appropriate subset of features to classify the faces. We extend this method to perform ::: a Multitask Learning feature selection and perform some experiments. ::: In a second stage, we describe and test two Multitask Learning methods for face ::: classi\ufffdcation. These methods are developed under a Bayesian framework and use ::: regularization constraints to encourage the di\ufffderent tasks to share information. ::: In face classi\ufffdcation applications, the development of Online Learning techniques ::: is an important research issue. The goal of these techniques is to update learned ::: classi\ufffders using new training data, instead of retraining the whole system. This is ::: very important in face classi\ufffdcation because the retraining of the whole system can be ::: computationally demanding, while the updating can be faster performed. The need ::: of these kind of methods is illustrated with the following problems: (a) update the ::: classi\ufffder to verify a person, making it to evolve across the time, removing information ::: of old samples and adding new recent images, (b) given a system for recognizing K ::: di\ufffderent persons, adapt the classi\ufffder to include a new subject in the system, or remove ::: an existing one. ::: The Online Learning methods are closely related with a particular scenario of ::: Multitask Learning, called the Sequential Multitask Learning. In this context, a third ::: block of contributions in this thesis is the proposal two Multitask Learning techniques ::: for Online Learning in face classi\ufffdcation domain. ::: The last contribution in the Multitask Learning context is a new task relatedness ::: de\ufffdnition and the development of two Multitask Learning techniques dealing with ::: this new framework. ::: Finally, we conclude the thesis and propose some future research lines related with ::: the proposed methodologies. ::: Additionally, we present two more contributions dealing with the small sample ::: sized problem in face classi\ufffdcation that do not belong to the Multitask Learning ::: topic. The \ufffdrst one is the proposal of a method for extracting external face features, ::: located at hear, chin or ears, for classi\ufffdcation purposes. Traditionally, automatic face ::: classi\ufffdcation techniques are focused on features di\ufffdcult to imitate, such as eyes, nose ::: or mouth (internal features), given that the main application of these methods was ::: related to security. However, nowadays it is more usual to \ufffdnd electronic devices ::: with small embedded cameras in our everyday life, running applications not related ::: to security. In these new areas, the use of the external face features as an additional ::: information source can improve the current systems, specially when there are just few ::: training samples to learn the classi\ufffdcation task. ::: The second contribution out of the Multitask Learning context is an empirical ::: study to determine the most suitable face image resolution to perform subject recognition ::: task. It is usual to use the grey intensity of each pixel as the initial feature ::: vector for face classi\ufffdcation purposes.

Current modeling approaches consider prediction of a single metric of the drug response curve such as AUC or IC50. However, the single summary metric of a dose-response curve fails to provide the entire drug sensitivity profile which can be used to design the optimal dose for a patient. In this article, we assess the problem of predicting the complete dose-response curve based on genetic characterizations. We propose an enhancement to the popular ensemble-based Random Forests approach that can directly predict the entire functional profile of a dose-response curve rather than a single summary metric. We design functional regression trees with node costs modified based on dose/response region dependence methodologies and response distribution based approaches. Our results relative to large pharmacological databases such as CCLE and GDSC show a higher accuracy in predicting dose-response curves of the proposed functional framework in contrast to univariate or multivariate Random Forest predicting sensitivities at different dose levels. Furthermore, we also considered the problem of predicting functional responses from functional predictors i.e., estimating the dose-response curves with a model built on dose-dependent expression data. The superior performance of Functional Random Forest using functional data as compared to existing approaches have been shown using the HMS-LINCS dataset.

One of the major problems is the higher number of features and the relatively small number of individuals, which complicates the task and harms the predictive ability of DNA sequences. In this paper, a novel boosting-based ensemble approach was proposed to study these interactions. An importance scoring strategy based on Gini impurity was introduced for feature selection.

In this paper, an automatic detection of premalignant lesions based on human voice production theory is designed. More specifically, premalignant lesions such as leukoplakia, Erythroplakia, Keratosis, etc are directly related to the vocal fold, features extracted from glottal fold waveform can be pertinent and critical. The proposed method performs as non-intrusive technique based on the extraction of vocal fold waveform from the recorded utterances. Method: The basic idea is to extract pertinent features from the source signal (glottal waveform). However, such signal is not directly accessible. Hence, we perform a first treatment of recorded speech using Iterative Adaptive Inverse Filtering (IAIF) to extract the glottal waveform. IAIF is applied on two databases: Massachusetts Eye and Ear Inrmary (MEEI) database and Saarbrucken Voice Database (SVD) with sustained vowel samples. From the glottal flow impulses, pertinent instances are used to build pertinent features. A deep exploration of extracted features, using statistical tools such as boxplot and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), leads to select the most critical and pertinent features. By using Support Vector Machine Technique as classification technique, a discrimination between normal and premalignant tumor is achieved. Results: Preliminary results show that some features are not discriminant. Those features are discarded and only pertinent ones are used in learning and testing processing using SVM. The performances are assessed using four criteria, sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy. When selected features are combined according to PCA analysis, an accuracy of about 92% is accomplished. Conclusion: It is shown in this study that is possible to detect the premalignant lesions with acceptable and fairly sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy. Such algorithm can help detect at earlier stage laryngeal cancer.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procs.2018.07.293", "venue": "KES", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2889451849", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["209319249"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54477474"}

Firstly, we present a novel approach to AUHB-DWR that aims to improve image quality. We formulate the reconstruction of an apparent DW image as a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) in which tissue model diffusion parameters act as hidden states in this random field. The second contribution of this paper is a new generation of fully connected conditional random fields, called the hidden stochastically fully connected conditional random fields (HSFCRF) that allows for efficient inference with significantly reduced computational complexity via stochastic clique structures. The proposed AUHB-DWR algorithms, HCRF and HSFCRF, are evaluated quantitatively in nine different patient cases using Fisher's criteria, probability of error, and coefficient of variation metrics to validate its effectiveness for the purpose of improving intensity delineation between expert identified suspected cancerous and healthy tissue within the prostate gland. The proposed methods are also examined using a prostate phantom, where the apparent ultra-high $b$ -value DW images reconstructed using the tested AUHB-DWR methods are compared with real captured UHB-DWI.

The Mawat Ophiolite Complex (MOC) is located in the NE of Iraq and is known for its mineral deposits. The aims of this study are: (I) to refine the existing lithological map of the MOC; (II) to identify the best discriminatory datasets for lithological classification, including geomorphic features and textures; and (III) to identify potential locations with high concentrations of chromite. We performed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method to allow the joint use of geomorphic features, textures and multispectral data of the Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER) satellite. The updated map allowed the identification of a new mafic body and a substantial improvement of the geometry of the known lithological units. The use of geomorphic features allowed for the increase of the overall accuracy from 73% to 79.3%. In addition, we detected chromite occurrences within the ophiolite by applying Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) technique. We identified two new locations having high concentrations of chromite and verified one of these promising areas in the field. This new body covers ~0.3 km2 and has coarsely crystalline chromite within dunite host rock. The chromium (Cr2O3) concentration is ~8.46%.

We use the discriminator $(D)$ of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) as the final classifier, and we train $D$ using both labeled and unlabeled data. The main novelty we introduce is the representation of the visual information fed to $D$ by means of two different channels: the original image and its \u201csemantic\u201d representation, the latter being obtained by means of an external network trained on ImageNet. The two channels are fused in $D$ and jointly used to classify fake images, real labeled and real unlabeled images. We show that using only 100 labeled images, the proposed approach achieves an accuracy close to 69% and a significant improvement with respect to other GAN-based semi-supervised methods.

Traditional approaches used to moderate eating behaviour often rely on inaccurate self-logging, manual observations or bulky equipment. Overall, there is a need for an intelligent and lightweight system which can automatically monitor eating behaviour and provide feedback. In this paper, we investigate: i) the development of an automated system for detecting eating behaviour using wearable Electromyography (EMG) sensors, and ii) the application of such a system in combination with real time wristband haptic feedback to facilitate mindful eating. Data collected from 16 participants were used to develop an algorithm for detecting chewing and swallowing. We extracted 18 features from EMG and presented those features to different classifiers. We demonstrated that eating behaviour can be automatically assessed accurately using the EMG-extracted features and a Support Vector Machine (SVM): F1-Score=0.94 for chewing classification, and F1-Score=0.86 for swallowing classification. Based on this algorithm, we developed a system to enable participants to self-moderate their chewing behaviour using haptic feedback. An experiment study was carried out with 20 additional participants showing that participants exhibited a lower rate of chewing when haptic feedback delivered in forms of wristband vibration was used compared to a baseline and non-haptic condition (F (2,38)=58.243, p<0.001).

Pattern recognition algorithms based on synergetics have been applied to images in the spatial domain with limited success in the past, given their dependence on the rotation, shifting, and scaling of the images. These drawbacks can be discarded if such methods are applied to data acquired by a hyperspectral sensor in the spectral domain, as each single spectrum, related to an image element in the hyperspectral scene, can be analyzed independently. The spectrum is first projected in a space spanned by a set of user-defined prototype vectors, which belong to some classes of interest, and then attracted by a final state associated to a prototype. The spectrum can thus be classified, establishing a first attempt at performing a pixel-wise image classification using notions derived from synergetics. As typical synergetics-based systems have the drawback of a rigid training step, we introduce a new procedure which allows the selection of a training area for each class of interest, used to weight the prototype vectors through attention parameters and to produce a more accurate classification map through plurality vote of independent classifications. As each classification is in principle obtained on the basis of a single training sample per class, the proposed technique could be particularly effective in tasks where only a small training data set is available. The results presented are promising and often outperform state-of-the-art classification methodologies, both general and specific to hyperspectral data.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2012.2219059", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2130487198", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3068269", "211216865", "12249130", "117756864", "676612", "61524452", "37172919", "60670376", "2153216", "35481282", "128699213", "14754582", "137888315", "73646356", "31445214", "41719444", "61437731", "153090529", "11049457", "10533950", "30546787", "14173829", "14591318", "16542065", "6906514", "118162411", "2045747", "4641916", "110009918", "14293639"], "inbound_citations": ["46168003", "203595981", "17449190"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10877291"}

Our empirical investigation reveals that the distribution of forecast errors do not follow any of the common parametric densities.

In this paper, using transfer learning as an organizing principle, we propose a novel design framework to enable autonomous reconfiguration of wearable systems.

We develop two new algorithms for data mapping (the mapping is between the training data and the data for the current operating setting). The first data mapping algorithm combines effective methods for finding signal similarity with network-based clustering , while the second algorithm is based on finding signal motifs . The data mapping algorithms constitute the centerpiece of the transfer learning phase in our framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of the data mapping algorithms using two publicly available datasets on human activity recognition.

Habitat suitability models for these invasive species were developed with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which were trained with data collected downstream the Contreras dam (the last barrier impeding the invasion of the upper river segment). Although SVMs gained visibility in habitat suitability modelling, they cannot be considered widespread in ecology.

Further, the development of partial dependence plots allowed unveiling the relationship between the selected input variables and the probability of presence. Results revealed the preference of northern pike for large and wide mesohabitats with vegetated shores and abundant prey whereas bleak preferred deep and slightly fast flow mesohabitats with fine substrate.

The Intrusion detection system (IDS) plays an important role in securing smart grid networks and detecting malicious activity, yet it suffers from several limitations. Many research papers have been published to address these issues using several algorithms and techniques. Therefore, a detailed comparison between these algorithms is needed. This paper presents an overview of four data mining algorithms used by IDS in Smart Grid. A performance evaluation of these algorithms is conducted based on several metrics including the probability of detection, probability of false alarm, probability of miss detection, efficiency, and processing time. Results show that Random Forest outperforms the other three algorithms in detecting attacks with a higher probability of detection, lower probability of false alarm, lower probability of miss detection, and higher accuracy.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "2001.00917", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/EIT.2019.8834255", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (EIT)", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2972618277", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["18604581", "5884474", "108476281", "13878913", "2079266", "13745331", "207616703", "57146809", "195916780", "4528546", "13252401", "40806925", "194951", "1149093", "89141", "53721372", "3708246", "457732"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202561517"}

In genetic epidemiology, complex diseases have a polygenic basis and a common assumption is that biological and genetic features affect the outcome under consideration via interactions. In the case of omics data, the use of standard approaches such as generalized linear models may be suboptimal and machine learning methods are appealing to make individual predictions. However, most of these algorithms focus mostly on main or marginal effects of the single features in a dataset. On the other hand, the detection of interacting features is an active area of research in the realm of genetic epidemiology. One big class of algorithms to detect interacting features is based on the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR). Here, we extend the model-based MDR (MB-MDR), a powerful extension of the original MDR algorithm, to enable interaction empowered individual prediction. Using a comprehensive simulation study we show that our new algorithm can use information hidden in interactions more efficiently than two other state-of-the-art algorithms, namely the Random Forest and Elastic Net, and clearly outperforms these if interactions are present. The performance of these algorithms is comparable if no interactions are present. Further, we show that our new algorithm is applicable to real data by comparing the performance of the three algorithms on a dataset of rheumatoid arthritis cases and healthy controls.

In malware detection, static analysis, the method of analyzing potentially malicious files, has been the prominent approach. This approach, however, quickly falls short as malicious programs become more advanced and adopt the capabilities of obfuscating its binaries to execute the same malicious functions, making static analysis extremely difficult for newer variants. The approach assessed in this paper is a novel dynamic malware analysis method, which may generalize better than static analysis to newer variants. Inspired by recent successes in Natural Language Processing (NLP), widely used document classification techniques were assessed in detecting malware by doing such analysis on system calls, which contain useful information about the operation of a program as requests that the program makes of the kernel. Features considered are extracted from system call traces of benign and malicious programs, and the task to classify these traces is treated as a binary document classification task of system call traces. The system call traces were processed to remove the parameters to only leave the system call function names. The features were grouped into various n-grams and weighted with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. This paper shows that Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) optimized by Stochastic Gradient Descent and the traditional Coordinate Descent on the Wolfe Dual form of the SVM are effective in this approach, achieving a highest of 96% accuracy with 95% recall score.

In this paper, we propose a new metric learning approach for tree-structured data with pq-grams. The pq-gram distance is a distance for ordered labeled trees, and has much lower computation cost than the tree edit distance. In order to perform metric learning based on pq-grams, we propose a new differentiable parameterized distance, weighted pq-gram distance. We also propose a way to learn the proposed distance based on Large Margin Nearest Neighbors (LMNN), which is a well-studied and practical metric learning scheme. We formulate the metric learning problem as an optimization problem and use the gradient descent technique to perform metric learning.

Based on the results obtained using the blind test protocol, it is interesting to note that even if in each independent data set the most performing stand-alone method is not always the same, the fusion of different methods enhances prediction efficiency in all the tested independent data sets.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21860064", "doi": "10.1109/TCBB.2011.117", "venue": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics", "journal": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2016319093", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["84083899", "25514763", "384617", "4337256", "10423613", "6461022", "14441902", "7396738", "205225875", "9071012", "1304875", "712299", "20113942", "36224301", "25240057", "13127724", "9728696", "2247957", "6304500", "14727192", "206420153", "28248657", "1991617", "1069962", "13014573", "37691435", "14483466", "5155801", "206769424", "17096845", "14289479", "20996586", "34489623", "16709353", "5674389", "3573986", "11464998", "13456249", "21057317", "37678134", "226104", "41087767", "11316257", "21863916", "11144243", "12091403", "206560797", "2787745", "42258207", "30683364", "8854755", "5814816", "24052424", "20081136", "40693177", "17759590", "5682304", "14529569"], "inbound_citations": ["15421299", "14123037", "15633588", "3709016", "213609026", "16680577", "46920993", "24348368", "16576124", "88226343", "766072", "24199602", "54900463", "201741195", "7884361", "16057260", "16021423", "201839206", "23316796", "16709818", "52418932", "8986335", "435300", "18659182", "3331951", "71147876", "209523324", "18725176", "5791129", "13006880", "15695900", "215362998", "35265531", "54625569", "36180385", "212649257", "10906544", "24987352", "29812378", "201983486", "1096212", "5042980", "51614694", "199550999", "5754323", "8426304", "36792025", "3513496", "19714686", "23801834", "206563240", "36496099", "122533585", "16846280", "36989584", "4588673", "24027251", "1742342", "3836567", "802587", "215017216", "15566246", "49296868", "15193938", "13261431", "3088952", "44806899", "5545764", "206563176", "29250915"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18539401"}

The representation way of a web page and contextual features used for this representation have both an impact on the classification's performance. Thus, finding an adequate representation of web pages is essential for a better web page classification. In this paper, we propose a web page representation based on the structure of the implicit graph built using implicit links extracted from the query-log. In this representation, we represent web pages using their textual contents along with their neighbors as features instead of using features of their neighbors. When two or more web pages in the implicit graph share the same direct neighbors and belong to the same class ci, it is most likely that every other web page, having the same immediate neighbors, will belong to the same class ci. We propose two kinds of web page representations: Boolean Neighbor Vector (BNV) and Weighted Neighbor Vector (WNV). In BNV, we supplement the feature vector, which represents the textual content of a web page, by a Boolean vector. This vector represents the target web page's neighbors and shows whether a web page is a direct neighbor of the target web page or not. In WNV, we supplement the feature vector, which represents the textual content of a web page, by a weighted vector. This latter represents the target web page's neighbors and shows strengths of relations between the target web page and its neighbors. We conduct experiments using four classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), NB (Naive Bayes), RF (Random Forest) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) on two subsets of ODP (Open Directory Project). Results show that: (1) the proposed representation helps obtain better classification results when using SVM, NB, RF and KNN for both Bag of Words (BW) and 5-gram representations.

One of the key technologies of video surveillance systems is Person Re-IDentification (Re-ID).

ESB performance is very important for the smooth functioning of the system. Any degradation or failure of the ESB results in huge revenue loss due to production discontinuity. Therefore, maintaining ESB in a healthy state is very essential and there are multiple factors related to resource utilization, workload and number of interfaces etc., which influences the performance of the ESB. Forecasting these variables at least a day ahead (24 h ahead) is required to take appropriate actions by the business team to maintain the ESB performance under control. But, these variables are heterogeneous (continuous, discrete and percentages) in nature, highly non-linear and non-stationary. The challenges associated with forecasting of these variables are (i) long horizon (24 h ahead forecast at 5 min granularity requires to forecast 288 steps) (ii) data generated from these kinds of systems makes it very difficult to use any linear statistical methods like state-space models, ARIMA etc. To address these challenges, the paper presents a framework where a basket of learning algorithms based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forests (RF) were used to model the chaotic behavior of the time series with a real-time automatic algorithm selection mechanism which enables appropriate forecasting algorithm to be chosen dynamically based on the performance over a time window, resulting in different algorithms being used for forecasting the same target variable on different days.

IntroductionClassification of the human functional state of an individual (Danilova, 1992; Hockey et al., 2003) is an important problem in modern psychology. It is a key subject of the EU FP integrated project \"Advanced sensor development for attention, stress, vigilance and sleep/wakefulness monitoring (SENSATION)\" (Maglavera et al., 2006), The Research and Technology Organization (RTO of NATO) program \"Operator Functional State Assessment\" (Hockey et al., 2003; Veltman et al., 2004), and a number of other projects. Applications of the automated classification of functional states include stress resistance evaluation, supervision over operators of critical infrastructure (air traffic controller, power plant operator, engine-driver, etc.), teaching, and phobia therapy. Such classification is particularly efficient in systems for teaching and/or phobia therapy that include a virtual reality module (e.g., virtual cave) and provide the capability for dynamic adjustment of task complexity: in this case the implementation of feedback based on real-time automated functional state classification can be used for the automated optimal selection of task complexity, and such a selection is a key factor for successful teaching and therapy.Standard mathematical approaches to the automated classification problem are based on the detection of characteristic patterns of classes, and on the construction of classifier functions that give close values for elements of the same class, and distinguishable values for elements from different classes. If characteristic patterns and classifier functions cannot be revealed using solely specific expert knowledge of the domain, automated and semi-automated machine-learning methods are used: Artifical Neural Networks (Wasserman, 1989), Support Vector Machine (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995), Logistic Regression (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000), Random Forest (Breiman, 2001), etc.However, these methods can be efficiently applied only if the size of learning samples is considerably larger than the dimension of the feature (measurement) arrays used for the classification. In the case of functional state classification based on electroencephalographic (EEG) data, this limitation is violated: the typical size of learning samples here does not exceed a few hundred (in most cases -- several dozen), and the number of measurements associated even with short (e.g., one second) time windows exceeds one thousand (and generally exceeds ten thousand). Recently we developed a specialized method for the automated construction of classifier functions for binary functional state classification, which provided reliable classification of stress vs. state of calm wakefulness (also referred to as a normal functional state) despite the relatively small size of learning samples (Galatenko et al., 2012). Along with the efficient procedure for dimension reduction, this method included an individual tuning stage that allowed the involvement of certain information on individual peculiarities in the classification. This stage is non-standard for conventional machine-learning methods. In this paper we show that the individual tuning stage significantly increases the reliability of the classification.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the section \"Algorithm scheme\" a short description of the algorithm for automated real-time classification of a functional state based on EEG data is given. A detailed description of the algorithm was given (Galatenko et al., 2012). In the section \"Experiment design\", an outline of an experiment for evaluating the importance of the individual tuning stage for classification reliability is given. In the section \"Results\", experiment results are discussed.2.

While this has already posed great challenges for fundamental data mining tasks such as classification, things are made even more complicated by the fact that completely-labeled examples are usually unavailable in such settings, leaving researchers the only option to learn classifiers on partially-labeled examples on uncertain data streams. Furthermore, there will be concept drift on evolving data streams. To address these challenges, this paper therefore focuses on the study of learning from positive and unlabeled examples (PU) on uncertain data streams. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to address the uncertainty issue in both item occurrence (occurrence level) and attribute value (attribute level) for the problem of PU learning over streaming data. Firstly, we propose an algorithm to classify positive and unlabeled examples with both uncertainties (PUU). The algorithm extracts reliable positive and negative examples by clustering-based method, and then trains the classifier with Weighted Extreme Learning Machine (Weighted ELM). Secondly, we propose an algorithm of PU learning over uncertain data streams (PUUS). It adopts ensemble model and trains base classification by PUU. In order to detect concept drift, PUUS uses cluster set similarities between the current data block and history data block. We propose different update strategies for different concept drift to adapt to evolving uncertain data streams. Experimental results show that PUUS can effectively classify uncertain data streams with just positive and unlabeled data, while achieving in the meantime good performance in detecting and handling concept drifts.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2017.03.094", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2747070277", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6601979", "2679779", "112251677", "62687839", "6416602", "6348157", "11868540", "5874117", "15080415", "35722094", "16879732", "12458407", "8046433", "61694907", "185617", "14192936", "5560340", "18877799", "29695460", "12923377", "2545890", "371647", "7079167", "6019070", "39456719", "10324936", "185617", "206089312", "116858", "26893209", "207778706", "9369727", "10941199"], "inbound_citations": ["115163656", "133606075", "201070793"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7803648"}

While other piano-related tasks, such as pitch estimation and onset detection, have seen improvement through applying deep learning methods, little work has been done to develop deep learning models to detect playing techniques. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach for the detection of sustain-pedal techniques, which are commonly used by pianists to enrich the sound. In the source task, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained for learning spectral and temporal contexts when the sustain pedal is pressed using a large dataset generated by a physical modelling virtual instrument. The CNN is designed and experimented through exploiting the knowledge of piano acoustics and physics. This can achieve an accuracy score of 0.98 in the validation results. In the target task, the knowledge learned from the synthesised data can be transferred to detect the sustain pedal in acoustic piano recordings. A concatenated feature vector using the activations of the trained convolutional layers is extracted from the recordings and classified into frame-wise pedal press or release. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in acoustic piano recordings of Chopin\u2019s music. From the cross-validation results, the proposed transfer learning method achieves an average F-measure of 0.89 and an overall performance of 0.84 obtained using the micro-averaged F-measure.

For this reason, the technological state-of-the-art is moving from the analysis of low-order features (e.g. Median Absolute Value and spectral features) that could suffer the aforementioned issues, to more complex techniques, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) separation Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) decomposition of signal channels. The latter hypothesizes a high-order modular control of muscles at the Central Nervous System (CNS) level built upon coordinated motor patterns (called muscle synergies), and it removes the limitations on Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) per electrode given by standard sEMG controllers. Unfortunately, the utilisation of such techniques in prosthetics is limited by their computational complexity, which limits them to research laboratories and bulky processing systems, calling for novel algorithms and hardware implementations that achieve same the level of accuracy and speed necessary for movement control, while minimizing the power consumption and the device size. This paper presents a FPGA-based, real-time NMF processor that extracts muscle synergies from a 8-electrode sEMG recording. The execution of the NMF algorithm is entirely performed using a fixed-point architecture, in order to increase computation speed and minimize the amount of DSPs used. The NMF fixed-point decomposition is then fed to two software different classifiers, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Neural Network, in order to quantify the degradation of the accuracy given by fixed-point calculations and to understand which mechanism is more robust.

It can be difficult, or impossible, to visually determine original rock types for samples that are significantly altered, e.g., when rocks have experienced texturally destructive metasomatism or deformation. A typical solution using chemical data involves the separation and labelling of chemically distinct rocks using discrimination diagrams. However, such approaches can be subjective, and manual sample-by-sample consideration of large mining or exploration databases is untenable. Here we present an example workflow to facilitate relating rocks with similar origins but differing geological histories. We employ a combination of unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to automate classification tasks typically undertaken manually by a geologist with domain expertise. In this study, data are first normalised and then clustered into natural groupings that represent protolith lithologies or rock-type subunits. These clusters are then used to inform a classification algorithm that assigns protolith equivalent labels to samples of altered rocks. Applied to problems involving large chemical datasets, machine learning provides objectivity, reproducibility and rapidity; useful advantages as compared to geostatistical domaining methods that involve manual determination and selection of geochemically similar regions. We utilise k-means ++ unsupervised clustering to create objective and reproducible groupings of data points, with many geochemical variables considered simultaneously. Subsequently, Random Forests supervised classification is used to label samples while accommodating interactions and/or correlations between data points. We present a case study from the Minto Cu-Au-Ag mine, Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada.

Higher resolution (~30\u201350 m) land cover mapping is expected to advance the understanding of the multi-dimensional interactions of the human-nature-climate system with the potentiality of representing most of the biophysical processes and characteristics of the land surface. However, mapping at 30-m resolution is complicated with existing manual techniques, due to the laborious procedures involved with the analysis and interpretation of huge volumes of satellite data. To cope with this problem, an automated technique was explored for the production of a high resolution land cover map at a national scale. The automated technique consists of the construction of a reference library by the optimum combination of the spectral, textural and topographic features and predicting the results using the optimum random forests model. The feature-rich reference library-driven automated technique was used to produce the Japan 30-m resolution land cover (JpLC-30) map of 2013\u20132015. The JpLC-30 map consists of seven major land cover types: water bodies, deciduous forests, evergreen forests, croplands, bare lands, built-up areas and herbaceous.

Consistent with previous work, we observe performance improvements on telephone conversational speech recognition (specifically the Eval2000 test sets) when training a subword-level CTC model with an auxiliary phone loss at an intermediate layer. We analyze the effects of a number of experimental variables (like interpolation constant and position of the auxiliary loss function), performance in lower-resource settings, and the relationship between pretraining and multitask learning. We observe that the hierarchical multitask approach improves over standard multitask training in our higher-data experiments, while in the low-resource settings standard multitask training works well.

Thus, mapping concentrations of different surface water quality parameters SWQPs, such as turbidity, total suspended solids TSS, chemical oxygen demand COD, biological oxygen demand BOD, and dissolved oxygen DO, is indeed critical for providing the appropriate treatment to the affected waterbodies. Traditionally, concentrations of SWQPs have been measured through intensive field work. Additionally, quite a lot of studies have attempted to retrieve concentrations of SWQPs from satellite images using regression-based methods. However, the relationship between SWQPs and satellite data is complex to be modelled accurately by using regression-based methods. Therefore, our study attempts to develop an artificial intelligence modelling method for mapping concentrations of both optical and non-optical SWQPs. In this context, a remote-sensing framework based on the back-propagation neural network BPNN is developed for the first time to quantify concentrations of different SWQPs from the Landsat8 satellite imagery. Compared to other methods, such as Support Vector Machine, significant coefficients of determination R2 between the Landsat8 surface reflectance and concentrations of SWQPs were obtained using the developed Landsat8-based-BPNN models. The resulting R2 values were 0.991, 0.933, 0.937, 0.930, and 0.934 for turbidity, TSS, COD, BOD, and DO, respectively.

In this paper, we present a computational framework for analyzing fMRI data consisting of 100 epileptic and 80 healthy patients, with an overall goal to produce a novel bio-marker that is predictive of epilepsy. The proposed method is primarily based on Dissimilarity of Activity (DoA) analysis. We demonstrate that the bio-marker presented in this study can be used to capture asymmetries in activities by detecting any abnormalities in Blood Oxygenated Level Dependent (BOLD) signal. In order to represent all asymmetries (of connectivity and activation patterns), we used functional connectivity analysis (FCA) in conjunction with DoA to find underlying connectivity patterns of the regions. Subsequently, these biomarkers were used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier that was able to distinguish between healthy and epileptic patients with 87.8% accuracy.

While it is an open challenge to recover the functionality of a shape from its geometry alone, this paper shows that it is often possible to infer its upright orientation by analyzing its geometry. Our key idea is to reduce the two-dimensional (spherical) orientation space to a small set of orientation candidates using functionality-related geometric properties of the object, and then determine the best orientation using an assessment function of several functional geometric attributes defined with respect to each candidate. Specifically we focus on obtaining the upright orientation for man-made objects that typically stand on some flat surface (ground, floor, table, etc.), which include the vast majority of objects in our everyday surroundings.

First, we define the concept of locality in two neighborhood systems, namely, the spatial and functional neighborhoods. Then, we construct spatially and functionally local meshes around each voxel, called seed voxel, by connecting it either to its spatial or functional p-nearest neighbors. The mesh formed around a voxel is a directed sub-graph with a star topology, where the direction of the edges is taken towards the seed voxel at the center of the mesh. We represent the time series recorded at each seed voxel in terms of linear combination of the time series of its p-nearest neighbors in the mesh. The relationships between a seed voxel and its neighbors are represented by the edge weights of each mesh, and are estimated by solving a linear regression equation. The estimated mesh edge weights lead to a better representation of information in the brain for encoding and decoding of the cognitive tasks. We test our model on a visual object recognition and emotional memory retrieval experiments using Support Vector Machines that are trained using the mesh edge weights as features.

In particular, with the growth in battery-powered electric vehicle development, the lithium-ion battery plays a critical role in the reliability of vehicle systems. In order to provide timely maintenance and replacement of battery systems, it is necessary to develop a reliable and accurate battery health diagnostic that takes a prognostic approach. Therefore, this paper focuses on two main methods to determine a battery's health: (1) Battery State-of-Health (SOH) monitoring and (2) Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction. Both of these are calculated by using a filter algorithm known as the Support Vector Regression-Particle Filter (SVR-PF). Models for battery SOH monitoring based on SVR-PF are developed with novel capacity degradation parameters introduced to determine battery health in real time. Moreover, the RUL prediction model is proposed, which is able to provide the RUL value and update the RUL probability distribution to the End-of-Life cycle. Results for both methods are presented, showing that the proposed SOH monitoring and RUL prediction methods have good performance and that the SVR-PF has better monitoring and prediction capability than the standard particle filter (PF).", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.176", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Power Sources", "mag_id": "2038012452", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["49654088", "202095214", "57756499", "204822090", "11892362", "118678970", "10044048", "139548754", "34472751", "52935205", "31407029", "49351484", "5038074", "108805285", "52917460", "8678167", "196167910", "212634884", "201810810", "125405855", "23147623", "55410389", "4686370", "59235404", "85498731", "209790084", "44190224", "150384023", "204091073", "117676618", "4693475", "129656324", "214692387", "41016359", "67081904", "13378550", "32700112", "27613294", "3815908", "52004078", "77393349", "3568309", "2118545", "14855295", "13341579", "44063727", "32550525"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110643788"}

To this end, we propose a Pose Invariant Model (PIM) for face recognition in the wild, with three distinct novelties. First, PIM is a novel and unified deep architecture, containing a Face Frontalization sub-Net (FFN) and a Discriminative Learning sub-Net (DLN), which are jointly learned from end to end. Second, FFN is a well-designed dual-path Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which simultaneously perceives global structures and local details, incorporated with an unsupervised cross-domain adversarial training and a \"learning to learn\" strategy for high-fidelity and identity-preserving frontal view synthesis. Third, DLN is a generic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for face recognition with our enforced cross-entropy optimization strategy for learning discriminative yet generalized feature representation.

The proposed system uses cost-effective inertial sensors, in conjunction with pattern recognition techniques, for identifying sensitive classifiers towards discriminate identification of LB patients. 24 healthy individuals and 28 low back pain patients performed trunk motion tasks in five different directions for validation. Four combinations of these motions were selected based on literature, and the corresponding kinematic data was collected. Upon filtering (4th order, low pass Butterworth filter) and normalizing the data, Principal Component Analysis was used for feature extraction, while Support Vector Machine classifier was applied for data classification. The results reveal that non-linear Kernel classification can be adequately employed for low back pain identification. Our preliminary results demonstrate that using a single inertial sensor placed on the thorax, in conjunction with a relatively simple test protocol, can identify low back pain with an accuracy of 96%, a sensitivity of %100, and specificity of 92%.

The classes are: scatter to represent vegetation such as tall grasses, bushes and tree canopy, surface to capture solid objects like ground surface, rocks or tree trunks. However, the only use of 3D features would never result a real robust vegetation detection system because of lacking color information. We, hence, propose a 2D-3D combination approach which can utilize the complement of three-dimensional point distribution and color descriptor. Firstly, 3D point cloud is segmented into regions of homogeneous distance. The local point distribution is then analyzed for each region to extract scatter features. Secondly, a coarse 2D-3D calibration needs to be implemented in order to map the regions to the corresponding color image. Then, color descriptors are studied and applied to each region and considered as color features.

We build a framework for applying the EnKF method on parameter optimization problems. We propose ensemble evolution to converge to the global optimum. We also optimize the EnKF calculation for large datasets by using the computationally efficient UR decomposition. To demonstrate the performance of our proposed design, we apply our approach for the tuning problem of Support Vector Machines.

Hypertension is the medical term for systolic and diastolic blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg. A conventional medication adherence scale was used to identify patients' adherence to their prescribed medication. Using machine learning applications to predict precise numeric adherence scores in hypertensive patients has not yet been reported in the literature. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: Data from 160 hypertensive patients from a tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, were used in this study. Variables were ranked based on their significance to adherence levels using the RF variable importance method. The backward elimination method was then performed using RF to obtain the variables significantly associated with the patients' adherence levels. RF, SVR and ANN models were developed to predict adherence using the identified significant variables. Visualizations of the relationships between hypertensive patients' adherence levels and variables were generated using SOM. ::: ::: ::: Result ::: Machine learning models constructed using the selected variables reported RMSE values of 1.42 for ANN, 1.53 for RF, and 1.55 for SVR. The accuracy of the dichotomised scores, calculated based on a percentage of correctly identified adherence values, was used as an additional model performance measure, resulting in accuracies of 65% (ANN), 78% (RF) and 79% (SVR), respectively. The Wilcoxon signed ranked test reported that there was no significant difference between the predictions of the machine learning models and the actual scores. The significant variables identified from the RF variable importance method were educational level, marital status, General Overuse, monthly income, and Specific Concern. ::: ::: ::: Conclusion ::: This study suggests an effective alternative to conventional methods in identifying the key variables to understand hypertensive patients' adherence levels.

The kernel-based ensemble technique first randomly selects spectral feature subspaces from the input data. Each individual classifier, which is in fact a support vector machine (SVM), then independently conducts its own learning within its corresponding spectral feature subspace and hence constitutes a weak classifier. The decisions from these weak classifiers are equally or adaptively combined to generate the final ensemble decision. However, in such ensemble learning, little attempt has been previously made to jointly optimize the weak classifiers and the aggregating process for combining the subdecisions. The main goal of this paper is to achieve an optimal sparse combination of the subdecisions by jointly optimizing the separating hyperplane obtained by optimally combining the kernel matrices of the SVM classifiers and the corresponding weights of the subdecisions required for the aggregation process. Sparsity is induced by applying an l1 norm constraint on the weighting coefficients. Consequently, the weights of most of the subclassifiers become zero after the optimization, and only a few of the subclassifiers with non-zero weights contribute to the final ensemble decision. Moreover, in this paper, an algorithm to determine the optimal full-diagonal bandwidth parameters of the Gaussian kernels of the individual SVMs is also presented by minimizing the radius-margin bound. The optimized full-diagonal bandwidth Gaussian kernels are used by the sparse SVM ensemble to perform binary classification. The performance of the proposed technique with optimized kernel parameters is compared to that of the one with single-bandwidth parameter obtained using cross-validation by testing them on various data sets. On an average, the proposed sparse kernel-based ensemble learning algorithm with optimized full-diagonal bandwidth parameters shows an improvement of 20% over the existing ensemble learning techniques.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2012.2203603", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2051568244", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "14495716", "31220742", "8693648", "2045232", "16596563", "63751177", "6644398", "14723701", "18105430", "206420153", "122256282", "16821651", "120555439", "60633363", "194951", "14607075", "28637672", "10301465", "1871891", "9988056", "59076046"], "inbound_citations": ["208877617", "3693618", "20458530", "3544458", "9456719", "22769333", "1429580", "22714760", "4059369", "10995838", "29615668", "123458138", "125813391", "24837701", "5856281", "13759473", "5555490", "123579577", "34586567", "54882858", "24788171"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2218560"}

Moreover, the exact location and orientation of the sensor is also a common restriction that is relaxed in this study.

Secondly, Support Vector Regression is applied on heuristically extracted features for the automatic computation of spatiotemporal properties during gait. Finally, sensor information is interpreted as an observation of a particular trajectory of the human gait dynamical system, from which a reconstruction space is obtained, and then transformed using standard principal components analysis, nally Support Vector Regression is used for prediction.

However, they restrict their pairwise weights to take the form of a weighted combination of Gaussian kernels where each Gaussian component is allowed to take only zero mean, and can only be rescaled by a single value for each label pair. Further, their method is sensitive to initialization. In this paper, we propose methods to alleviate these issues. First, we propose a hierarchical mean-field approach where labelling from the coarser level is propagated to the finer level for better initialisation. Further, we use SIFT-flow based label transfer to provide a good initial condition at the coarsest level. Second, we allow our approach to take general Gaussian pairwise weights, where we learn the mean, the co-variance matrix, and the mixing co-efficient for every mixture component.

Traditional features such as HOG, SIFT, SURF etc., individually encapsulates certain discriminative cues for visual classification. On the other hand, each layer of a deep neural network generates multi ordered representations. In this paper we present a novel approach for such multi feature representation learning using Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost). General practise in AdaBoost [8] is to concatenate components of feature spaces and train base learners to classify examples as correctly/incorrectly classified. We posit that multi feature space learning should be viewed as a derivative of cooperative multi agent learning. To this end, we propose a mathematical framework to leverage performance of base learners over each feature space, gauge a measure of \"difficulty\" of training space and finally make soft weight updates rather than strict binary weight updates prevalent in regular AdaBoost. This is made possible by periodically sharing of response states by our learner agents in the boosting framework. Theoretically, such soft weight update policy allows infinite combinations of weight updates on training space compared to only two possibilities in AdaBoost. This opens up the opportunity to identify 'more difficult' examples compared to 'less difficult' examples. We test our model on traditional multi feature representation of MNIST handwritten character dataset and 100-Leaves classification challenge.

In this paper, we propose a new strategy to measure the relatedness that jointly learns shared parameters and shared feature representations. The objective of our proposed method is to transform the features of different tasks into a common feature space in which the tasks are closely related and the shared parameters can be better optimized. We give a detailed introduction to our proposed MTL method. Additionally, an alternating algorithm is introduced to optimize the nonconvex objection.

Adding explicit constraints to avoid unsafe states is generally not possible when the state representations are complex. Furthermore, enforcing these constraints during execution of the learned policy can be challenging in environments where dynamics are difficult to model such as push mechanics in grasping. In this paper, we propose a two-phase method for generating robust policies from demonstrations in robotic manipulation tasks. In the first phase, we use support estimation of supervisor demonstrations and treat the support as implicit constraints on states in addition to learning a policy directly from the observed controls. We also propose a time-variant modification to the support estimation problem allowing for accurate estimation on sequential tasks. In the second phase, we use a switching policy to steer the robot from leaving safe regions of the state space during run time using the decision function of the estimated support. The policy switches between the robot's learned policy and a novel recovery policy depending on the distance to the boundary of the support. We present additional conditions, which linearly bound the difference in state at each time step by the magnitude of control, allowing us to prove that the robot will not violate the constraints using the recovery policy.

It achieved an accuracy over 91.3% in the 10-fold cross validation, and the best accuracy of 72% in an independent testing, which suggests a possibility for early detection of PD.

By having a system that is able to leverage and share knowledge across them, our aim is two-fold: to circumvent the so-called Backtest Overfitting problem; and to generate higher risk-adjusted returns and fewer drawdowns. To do that, QuantNet exploits a form of modelling called Transfer Learning, where two layers are market-specific and another one is market-agnostic. This ensures that the transfer occurs across trading strategies, with the market-agnostic layer acting as a vehicle to share knowledge, cross-influence each strategy parameters, and ultimately the trading signal produced. In order to evaluate QuantNet, we compared its performance in relation to the option of not performing transfer learning, that is, using market-specific old-fashioned machine learning. In summary, our findings suggest that QuantNet performs better than non transfer-based trading strategies, improving Sharpe ratio in 15% and Calmar ratio in 41% across 3103 assets in 58 equity markets across the world.

The progress of a bolus of contrast agent through the tissue of the brain is imaged via a series of T2*-weighted MRI scans. Clinically relevant parameters such as blood flow and Tmax can be calculated by deconvolving the contrast-time curves with the bolus shape (arterial input function). In acute stroke, for instance, these parameters may help distinguish between the likely salvageable tissue and irreversibly damaged infarct core. Deconvolution typically relies on singular value decomposition (SVD): however, studies have shown that these algorithms are very sensitive to noise and artifacts present in the image and therefore may introduce distortions that influence the estimated output parameters. Methods: In this work, we present a machine learning approach to the estimation of perfusion parameters in DSC-MRI. Various machine learning models using as input the raw MR source data were trained to reproduce the output of an FDA approved commercial implementation of the SVD deconvolution algorithm.Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of training set size, optimal patch size, and the effect of using different machine-learning models for regression Results: Model performance increased with training set size, but after 5000 samples (voxels) this effect was minimal. Models inferring perfusion maps from a 5 by 5 voxel patch outperformed models able to use the information in a single voxel, but larger patches led to worse performance. Random Forest models produced had the lowest root mean squared error, with neural networks performing second best: however, a phantom study revealed that the random forest was highly susceptible to noise levels, while the neural network was more robust Conclusion: The machine learning-based approach produces estimates of the perfusion parameters invariant to the noise and artifacts that commonly occur as part of MR acquisition. As a result, better robustness to noise is obtained, when evaluated against the FDA approved software on acute stroke patients and simulated phantom data", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6131486", "pubmed_id": "30233482", "doi": "10.3389/fneur.2018.00717", "venue": "Front.

In this paper, we present an enhanced DCNN framework specifically tailored for road extraction of remote sensing images by applying landscape metrics (LMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs). To improve the DCNN, a modern activation function called the exponential linear unit (ELU), is employed in our network, resulting in a higher number of, and yet more accurate, extracted roads. To further reduce falsely classified road objects, a solution based on an adoption of LMs is proposed. Finally, to sharpen the extracted roads, a CRF method is added to our framework.

In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic presentation of pollen data and biome assignment. We apply a recently developed pollen-based vegetation classification method utilizing supervised machine learning to Southern Africa modern pollen assemblages. We present an updated modern pollen dataset from Southern Africa, linking the sites to previously defined vegetation units and, ultimately, we generate probabilistic classification for fossil assemblages to reconstruct past vegetation. The modern pollen dataset (N = 211 sites) represents a long vegetation gradient, from desert to forest biomes, capturing broad climate gradients ranging from arid to subtropical. We validate two models using Random Forest algorithm to classify modern vegetation at different spatial resolutions: subcontinental (biomes) and regional (bioregions). When the modern pollen assemblages (N = 164 sites) are used to predict the vegetation types, the classification models are correct in a number of cases. In our dataset of 164 sites, the classification model correctly classifies pollen assemblages from savanna (91% correct), grassland (87%), and coastal forest (82%) vegetation types, while the best results for classification of regional vegetation are achieved for sub-humid savanna (95%), dry savanna (95%), coastal forest (91%), and wet grassland (90%). We apply the models to a fossil pollen sequence at Wonderkrater in the South African savanna, to reconstruct subcontinental and regional changes in past vegetation states over the last 60 000 years. The most probable vegetation state dominating the region since the Late Pleistocene is sub-humid savanna yet grassland occurred at times associated with high vegetation variability. Within the record, the most frequent and amplified variability in the inferred vegetation states occurred during the transitional phase between the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene.

Recently, with the advent of new sensors, the time-series data with high spatial and temporal resolutions have become widely available and used for constructing various VIs time-series. These high-resolution time-series, in addition to temporal information about the crops\u2019 phenology, contain valuable information about the spatial patterns of croplands. This information can be used to increase the performance of crop classification. In order to properly extract both spatial and temporal information from the time-series of VIs, we proposed the concept of histogram-based spatio-temporal (HST) features. These features represent each pixel in a time-series by the histogram of its spatio-temporal neighborhood. The HST features, like any other histogram-based features, are characterized by high dimensionality and sparseness. Consequently, the common classification algorithms cannot be employed for their classification. To address this issue, we presented Support Vector Machines (SVM) using an intersection kernel, which is specifically proposed for classification of histogram-based features. Time-series of three different vegetation indices, namely, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIRE) were considered to evaluate the performance of the HST features. The results of experimental tests showed that the HST features by yielding the overall accuracy of 88.31%, 87.27% and 84.36% for NDVIRE, NDVI, and SAVI respectively are much more informative than other textural features used for comparison. Moreover, we provided a detailed analysis of the performance of the HST features concerning the size of the spatio-temporal neighborhood and the number of histogram\u2019s bins.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2018.05.014", "venue": "Int.

Understanding and predicting transcription factor interactions based on their sequence alone is difficult since they are often part of families of factors sharing high sequence identity. Given the scarcity of experimental data on interactions compared to available sequence data, however, it would be most useful to have accurate methods for the prediction of such interactions. Results: We present a method consisting of a Random Forestbased feature-selection procedure that selects relevant motifs out of a set found using a correlated motif search algorithm. Prediction accuracy for several transcription factor families (bZIP, MADS, homeobox and forkhead) reaches 60\u201390%. In addition, we identified those parts of the sequence that are important for the interaction specificity, and show that these are in agreement with available data.

Differentially expressed modules tend to distinguish differences integrally. Identifying modules individually has been crucial for understanding OS mechanisms and applications of custom therapeutic decisions in the future. MATERIAL AND METHODS Samples came from individuals were used from control group (n=15) and OS group (n=84). Based on clique-merging, module-identification algorithm was used to identify modules from OS PPI networks. A novel approach - the individualized module aberrance score (iMAS) was performed to distinguish differences, making special use of accumulated normal samples (ANS). We performed biological process ontology to classify functionally modules. Then Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to test distribution results of normal and OS group with screened modules. RESULTS We identified 83 modules containing 2084 genes from PPI network in which 61 modules were significantly different. Cluster analysis of OS using the iMAS method identified 5 modules clusters. Specificity=1.00 and Sensitivity=1.00 proved the distribution outcomes of screened modules were mainly consistent with that of total data, which suggested the efficiency of 61 modules. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that a novel pipeline that identified the dysregulated modules in individuals of OS.

Our hypothesis is that models should be aware of verb semantics, as expressed via semantic role labels, argument types, and/or frame elements. Unfortunately, no VQA dataset exists that includes verb semantic information. Our first contribution is a new VQA dataset (imSituVQA) that we built by taking advantage of the imSitu annotations.

Compared with traditional topical classification, it was hypothesized that syntactic and semantic processing of text would be more important for sentiment classification. In this study, five different approaches, unigrams (individual words), part-of-speech tagging, association rules, use of negation, and use of WordNet synsets (identifying a set of synonyms) were investigated. A sample of 1,800 miscellaneous product reviews was retrieved from Review Centre (www.reviewcentre.com. 2003) for the study. 1,200 reviews were used for training, and 600 for validation. Using SVM, the baseline unigrams approach obtained an accuracy rate of 81.3%. The use of WordNet synsets obtained marginally better result of 81.7%. The other text features did not yield better results.

Besides, the validity of the model was estimate using the measured data of pore water pressure. The slope stability coefficients were calculated in GEO-STUDIO environment. And the data were used as the input samples to train and test SVM model. Results show that the agreement achieved in pore water pressure between measurement and analysis using the finite element model can be considered very reasonable. And the slope stability coefficient results by SVM coincided well with that of finite element analysis. It suggests that the proposed model has the potential to be a useful tool for the prediction of slope stability coefficient considering the influence of rainfall and water level.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.851.840", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Mechanics and Materials", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2517884971", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["129867359", "111070334", "62613529", "129861116", "120299325", "140631605", "121592676", "110043043", "205702109", "110766393", "113009915", "110441902", "7138354", "120375703", "124101664", "124532315", "140706267", "129861116"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113922691"}

In this paper, we propose a DA based method called Emotion-discriminative and Domain-invariant Feature Learning Method (EDFLM) for SER, in which both the domain divergence and emotion discrimination are considered to learn emotion-discriminative and domain-invariant features by using emotion label constraint and domain label constraint. Furthermore, to disentangle the emotion-related factors from the emotion-unrelated factors, we introduce an orthogonal term to encourage the input to be disentangled into two blocks: emotion-related and emotion-unrelated features. Our method can learn emotion-discriminative and domain-invariant features through a back propagation network which uses the acoustic features of INTERSPEECH 2009 Emotion Challenge as the input rather than raw speech signals.

Most existing approaches utilize predefined rules and domain knowledge to derive shot types in sports video.

To address this problem, we propose a generic approach to classify shots in sports video. Our approach utilizes bag of visual words model to represent key frame for each shot based on Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature points; either Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) are then employed to classify key frame to determine shot type. As our approach relies little on domain knowledge, it can be more easily extended to different sports. We have evaluated our shot classification approach over five types of sports video and have achieved promising results. To show the usefulness and effectiveness of our shot classification, we apply the results of shot type to detect events in basketball video via a generative-discriminative model. In addition, we have observed that some common visual parts frequently appear across various shots in the same sport or even different but relevant sports. For instance, soccer and basketball are relevant sports in the sense of field-ball game.

The discriminator aims to estimate the probability that a summary came from the training data rather than the generator to guide the training of the generative model.

Most current transfer-learning methods focus on scenarios where the auxiliary and the target learning tasks are very similar: either (some of) the auxiliary data can be directly used as training examples for the target task or the auxiliary and the target data share the same representation. However, in many cases the connection between the auxiliary and the target tasks can be remote. Only a few features derived from the auxiliary data may be helpful for the target learning. We call such scenario the deep transfer-learning scenario and we introduce a novel transfer-learning method for deep transfer. Our method uses restricted Boltzmann machine to discover a set of hierarchical features from the auxiliary data. We then select from these features a subset that are helpful for the target learning, using a selection criterion based on the concept of kernel-target alignment. Finally, the target data are augmented with the selected features before training. Our experiment results show that this transfer method is effective.

In particular, the problems of cross-session and cross-subject classification are considered. These problems concern the ability to use data from previous sessions or from a database of past users to calibrate and initialize the classifier, allowing a calibration-less BCI mode of operation. Methods: Data are represented using spatial covariance matrices of the EEG signals, exploiting the recent successful techniques based on the Riemannian geometry of the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. Cross-session and cross-subject classification can be difficult, due to the many changes intervening between sessions and between subjects, including physiological, environmental, as well as instrumental changes. Here, we propose to affine transform the covariance matrices of every session/subject in order to center them with respect to a reference covariance matrix, making data from different sessions/subjects comparable. Then, classification is performed both using a standard minimum distance to mean classifier, and through a probabilistic classifier recently developed in the literature, based on a density function (mixture of Riemannian Gaussian distributions) defined on the SPD manifold. Results: The improvements in terms of classification performances achieved by introducing the affine transformation are documented with the analysis of two BCI datasets.

However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the retrospective design nature, limited sample size and the lack of several potential confounding factors (including obesity, nutritional status, and fruit and vegetable consumption and potential regional carcinogen contacts).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5623487", "pubmed_id": "28947442", "doi": "10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015443", "venue": "BMJ Open", "journal": "BMJ Open", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2756925100", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["30500384", "1609513", "25124254", "30322340", "13836309", "22995392", "22861501", "25155249", "39273376", "35988600", "40812749", "9975715", "34727160", "12992845", "29630900", "9204923", "3253469", "54550632", "157595", "18683182", "45673063", "61007780", "12051918", "89141", "28637672", "60611377", "4482923", "16230928", "207048014"], "inbound_citations": ["204811433", "58007543"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:29413942"}

The SVM problem is formulated as a convex objective function subject to box constraints that needs to be maximized, a quadratic programming (QP) problem. In order to solve the QP problem on larger data sets specialized algorithms and heuristics are required. In this paper we present a new data-squashing method for selecting training instances in support vector learning. Inspired by the growing neural gas algorithm and learning vector quantization we introduce a new, parameter robust neural gas variant to retrieve an initial approximation of the training set containing only those samples that will likely become support vectors in the final classifier. This first approximation is refined in the border areas, defined by neighboring neurons of different classes, yielding the final training set. We evaluate our approach on synthetic as well as real-life datasets, comparing run-time complexity and accuracy to a random sampling approach and the exact solution of the support vector machine. Results show that runtime-complexity can be significantly reduced while achieving the same accuracy as the exact solution and that furthermore our approach does not not rely on data set specific parameterization of the sampling rate like random sampling for doing so.

This task is particularly difficult, and little explored, with respect to the literature in the arts and humanities, where references are mostly given in footnotes. We apply a deep learning architecture for reference mining from the full text of scholarly publications. We explore and discuss three architectural components: word and character-level word embeddings, different prediction layers (Softmax and Conditional Random Fields) and multi-task over single-task learning. Our best model uses both pre-trained word embeddings and characters embeddings, and a BiLSTM-CRF architecture. We test our solution on a dataset of annotated references from the historiography on Venice and, using a linear-chain CRF classifier as a baseline, we show that this deep learning architecture improves by a considerable margin.

Historical flooding records from government bulletins and newspapers, the only available information regarding floods that have occurred in some mountainous areas, are valuable for understanding flood disaster mechanisms in these regions. In this study, the flood susceptibility in mountainous regions in China was mapped based on historical flooding records from 1949 to 2000. A Random Forest (RF) model, which can handle large datasets through factor contribution analysis, was chosen to characterize the relationships between flooding occurrences and twelve geographic, meteorological, and hydrological explanatory factors. The results indicate that the RF model can effectively identify flood-prone areas and has advantages over artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) methods. Among these explanatory factors, the geographic factors (elevation, longitude and drainage density) are the most important predictors of flooding in China's mountainous areas, whereas the hydrological factors (relative elevation and curve number) are the least important. Two independent datasets of historical flooding events from the Bulletin of Flood and Drought Disasters in China (2006\u20132014) alongside news reports and yearbooks (2008\u20132014) were collected and chosen to validate the capability of the RF model. The validation results confirm that the RF model can identify the flood susceptibility with satisfactory accuracy.

Therefore point estimation of posterior probability is used. In RVM evidence value is calculated via Laplace approximation. However, extended model doesn't allow maximization of posterior probability as dimension of optimization parameters space becomes too high. Hence Laplace approximation can be no more used in new model. We propose a local evidence estimation method which establishes a compromise between accuracy and stability of algorithm.

Modelling was attempted at two scales: site-specific and a global scale. Spectral measurements were obtained on the near-infrared (NIR) spectral range between 1600 to 2400 nm under field conditions in a non-destructive way using a portable spectrophotometer. For the site specific approach, spectra were collected from the adaxial side of 400 individual leaves of 20 grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) varieties one week after veraison. For the global model, two additional sets of spectra were collected one week before harvest from two different vineyards in another vintage, each one consisting on 48 measurement from individual leaves of six varieties. Several combinations of spectra scatter correction and smoothing filtering were studied. For the training of the models, support vector machines and artificial neural networks were employed using the pre-processed spectra as input and the varieties as the classes of the models. The results from the pre-processing study showed that there was no influence whether using scatter correction or not. Also, a second-degree derivative with a window size of 5 Savitzky-Golay filtering yielded the highest outcomes. For the site-specific model, with 20 classes, the best results from the classifiers thrown an overall score of 87.25% of correctly classified samples. These results were compared under the same conditions with a model trained using partial least squares discriminant analysis, which showed a worse performance in every case.

One prominent way of symbolically representing attitudes is through meta-representational schemes. These have representational expressions that themselves refer to representational expressions. Meta-representation is one of the most expressively powerful symbolic approaches for attitude representation. Therefore: could non-implementationai connectionist systems use an analogous approach? Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to devise a plausible analogy. The paper looks at three main possibilities: (i) the representational activation patterns of the non-implementational connectionist system refer to the system's own activation patterns; (ii) the activation patterns refer to formal symbolic expressions; and (iii) the activation patterns refer to natural-language expressions. These approaches, which are not claimed to be exhaustive, concentrate respectively on the following facts about symbolic meta-representation schemes: (1) they typically refer to their own representational expressions; (2) the schemes typically refer to formal symbolic expressions; although (3) some of the schemes refer to natural language expressions. The article briefly argues that possibility (iii) avoids some of the problems of (i) and (ii). There are also two independent, non\u00ad connectionism-derived reasons for considering (iii). One is that it is strongly related to a prevalent commonsense metaphor of beliefs and so on as internal, natural language utterances. (The other is to do with the heightened difficulty of handling vague quantification within propositional attitude contexts, but is discussed elsewhere and not in the present paper.) The paper as a whole highlights the point that even a non-implementational connectionist system must be able to think about complex symbolic constructs such as logic expressions and natural language phrases, even though it does not think with them.", "year": 1993, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/09528139308953762", "venue": "J.

Because the analysis of residual stands in the field is prohibitively expensive we lack understanding on how residual stands are distributed and why. Here, we explore the use of high-resolution Quickbird satellite imagery in conjunction with in-situ measurements and machine learning techniques to map basal area of spruce and fir for two fire areas in Central Siberia, and analyze the distribution of residual stands with respect to topography. First, an advanced feature selection algorithm which combines a genetic algorithm with guided local search is wrapped around the Random Forests regression technique, to identify suitable variable subsets out of a large number of candidate variables that were derived from Quickbird data. Second, we train and apply Random Forests using the derived variable subsets to the two fire areas to generate spatially explicit estimates of basal area for spruce and fir. Third, we analyze species specific differences and the relationship between basal area and topography using a high resolution digital elevation model from ASTER data. Our results show that the main gradients of species specific basal area can be reproduced using Quickbird data but stress the importance of variable selection. We find associations of residual stands with topography - depressions and channels exhibit larger prevalence of residual stands than ridges or plateaus, the latter being more often subject to severe fires. We further found that the relationship between basal area and elevation tends to be reversed inside the burned area in comparison to the surrounding unburned forest. Our results suggest that local topography may control the sensitivity of ecological processes to a changing fire regime with more severe fires, and highlight the synergistic use of high resolution satellite remote sensing and machine learning methods for fire ecological applications.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procs.2013.05.410", "venue": "ICCS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2045973791", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["73666656", "86257953", "13836826", "131285000", "84561416", "14715509", "130919599", "724358", "83549083", "25896857", "133318891", "86051320", "128619277", "18098865", "89141", "124426327", "206420153", "13014985", "140164618", "129163412", "1764288", "21269053"], "inbound_citations": ["13014985", "205143109", "58013662", "290238", "134901991", "3972456"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7039295"}

Nodes which share the same label are then grouped into communities. Although LPA excels with near linear execution time, it gets easily stuck in local optima and often returns a single giant community.

In this article, we propose Cross-modal Generative Adversarial Networks (CM-GANs) with the following contributions. First, a cross-modal GAN architecture is proposed to model joint distribution over the data of different modalities. The inter-modality and intra-modality correlation can be explored simultaneously in generative and discriminative models. Both compete with each other to promote cross-modal correlation learning. Second, the cross-modal convolutional autoencoders with weight-sharing constraint are proposed to form the generative model. They not only exploit the cross-modal correlation for learning the common representations but also preserve reconstruction information for capturing the semantic consistency within each modality. Third, a cross-modal adversarial training mechanism is proposed, which uses two kinds of discriminative models to simultaneously conduct intra-modality and inter-modality discrimination. They can mutually boost to make the generated common representations more discriminative by the adversarial training process. In summary, our proposed CM-GAN approach can use GANs to perform cross-modal common representation learning by which the heterogeneous data can be effectively correlated. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the performance of CM-GANs on cross-modal retrieval compared with 13 state-of-the-art methods on 4 cross-modal datasets.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1710.05106", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3284750", "venue": "TOMM", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2950355382,2964216321,2766910785", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2495132", "2627084", "6483070", "1282515", "207216960", "2973467", "2659157", "1560943", "1033682", "3031042", "4461350", "202473", "30227854", "122166830", "30922496", "13945591", "207763512", "211227", "4606637", "3854649", "4616218", "6704804", "6242128", "12867189", "16447573", "12803511", "352650", "1099052", "20028564", "14061443", "15514398", "18064867", "27307562", "11758569", "6930928", "5583509", "1563370", "1515901", "10328909", "25330674", "14124313", "9197086", "686835", "23672393", "15565263", "19140125", "3331356", "5063278", "1541706", "13618178", "15692855", "18365605", "19015689", "14932020", "3870065", "14634330", "6783548", "1277217"], "inbound_citations": ["25162465", "167205351", "167205351", "47020689", "13969696", "146811135", "197928073", "210696566", "69944815", "209525460", "208512938", "199489240", "211297689", "209696502", "215238895", "208298271", "51877895", "204837644", "86832326", "204837544", "204575964", "208157975", "198162980", "198906771", "59523701", "145047863", "169032532", "182952857", "210972034", "201651618", "3994012", "195847777"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8355505"}

Based on the theoretical technology of machine vision, this paper proposed a double threshold method to extract potential defect area and eliminate the background area and the completely defect-free area. In the double threshold method, we utilize the Canny operator and the PPHT (Progressive Probabilistic Hough Transform) to adjust the direction of the image block on the end face of the steel coils, makes the texture direction on each image block consistent. Then, Gaussian steerable filter, followed by second Canny and PPHT, was applied to enhance image.

In this context, land cover maps of remote sensing data are the most commonly used EO products and development of adequate classification strategies is an ongoing research topic. However, the availability of meaningful multispectral data sets can be limited due to cloud cover, particularly in the tropics. In such regions, the use of SAR systems (Synthetic Aperture Radar), which are nearly independent form weather conditions, is particularly promising. With an ever-growing number of SAR satellites, as well as the increasing accessibility of SAR data, potentials for multi-frequency remote sensing are becoming numerous. In our study, we evaluate the synergistic contribution of multitemporal L-, C-, and X-band data to tropical land cover mapping. We compare classification outcomes of ALOS-2, RADARSAT-2, and TerraSAR-X datasets for a study site in the Brazilian Amazon using a wrapper approach. After preprocessing and calculation of GLCM texture (Grey Level Co-Occurence), the wrapper utilizes Random Forest classifications to estimate scene importance. Comparing the contribution of different wavelengths, ALOS-2 data perform best in terms of overall classification accuracy, while the classification of TerraSAR-X data yields higher accuracies when compared to the results achieved by RADARSAT-2. Moreover, the wrapper underlines potentials of multi-frequency classification as integration of multi-frequency images is always preferred over multi-temporal, mono-frequent composites.

Considering the earthquake that hit L'Aquila city (Italy) on April 6, 2009, this work assess the feasibility of producing damage maps at the scale of single building from Very High Resolution (VHR) optical images collected before and after the seismic event. We considered the European Macroseismic Scale 1998 (EMS-98) and assessed the possibility to discriminate between collapsed or heavy damaged buildings (damage grade DG equal to 5 in the EMS-98 scale) and less damaged or undamaged buildings (DG The proposed approach relies on a pre-existing urban map to identify image objects corresponding to building footprints. The image analysis is carried out according to many different parameters with the objective of assessing their effectiveness in singling out changes associated to the building collapse.

In this paper, first, we explore the possibility of using Permutation Entropy (PE) of speed, a measure of complexity and uncertainty of GPS trajectory segment, as a feature for transportation mode detection. Second, we employ Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to distinguish GPS trajectory segments of different transportation.

Here, we demonstrate that with the increased sensitivity of modern FTIR spectrometers, automatisation of sample preparation and modern bioinformatics, it is possible to identify and validate spectral biomarker candidates for distinguishing between urinary bladder cancer (UBC) and inflammation in suspected bladder cancer patients. The current dataset contains spectra of blood serum and plasma samples of 135 patients. All patients underwent cytology and pathological biopsy characterization to distinguish between patients without UBC (46) and confirmed UBC cases (89). A minimally invasive blood test could spare control patients a repeated cystoscopy including a transurethral biopsy, and three-day stationary hospitalisation. Blood serum, EDTA and citrate plasma were collected from each patient and processed following predefined strict standard operating procedures. Highly reproducible dry films were obtained by spotting sub-nanoliter biofluid droplets in defined patterns, which were compared and optimized. Particular attention was paid to the automatisation of sample preparation and spectral preprocessing to exclude errors by manual handling. Spectral biomarker candidates were identified from absorbance spectra and their 1st and 2nd derivative spectra using an advanced Random Forest (RF) approach. It turned out that the 2nd derivative spectra were most useful for classification. Repeat validation on 21% of the dataset not included in predictor training with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifiers and Random Forests (RFs) yielded a sensitivity of 93 \u00b1 10% and a specificity of 46 \u00b1 18% for bladder cancer. The low specificity can be most likely attributed to the unbalanced and small number of control samples.

In the present paper, we specifically consider Gaussian distributions to model uncertainty. Thereby, our data consist of pairs $(x_i,\\Sigma_i)$, $i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$, along with an indicator $y_i\\in\\{-1,1\\}$ to declare membership in one of two categories for each pair. These pairs may be viewed to represent the mean and covariance, respectively, of random vectors $\\xi_i$ taking values in a suitable linear space (typically ${\\mathbb R}^n$).

In this paper, we present a new large-scale database \"Multi-Human Parsing (MHP)\" for algorithm development and evaluation, and advances the state-of-the-art in understanding humans in crowded scenes. MHP contains 25,403 elaborately annotated images with 58 fine-grained semantic category labels, involving 2-26 persons per image and captured in real-world scenes from various viewpoints, poses, occlusion, interactions and background.

NAN consists of three Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-like sub-nets, respectively performing semantic saliency prediction, instance-agnostic parsing and instance-aware clustering. These sub-nets form a nested structure and are carefully designed to learn jointly in an end-to-end way.

With a carefully-designed pipeline, we show that the answer is affirmative. First, a large-scale image set is generated using the generator of GAN, without manual annotation. Then, these images are fed to a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) followed by a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM), which performs the feature learning and sequence labelling. Finally, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned on real images. Our experimental results on a few data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of using GAN images: an improvement of 7.5% over a strong baseline with moderate-sized real data being available. We show that the proposed framework achieves competitive recognition accuracy on challenging test datasets.

Although each of those models has its strengths within relatively well suited application domains, none provide adequate mechanisms to support the interactions among knowledge structures which are necessary to capture the generative capacities of human diagnosticians in novel situations. Achieving such interactions has been one of the greatest difficulties associated with implementing models of diagnostic decision-making that can reason in the presence of imprecise or incomplete information, using traditional AI representations like frames [Minsky, 1975] and production rules [Newell & Simon, 1972]. Throughout this period, however, there has been an unabated interest in developing radically different models of human memory and cognition. , This impetus for a new perspective to cognition can be largely attributed to a desire to overcome the shortcomings of existing symbol processing models to emulate human decision-making in terms of its underlying structure, representation and processing of knowledge, but more importantly, to better understand its evolution with experience over time. Not surprisingly, there has been a resurrection of a previously abandoned approach to studying the mind, called \"Parallel Distributed Processing\", \"Connectionism\", or \"Neural Networks\". Unlike classical approaches which associate intelligence with the explicit manipulation of structured symbolic expressions, this new approach proposes that intelligence emerges as a result of the transmission of activation levels within large networks of highly interconnected nodes, at times without specific semantic content. Implicit in the structure and behavior of neural models, they exhibit many of the interesting phenomena that are commonly associated with intelligence but which have eluded successful explication using traditional symbol-processing techniques.

Part of these devices may leverage machine learning models to detect events. However, the recognition ability of a device is limited to its sensing type and the deployed position. In order to improve the system recognition ability, additional sensing devices need to be added. Nevertheless, training the computational algorithm for the newly added sensing device requires collecting and labeling large amount of data, which is both time-consuming and expensive. Many researchers are engaged to study synchronous automatic learning methods to tackle this challenge. In these approaches, learning ability of the added device can be transferred from a well-trained source device with no need to label data. However, these methods are unable to train a new model which exceeds the source model in recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Talent Learner Transfer Learning method (TLTL). TLTL enables the added sensor to find new capable instances automatically, which are confusing for the old sensor but distinguishable to the added sensor, and then refines their labels through active learning. As a consequence, the added sensor can outperform the old sensor in recognition accuracy. Performance evaluations are based on three public datasets and one self-collected dataset. An average accuracy of 89.45% for the new sensor is achieved, which is 13.05% higher than the state-of-the-art method, and only 2.3% lower than the upper bound.

In our method, we first utilize the Generative Adversarial Networks in a semi-supervised fashion to produce virtual images with an adversarial loss. Second, considering the neighborhood structure within negative samples, a random sampling algorithm is proposed to effectively mining the potentially hard samples. Third, we propose a multi-negative loss function with the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence. Finally, by optimizing the total loss the deep neural networks are trained. Then the learned networks are further used to obtain image representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on publicly available datasets.

There have been few researches focusing on hysteresis in an F/T sensor. We solved this problem by considering time series data. Time series data was put into machine learning such as linear regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR). We evaluated this method with an existing high dynamic range F/T sensor. We confirmed that the error decreased in both high and low force ranges. Since there is nonlinearity in hysteresis, we predicted that SVR will be more accurate than linear regression.

For data augmentation, the first approaches to use some image processing methods, i.e., manual-extracting subimages, adding noise, filtering, and flipping, on the original training images to generate some new training images; the second approach is to employ the existing SAR target recognition data set, MSTAR data set, to assist in accomplishing the target detection task. For transfer learning, we first apply subaperture decomposition technique on original SAR images to acquire three-channel subaperture SAR images, and then transfer the three-channel VGGNet model pretrained on the ImageNet data set to the three-channel subaperture SAR images, in order to initialize corresponding parameters of the convolutional layers in the base network in our SSD.

In order to get clean images, traditional machine vision methods usually use various constraints/prior conditions to obtain a reasonable haze removal solutions, the key to achieve haze removal is to estimate the medium transmission of the input hazy image in earlier studies.

By this a better data encapsulation with a linear hypersphere can be usually achieved. Moreover, the classifier does not try to capture the whole distribution of the input data which is often difficult to achieve. Instead, the characteristic data samples, called support vectors, are selected which allow construction of the tightest hypersphere that encloses majority of the input data.

However, they also suffer from optimum SVMs parameters assignment and optimum feature subset selection issues that can significantly affect on the obtained results. In optimization of SVMs parameters and feature space, traditional optimization algorithms usually trap in local optimum. Thus, it is inevitable to apply meta- heuristic optimization algorithms to obtain global optimum solution. As results, the superior performance of SVMs achieved by simultaneously optimization of SVMs parameters and input feature subset on Polarimetric imagery are demonstrated. This study, initially aims to optimize the accuracy of SVMs classifier by selecting the subset of best informative features and determining the best values for the SVMs parameters. Accordingly, we apply three proposed classification strategies by combining of SVMs classifier and Bees Algorithm.

This HybridFatigue system is based on integrating visual features through PERCLOS measure and non-visual features by heart-beat (ECG) sensors.

Those hybrid features have been extracted and classified as driver fatigue by advanced deep-learning-based architectures in real-time. A multi-layer based transfer learning approach by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep-belief network (DBN) was used to detect driver fatigue from hybrid features. To solve night-time driving and to get accurate results, the ECG sensors were utilized on steering by analyzing heartbeat signals in case if the camera is not enough to get facial features. Also to solve the accurate detection of center head-position of drivers, two-cameras were mounted instead of a single camera.

Finally, we propose a k self-adaptive neighbor weight (kSNW) algorithm, used for radio map construction in this paper, to realize online localization. The results of the experiments conducted in a real indoor environment show that the proposed method reduces the demand for large quantities of labeled samples and achieves good positioning accuracy.

We also address the related issue of ranking the importance of input features, which is itself a problem of great interest in modeling. Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless inputs leads to a simplification of the problem and possibly faster and more accurate detection, feature selection is very important in intrusion detection. Two methods for feature ranking are presented: the first one is independent of the modeling tool, while the second method is specific to SVMs. The two methods are applied to identify the important features in the 1999 DARPA intrusion data. It is shown that the two methods produce results that are largely consistent. We present various experimental results that indicate that SVM-based intrusion detection using a reduced number of features can deliver enhanced or comparable performance.

These atlases rely on the assumption that the same anatomical features are present on all subjects to be studied and that these features are stable enough to allow meaningful comparisons between different brain surfaces and structures These methods, however, often fail when applied to fetal MRI data, due to the lack of consistent anatomical features present across gestation. This paper presents a novel surface-based fetal cortical parcellation framework which attempts to circumvent the lack of consistent anatomical features by proposing a brain parcellation scheme that is based solely on learned geometrical features. A mesh signature incorporating both extrinsic and intrinsic geometrical features is proposed and used in a clustering scheme to define a parcellation of the fetal brain. This parcellation is then learned using a Random Forest (RF) based learning approach and then further refined in an alpha-expansion graph-cut scheme. Based on the votes obtained by the RF inference procedure, a probability map is computed and used as a data term in the graph-cut procedure. The smoothness term is defined by learning a transition matrix based on the dihedral angles of the faces. Qualitative and quantitative results on a cohort of both healthy and high-risk fetuses are presented. Both visual and quantitative assessments show good results demonstrating a reliable method for fetal brain data and the possibility of obtaining a parcellation of the fetal cortical surfaces using only geometrical features.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4939146", "pubmed_id": "27413248", "doi": "10.1117/12.2212805", "venue": "SPIE Medical Imaging", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2310866651,3005457969,3004529064", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Engineering", "Physics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14176653", "16210141", "10481196", "13193680", "969942", "31419024", "4504791", "837530", "29415946", "12701882", "17847588", "89141", "123691924", "1782131", "12235567", "22551040", "6220017", "2285497", "17628463"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5538594"}

However, the hallucinated details are often accompanied with unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the visual quality, we thoroughly study three key components of SRGAN - network architecture, adversarial loss and perceptual loss, and improve each of them to derive an Enhanced SRGAN (ESRGAN). In particular, we introduce the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without batch normalization as the basic network building unit. Moreover, we borrow the idea from relativistic GAN to let the discriminator predict relative realness instead of the absolute value. Finally, we improve the perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which could provide stronger supervision for brightness consistency and texture recovery. Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed ESRGAN achieves consistently better visual quality with more realistic and natural textures than SRGAN and won the first place in the PIRM2018-SR Challenge.

Next so-needed threshold value is directly sifted from these limited support vectors. Finally the entire connective WBC regions are segmented from the original cell image. The proposed method successfully works for WBC detection, and effectively reduces the influence brought by illumination and staining.

State-of-the-art approaches for contour mapping, however, are neither energy-optimized, nor capable of handling heterogeneous user requests. In this paper, we develop a novel energy-efficient On-demand Active Contour Service (OACS) for power-constrained WSNs. OACS regresses the field intensity function with kernel Support Vector Regression (SVR), a novel machine learning tool that flexibly handles both contour line and contour map requests.

Selvaraj et al demonstrated single individual SNV phasing is possible with proximity ligated (HiC) sequencing. Here, we demonstrate HiC can phase structural variants into phased scaffolds of SNVs. Since HiC data is noisy, and SV calling is challenging, we applied a range of supervised classification techniques, including Support Vector Machines and Random Forest, to phase deletions. Our approach was demonstrated on deletion calls and phasings on the NA12878 human genome. We used three NA12878 chromosomes and simulated chromosomes to train model parameters. The remaining NA12878 chromosomes withheld from training were used to evaluate phasing accuracy. Random Forest had the highest accuracy and correctly phased 86% of the deletions with allele-specific read evidence. Allele-specific read evidence was found for 76% of the deletions. HiC provides significant read evidence for accurately phasing 33% of the deletions.

However, their success relies on the presence of a large amount of labeled data. How can one use the same discriminative models for learning useful features in the absence of labels? We address this question in this paper, by jointly modeling the distribution of data and latent features in a manner that explicitly assigns zero probability to unobserved data. Rather than maximizing the marginal probability of observed data, we maximize the joint probability of the data and the latent features using a two step EM-like procedure. To prevent the model from overfitting to our initial selection of latent features, we use adversarial regularization. Depending on the task, we allow the latent features to be one-hot or real-valued vectors and define a suitable prior on the features. For instance, one-hot features correspond to class labels and are directly used for the unsupervised and semi-supervised classification task, whereas real-valued feature vectors are fed as input to simple classifiers for auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks. The proposed model, which we dub discriminative encoder (or DisCoder), is flexible in the type of latent features that it can capture.

To address the safety issues in autonomous driving systems, a recent set of testing techniques have been designed to automatically generate artificial driving scenes to enrich test suite, e.g., generating new input images transformed from the original ones. However, these techniques are insufficient due to two limitations: first, many such synthetic images often lack diversity of driving scenes, and hence compromise the resulting efficacy and reliability. Second, for machine-learning-based systems, a mismatch between training and application domain can dramatically degrade system accuracy, such that it is necessary to validate inputs for improving system robustness. In this paper, we propose DeepRoad, an unsupervised DNN-based framework for automatically testing the consistency of DNN-based autonomous driving systems and online validation. First, DeepRoad automatically synthesizes large amounts of diverse driving scenes without using image transformation rules (e.g. scale, shear and rotation). In particular, DeepRoad is able to produce driving scenes with various weather conditions (including those with rather extreme conditions) by applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) along with the corresponding real-world weather scenes. Second, DeepRoad utilizes metamorphic testing techniques to check the consistency of such systems using synthetic images. Third, DeepRoad validates input images for DNN-based systems by measuring the distance of the input and training images using their VGGNet features. We implement DeepRoad to test three well-recognized DNN-based autonomous driving systems in Udacity self-driving car challenge. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepRoad can detect thousands of inconsistent behaviors for these systems, and effectively validate input images to potentially enhance the system robustness as well.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3238147.3238187", "venue": "2018 33rd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)", "journal": "2018 33rd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2888307014", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["108258328", "38384342", "15780954", "15467386", "8643626", "206593710", "1033682", "37488141", "980236", "8239952", "195908774", "3074096", "16787593", "31112541", "3783306", "14018070", "10090762", "207757111", "64760951", "6263878", "1687220", "16426065", "16426065", "14124313", "4055261", "140109802", "8183801", "7711241", "195347176", "1082740", "589344", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["195064721", "210970052", "170079064", "210937727", "195064272", "208780991", "174800805", "201666387", "53742964", "208291083", "202540050", "195891060", "203838412", "197644583", "202539577", "211043979", "201813965", "208526910", "212628749", "204008510", "204512280", "203655231", "195657970", "211844487", "199452965", "174802478", "214691941", "202539157", "56172084", "210859322", "67856574", "209500628", "211140002", "201657609", "209500570", "211145347", "148565603", "208513473", "202548549", "211133332", "210931969", "211066398", "195063910", "208637345"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52071803"}

Expert systems are required to extract information from these venues about a real-world entity like a person, organisation, event, etc. However, this information may change over time, and there is a need to maintain the data. Therefore, it is desirable to have an intelligent model to extract relevant data items from different sources and merge them to build a complete profile of an entity (entity profiling). Further, this model should be able to handle incorrect or obsolete data items. In this paper, we propose a novel method for completing a profile. We have developed a two-phase method.

We have studied the performance of various classifiers for this purpose and observed that the use of the random forest is best suited for entity resolution. Also, we proposed and used \u201ctrustworthiness of a source\u201d as a feature to the random forest.

However, they view the distributions of features from different classes as a general distribution and try to match these distributions across domains, which lead to the mixture of features from different classes across domains and degrade the performance of classification. Additionally, existing works only force the shared features among domains to be orthogonal to the features in the domain-specific network. However, redundant features between the domain-specific networks still remain, which may shrink the discriminative ability of domain-specific features. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end network to obtain the more optimal features, which we call compact features. We propose to extract the domain-invariant features by matching the joint distributions of different domains, which have dis- tinct boundaries between different classes.

Despite significant progress in this field, there still remain numerous avenues to explore. Indeed, this research paper provides a study of exploiting online travel information for personalized travel package recommendation. A critical challenge along this line is to address the unique characteristics of travel data, which distinguish travel packages from traditional items for recommendation. To that end, in this research paper, we first analyze the characteristics of the existing travel packages and develop a tourist-area-season topic (TAST) model. This TAST model can represent travel packages and tourists by different topic distributions where the topic extraction is conditioned on both the tourists and the intrinsic features (i.e., locations, travel seasons) of the landscapes. Then, based on this topic model representation, we propose a cocktail approach to generate the lists for personalized travel package recommendation. Furthermore, we extend the TAST model to the tourist-relation-area-season topic (TRAST) model for capturing the latent relationships among the tourists in each travel group. Finally, we evaluate the TAST model, the TRAST model, and the cocktail recommendation approach on the real-world travel package data. Experimental results show that the TAST model can effectively capture the unique characteristics of the travel data and the cocktail approach is, thus, much more effective than traditional recommendation techniques for travel package recommendation. Also, by considering tourist relationships, the TRAST model can be used as an effective assessment for travel group formation. ::: Keywords: Tourist relation area season topic; Chi Square Automatic Interaction Detection; Classification and Regression Trees; Rule induction; Intrinsic Complex Spatio-temporal Relationships; Data visualization", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Research", "mag_id": "2286522898", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61242518"}

The cooperative optimization of this high dimensional space is a difficult problem which obviously has a highly correlated characterization where human network operators cannot possibly capture these correlations. Model-free Reinforcement Learning techniques represent a potential solution to our problem. Specifically, we use Deep Q-Learning Networks (DQN) to improve networking performance. We have developed a high-fidelity network simulation tool we call Tactical Airborne Network Simulator (TANS) which we use to train our neural network before deploying to the field where the asset is deployed to some mission which is hopefully somewhat similar to the scenarios used for training. By utilizing the model developed under the TANS training scenarios for the target mission scenario our learning technique gets a head start, rather than using a truly model-free approach. Our technique is codified in the ML community as \u201cDeep Transfer Learning\u201d [4] where terms and metrics have been examined. This paper represents an initial investigation into both the decision support agent architecture and the ML technique.

Our motivation is to create an automated method of building new feature extraction algorithms for images that are competitive with commonly used human-engineered features, such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). The evolved feature extraction algorithms are functions defined over the image space, and each produces a real-valued feature vector of variable length. Each evolved feature extractor breaks up the given image into a set of cells centered on every pixel, performs evolved operations on each cell, and then combines the results of those operations for every cell using an evolved operator. Using this method, the algorithm is flexible enough to reproduce both LBP and HOG features. The dataset we use to train and test our approach consists of a large number of pre-segmented image \u201cchips\u201d taken from a Forward Looking Infrared Imagery (FLIR) camera mounted on the hood of a moving vehicle.

Moreover, known practical applications of BG are confined to Horn clause logic. Recently, a hybrid ALP-ILP proof procedure, called HAIL, was shown to generalise existing BG techniques by deriving multiple clauses in response to a single example, and constructing hypotheses outside the semantics of BG. The HAIL proof procedure is based on a new semantics, called Kernel Set Subsumption (KSS), which was shown to be a sound generalisation of BG. But so far KSS is defined only for Horn clauses. This paper extends the semantics of KSS from Horn clause logic to general clausal logic, where it is shown to remain a sound extension of BG. A generalisation of the C-derivation, called a K*-derivation, is introduced and shown to provide a sound and complete characterisation of KSS.

In this paper, we describe the novel methodology for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data, obtained from neocortical cells and neural progenitor cells, using machine learning algorithms (Support Vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Thirty-eight key transcripts were identified, using the SVM-based recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) method of feature selection, to best differentiate developing neocortical cells from neural progenitor cells in the SVM and RF classifiers built. Also, these genes possessed a higher discriminative power (enhanced prediction accuracy) as compared commonly used statistical techniques or geneset-based approaches. Further downstream network reconstruction analysis was carried out to unravel hidden general regulatory networks where novel interactions could be further validated in web-lab experimentation and be useful candidates to be targeted for the treatment of neuronal developmental diseases. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: This novel approach reported for is able to identify transcripts, with reported neuronal involvement, which optimally differentiate neocortical cells and neural progenitor cells. It is believed to be extensible and applicable to other single-cell RNA-seq expression profiles like that of the study of the cancer progression and treatment within a highly heterogeneous tumour.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5260093", "pubmed_id": "28155657", "doi": "10.1186/s12864-016-3317-7", "venue": "BMC Genomics", "journal": "BMC Genomics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2567437666", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["215567451", "14650064", "14400138", "6413584", "8004171", "12201", "15657266", "12387612", "3928352", "2374637", "35542856", "29269318", "6507039", "19790151", "206513052", "205418589", "13014343", "76582452", "215519471", "1663277", "27061085", "961425", "194951", "20297158", "52874011", "89141", "7621983", "10196486", "15170525", "10442936", "15499199", "207720429", "14380663", "301840", "5964780", "16850836", "7060566", "2265628", "18608244", "2863381", "1794353", "5861258", "29963534", "10420934", "10228943", "12289160", "9316040", "207738357", "10862392"], "inbound_citations": ["215498366", "199488701", "201198303", "211050445", "209462209", "14985599", "201125405", "201196460", "214900628", "215472394", "20671392"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16419888"}

This issue magnifies when facing continuous domains where the curse of dimensionality is inevitable, and generalization is mostly desired. Transfer learning is a successful technique to remedy such a problem which results in significant improvements in learning performance by providing generalization not only within a task but also across different but related or similar tasks. The critical issue in transfer learning is how to incorporate the knowledge acquired from learning in a different but related task in the past. Domain adaptation is an exciting paradigm that seeks to address this challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel skill based Transfer Learning with Domain Adaptation (TLDA) approach suitable for continuous RL problems. TLDA discovers and learns skills as high-level knowledge from source task and then uses domain adaptation technique to help agent discover state-action mapping as a relation between the source and target tasks. With such mapping, TLDA can adapt source skills and speed up learning on a new target task.

This condition can be detected automatically by automated image processing techniques applied in spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volumes. The most common approach is the individualized analysis of each slice (B-Scan) of the SD-OCT volumes. However, it ends up losing the correlation between pixels of neighboring slices. The retina representation by topographic maps reveals the similarity of these structures with geographic relief maps, which can be represented by geostatistical descriptors. In this paper, we present a methodology based on geostatistical functions for the automatic diagnosis of AMD in SD-OCT.MethodsThe proposed methodology is based on the construction of a topographic map of the macular region. Over the topographic map, we compute geostatistical features using semivariogram and semimadogram functions as texture descriptors. The extracted descriptors are then used as input for a Support Vector Machine classifier.ResultsFor training of the classifier and tests, a database composed of 384 OCT exams (269 volumes of eyes exhibiting AMD and 115 control volumes) with layers segmented and validated by specialists were used. The best classification model, validated with cross-validation k-fold, achieved an accuracy of 95.2% and an AUROC of 0.989.ConclusionThe presented methodology exclusively uses geostatistical descriptors for the diagnosis of AMD in SD-OCT images of the macular region.

All nitrogen fixing microbes rely on the same nitrogenase enzyme for nitrogen reduction, which is in fact an enzyme complex consists of as many as 20 genes. However, the occurrence of six genes viz., nifB, nifD, nifE, nifH, nifK, and nifN has been proposed to be essential for a functional nitrogenase enzyme. Therefore, identification of these genes is important to understand the mechanism of BNF as well as to explore the possibilities for improving BNF from agricultural sustainability point of view. Further, though the computational tools are available for the annotation and phylogenetic analysis of nifH gene sequences alone, to the best of our knowledge no tool is available for the computational prediction of the above mentioned six categories of nitrogen-fixation (nif) genes or proteins. Thus, we proposed an approach, which is first of its kind for the computational identification of nif proteins encoded by the six categories of nif genes. Sequence-derived features were employed to map the input sequences into vectors of numeric observations that were subsequently fed to the support vector machine as input. Two types of classifier were constructed: (i) a binary classifier for classification of nif and non-nitrogen-fixation (non-nif) proteins, and (ii) a multi-class classifier for classification of six categories of nif proteins. Higher accuracies were observed for the combination of composition-transition-distribution (CTD) feature set and radial kernel, as compared to the other feature-kernel combinations. The overall accuracies were observed >90% in both binary and multi-class classifications. The developed approach further achieved >92% accuracy, while evaluated with blind (independent) test datasets. The developed approach also produced higher accuracy in identifying nif proteins, while evaluated using proteome-wide datasets of several species. Furthermore, we established a prediction server nifPred (http://webapp.cabgrid.res.in/nifPred) to assist the scientific community for proteome-wide identification of six categories of nif proteins. Besides, the source code of nifPred is also available at https://github.com/PrabinaMeher/nifPred.

By virtue of the great success in numerous computer vision tasks achieved by the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it is a nice direction to tackle the SR problem using CNNs. Despite progress in accuracy of SR using deeper CNNs, those models are almost trained base upon supervised way. In this paper, we propose a deep unsupervised learning approach for SR with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which is composed of a deep convolutional generator network with dense connections and a discriminator. A sub-pixel convolutional layer is operated on the top of the generator to upscale the inputs, and the standard convolutions are all implemented in the LR space, which leads to a fast restoration. The generator is trained to directly recover the high-resolution image from the low-resolution image. Strided convolution and ReLU activations are employed in the discriminator to distinguish the HR images from the produced HR images. The generator model is optimized with a combination of a data error, a regular term and an adversarial loss, which ensures local\u2013global contents consistency and pixel faithfulness. Note that no labeled training data is employed during the training.

The SVM correctly identifies six types of roof shapes in 66% of cases, that is, flat & shed, gable, hip, gambrel & mansard, cross/corner gable & hip, and complex roofs. We classify the roofs based on their useful area for PV installations and potential for receiving solar energy.

The main exception is the gable where this ratio is 1.18. The flat and shed roofs have the second highest useful roof area for PV (complex roof being the highest) and the highest PV potential (in GWh). By contrast, hip roof has the lowest PV potential.

Local approaches divide the problem into local subproblems, but usually do not exploit the information of the hierarchy. This paper addresses the problem of HMC for both tree and Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) structures whose labels do not necessarily reach a leaf node. A local classifier per parent node is trained incorporating the prediction of the parent(s) node(s) as an additional attribute to include the relations between classes. In the classification phase, the branches with low probability to occur are pruned, performing non-mandatory leaf node prediction. Our method evaluates each possible path from the root of the hierarchy, taking into account the prediction value and the level of the nodes; selecting the path (or paths in the case of DAGs) with the highest score. We tested our method with 20 datasets with tree and DAG structured hierarchies against a number of state-of-the-art methods.

Such analysis is often challenged by censored, small-sample-size, but high-dimensional genomic profiles or clinical data. Therefore, sophisticated models and algorithms are in pressing need.In this study, we propose a novel Area Under Curve (AUC) optimization method for multi-biomarker panel identification named Nearest Centroid Classifier for AUC optimization (NCC-AUC). Our method is motived by the connection between AUC score for classification accuracy evaluation and Harrell's concordance index in survival analysis. This connection allows us to convert the survival time regression problem to a binary classification problem. Then an optimization model is formulated to directly maximize AUC and meanwhile minimize the number of selected features to construct a predictor in the nearest centroid classifier framework. NCC-AUC shows its great performance by validating both in genomic data of breast cancer and clinical data of stage IB Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). For the genomic data, NCC-AUC outperforms Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Support Vector Machine-based Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) in classification accuracy. It tends to select a multi-biomarker panel with low average redundancy and enriched biological meanings. Also NCC-AUC is more significant in separation of low and high risk cohorts than widely used Cox model (Cox proportional-hazards regression model) and L1-Cox model (L1 penalized in Cox model). These performance gains of NCC-AUC are quite robust across 5 subtypes of breast cancer. Further in an independent clinical data, NCC-AUC outperforms SVM and SVM-RFE in predictive accuracy and is consistently better than Cox model and L1-Cox model in grouping patients into high and low risk categories.In summary, NCC-AUC provides a rigorous optimization framework to systematically reveal multi-biomarker panel from genomic and clinical data. It can serve as a useful tool to identify prognostic biomarkers for survival analysis.NCC-AUC is available at http://doc.aporc.org/wiki/NCC-AUC.ywang@amss.ac.cnSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26092859", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btv374", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2096781310", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["425588", "124933239", "12605120", "23687368", "206787478", "116197768", "206737254", "122276229", "52805719", "13164590", "6535963", "61649919", "23344910", "123152928", "8822160", "8571129", "5483830", "20381373", "16063526", "24040451", "8742910", "30982552", "2271776", "149499807", "11817889", "14239330", "8594304", "2374637", "14306575", "123618664", "17129037", "17556603", "27717938"], "inbound_citations": ["6332375", "788301", "3690613", "85445201", "46130467", "215311754", "58586159", "51614493", "214585141", "211061138"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23806739"}

The use of DTI as a biomarker, however, depends on its applicability in a multicenter setting accounting for effects of different MRI scanners. We applied multivariate machine learning (ML) to a large multicenter sample from the recently created framework of the European DTI study on Dementia (EDSD). We hypothesized that ML approaches may amend effects of multicenter acquisition. We included a sample of 137 patients with clinically probable AD (MMSE 20.6\u00b15.3) and 143 healthy elderly controls, scanned in nine different scanners. For diagnostic classification we used the DTI indices fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) and, for comparison, gray matter and white matter density maps from anatomical MRI. Data were classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier. We used two cross-validation approaches, (i) test and training samples randomly drawn from the entire data set (pooled cross-validation) and (ii) data from each scanner as test set, and the data from the remaining scanners as training set (scanner-specific cross-validation). In the pooled cross-validation, SVM achieved an accuracy of 80% for FA and 83% for MD. Accuracies for NB were significantly lower, ranging between 68% and 75%. Removing variance components arising from scanners using principal component analysis did not significantly change the classification results for both classifiers. For the scanner-specific cross-validation, the classification accuracy was reduced for both SVM and NB. After mean correction, classification accuracy reached a level comparable to the results obtained from the pooled cross-validation.

Many of the existing convex/non-convex soft-margin losses can be viewed as a surrogate of the $L_{0/1}$ soft-margin loss. Despite the discrete nature of $L_{0/1}$, we manage to establish the existence of global minimizer of the new model as well as revealing the relationship among its minimizers and KKT/P-stationary points. These theoretical properties allow us to take advantage of the alternating direction method of multipliers. In addition, the $L_{0/1}$-support vector operator is introduced as a filter to prevent outliers from being support vectors during the training process. Hence, the method is expected to be relatively robust. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method generates better performance in terms of much shorter computational time with much fewer number of support vectors when against with some other leading methods in areas of SVM.

This task is normally carried out by human coaches, and it needs to be solved automatically in technical applications that are to provide automatic coaching (e.g. training environments in VR). However, most coaching systems only provide coarse information on movement quality, such as a scalar value per body part that describes the overall deviation from the correct movement. Further, they are often limited to static body postures or rather simple movements of single body parts. While there are many approaches to distinguish between different types of movements (e.g., between walking and jumping), the detection of more subtle errors in a motor performance is less investigated. We propose a novel approach to classify errors in sports or rehabilitation exercises such that feedback can be delivered in a rapid and detailed manner: Homogeneous sub-sequences of exercises are first temporally aligned via Dynamic Time Warping. Next, we extract a feature vector from the aligned sequences, which serves as a basis for feature selection using Random Forests. The selected features are used as input for Support Vector Machines, which finally classify the movement errors.

When dealing with sparse or no labeled data in the target domain, transfer learning shows its appealing performance by borrowing the supervised knowledge from external domains. Recently deep structure learning has been exploited in transfer learning due to its attractive power in extracting effective knowledge through multi-layer strategy, so that deep transfer learning is promising to address the cross-domain mismatch. In general, cross-domain disparity can be resulted from the difference between source and target distributions or different modalities, e.g., Midwave IR (MWIR) and Longwave IR (LWIR). In this paper, we propose a Weighted Deep Transfer Learning framework for automatic target classification through a task-driven fashion. Specifically, deep features and classifier parameters are obtained simultaneously for optimal classification performance. In this way, the proposed deep structures can extract more effective features with the guidance of the classifier performance; on the other hand, the classifier performance is further improved since it is optimized on more discriminative features. Furthermore, we build a weighted scheme to couple source and target output by assigning pseudo labels to target data, therefore we can transfer knowledge from source (i.e., MWIR) to target (i.e., LWIR).

The submerge part of the iceberg is represented by subclinical mastitis, which in some cases can reach 65% of the flock (Fthenakis and Jones, 1990). ::: The economic loss due to mastitis is estimated around 69 NZ$ (\u2248 42 \u20ac) per infected half-udder per entire period of lactation (Cuccuru et al., 2011). ::: The current investigation presents an alternative approach to predict the presence of udder inflammation in Sarda dairy ewes through the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a sub-discipline in the field of artificial intelligence. The milk lactose content (MLC) and milk electrical conductivity (MEC) are used as predictive variable and the milk somatic cell count (MSCC) as classifier.

Support Vector Machine has been successfully used in pattern recognition and function estimation. In order to tackle with incremental learning problems with new features, an incremental feature learning algorithm based on Least Square Support Vector Machine is proposed in this paper. In this algorithm, features of newly joined samples contain two parts: already existing features and new features. Using historic structural parameters which are trained from the already existing features, the algorithm only trains the new features with Least Square Support Vector Machine. Experiments show that this algorithm has two outstanding properties. First, different kernel functions can be used for the already existing features and the new features according to the distribution of samples. Consequently, this algorithm is more suitable to deal with classification tasks which can not be well solved by using a single kernel function. Second, the training time and the memory space can be reduced because the algorithm fully uses the structural parameters of classifiers trained formerly and only trains the new features with Least Square Support Vector Machine. Some UCI datasets are used to demonstrate the less training time and comparable or better performance of this algorithm than the Least Square Support Vector Machine.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-69311-6_34", "venue": "FAW", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1603997747", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202120284", "11056133", "451026", "58587", "5695166", "14712816", "54012301", "4967738", "16207002", "36727395", "207148853", "3749904", "17822803", "15975593", "46348496"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8617099"}

However, the labeled data available in many applications is scarce, and hence the metrics learned are often unsatisfactory. In this article, we consider a transfer-learning setting in which some related source tasks with labeled data are available to help the learning of the target task. We first propose a convex formulation for multitask metric learning by modeling the task relationships in the form of a task covariance matrix. Then we regard transfer learning as a special case of multitask learning and adapt the formulation of multitask metric learning to the transfer-learning setting for our method, called transfer metric learning (TML). In TML, we learn the metric and the task covariances between the source tasks and the target task under a unified convex formulation. To solve the convex optimization problem, we use an alternating method in which each subproblem has an efficient solution. Moreover, in many applications, some unlabeled data is also available in the target task, and so we propose a semi-supervised extension of TML called STML to further improve the generalization performance by exploiting the unlabeled data based on the manifold assumption.

Big data applications often have high demands on multiple computing components in concert, such as storage, memory, network and processors and have evolving performance characteristics along with the scale of the workload. To further complicate the problem, the increasing diversity of hardware technologies available makes side-by-side comparisons hard. Choosing right resources among a wide array of available systems is a decision that is likely to plague both end users and resources providers. In this paper, we propose a workload aware model for the computational infrastructure selection problem for a given application. Our model considers both features of the workload and features of the computational infrastructure and predicts expected performance for a given workload, based on historical performance results using Support Vector Machines (SVM). We tested our model with a practical application from the domain of Transportation research on two distinct computing resources. The application has significant requirements on both memory availability and processing power. Therefore the optimal performance of the application is a dedicated trade-off between different types of resources and it is workload specific. The two testing systems represent two main trends in high performance computing resources. One infrastructure is a traditional high end computing cluster consisting of moderate number of CPUs and memories running at high frequency and high bandwidth. The other system, based on the latest Intel Knights Landing processor, is a good representation of the trending Many-Core technology in which high number of processing cores running at lower frequencies are available. The memory allocation models are also often different between the two systems. Our results show that our proposed model can achieve over 90% accuracy in performance prediction with small training data sets for our test application. The results also indicate that our model is a viable approach to be extended to other classes of applications and to be potentially adopted by high performance computing resource providers.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BigData.2016.7840855", "venue": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "journal": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2583750011", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["195713842", "207165665", "15677103", "23016717", "17056017", "17072620", "1234927", "1540000", "15364523", "37525002", "29260724", "15969494", "28329497", "13470689", "9524600", "2910521", "1508503", "1994197", "53446731", "6486889", "9148505", "15311054", "11818928"], "inbound_citations": ["3728126"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16455615"}

Therefore, it is very necessary to develop reliable, active and contemporary methods of phishing detection to combat the adaptive techniques used by phishers. In this paper, different phishing detection approaches are reviewed by classifying them into three main groups. Then, the proposed model is presented in two stages. In the first stage, different machine learning algorithms are applied to validate the chosen dataset and applying features selection methods on it. Thus, the best accuracy was achieved by utilizing only 20 features out of 48 features combined with Random Forest is 98.11%. While in the second stage, the same dataset is applied to various fuzzy logic algorithms. As well the experimental results from the application of Fuzzy logic algorithms were incredible. Where in applying the FURIA algorithm with only five features the accuracy rate was 99.98%. Finally, comparison and discussion of the results between applying machine learning algorithms and fuzzy logic algorithms is done.

In general, the stabilization of the resulting piece-wise affine system requires, in the worst case, solving an exponential number of linear matrix inequalities (with respect to the state dimension). To overcome this computational limitation, we propose a stabilization procedure having a complexity that grows linearly with the number of partitions. This stabilization procedure explicitly exploits the fact that our model is described via an ensemble of regression trees.

If an early prognostication of DR is not done, then it may lead to loss of vision. Some of the diagnosing tools for detection of DR are Indirect Ophthalmoscope, Slit Lamp Examination, Color Photograph, and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The DR dataset contains 5 types of lesions ranging from mild to severe. These lesions are hard to distinguish from each other. The manual diagnosis of DR involves the proper classification of these lesions into their appropriate classes that is quite tedious and error-prone process marred with low level of accuracies. Researchers therefore rely on automatic detection and prognosis of DR based on Machine Learning (ML) methods. In this work, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) framework to classify these lesions with high level of accuracy. To accomplish the task, we train a DL model Visual Geometry Group (VGG19) on Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRID) dataset to extract the features from the color fundus eye photography provided in the dataset. The extracted features are then fed into different classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) etc. to classify the lesions properly.

A generator convolutional neural network (CNN) with several dense connections, is trained to transform noisy OCT image into clean OCT image.

Due to the inherent complexity of many real world systems the application of traditional techniques is limited. In such instances more sophisticated (so called intelligent) modelling approaches are required. Neurofuzzy modelling is one such technique, which by integrating the attributes of fuzzy systems and neural networks is ideally suited to system identification. This attractive paradigm combines the well established learning techniques of a particular form of neural network i.e. generalised linear models with the transparent knowledge representation of fuzzy systems, thus producing models which possess the ability to learn from real world observations and whose behaviour can be described naturally as a series of linguistic humanly understandable rules. Unfortunately, the application of these systems is limited to low dimensional problems for which good quality expert knowledge and data are available. The work described in this thesis addresses this fundamental problem with neurofuzzy modelling, as a result algorithms which are less sensitive to the quality of the a priori knowledge and empirical data are developed. The true modelling capabilities of any strategy is heavily reliant on the model's structure, and hence an important (arguably the most important) task is structure identification. Also, due to the curse of dimensionality, in high dimensional problems the size of conventional neurofuzzy models gets prohibitively large. These issues are tackled by the development of automatic neurofuzzy model identification algorithms, which exploit the available expert knowledge and empirical data. To alleviate problems associated with the curse of dimensionality, aid model generalisation and enhance model transparency, parsimonious models are identified. This is achieved by the application of additive and multiplicative neurofuzzy models which exploit structural redundancies found in conventional systems. The developed construction algorithms successfully identify parsimonious models, but as a result of noisy and poorly distributed empirical data, these models can still generalise inadequately. This problem is addressed by the application of Bayesian inferencing techniques; a form of regularisation. Smooth model outputs are assumed and superfluous model parameters are controlled, sufficiently aiding model generalisation and transparency, and data interpolation and extrapolation. By exploiting the structural decomposition of the identified neurofuzzy models, an efficient local method of regularisation is developed. All the methods introduced in this thesis are illustrated on many different examples, including simulated time series, complex functional equations, and multi-dimensional dynamical systems. For many of these problems conventional neurofuzzy modelling is unsuitable, and the developed techniques have extended the range of problems to which neurofuzzy modelling can successfully be applied.", "year": 1997, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1540378271", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["14759812", "54589409"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56560452"}

Considering that the experimental identification of plant-pathogen PPIs is time-consuming and labor-intensive, computational methods are emerging as an important strategy to complement the experimental methods. In this work, we first evaluated the performance of traditional computational methods such as interolog, domain-domain interaction and domain-motif interaction in predicting known plant-pathogen PPIs. Owing to the low sensitivity of the traditional methods, we utilized Random Forest to build an inter-species PPI prediction model based on multiple sequence encodings and novel network attributes in the established plant PPI network. Critical assessment of the features demonstrated that the integration of sequence information and network attributes resulted in significant and robust performance improvement. Additionally, we also discussed the influence of Gene Ontology and gene expression information on the prediction performance. The Web server implementing the integrated prediction method, named InterSPPI, has been made freely available at http://systbio.cau.edu.cn/intersppi/index.php. InterSPPI could achieve a reasonably high accuracy with a precision of 73.8% and a recall of 76.6% in the independent test. To examine the applicability of InterSPPI, we also conducted cross-species and proteome-wide plant-pathogen PPI prediction tests. Taken together, we hope this work can provide a comprehensive understanding of the current status of plant-pathogen PPI predictions, and the proposed InterSPPI can become a useful tool to accelerate the exploration of plant-pathogen interactions.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29028906", "doi": "10.1093/bib/bbx123", "venue": null, "journal": "Briefings in Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2758437023", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3335739", "215641634", "22986324", "14671229", "4431696", "8989912", "2062857", "11625730", "18761421", "87860583", "14830574", "12078246", "215222508", "18692932", "2107053", "8457035", "3763358", "4577542", "16991584", "9944489", "18647696", "45797716", "52802682", "46425086", "2751069", "3147406", "85648970", "9611541", "7220375", "13738438", "205914561", "9388262", "18231194", "3792181", "15725994", "11114746", "2832168", "11423858", "28589452", "17762174", "3321295", "215121903", "10549314", "2838900", "215530210", "2841681", "2573192", "1246355", "3144723", "10659969", "207159665", "19011676", "27077363", "22179720", "84520522", "17548535", "1682811", "5635604", "3000961", "16923281", "22565487", "24989333", "36206552", "332435", "9470269", "2958085", "3757161", "11445338", "5692598", "205533", "1177203"], "inbound_citations": ["215472129", "210860181"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6066644"}

The geochemical data in general were more predictive of the known Au occurrences than the geophysical data. A data-driven approach such as RF for the production of regional Au prospectivity maps is recommended provided that a sufficient number of training areas (known Au occurrences) exist.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.oregeorev.2015.01.004", "venue": null, "journal": "Ore Geology Reviews", "mag_id": "1988613889", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["73721731", "134963644", "164679936", "131501604", "201076311", "134382354"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:140160076"}

This paper investigates the cogeneration systems of industrial users and collects fuel consumption data and data concerning the steam output of boilers. On the basis of the relation between the fuel enthalpy and steam output, the Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to derive boiler and turbine Input/Output (I/O) operation models to provide fuel cost functions. The CO2 emission of pollutants generated by various types of units is also calculated. The objective function is formulated as a maximal profit model that includes profit from steam sold, profit from electricity sold, fuel costs, costs of exhausting carbon, wheeling costs, and water costs. By considering Time-of-Use (TOU) and carbon trading prices, the profits of a cogeneration system in different scenarios are evaluated. By integrating the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), an Enhanced ACO (EACO) is proposed to come up with the most efficient model. The EACO uses a crossover and mutation mechanism to alleviate the local optimal solution problem, and to seek a system that offers an overall global solution using competition and selection procedures. Results show that these mechanisms provide a good direction for the energy trading operations of a cogeneration system. This approach also provides a better guide for operation dispatch to use in determining the benefits accounting for both cost and the environment in a liberty market.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/en12152868", "venue": null, "journal": "Energies", "mag_id": "2963031414", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199654727"}

To address the need for self-adaptation in such environments, techniques for detecting environment changes and re-learning behaviours appropriate to those changes have been proposed. However, with the heterogeneity of sensor inputs, the problem of self-adaptation permeates one level deeper; in order for the learnt behaviour to adapt, the underlying environment representation needs to adapt first. The granularity of the RL state space might need to be adapted to learn more efficiently, or to match the new granularity of input data. This paper proposes an implementation of Constructivist RL (Con-RL), enabling RL to learn and continuously adapt its state space representations. We propose a Multi-Layer Growing Neural Gas (ML-GNG) technique, as an extension of the GNG clustering algorithm, to autonomously learn suitable state spaces based on sensor data and learnt actions at runtime. We also create and continuously update a repository of state spaces, selecting the most appropriate one to use at each time step. We evaluate Con-RL in two scenarios: the canonical RL mountain car single-agent scenario, and a large-scale multi-agent car and ride-sharing scenario.

As the UAV capabilities and technology complexity rapidly increase, UAV reliability and security are particularly essential. In order to improve the operational security, fault diagnosis, flight quality assessment and fuel consumption assessment are implemented. However, under different flight states, such as takeoff, climbing, level flight, etc. the possible failures, the meaning of flight quality and fuel consumption levels are different, so flight state recognition is the basis of the above work. Aiming at the problem that the flight time of various flight states is different, which leads to the imbalance of recognition samples, this paper proposes an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) based method. The method supplements samples by generating samples that enjoy the same distribution with the real data, thereby improving the accuracy of the recognition.

Local optimization methods give unpredictable results if no prior information is available. Traditionally this has generated mistrust for the use of inverse methods. Stochastic approaches to inverse problems consists in shift attention to the probability of existence of certain kinds of models (called equivalent) instead of \"looking for the true model\". Also, inverse problems are ill-conditioned and often the observed data are noisy. Global optimization methods have become a good alternative to sample the model space efficiently. These methods are very robust since they solve the inverse problem as a sampling problem, but they are hampered by dimensionality issues and high computational costs needed to solve the forward problem (predictions). In this paper we show how our research over the last three years on particle swarm optimizers can be used to solve and evaluate inverse problems efficiently. Although PSO is a stochastic algorithm, it can be physically interpreted as a stochastic damped mass-spring system. This analogy allowed us to introduce the PSO continuous model, to deduce a whole family of PSO algorithms, and to provide some results of its convergence based on the stochastic stability of the particle trajectories. This makes PSO a particularly interesting algorithm, different from other global algorithms which are purely heuristic. ::: ::: We include the results of an application of our PSO algorithm to the prediction of phosphorylation sites in proteins, an important mechanism for regulation of biological function.

However, the experimental methods for detecting PPIs are both time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, computational prediction of protein interactions are becoming increasingly popular, which can provide an inexpensive way of predicting the most likely set of interactions at the entire proteome scale, and can be used to complement experimental approaches. Although much progress has already been achieved in this direction, the problem is still far from being solved and new approaches are still required to overcome the limitations of the current prediction models. In this work, a sequence-based approach is developed by combining a novel Multi-scale Continuous and Discontinuous (MCD) feature representation and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The MCD representation gives adequate consideration to the interactions between sequentially distant but spatially close amino acid residues, thus it can sufficiently capture multiple overlapping continuous and discontinuous binding patterns within a protein sequence. An effective feature selection method mRMR was employed to construct an optimized and more discriminative feature set by excluding redundant features. Finally, a prediction model is trained and tested based on SVM algorithm to predict the interaction probability of protein pairs. When performed on the yeast PPIs data set, the proposed approach achieved 91.36% prediction accuracy with 91.94% precision at the sensitivity of 90.67%.

Several approaches and systems based on different mathematical tools have been studied and developed, among them, the Anomaly-Network Intrusion Detection System (A-NIDS), which monitors network traffic and compares it against an established baseline of a \u201cnormal\u201d traffic profile. Then, it is necessary to characterize the \u201cnormal\u201d Internet traffic. This paper presents an approach for anomaly detection and classification based on Shannon, Renyi and Tsallis entropies of selected features, and the construction of regions from entropy data employing the Mahalanobis distance (MD), and One Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) with different kernels (Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Mahalanobis Kernel (MK)) for \u201cnormal\u201d and abnormal traffic. Regular and non-regular regions built from \u201cnormal\u201d traffic profiles allow anomaly detection, while the classification is performed under the assumption that regions corresponding to the attack classes have been previously characterized. Although this approach allows the use of as many features as required, only four well-known significant features were selected in our case. In order to evaluate our approach, two different data sets were used: one set of real traffic obtained from an Academic Local Area Network (LAN), and the other a subset of the 1998 MIT-DARPA set. For these data sets, a True positive rate up to 99.35%, a True negative rate up to 99.83% and a False negative rate at about 0.16% were yielded. Experimental results show that certain q-values of the generalized entropies and the use of OC-SVM with RBF kernel improve the detection rate in the detection stage, while the novel inclusion of MK kernel in OC-SVM and k-temporal nearest neighbors improve accuracy in classification.

Closely associated with cellular signaling activities, this type of PTM is also involved in some major diseases, such as stomach cancer and lung cancer. Therefore, from the angles of both basic research and drug development, we are facing a challenging problem: for an uncharacterized protein sequence containing many residues of P or K, which ones can be hydroxylated, and which ones cannot? With the explosive growth of protein sequences in the post-genomic age, the problem has become even more urgent. To address such a problem, we have developed a predictor called iHyd-PseCp by incorporating the sequence-coupled information into the general pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) and introducing the \u201cRandom Forest\u201d algorithm to operate the calculation. Rigorous jackknife tests indicated that the new predictor remarkably outperformed the existing state-of-the-art prediction method for the same purpose. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for iHyd-PseCp has been established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iHyd-PseCp , by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations involved.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5190098", "pubmed_id": "27322424", "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.10027", "venue": "Oncotarget", "journal": "Oncotarget", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2439245561", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3195167", "21900693", "23797034", "10342584", "20555640", "43324910", "2870499", "215048416", "5545764", "8706532", "10399824", "30006069", "38923150", "19937519", "1317385", "20288559", "82054375", "42940829", "19520368", "28193825", "18871098", "44753582", "25060452", "22092321", "16878920", "96335938", "34333853", "36877885", "46577708", "18521634", "41310948", "25154533", "207159665", "21531920", "4939461", "24399041", "4469531", "36224301", "25150743", "21650959", "5754323", "16576124", "36989584", "26660271", "14267850", "19538556", "24852628", "62173998", "40078191", "15633588", "20728203", "13854503", "16680577", "16701668", "1995166", "36792025", "36251563", "37679397", "88226343", "26168360", "24199602", "12479837", "884483", "21863916", "18751574", "11577977", "26599497", "7884361", "5080059", "13261431", "5042980", "15221160", "21636463", "24357081", "41860335", "205789503", "36284193", "5262761", "24027251", "24449357", "35278975", "20431911", "18574232", "14895868", "27840446", "42777427"], "inbound_citations": ["23030887", "3791102", "202009727", "67736071", "11616380", "202016082", "52303284", "211138374", "215436553", "59307514", "148564181", "10833936", "3763257", "52418932", "435300", "24844305", "51627562", "7264216", "212841012", "5791129", "54482585", "206345053", "208643129", "215055142", "199550999", "13773609", "215488845", "214721997", "3513496", "215113225", "49421239", "1636536", "215424492", "17445880", "202615486", "49290977", "12023798", "108848883", "215140561", "20389981", "15577676", "89680221", "202641460", "199134690", "6377612", "215293445", "21227318", "167215351", "4722977", "46794630", "7419665", "12848625", "215022318"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3561690"}

The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a major role in overall protein turnover, in eukaryotic cells including plasmodia. 20S \u03b2 subunit is the catalytic core of this proteolytic machinery, and hence most of the inhibitors developed are being targeted towards this component. Inhibition of the proteasome is established as a promising strategy to develop novel antimalarial drugs. The present study reports identification of novel drug-like 20S proteasome inhibitors with potential activity against the 20S \u03b2 subunit of P. falciparum using a combination of ligand based (Support Vector Machines) and receptor based (molecular docking) techniques. The robust learning and generalizing capability of Support Vector Machines (SVM) has been exploited to classify proteasome inhibitors and non-inhibitors, targeted towards P. falciparum 20S proteasome. SVM model has been trained using 170 molecular descriptors of 64 inhibitors and 208 putative non-inhibitors of 20S proteasome. The non-linear classifier based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel yielded highest classification accuracy in comparison to the linear classifier. The best classifier had 5-fold Cross-Validation (CV) accuracy of 97% and Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.99 reflecting good accuracy of the model. The SVM model rapidly classified compounds with potential proteasomal activity. Subsequently, molecular docking studies aided the generation of focused collection of compounds with good binding affinity towards the substrate-binding site of 20S \u03b2 subunit. The novel drug-like 20S proteasome inhibitors identified in this study can be a good starting point to develop novel antimalarial drugs.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21843142", "doi": "10.2174/138620711797537058", "venue": "Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening", "journal": "Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening", "mag_id": "2076330052", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["19674514", "14529813"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32951082"}

Numerous experiments aim at recognition of motion intent of left or right hand being useful for locked-in-state or paralyzed subjects in controlling computer applications. The chapter presents an experimental study of several methods for real motion and motion intent classification (rest/upper/lower limbs motion, and rest/left/right hand motion). First, our approach to EEG recordings segmentation and feature extraction is presented. Then, 5 classifiers (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Nearest-Neighbors NNge, Rough Set classifier) are trained and tested using examples from an open database. Feature subsets are selected for consecutive classification experiments, reducing the number of required EEG electrodes. Methods comparison and obtained results are presented, and a study of features feeding the classifiers is provided. Differences among participating subjects and accuracies for real and imaginary motion are discussed.
