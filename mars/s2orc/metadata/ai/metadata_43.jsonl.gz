This study is undertaken to develop an efficient and scalable spam-filtering framework for heavily burdened email servers. We propose an Intelligent Hybrid Spam-Filtering Framework (IHSFF) to detect spam by analyzing only email headers. This framework is especially suitable for giant email servers because of its efficiency and scalability. The proposed filtering system may be deployed alone or in conjunction with other filters. We extract five features from the email header, namely ''originator field'', ''destination field'', ''X-Mailer field'', ''sender server IP address'' and ''mail subject''. Email subjects are digitalized using an algorithm based on n-grams for better performance. Moreover, using real-world data from a well-known ESP in China, we employ various machine-learning algorithms to test the model. Experimental results show that the framework using the Random Forest algorithm achieves good accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure.

We propose a wrapper search method using a one versus the rest discrete output classifier. Obtaining and evaluating the quality of feature sets requires the development of appropriate classifier metrics. A one versus the rest classifier must be evaluated by a scalar performance metric that provides feedback for the feature search algorithm. However, the one versus the rest discrete classifier is prone to settling into degenerate states for difficult discrimination problems. The chance of occurrence of degeneracy increases with the number of classes, number of subjects and imbalance between the number of samples in the majority and minority classes. This paper proposes a scalar Quality (Q)-factor to compensate for classifier degeneracy and to improve the convergence of the wrapper search. The Q-factor, calculated from the ratio of sensitivity to specificity of the confusion matrix, is applied as a penalty to the accuracy (1-error rate).

In-network classification is critically important in ASNs because wireless transmission costs several orders of magnitude more energy than computation. The main challenges of in-network classification in ASNs include effective feature selection, intensive computation requirement and high noise levels. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse representation based feature-less, low computational cost, and noise resilient framework for in-network classification in ASNs. The key component of Sparse Approximation based Classification (SAC), e1 minimization, is a convex optimization problem, and is known to be computationally expensive. Furthermore, SAC algorithms assumes that the test samples are a linear combination of a few training samples in the training sets. For acoustic applications, this results in a very large training dictionary, making the computation infeasible to be performed on resource constrained ASN platforms. Therefore, we propose several techniques to reduce the size of the problem, so as to fit SAC for in-network classification in ASNs. Our extensive evaluation using two real-life datasets (consisting of calls from 14 frog species and 20 cricket species respectively) shows that the proposed SAC framework outperforms conventional approaches such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. Moreover, our SAC approach can deal with multi-label classification which is common in ASNs. Finally, we explore the system design spaces and demonstrate the real-time feasibility of the proposed framework by the implementation and evaluation of an acoustic classification application on an embedded ASN testbed.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2517351.2517357", "venue": "SenSys '13", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1983618555", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1012444", "15911073", "5431719", "15994448", "7033413", "961425", "17505086", "10956978", "9071098", "1274794", "17267810", "14194870", "5800957", "921044", "8147679", "42133668", "819383", "52805445", "9499591", "2790581", "2185716", "14780725", "9720105", "13028743", "437143", "2240561", "2052723", "18558293", "2862880", "9504273", "14886376"], "inbound_citations": ["32764461", "8345803", "49659134", "20904644", "40394876", "16889259", "54451606", "246503", "5348015", "9578452", "12104734", "15588150", "13756502", "201638807", "12452828", "251818", "43946244", "25886964", "29466807", "7935398", "44113664", "8606867", "9012937", "1839942", "1575614", "52284242", "211258973", "7227724"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1298969"}

Both unsupervised (Kohonen\u2019s Self-Organizing Map, KSOM) and supervised (Back-propagation Neural Network, BNN; and Support Vector Machine, SVM) machine learning techniques were used for the classification of sequences from the testing set into one of three categories: transition from exon to intron, transition from intron to exon, and no transition. The dataset used in this study is comprised of 1,424 DNA sequences obtained from the National Center for Bioinformatics Information (NCBI). Performance of the machine learning approaches were assessed by the construction of learning models from 1,000 sequences of the training set and evaluated on the 424 sequences of the testing set that is unknown to the learning model. Each sequence is a window of 32 nucleotides long with regions comprising -15 to +15 nucleotides from the dinucleotide splice site. Since the nucleotides (A, C, G, and T) are represented by four digit binary code (e.g. 0001, 0010, 0100, and 1000) the number of descriptors increased from 32 to 128. The performance of machine learning techniques in order of increasing accuracy are as follows SVM > BNN > KSOM, suggesting that SVM is a robust method in the identification of unknown splice site. Although KSOM gave lower prediction accuracy than the two supervised methods, it is fascinating that it was able to make such prediction based only on knowledge of the input whereas the supervised method requires that the output be known during training.

In contrast to traditional methods that develop the complex models to obtain accurate segmentation results, correction learning aims to detect the erroneous segmentation in advance and correct this automatically by only using simple method. The proposed correction learning method mainly involves two steps: coarse segmentation and correction learning. First, an active contour model is firstly constructed for coarse segmentation by introducing assumption of bias field and local intensity clustering property. Then, correction learning is developed to address the erroneous segmentation and to improve the segmentation performance. In this paper, correction learning mainly contains Internal Tumor Block Correction (ITBC) and Boundary Block Correction(BBC). In order to correct the erroneous segmentation caused by intensity inhomogeneity, the internal tumor blocks detection model based on Simple Linear Iterative Clustering(SLIC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is learned to detect these segmented blocks.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is used by radiotherapists to manually segment brain lesions and to observe their development throughout the therapy. The manual image segmentation process is time-consuming and results tend to vary among different human raters. Therefore, there is a substantial demand for automatic image segmentation algorithms that produce a reliable and accurate segmentation of various brain tissue types. Recent advances in deep learning have led to convolutional neural network architectures that excel at various visual recognition tasks. They have been successfully applied to the medical context including medical image segmentation. In particular, fully convolutional networks (FCNs) such as the U-Net produce state-of-the-art results in the automatic segmentation of brain tumors. MRI brain scans are volumetric and exist in various co-registered modalities that serve as input channels for these FCN architectures. Training algorithms for brain tumor segmentation on this complex input requires large amounts of computational resources and is prone to overfitting. In this work, we construct FCNs with pretrained convolutional encoders. We show that we can stabilize the training process this way and produce more robust predictions.

The book helps to neural modelers to understand the challenges coming from the field of cognitive systems, architectures including robots, and cognitive scientists and engineers to learn more about the methods of computational neuroscience to understand the underlying neural mechanisms and computational algorithms. ::: ::: The first large part (Computational Neuroscience Models) contains ten papers. The general goal of this part was to collect works on presenting neural network models of different aspects of the perception\u2014action cyclic process. ::: ::: Perception, itself is studied in two papers. Tsotsos and Rothenstein argue that the brain does not solve the generic problem of visual search, but by the aid of attention it helps to create a computationally solvable problem. Ursino et al. reviews neural mechanisms of multisensory integration in audio-visual and visual-tactile systems respectively, constrained by neurophysiological data. It seems to be some general features behind integration, such as lateral inhibition and excitation, nonlinear processing, competitive mechanism etc. Memory and learning, as the most important cognitive functions, were reviewed from a computer scientist\u2019s (Andrew Coward) perspective to find mapping between the psychological and physiological level descriptions. ::: ::: One of the central points of this part is to review the underlying neural models of decision making processes. Levine offers a mechanism based on the interaction of a number of brain regions to model decision making under risky conditions. The main point is how emotional evaluation and numerical calculation interact. The role of error monitoring in managing conflict resolution and decision making was analyzed by Brown and Alexander. Specifically, the importance of a brain region, namely the anterior cingulate cortex was emphasized. Related to conscious and unconscious processing a neurally plausible network framework was suggested by Rolls based on probabilistic attractor network models. ::: ::: Kinematic of robots is a featured topic in robotics, Gentili et al. presented a neural network model, showed simulations, and discussed the scope and limits of biological plausible models. I found very interesting the paper of Nishimoto and Tani. They connected brain modeling, schemata learning and robot applications by adopting the concept and model framework of multiple time-scale neural networks. ::: ::: As always, John Taylor in his two papers combined broad conceptual overviews with specific details ready to applications. In the first paper he reviewed the main results of the EU GNOSYS project to build brain-inspired reasoning robot, in the second one he gives a comparative analysis of models of consciousness. It is not the reviewer\u2019s task to decide whether or not the model called CODAM (established by Taylor\u2019s own team) is the clear winner of the competitive comparison. ::: ::: The second part is about cognitive architectures, algorithms and systems. ::: ::: Another paper about CODAM (Rapantzikos et al.) emphasizes the necessity of integrating bottom up and top down algorithms, and the dynamic character of the attentional selection mechanisms to have a successful computational model of visual attention. In their implementation there is an interplay between a higher level control system and lower level cortical representation. Petridis and Perantonis applied a new methodology based on graph theory to extract semantics form multimedia data. ::: ::: The cognitive architecture CLARION (Connectionist Learning with Adaptive Rule Induction On-line) elaborated by Ron Sun and his team was mentioned in two papers. Qi Zhang reviewed the algorithms of learning episodic and semantic memory. Sun and Wilson simulated motivational processes, and the challenge is to define appropriate motivational variables, and relations among them. The topic of error monitoring, conflict resolution and decision making came back in the paper of Lima, in particular in application to robots. Petri nets proved to be a good tool for plan representation. ::: ::: The next two papers contribute to the theory and application of cognitive robots. Karigiannis et al. is interested in the ontogenetic development of learning. Different versions of reinforcement learning algorithms are successfully adopted to solve kinematic problems. Mohan et al. worked also in the framework of GNOSYS, and built algorithms for the internal models of real and imagined actions. One important aspect is the learning of the reward structure. ::: ::: Computational algorithms for reasoning and knowledge representation are reviewed by d\u2019Avila Garcez and Lamb. A connectionist algorithms was give to learn from experience. Tishby and Polani investigated the circular flow of information in the perception\u2013action cycle by the classical syntactical information theory. Specifically, they are interested in analyzing reward-driven decision process. Chella and Manzotti reviews the ambitious project of artificial consciousness. I agree with the authors: \u201cAlthough a complete theory of consciousness will very probably require some ground-breaking conceptual revisions, the deliberate attempt at mimicking consciousness will pave the way to a future scientific paradigm to understand the mind. ::: ::: The third small, illustrative part demonstrates the possibilities of hardware implementations. Lim\u2019s chapter (Smart sensor networks) shows applications of perception-reason-action networks for distributed multi-robot systems. Tang and Murray presented artificial neural networks, as appropriate methods for sensory data fusion. Data fusion should have a major role in wireless microsystems. ::: ::: The book certainly provides an overview about the neural and cognitive architectures, algorithms and systems for the perception -action systems. I missed the mentioning of one concept, namely \u201ccircular causality\u201d. I see the book as a well-edited whole, which offers a coherent perspective, and contains many remarkable details.

It is challenging to develop a robust and efficient target model. In this paper, we propose a robust model for long-term tracking in complex scenes. In order to achieve this goal, firstly, we extract multi-scale feature based on the illumination invariant color space to solve scale and illumination change of the target. For the purpose of reducing time consumption caused by the multi-scale feature, we adopt a random measurement matrix to project the high-dimensional multi-scale features onto a low-dimensional subspace. Secondly, we introduce a tracking Failure Detection Strategy(FDS) to decide whether the tracking is a failure which cause by occlusion, illumination change and situations when the target moves out of camera view. Finally, we proposed a Weighted Random Forest(WRF) classifier to retrieve the target position after the tracking failure situation, and the classifier is updated online, so that the performance of the model improves over time.

OBJECTIVE: In this paper we present a novel methodology for the automated identification of different plaque components in grayscale IVUS images. METHODS: The proposed method is based on a hybrid approach that incorporates both image processing techniques and classification algorithms and allows classification of the plaque into three different categories: Hard Calcified, Hard-Non Calcified and Soft plaque. Annotations by two experts on 8 IVUS examinations were used to train and test our method. RESULTS: The combination of an automatic thresholding technique and active contours coupled with a Random Forest classifier provided reliable results with an overall classification accuracy of 86.14%.

Landslides are difficult to recognize, particularly in rainforest regions. Thus, an accurate, detailed, and updated inventory map is required for landslide susceptibility, hazard, and risk analyses. The inconsistency in the results obtained using different features selection techniques in the literature has highlighted the importance of evaluating these techniques. Thus, in this study, six techniques of features selection were evaluated. Veryhigh- resolution LiDAR point clouds and orthophotos were acquired simultaneously in a rainforest area of Cameron Highlands, Malaysia by airborne laser scanning (LiDAR). A fuzzy-based segmentation parameter (FbSP optimizer) was used to optimize the segmentation parameters. Training samples were evaluated using a stratified random sampling method and set to 70% training samples. Two machine-learning algorithms, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were used to evaluate the performance of each features selection algorithm.

For example, additive kernels work extremely well for some specific tasks, such as computer vision classification, medical research, and some specialized scenarios. Moreover, the analytical solution using AK-LS-SVM can formulate leave-one-out cross-validation error estimates in a closed form for parameter tuning, which drastically reduces the computational cost and guarantee the generalization performance especially on small and medium datasets. However, AK-LS-SVM still faces two main challenges: 1) improving the classification performance of AK-LS-SVM and 2) saving time when performing a grid search for model selection. Inspired by the stacked generalization principle and the transfer learning mechanism, a layer-by-layer combination of AK-LS-SVM classifiers embedded with transfer learning is proposed in this paper. This new classifier is called deep transfer additive kernel least square support vector machine (DTA-LS-SVM) which overcomes these two challenges. Also, considering that imbalanced datasets are involved in many real-world scenarios, especially for medical data analysis, the deep-transfer element is extended to compensate for this imbalance, thus leading to the development of another new classifier iDTA-LS-SVM. In the hierarchical structure of both DTA-LS-SVM and iDTA-LS-SVM, each layer has an AK-LS-SVM and the predictions from the previous layer act as an additional input feature for the current layer. Importantly, transfer learning is also embedded to guarantee generalization consistency between the adjacent layers. Moreover, both iDTA-LS-SVM and DTA-LS-SVM can ensure the minimal leave-one-out error by using the proposed fast leave-one-out cross validation strategy on the training set in each layer. We compared the proposed classifiers DTA-LS-SVM and iDTA-LS-SVM with the traditional LS-SVM and SVM using additive kernels on seven public UCI datasets and one real world dataset.

In recent years, with the development of deep learning, object detection has also obtained great breakthroughs. For object detection tasks in natural images, such as the PASCAL (Pattern Analysis, Statistical Modelling and Computational Learning) VOC (Visual Object Classes) Challenge, the major trend of current development is to use a large amount of labeled classification data to pre-train the deep neural network as a base network, and then use a small amount of annotated detection data to fine-tune the network for detection. In this paper, we use object detection technology based on deep learning for airplane detection in remote sensing images. In addition to using some characteristics of remote sensing images, some new data augmentation techniques have been proposed. We also use transfer learning and adopt a single deep convolutional neural network and limited training samples to implement end-to-end trainable airplane detection.

This task becomes challenging when applied to morphologically rich languages (MRL). In this article, we evaluate the use of deep learning advances, namely the Recursive Neural Tensor Networks (RNTN), for sentiment analysis in Arabic as a case study of MRLs. While Arabic may not be considered the only representative of all MRLs, the challenges faced and proposed solutions in Arabic are common to many other MRLs. We identify, illustrate, and address MRL-related challenges and show how RNTN is affected by the morphological richness and orthographic ambiguity of the Arabic language. To address the challenges with sentiment extraction from text in MRL, we propose to explore different orthographic features as well as different morphological features at multiple levels of abstraction ranging from raw words to roots. A key requirement for RNTN is the availability of a sentiment treebank; a collection of syntactic parse trees annotated for sentiment at all levels of constituency and that currently only exists in English. Therefore, our contribution also includes the creation of the first Arabic Sentiment Treebank (A r S en TB) that is morphologically and orthographically enriched. Experimental results show that, compared to the basic RNTN proposed for English, our solution achieves significant improvements up to 8% absolute at the phrase level and 10.8% absolute at the sentence level, measured by average F1 score.

More specifically, the Hough transform algorithm (HT) was applied to the orthomosaicked images for inter-row weed detection. A semi-automatic Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) procedure was developed with Random Forests (RF) combined with feature selection techniques to classify soil, weeds and maize. Furthermore, the two binary weed masks generated from HT and OBIA were fused for accurate binary weed image. The developed RF classifier was evaluated by 5-fold cross validation, and it obtained an overall accuracy of 0.945, and Kappa value of 0.912. Finally, the relationship of detected weeds and their ground truth densities was quantified by a fitted linear model with a coefficient of determination of 0.895 and a root mean square error of 0.026. Besides, the importance of input features was evaluated, and it was found that the ratio of vegetation length and width was the most significant feature for the classification model.

Estimating parameters using the Maximum Likelihood approach is feasible only for a subclass of max-sum classifiers with an acyclic structure of neighbouring pairs.

Besides the max-sum classifiers with the acyclic neighbouring structure, it has been shown that the discriminative learning is possible even with arbitrary neighbouring structure provided the quality functions fulfill some additional constraints. In this article, we extend the discriminative approach to other three classes of max-sum classifiers with an arbitrary neighbourhood structure. We derive learning algorithms for two subclasses of max-sum classifiers whose response can be computed in polynomial time: (i) the max-sum classifiers with supermodular quality functions and (ii) the max-sum classifiers whose response can be computed exactly by a linear programming relaxation. Moreover, we show that the learning problem can be approximately solved even for a general max-sum classifier.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1390681.1390685", "venue": "Journal of Machine Learning Research", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1586342396", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10128146", "16243267", "17446952", "17792995", "6652383", "15218196", "11469024", "15502486", "2481407", "16806171", "17632083", "18685516", "14210374", "16191202"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:45690"}

However, this task is complicated in clinical medicine due to the variation in scanning parameters and protocols, even within a single medical center. Existing literature on automatic image segmentation using MR data is based on the analysis of highly homogenous images obtained using a fixed set of pulse sequence parameters (TR/TE). Unfortunately, algorithms that operate on fixed scanning parameters do not avail themselves to real-world daily clinical use due to the existing variation in scanning parameters and protocols. Thus, it is necessary to develop algorithmic techniques that can address the challenge of MR image segmentation using real clinical data. Toward this goal, we developed a multi-parametric ensemble learning technique to automatically detect and segment lumbar vertebral bodies using MR images of the spine. We use spine imaging data to illustrate our techniques since low back pain is an extremely common condition and a typical spine clinic evaluates patients that have been referred with a wide range of scanning parameters. This method was designed with special emphasis on robustness so that it can perform well despite the inherent variation in scanning protocols. Specifically, we show how a single multi-parameter ensemble model trained with manually labeled T2 scans can autonomously segment vertebral bodies on scans with echo times varying between 24 and 147 ms and relaxation times varying between 1500 and 7810 ms. Furthermore, even though the model was trained using T2-MR imaging data, it can accurately segment vertebral bodies on T1-MR and CT, further demonstrating the robustness and versatility of our methodology.

System identification is the process of identifying a model of an unknown process, for the purpose of predicting and/or gaining an insight into the behaviour of the process. Due to the inherent complexity of many real processes (i.e multivariate, nonlinear and time varying), conventional modelling techniques have proved to be too restrictive. In these instances more sophisticated (intelligent) modelling techniques are required. Recently the similarities between neural networks, with their ability to learn to universally approximate any continuous nonlinear multivariate function, and fuzzy systems, with their transparent reasoning by a series of linguistic rules, have been drawn. This has lead to the development of neurofuzzy systems combining the desired attributes of both these paradigms, and hence producing a technique ideal for modelling. Neurofuzzy systems are a fuzzy system defined on a neural network type structure providing a fuzzy system to which thorough mathematical analysis can be applied. For this reason neurofuzzy systems have become an attractive powerful new modelling technique, combining the well established learning techniques of associative memory networks (AMNs) with the transparency of fuzzy systems. However, the true modelling capabilities of any given model depend heavily on its structure, and hence an important task (arguably the most important) is structure identification. Assuming the availability of empirical input/output data, known as the training set, a construction algorithm can be used to construct a model to fit this data. Due to the fuzzy system equivalence of these models, neurofuzzy model identification is amenable to another method; a priori knowledge of the process can be represented by a series of fuzzy rules which can then be used either as the system model or to initialise a construction algorithm. Also, when the dimension of the problem increases the size of the neurofuzzy model and hence the size of an adequate training set, grows exponentially. Due to this phenomenon, known as the curse of dimensionality, the use of conventional neurofuzzy models on high dimensional problems (> 4 inputs) is impractical. Hence, during model construction (in all dimensions) the following fundamental principles must be employed: Principle of data reduction: the smallest number of input variables should be used to explain a maximum amount of information; Principle of network parsimony: the best models are obtained using the simplest acceptable structures, containing the smallest number of adjustable parameters. Parsimony is obtained by exploiting structural redundancy in conventional systems, which is achieved by employing alternative neurofuzzy representations. A brief introduction to such representations is given in this paper. Another important issue when constructing models from empirical data, is the quality of this data. Ideally this data should be well distributed and noise free, two unrealistic demands (especially in high dimensions). A common approach to these problems in both statistical and neural network communities is regularisation, which penalises the weight training cost function to try and control superfluous parameters. Despite building parsimonious models, due to the poor quality of the training set some weights maybe be poorly identified, producing models that generalise badly, regularisation attempts to control these parameters. This is another issue briefly addressed in this paper.", "year": 1996, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-18242-6_5", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1551156356", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["115771059", "60722468"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17591372"}

Therefore, utilities wish to repair or replace the sewers before they collapse. In order to investigate if a sewer needs maintenance or replacement it can be inspected with Closed Circuit Television (CCTV), but as CCTV inspection is very expensive, and hence only a small percentage of the sewers are inspected. This underlines the importance of choosing the correct sewers for inspection and have resulted in development of several deterioration models. However, the best performing existing models are tailored to individual cities and need to be calibrated in order to be generalized to new areas. As the cost for collecting a data set for calibration is high, the utilities could benefit from a sewer deterioration model which generalizes across location.This paper presents a deterioration model based on Random Forest, which is trained on data from 35 utilities spread across the country of Denmark. The model was able to predict the sewer condition with a specificity at 0.80 and a sensitivity at 0.76, which is comparable to the best existing models. This shows that it is possible to make a deterioration model which generalizes across data from different regions, sewers and utilities.

A Pixel Labelling Algorithm incorporating color, contrast and image texture conjointly provide a treatment solution. This includes feature extraction and classification. The process involved is scaling segmentation of the image. The Markov random field (MRF) is used to smooth a classification from a support vector machine (SVM) that utilizes a feature space derived from image color and scaling texture. So initially the image is contrasted to find the affected area. The concentration is on the lighting and the skin type. The scaling contrast map provides an effective way to contrast image. It focuses on colour and intensity of the image. Gabor filter is used to extract the texture from the image. The final image obtained is the ground truth. The proposed system focuses on segmentation and scaling of 2D digital images of Psoriasis to detect vague scaling. An edge mapped luminance algorithm is used.

In this study, models based on Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference Systems and Least Squares Support Vector Machines methods were developed to predict oxygen transfer efficiency in free flowing gated closed conduits.

Because the function of a protein is closely correlated with its subcellular location, with the rapid increase in new protein sequences entering into databanks, it is vitally important for both basic research and pharmaceutical industry to establish a high throughput tool for predicting protein subcellular location. In this paper, a new concept, the so-called \"functional domain composition\" is introduced. Based on the novel concept, the representation for a protein can be defined as a vector in a high-dimensional space, where each of the clustered functional domains derived from the protein universe serves as a vector base. With such a novel representation for a protein, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is introduced for predicting protein subcellular location. High success rates are obtained by the self-consistency test, jackknife test, and independent dataset test, respectively.

The food quality assessment task becomes more challenging when it is about harmless internal examination of the ingredient, and even more when its size is also minute. In this article, a method for automatic detection, extraction and classification of raw food item is presented using x-ray image data of pine nuts. Image processing techniques are employed in developing an efficient method for automatic detection and then extraction of individual ingredient, from the source x-ray image which comprises bunch of nuts in a single frame. For data representation, statistical texture analysis is carried out and attributes are calculated from each of the sample image on the global level as features. In addition co-occurrence matrices are computed from images with four different offsets, and hence more features are extracted by using them. To find fewer meaningful characteristics, all the calculated features are organized in several combinations and then tested. Seventy percent of image data is used for training and 15% each for cross-validation and test purposes. Binary classification is performed using two state-of-the-art non-linear classifiers: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Performance is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. ANN classifier showed 87.6% accuracy with correct recognition rate of healthy nuts and unhealthy nuts as 94% and 62% respectively. SVM classifier produced the similar accuracy achieving 86.3% specificity and 89.2% sensitivity rate. The results obtained are unique itself in terms of ingredient and promising relatively.

This global process of land transformation is not only persistent in highly dynamic urban areas in developing countries, but also in cities of the Western world. The exponential increase of impervious surfaces for establishment of settlements and transport infrastructure yields negative consequences in many regards, e.g., increasing surface runoff and flood risk, decreasing groundwater recharge, or intensification of the urban heat island effect. Thus, exact and area-wide estimation of impervious surfaces is of high value and must be repeated regularly in order to provide up-to-date information for policy makers. For example in Germany, surveys on imperviousness are often conducted at irregular intervals with patchy spatial coverage and distribution only. In this regard, suitable remote sensing data offers a cost-effective solution for area-wide surveying and monitoring of impervious surfaces. ::: This study investigates the capability of optical satellite remote sensing imagery with various spatial resolutions for impervious surface estimation. The utilized input data sets range from WorldView-2 imagery with very-high resolution (VHR) of 0.5 m to high resolution (HR) imagery acquired by Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 with only 30 m spatial resolution. These HR sensors possess the advantage of cost-free imagery and high temporal resolution, which enables effective capabilities for monitoring imperviousness. VHR data is analyzed by means of object-based image analysis (OBIA), while Support Vector Regression (SVR) is employed for estimation of impervious surfaces in HR imagery since individual urban objects cannot be resolved at lower spatial scales. In addition, different input features are evaluated systematically in order to assess the potential of data compression by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as well as spectral indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation index (SAVI), or Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI). ::: Our results illustrate that the OBIA classification of the WorldView-2 imagery with 0.5 m spatial resolution for the city of Munich achieved estimations of imperviousness with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of about 10.0 % compared to official data of imperviousness provided by the city municipality. Naturally, the classification based on HR data obtained lower accuracies. However, RMSE values in the order of 20.0 % - 25.0 % dependent on the utilized features and spatial resolutions reveal that these remote sensing data sets still allow a general assessment with fair to high accuracy at no cost. In general, the accuracy of impervious surface mapping is highly dependent on the spatial resolution of the input data, i.e. the accuracy increases with spatial detail of the imagery.

Hyperspectral images are made up of contiguous wavebands in a given spectral band. These images provide information on the chemical make-up profile of objects, thus allowing the differentiation of objects of the same colour but which possess make-up profile. Yet, whatever the application field, most of the methods devoted to HIS processing conduct data analysis without taking into account spatial information. Pixels are processed individually, as an array of spectral data without any spatial structure. Standard classification approaches are thus widely used (k-means, fuzzy-c-means hierarchical classification...). Linear modelling methods such as Partial Least Square analysis (PLS) or non linear approaches like support vector machine (SVM) are also used at different scales (remote sensing or laboratory applications). However, with the development of high resolution sensors, coupled exploitation of spectral and spatial information to process complex images, would appear to be a very relevant approach. However, few methods are proposed in the litterature. The most recent approaches can be broadly classified in two main categories. The first ones are related to a direct extension of individual pixel classification methods using just the spectral dimension (k-means, fuzzy-c-means or FCM, Support Vector Machine or SVM). Spatial dimension is integrated as an additionnal classification parameter (Markov fields with local homogeneity constrainst [5], Support Vector Machine or SVM with spectral and spatial kernels combination [2], geometrically guided fuzzy C-means [3]...). The second ones combine the two fields related to each dimension (spectral and spatial), namely chemometric and image analysis. Various strategies have been attempted. The first one is to rely on chemometrics methods (Principal Component Analysis or PCA, Independant Component Analysis or ICA, Curvilinear Component Analysis...) to reduce the spectral dimension and then to apply standard images processing technics on the resulting score images i.e. data projection on a subspace. Another approach is to extend the definition of basic image processing operators to this new dimensionality (morphological operators for example [1, 4]). However, the approaches mentioned above tend to favour only one description either directly or indirectly (spectral or spatial). The purpose of this paper is to propose a hyperspectral processing approach that strikes a better balance in the treatment of both kinds of information. To achieve this, a generic scheme is proposed to associate more closely the spectral and spatial aspects symmetrically and conjunctively. This method, called butterfly, aims to perform an iterative and a cross analysis of data in the spectral and the spatial domains lead to the segmentation of the hyperspectral image. The strategy is based on two steps - Extraction of a spatial structure (topology) incorporating a spectral structure, - Extraction of a spectral structure (latent variables) incorporating a spatial structure, These steps are processed in a successive, iterative and inter-dependent way. In this article, we will focus solely on specific notions of topology i.e. the notions of connectivity and adjacency. Thus, the first stage deals with the use of commonly used image processing tools (region segmentation algorithms) on a limited number of score images. This makes it relatively easy to process. To carry out the second step, we use chemometric tools to reveal a subspace (latent variables) enabling the characterization of heterogeneity of the obtained image partitions. However, the scheme can be applied on two different ways depending on the region segmentation strategy used i.e. top down approaches (splitting) or bottom-up approaches (merging). We have implemented this scheme by using a split and merge strategy based on the quadtree approach. Each phase is done over successive steps (iterations). At each iteration of the split phase, the data are projected on k(1) suitable latent variables. The split of each existing region (partition) into four disjoints quadrants is tested and the one maximising the Wilks Lambda parameter is chosen. At each iteration of the merge phase, the data are projected on k(2) suitable latent variables and all the merging of two adjacent regions are tested. The one maximising the Wilks Lambda parameter is chosen. Lastly, we tested our approach on a simple synthetic image to show more precisely its characteristics and also on two real images at different scales (in field acquisition on crop, remote sensing image of urban zone). The results obtained on real images underline the benefit of the butterfly approach. However, further work will be undertaken to investigate the influence of various parameters. Moreover, other topology notions and image analysis algorithm could be also investigated.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2945648215", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:182017961"}

In this context, FS is based on the texture features obtained from the lumen, nuclei, cytoplasm and stroma, all of which are important tissue components. However, it is difficult to represent the high-dimensional textures of these tissue components. To solve this problem, we propose a new FS method that enables the selection of features with minimal redundancy in the tissue components. ::: ::: ::: METHODOLOGY ::: We categorise tissue images based on the texture of individual tissue components via the construction of a single classifier and also construct an ensemble learning model by merging the values obtained by each classifier. Another issue that arises is overfitting due to the high-dimensional texture of individual tissue components. We propose a new FS method, SVM-RFE(AC), that integrates a Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) embedded procedure with an absolute cosine (AC) filter method to prevent redundancy in the selected features of the SV-RFE and an unoptimised classifier in the AC. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We conducted experiments on H&E histopathological prostate and colon cancer images with respect to three prostate classifications, namely benign vs. grade 3, benign vs. grade 4 and grade 3 vs. grade 4. The colon benchmark dataset requires a distinction between grades 1 and 2, which are the most difficult cases to distinguish in the colon domain. The results obtained by both the single and ensemble classification models (which uses the product rule as its merging method) confirm that the proposed SVM-RFE(AC) is superior to the other SVM and SVM-RFE-based methods. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: We developed an FS method based on SVM-RFE and AC and successfully showed that its use enabled the identification of the most crucial texture feature of each tissue component. Thus, it makes possible the distinction between multiple Gleason grades (e.g. grade 3 vs. grade 4) and its performance is far superior to other reported FS methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29680688", "doi": "10.1016/j.artmed.2018.04.002", "venue": "Artificial intelligence in medicine", "journal": "Artificial intelligence in medicine", "mag_id": "2802565218", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204818219", "214699990", "212705519", "198318880", "211142733"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5058082"}

Learning representations in such a scenario is inherently complex due to the presence of multiple heterogeneous information channels. These channels can encode both (a) inter-relations between the items of different modalities and (b) intra-relations between the items of the same modality. Encoding multimedia items into a continuous low-dimensional semantic space such that both types of relations are captured and preserved is extremely challenging, especially if the goal is a unified end-to-end learning framework. The two key challenges that need to be addressed are: 1) the framework must be able to merge complex intra and inter relations without losing any valuable information and 2) the learning model should be invariant to the addition of new and potentially very different modalities. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework which can scale to data streams from many modalities. To that end we introduce a hypergraph-based model for data representation and deploy Graph Convolutional Networks to fuse relational information within and across modalities. Our approach provides an efficient solution for distributing otherwise extremely computationally expensive or even unfeasible training processes across multiple-GPUs, without any sacrifices in accuracy. Moreover, adding new modalities to our model requires only an additional GPU unit keeping the computational time unchanged, which brings representation learning to truly multimodal datasets.

From these roots, ILP's scope has grown to encompass different approaches that address learning from structured relational data. One notable example is the area of statistical relational learning which focuses on extending ILP to model uncertainty. The special issue is also in conjunction with the 24th International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), which was held from September 14th to 16th, 2014, in Nancy, France in co-location with ECML/PKDD-2014. To avoid the redundancy between the conference proceedings and the special issue, authors with an accepted paper at ILP were asked to either have their paper appear in the conference proceedings or submit an extended version of the paper to the special issue. While associated with the ILP conference, there was an open call for submissions to this special issue. The special issue received six submissions of which three were originally submitted to the ILP conference. Ultimately, four were accepted to appear in the special issue. The papers offer a nice reflection on the strengths of ILP and relational learning and where the field is headed. Namely, the articles build off ILP's established track record of being particularly well suited to addressing important applications and the vibrant recent work that focuses on modeling uncertainty in relational data. One of the first application areas where ILP gained significant traction was in analyzing molecules, in particular for the task of drug design.

Many imaging modalities including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) can be interpreted in this way. We can venture further and consider that a medical image naturally factors into some spatial factors depicting anatomy and factors that denote the imaging characteristics. Here, we explicitly learn this decomposed (factorised) representation of imaging data, focusing in particular on cardiac images. We propose Spatial Decomposition Network (SDNet), which factorises 2D medical images into spatial anatomical factors and non-spatial imaging factors. We demonstrate that this high-level representation is ideally suited for several medical image analysis tasks, such as semi-supervised segmentation, multi-task segmentation and regression, and image-to-image synthesis. Specifically, we show that our model can match the performance of fully supervised segmentation models, using only a fraction of the labelled images. Critically, we show that our factorised representation also benefits from supervision obtained either when we use auxiliary tasks to train the model in a multi-task setting (e.g. regressing to known cardiac indices), or when aggregating multimodal data from different sources (e.g. pooling together MRI and CT data). To explore the properties of the learned factorisation, we perform latent-space arithmetic and show that we can synthesise CT from MR and vice versa, by swapping the modality factors. We also demonstrate that the factor holding image specific information can be used to predict the input modality with high accuracy.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1903.09467", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Medical Image Analysis 2019", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2922871285,2959170286", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["3586592", "3613245", "12929278", "215390137", "51894458", "67927804", "51610194", "28003886", "49862143", "10285129", "3947701", "5002792", "4903005", "947451", "5965892", "206593710", "1033682", "4379611", "4883312", "3380833", "6628106", "51904575", "24621343", "6892094", "206429151", "206683222", "206750461", "19119291", "52272851", "11758569", "16895865", "3719281", "6530726", "943353", "4043370", "44884796", "49558518", "13836027", "19046372", "28790398", "34028323", "2309009"], "inbound_citations": ["211481741"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85459290"}

Methods: This study analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from frontal channels in patients with disorders of consciousness (either coma or MCS), patients under general anesthesia, and healthy participants in normal waking consciousness (NWC). Four non-linear methods\u2014permutation entropy (PE), sample entropy (SampEn), permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC), and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)\u2014as well as relative power (RP), extracted features from the EEG recordings. A genetic algorithm-based support vector machine (GA-SVM) classified the states of consciousness based on the extracted features. A multivariable linear regression model then built EEG indices for level and content of consciousness. Results: The PE differentiated all four states of consciousness (p<0.001). Altered contents of consciousness for NWC, MCS, coma, and general anesthesia were best differentiated by the SampEn, and PLZC. In contrast, the levels of consciousness for these four states were best differentiated by RP of Gamma and PE. A multi-dimensional index, combined with the GA-SVM, showed that the integration of PE, PLZC, SampEn, and DFA had the highest classification accuracy (92.3%).

Annotating the quadratic number of pairwise relations between training images is simply not feasible, while unsupervised inference is prone to noise, thus leaving the vast majority of these relations to be unreliable. To nevertheless find those relations which can be reliably utilized for learning, we follow a divide-and-conquer strategy: We find reliable similarities by extracting compact groups of images and reliable dissimilarities by partitioning these groups into subsets, converting the complicated overall problem into few reliable local subproblems. For each of the subsets we obtain a representation by learning a mapping to a target feature space so that their reliable relations are kept. Transitivity relations between the subsets are then exploited to consolidate the local solutions into a concerted global representation. While iterating between grouping, partitioning, and learning, we can successively use more and more reliable relations which, in turn, improves our image representation.

This paper aims at making a step toward an objective evaluation process for generative models. It presents a new method to assess a trained generative model by evaluating the test accuracy of a classifier trained with generated data. The test set is composed of real images. Therefore, The classifier accuracy is used as a proxy to evaluate if the generative model fit the true data distribution. By comparing results with different generated datasets we are able to classify and compare generative models. The motivation of this approach is also to evaluate if generative models can help discriminative neural networks to learn, i.e., measure if training on generated data is able to make a model successful at testing on real settings. Our experiments compare different generators from the Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) frameworks on MNIST and fashion MNIST datasets.

Different from the Kodovsky's ensemble classifier which selects features in a completely random way, the proposed CS-RS modifies the generation method of feature subspaces. Firstly, our method employs the chi-square statistic (CS) to measure the weight of each feature in the original feature space and sorts features according to weights. Then the sorted original feature space is partitioned into two parts according to a given dividing point: high correlation part and low correlation part. Finally, the feature subset is formed by selecting features randomly in each part according to the given sampling rate. Experiments with the steganographic algorithms HUGO demonstrate that the proposed CS-RS using the FLD classifier offers training complexity comparable to the Kodovsky's classifier and significantly increases the performance of the Kodovsky's classifier in less than 1000-dimensional feature subspaces, gaining 1.2% on the optimal result.

The measure uses a grey level gradient or intensity information and the fractal dimension. The proposed measure is partitioned into two distinct regions, namely, changed and unchanged, using some change detection methods like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Fuzzy C -Means clustering (FCM) and artificial neural networks with a back propagation training algorithm. Experiments over the study area show that the results of implementing change detection methods are improved by using the proposed measure, in comparison to the classical log-ratio image.

Web pages contain much irrelevant information that does not reflect their categories or topics, and operates as noise in the process of their classification, especially when using a text classifier. Thus, the use of information from related web pages can help to overcome the problem of noisy content and to get a better result after the classification. Web pages are linked either directly by hyperlinks or indirectly by us- er's intuitive judgment. In this work, we suggest a post clas- sification corrective method that uses the query-log to build an implicit neighborhood, and collectively propagate classes over web pages of that neighborhood. This collective propa- gation helps improving text classifier results by correcting wrongly assigned categories. Our technique operates in four steps. In the first step, it builds a weighted graph called ini- tial graph, whose vertices are web pages and edges are im- plicit links. In the second step, it uses a text classifier to de- termine classes of all web pages represented by vertices in the initial graph. In the third step, it constructs clusters of web pages using Formal Concept Analysis. Then, it applies a first adjustment of classes called Internal Propagation of Categories (IPC). In the final step, it performs a second adjustment of classes called External Propagation of Cate- gories (EPC). This adjustment leads to significant improve- ments of results provided by the text classifier. We conduct our experiments using five classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), NB (Naive Bayes), KNN (K Nearest Neighbors), ICA (Iterative classification algorithm) based on SVM and ICA based on NB, on four subsets of ODP (Open Directory Project). We also compare our approach to Classification using Linked Neighborhood (CLN) considered as the closest algorithm to EPC. Results show that: (1) when applied after SVM, NB, KNN or ICA classification, IPC followed by EPC help bringing improvements on results. (2) F1 scores pro- vided by our approach with any of the five classifiers are significantly better than those obtained by CLN.

Rule induction is a powerful technique used in machine learning wherein the target concept is represented as a set of rules. The attraction of rule induction is that rules are more transparent and easier to understand compared to other induction methods (e.g., regression methods or neural network). Rule induction has been shown to outperform other learners on many problems. However, it is not suitable to handle exceptions and noisy data in training sets, which can be solved by pruning. This thesis is concerned with investigating whether preceding rule induction with instance reduction techniques can help in reducing the complexity of rule sets by reducing the number of rules generated without adversely affecting the predictive accuracy. An empirical study is undertaken to investigate the application of three different rule classifiers to datasets that were previously reduced with promising instance-reduction methods. Furthermore, we propose a new instance reduction method based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). We evaluate the effectiveness of this instance reduction method for k nearest neighbour algorithms in term of predictive accuracy and amount of reduction. Then we compared it with other instance reduction methods. ::: We show that pruning classification rules with instance-reduction methods lead to a statistically significant decrease in the number of generated rules, without adversely affecting performance. On the other hand, applying instance-reduction methods enhances the predictive accuracy on some datasets.

Moreover, the impact of the disease is expected to increase even more as the life expectancy is going to grow over the years. Consequently, a lot of research is focused on computer-aided diagnosis techniques that aim at quantitatively study Magnetic Resonance brain images of early stage patients. Early diagnosis could help in better future cure or disease- modifying treatments. An example of AD early stage is Mild Cognitive Impariment (MCI), as the 50% of the individuals who suffer from this pathology develop AD in three of four years. In this work, we use Support Vector Machines to classify subjects from AD, MCI and healthy control (CTL) groups. Our main objective is to study whether combining different anatomical scale brain regions and different image modalities could improve the classification accuracy. Thus, regional and global Grey Matter (GM) volumes (multiscale approach), Withe Matter (WM) regional volumes, Regional Asymmetry coefficients and T1- quantitative MRI data (multivariate) are combined. Our accuracies when comparing CTL vs AD and CTL vs MCI with large public databases (ADNI) are comparable to the results in the literature: 88.3% and 81.8% respectively. In this master thesis we study also smaller databases of MCI patients from Lausanne University Hospital. We pay special attention to the study of pre-processing steps: Intra Craneal Volume normalization and age correction. Our results show that for our small group of patients, better accuracies can be obtained when combining different types of features (multiscale and multivariate) than when only using classical GM region volumes.

Our proposed method applies a model compression technique based on a teacher\u2013student framework to a random forest (RF) classifier instead of a wide and deep network because a compressed deep network still demands a large memory for a large amount of parameters and processing resources for multiplication. The first objective of the proposed compression method is to train a student shallow RF (S-RF), which can mimic the teacher RF\u2019s performance, by using a softened version of the teacher RF\u2019s output. Second, a deep network cannot easily detect small and closely located pedestrians in a surveillance video captured from a high perspective because of frequent convolutions and pooling processes. In this paper, adaptive image scaling and region of interest with S-RF were therefore combined to allow fast and accurate pedestrian detection in a low-specification surveillance system.

Such virtual connections are then remapped into physical connections to be carried on the physical network using network address translation. VNAT requires no modification to existing applications, operating systems, or protocol stacks. Furthermore, it is fully compatible with the existing communication infrastructure; virtual and normal connections can coexist without interfering each other.

In particular, a model of coupled nonlinear oscillators which emulates the transmembrane voltage activities in CA3 neurons, operating in a chaotic regime and in the presence of noise, can exhibit coherence resonance and stochastic resonance. Certain firing frequencies become more \"rhythmic\" for some optimal values of noise intensity. The effect of noise in different coupling pathways is investigated. We found that the effect of coherence resonance and stochastic resonance are more prominent if noise is presented in either electric field or gap junction coupling pathways. Frequency sensitivity of the model is investigated as a preliminary step in illustrating the principles of possible epileptic seizure control strategies using \"chaos control\" concepts. Significant effects of stochastic resonance are observed in the 4-8 Hz range. Weaker effects can be found in the 1-4 Hz and 8-10 Hz ranges whereas 0.5 Hz does not exhibit any resonance phenomenon. Our results suggest that: (a) Stochastic resonance could enhance the intrinsic 4-8 Hz rhythms in CA3 neurons more prominently via field coupling pathways. It could also help explain why some reported seizure control strategies using pulse-trains would only be effective at 0.5 Hz.

That is, SVM's suffer from a widely recognized scalability problems in both memory requirements and computation time when the input dataset is too large. To address this, we aimed at training the Support vector machine model in MapReduce programming model of Hadoop framework, since the MapReduce programming model has the ability to rapidly process a large amount of data in parallel. MapReduce works in tandem with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The so proposed approach will solve the scalability problem of present SVM algorithm.

As a way of overcoming this, we introduce incremental learning, a process in which an inductive programming system automatically modifies its inductive bias towards some domain through solving a sequence of gradually more difficult problems in that domain. We demonstrate a simple form of incremental learning in which a system incorporates solution programs into its background knowledge as it progresses through a sequence of problems. Using a search-based inductive functional programming system modelled on the MagicHaskeller system of Katayama [4], we perform a set of experiments comparing the performance of inductive programming with and without incremental learning. Incremental learning is shown to produce a performance improvement of at least a factor of thirty on each of the four problem sequences tested. We describe how, given some assumptions, inductive programming with incremental learning can be shown to have a polynomial, rather than exponential, time complexity with respect to the size of the program to be generated.

However, this information does not reliably capture the nature of the application, i.e. whether it is benign or malicious. In this paper, we claim and experimentally support that using the micro-architectural level information obtained from HPCs cannot distinguish between benignware and malware.

We frame the prediction of the output sequence as a sequential decision-making process, where we train the network with an adjusted actor-critic algorithm (AC-RNN). We comprehensively compare this strategy with maximum-likelihood training for both RNNs and CRFs on three structured-output tasks.

While the idea of learning cost functions is relatively new to the field of generative modeling, learning costs has long been studied in control and reinforcement learning (RL) domains, typically for imitation learning from demonstrations. In these fields, learning cost function underlying observed behavior is known as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) or inverse optimal control. While at first the connection between cost learning in RL and cost learning in generative modeling may appear to be a superficial one, we show in this paper that certain IRL methods are in fact mathematically equivalent to GANs. In particular, we demonstrate an equivalence between a sample-based algorithm for maximum entropy IRL and a GAN in which the generator's density can be evaluated and is provided as an additional input to the discriminator. Interestingly, maximum entropy IRL is a special case of an energy-based model. We discuss the interpretation of GANs as an algorithm for training energy-based models, and relate this interpretation to other recent work that seeks to connect GANs and EBMs. By formally highlighting the connection between GANs, IRL, and EBMs, we hope that researchers in all three communities can better identify and apply transferable ideas from one domain to another, particularly for developing more stable and scalable algorithms: a major challenge in all three domains.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1611.03852", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2566467060", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6103843", "14096841", "1820089", "9640442", "37925315", "8768364", "8121626", "1033682", "16153365", "6448021", "13997572", "8070055", "13975441", "8531544", "34196655", "3631537", "6254678", "8469530", "103456", "3603249", "3439214", "15876696", "11919065", "336219"], "inbound_citations": ["202764268", "202712580", "201981476", "208138089", "108304275", "8469530", "86605068", "20973268", "20299971", "126011543", "77383990", "214802532", "174800824", "208910704", "49426397", "214334512", "207870623", "1482745", "204578244", "13751352", "5824780", "21650267", "202537339", "52297370", "196185575", "208617453", "153312899", "212717768", "203626552", "210838972", "174800321", "44130530", "208527348", "29630552", "196470924", "202577381", "196195382", "54461610", "56596580", "52087976", "49299163", "155100049", "13669032", "203626752", "56177744", "10466029", "201812145", "3508638", "211020624", "170079195", "52171126", "27332382", "52903707", "164211006", "204509231", "211011073", "53963306", "113704", "204830537", "59222843", "15427058", "108296485", "57365053", "67788344", "60440441", "50787617", "52824835", "202776458", "210839653", "202765664", "199510905", "211204702", "119295213", "3952962", "211105023", "84845815", "53023256", "201651596", "211532692", "184488108", "23301738", "67936982", "52895409", "46894820", "19077536", "207880680", "209140458", "202676137", "21529792", "203626717", "21646317", "208157964", "51865118", "53223857"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3248959"}

Among all operations involved in image photomontage, image splicing can be considered the most fundamental and essential operation. In this report, our goal is to detect spliced images by a passive-blind approach, which can do without any prior information, as well as without the need of embedding watermark or extracting image features at the moment of image acquisition. Bicoherence, a third-order moment spectra and an effective technique for detecting quadratic phase coupling (QPC), has been previously proposed for passive-blind detection of human speech splicing, based on the assumption that human speech signal is low in QPC. However, images originally have non-trivial level of bispectrum energy, which implies an originally significant level of QPC. Hence, we argue that straightforward applications of bicoherence features for detecting image splicing are not effective. Furthermore, the theoretical connection between bicoherence and image splicing is not clear. For this work, we created a data set, which contains 933 authentic and 912 spliced image blocks. Besides that, we proposed two general methods, i.e., characterizing the image features that bicoherence is sensitive to and estimating the splicinginvariant component, for improving the performance of the bicoherence technique. We also proposed a model of image splicing to explain the effectiveness of bicoherence for image-splicing detection. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the features derived from the proposed improvement methods by Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification on the data set. The results show a significant improvement in image splicing detection accuracy, from 62% to 72%.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "111467674", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["120441713", "42757455", "5604476", "6651925", "14770291", "36169982", "2208074", "1434507", "36119413", "12095794", "10271144", "17822067", "1054885", "59804598", "12012125", "5699700", "1015193", "8895354", "12973143", "120136949", "22656301", "16947496", "206394327", "23790114", "124858564", "8606987", "9535307", "120198527", "109462752", "35830149", "570197", "9497613", "961425", "2443126"], "inbound_citations": ["3409646", "18807183", "3456130", "14557937", "30322878", "17819483", "17845014", "3732796", "16160898", "5627666"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16151127"}

The maintenance of a steel structure depends on regular inspections, and visual inspections are often adopted in Taiwan. Using the naked eye to determine the rusted area percentage greatly depends on the experience of the inspector, resulting in subjective results. As an alternative, an algorithm consisting of three different approaches is proposed to automatically process images. The Hue percentage and coefficient of variation (COV) of the gray levels are used to divide images into three groups in which each group is assessed using a specific recognition technique. The three proposed techniques are the following: the traditional K-means method in the H component, the double-center-double-radius (DCDR) algorithm in the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color space and DCDR in the Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI) color space. Additionally, the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) was adopted to predict the radii in the DCDR approaches.

Thus, modeling the thermal process, which always involves unknown boundary heat exchange, is significant to battery management. Two critical issues should be addressed for the thermal process modeling: 1) the nominal model, which is constructed offline, can be updated efficiently to compensate for any online disturbances; and 2) the influence of previous and recent spatiotemporal dynamics may be varying and should be handled properly. Bearing these in mind, in this paper, a spatial correlation-based incremental learning technique is designed for spatiotemporal modeling. First, the incremental learning technique is developed to update the dominant spatial basis functions of the nominal model, which is constructed by a time/space separation-based method.

In this work, considering that the curvature can measure concavity and convexity of surface well, and the human eyes are also very sensitive to the change of curvature, we propose a new objective 3D mesh quality assessment method. Curvature features are used to evaluate the visual difference between the reference and distorted meshes. Firstly, the Gaussian curvature and the mean curvature on the vertices of the reference and distorted meshes are calculated, and then the correlation function is used to measure the correlation coefficient of these meshes. In this case, the degree of degradation of the distorted mesh can be well represented. Finally, the Support Vector Regression model is used to fuse the two features and the objective quality score could be obtained. The proposed method is compared with seven existing 3D mesh quality assessment methods. Experimental results on the LIRIS_EPFL_GenPurpose Database show that the PLCC and SROCC of the proposed method are increased by 13.60% and 6.23%, compared with the best results of the seven representative methods.

In this scenario online learning seems the main way out, thanks to the possibility of adapting to changes in a smart and flexible way. Nevertheless, standard machine learning approaches usually suffer when confronted with massive amounts of data and when asked to work online. Online learning requires a high training and testing speed, all the more in place recognition, where a continuous flow of data comes from one or more cameras. In this paper we follow the Support Vector Machines-based approach of Pronobis et al., proposing an improvement that we call Online Independent Support Vector Machines. This technique exploits linear independence in the image feature space to incrementally keep the size of the learning machine remarkably small while retaining the accuracy of a standard machine.

Depend on these main findings correlated with MS, we attempt to develop an EEG based classification system to automatically classify subject's MS level and find the suitable EEG features via common feature extraction, selection and classifiers technologies in this study. If we can find the regulations and then develop an algorithm to predict MS occurring, it would be a great benefit to construct a safe and comfortable environment for all drivers and passengers when they are cruising in the car, bus, ship or airplane. EEG is one of the best methods for monitoring the brain dynamics induced by motion-sickness because of its high temporal resolution and portability. After collecting the EEG signals and subjective MS level in a realistic driving environment, we first do the data pre-processing part including ICA, component clustering analysis and time-frequency analysis. Then we adopt three common feature extractions and two feature selections (FE/FS) technologies to extract or select the correlated features such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminate analysis (LDA), nonparametric weighted feature extraction (NWFE), forward feature selections (FFS) and backward feature selections (BFS) and feed the feature maps into three classifiers (Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classifier (ML), k-Nearest-Neighbor Classifier (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)). Experimental results show that classification performance of all our proposed technologies can be reached almost over 95%.

Comparatively, RF yielded plausible results only for E. dunii (R\u00b2 of 0.79; RMSE of 7.18 t\u00b7ha\u207b\u00b9). We demonstrated that although the two statistical methods were able to predict biomass accurately, RF produced weaker results as compared to SGB when applied to combined species dataset.

However, the sheer volume of the data makes it extremely difficult to browse and find required information. Organizing the video and locating required information effectively and efficiently presents a great challenge to the video retrieval community. This demands a tool which would break down the video into smaller and manageable units called shots. Traditional shot detection methods use pixel difference, histograms, or temporal slice analysis to detect hard-cuts and gradual transitions. However, systems need to be robust to sequences that contain dramatic illumination changes, shaky camera effects, and special effects such as fire, explosion, and synthetic screen split manipulations. Traditional systems produce false positives for these cases; i.e., they claim a shot break when there is none. We propose a shot detection system which reduces false positives even if all the above effects are cumulatively present in one sequence. Similarities between successive frames are computed by finding the correlation and is further analyzed using a wavelet transformation. A final filtering step is to use a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM).

However, a bias with soft-biometrics features has been detected. This bias reduces recognition performance when gender is used. Feature selection for gender classification from face images is a difficult problem since faces contain symmetrical and redundant features. We argue that traditional methods, based on mutual information using pairs of features to estimate the relevance and redundancy among features, fail to select the right set of features in cases where there are strong spatial correlations among features, which is the case with facial images. In this paper, a new method is proposed fusing a filter and a wrapper to measure the relationships among image features, and to select feature clusters based on mutual information for gender classification. We applied this method on nine face datasets using an SVM classifier. We were able to achieve 98.2% correct gender classification in the testing partition using the UND, 95.56% with the Morph II, 98.33% on the LFW, and 98.66% on celebA databases.

In this paper, we propose the use of a hydraulic bed sensor for sleep stage classification. Our main motivation of using the bed sensor is to provide a non-invasive, in-home monitoring system, which tracks the changes in health conditions of the subjects over time. Regular polysomnography data from a Sleep Lab have been used as the ground truth, with the focus on three sleep stages, namely, awake, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep (NREM). A total of 74 features including heart rate variability (HRV) features, respiratory rate variability (RV) features, and linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCC) were extracted from the bed sensor data. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification methods were applied to these features. Our results show accuracy as good as 85% with 0.74 kappa, in the detection of these three sleep stages.

However, the tropical vegetation of the Amazon rainforest considerably limits the number of outcrops available for systematic geological mapping. Therefore, the use of remote data such as airborne geophysics and remote sensing is essential to provide a reliable geological map. The airborne magnetometric data to define lithological units and its boundaries is a challenge, especially in regions with low magnetic latitude and/or remanent magnetization. In this work, we proposed an approach using Magnetization Vector Inversion (MVI) to map the distribution of the magnetic susceptibility, in order to replace techniques such as pole reduction and total gradient. We applied the Random Forest algorithm (supervised Machine Learning algorithm) to recognize patterns in remote data and improve the current mapped lithological units. With 1400 training samples (2.5% of the total samples), we produced two Predictive lithological maps: a first with remote data only and a second with remote data and spatial coordinates. We evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each Predictive map, and we conclude that both maps need to be analyzed together for the refinement of the current geological map.

The aim of this study is to compare PTFs with the use of the nonlinear regression (NLR) and support vector machine (SVM) methods, as well as to choose predictor properties for estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks). Ks was determined in direct laboratory experiments on monoliths of agrosoddy-podzolic soil (Umbric Albeluvisol Abruptic, WRB, 2006) and calculated using PTFs based on the NLR and SVM methods. Six classes of predictor properties were tested for the calculated prognosis: Ks-1 (predictors: the sand, silt, and clay contents); Ks-2 (sand, silt, clay, and soil density); Ks-3 (sand, silt, clay, soil organic matter); Ks-4 (sand, silt, clay, soil density, organic matter); Ks-5 (clay, soil density, organic matter); and Ks-6 (sand, clay, soil density, organic matter). The efficiency of PTFs was determined by comparison with experimental values using the root mean square error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R2). The results showed that the RMSE for SVM is smaller than the RMSE for NLR in predicting Ks for all classes of PTFs. The SVM method has advantages over the NLR method in terms of simplicity and range of application for predicting Ks using PTFs.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3103/S0147687418030079", "venue": "Moscow University Soil Science Bulletin", "journal": "Moscow University Soil Science Bulletin", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2893797253", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["129269167", "58698067", "129385160", "17823664", "133645388", "129766388", "132580406", "23948730", "129468939", "6421994", "52219815"], "inbound_citations": ["210905240"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134827588"}

In line with recent trends in statistical learning of structured natural language input, we use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification framework deploying tree kernels. We then propose tree transformations and decorations, as a methodology for modeling complex linguistic phenomena in highly multi-dimensional feature spaces. We develop a general purpose tree engineering framework, which enables us to transcend the typically complex and laborious process of feature engineering. We build kernel based classifiers for two token labeling tasks: fine-grained event recognition, and lexical answer type detection in questions. For both, we show that in comparison with a corresponding linear kernel SVM, our method of using tree kernels improves recognition, thanks to appropriately engineering tree structures for use by the tree kernel.

It is extremely problematic to discover an optimal group of rendezvous points and decide the trajectory of mobile sink.

However, there is little understanding of what underlying principles are responsible for the results. This thesis investigates the effects of damage in networks that make familiar patterns of activity into stable \"attractors\", in order to identify the computational principles that enable them to reproduce specific neuropsychological phenomena. ::: In a series of simulations, networks are trained to pronounce written words via a simplified representation of their semantics. Under damage, the networks produce a distribution of visual and semantic errors similar to that of patients with \"deep dyslexia.\" Further simulations replicate other characteristics of these patients: additional error types, better performance on concrete vs. abstract words, preserved lexical decision, and greater confidence in visual vs. semantic errors. A range of network architectures and learning procedures produce qualitatively similar results, demonstrating that the layout of attractors giving rise to the error pattern depends more on the unstructured nature of the task than on the architectural details that enable the attractors to develop. ::: Additional simulations address issues in relearning after damage: the speed of recovery, degree of generalization, and strategies for optimizing recovery. Relative differences in the degree of generalization for different lesion locations is due to the amount of structure in the subtasks performed by parts of the network. ::: In the related domain of object recognition, a network augmented with short-term correlational weights is trained to generate semantic representations of objects from high-level visual representations. Under damage, the network exhibits the complex semantic and perseverative effects of patients with a visual naming disorder known as \"optic aphasia.\" The greater structure in mapping visual to semantic representations for object vs. words explains why the errors of optic aphasics are predominantly semantic rather than visual. ::: Taken together, the results of the thesis demonstrate that the breakdown and recovery of behavior in lesioned attractor networks reproduces specific neuropsychological phenomena by virtue of the way the structure of a task shapes the layout of attractors.", "year": 1991, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "45039804", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["143645225", "16171263", "140930411", "210337041", "197658202", "207056183", "19929736", "16710884", "58779360", "202927997", "40228950", "682951", "59836803", "14521178", "15118845", "209396626", "142546535", "18121997", "58788111", "59705684", "146152365", "140855198", "62159520", "24120691"], "inbound_citations": ["198208", "18339624", "16495386", "10764579", "16894652", "9556257", "12557502", "16794832"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2850849"}

Past patterns of LULC and LST were identified through the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and multi-spectral Landsat satellite images during 1987\u20132017 data period. The Cellular automata (CA) model and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were applied to simulate future (years 2032 and 2047) LULC and LST changes, respectively, using their past patterns. CA model was validated for the simulated and the estimated LULC for the year 2017 with an overall Kappa (K) value of 0.77 using validation modules in QGIS and IDRISI software. ANN method was validated by correlating the observed and simulated LST for the year 2017 with correlation coefficient (R) and Mean Square Error (MSE) values of 0.81 and 0.51, respectively. Results indicated a change in the LULC and LST for instance the built-up area was increased by 4.43% while agricultural area and bare soil were reduced by 2.74% and 4.42%, respectively, from 1987 to 2017. The analysis of LST for different LULC classes indicated that built-up area has highest temperature followed by barren, agriculture and vegetation surfaces.

This relationship is improved without using a complicated, human generated model. Two learning phases are distinguished. First the learning controller is trained (or initialised) in a supervised way by a suboptima) controller. Then a reinforcement learning phase follows. We followed a connectionist approach. The controller consists of two neural networks: (i) the policy network, and (ii) the exploration network. On-line robotic exploration plays a crucial role in obtaining a better policy. Optionally, this architecture can be extended with a third network: the reinforcement network. The learning controller is implemented on a CAD-based contact force simulator. In contrast with most other related work, the learning controller works in 3 dimensions with 6 degrees of freedom.

Many resources have catalogued molecular alterations in known PID genes along with their associated clinical and immunological phenotypes.

We have recently developed a platform designated Resource of Asian PDIs, which hosts information pertaining to molecular alterations, protein-protein interaction networks, mouse studies and microarray gene expression profiling of all known PID genes. Using this resource as a discovery tool, we describe the development of an algorithm for prediction of candidate PID genes. Using a support vector machine learning approach, we have predicted 1442 candidate PID genes using 69 binary features of 148 known PID genes and 3162 non-PID genes as a training data set. The power of this approach is illustrated by the fact that six of the predicted genes have recently been experimentally confirmed to be PID genes. The remaining genes in this predicted data set represent attractive candidates for testing in patients where the etiology cannot be ascribed to any of the known PID genes.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2780952", "pubmed_id": "19801557", "doi": "10.1093/dnares/dsp019", "venue": "DNA Research: An International Journal for Rapid Publication of Reports on Genes and Genomes", "journal": "DNA Research: An International Journal for Rapid Publication of Reports on Genes and Genomes", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2137621059,2185962682", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["20787581", "28061756", "2698102", "10039376", "5422060", "40759645", "9600286", "9805443", "12007644", "2154417", "908200", "1026081", "11220462", "7943197", "31878160", "2744066", "15848812", "18581374", "18868540", "31122152", "1576811", "1817279", "15207307", "7526834", "18010955", "13639064", "11433098", "6383337", "10599219", "6338253", "37437178", "16497231", "6317633", "15830391", "14791297", "14641265", "819570", "75525491", "22371689", "73388526", "75510716", "21917114", "17529682", "24577735", "10654092", "6311248", "15003973", "52805223", "11343725", "205357050", "21256707", "27276757", "12337119", "13960305", "21287878", "7922637", "5123195", "4391697", "6895360"], "inbound_citations": ["3591154", "26896172", "87603110", "17009886", "14559429", "7269227", "195847500", "775192", "42421993", "51893225", "1531313", "15397879"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5812132"}

Furthermore, in order to accelerate the training process, an effective linear regression algorithm was used to solve the paired quadratic programming problems (QPPs) of the TSVR model involved.

Understanding the forces behind fire regime dynamics is essential to achieve effective wildfire management and policymaking. The current research belongs to a series of two manuscripts aimed at describing spatial-temporal dynamics of fire regime and its drivers in mainland Spain. In this work, we identified the main transitional pathways of fire regime zones between past (1974\u20131994) and current (1995\u20132015) conditions to identify the influence of the main wildfire drivers (demographic potential, climate trends, forest interfaces and topography). Our methodology combined Principal Component Analysis and Ward's hierarchical clustering to identify and spatialize homogenous regions of fire regime on the basis of the main fire regime features: number of fires, burned area, burnt area from lightning-caused fires, area affected by large fires (>100 ha) and seasonality. This procedure was replicated in current and past conditions to extract the most frequent combinations of fire regime typologies, eventually leading to a set of binary response variables (change versus persistence of fire regime). Finally, Random Forest regression was applied to estimate the explanatory performance of fire regime drivers for each transition path. Our results point to an overall decline in fire activity over most of the Spanish territory. The hinterlands and Mediterranean coast experienced the greatest decrease in fire activity. In contrast, winter activity has progressed in the North-western region. According to Random Forest outputs, demographic potential highlights as the main driver of fire regime change (both regressive and progressive), followed by climate dynamics (temperature and rainfall trends) and topographic features. In turn, Wildland-Agricultural Interface (WAI) and Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) were also behind several noticeable trajectories as is the case of winter fire progression (WAI) or moderate increase in fire incidence linked to human-caused fires (WUI).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135841", "venue": null, "journal": "Science of The Total Environment", "mag_id": "2990035512", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213076116"}

Although, coarse spatial resolution sensors provide frequent LST measurements, their applicability is rather limited for many applications. Downscaling methods are therefore applied to improve the spatial resolution of LST products. A number of Machine Learning (ML) methods have already been used in the LST downscaling studies. Nevertheless, the literature lacks a suitable inter-comparison of different ML methods, as well as the impact of the feature selection process on downscaling results. This study aims at comparing downscaled LST from 1 km daily MODIS LST product (MOD11A1) to 240 m using Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Temperature Sharpening (TsHARP) approaches with 11 predictor variables at a heterogeneous area in different seasons. In addition, by implementing a feature selection with the Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) method, the most important variables were selected and used as inputs of the models. The results were evaluated against the LST derived from Landsat-8 thermal imageries using a split window method, showing that all the ML methods perform well in LST downscaling (with an average RMSE = 2.5 and MAE = 1.74) with marginal differences, outperforming the TsHARP method (RMSE\u223c 3.02, MAE\u223c 2.19).

Consequently, the capability of learning algorithms to work with large amounts of data has become a crucial scientific and technological challenge for their practical applicability. Hence, it is no surprise that large-scale learning is currently drawing plenty of research effort in the machine learning research community. In this thesis, we focus on kernel methods, a theoretically sound and effective class of learning algorithms yielding nonparametric estimators. Kernel methods, in their classical formulations, are accurate and efficient on datasets of limited size, but do not scale up in a cost-effective manner. Recent research has shown that approximate learning algorithms, for instance random subsampling methods like Nystrom and random features, with time-memory-accuracy trade-off mechanisms are more scalable alternatives. In this thesis, we provide analyses of the generalization properties and computational requirements of several types of such approximation schemes. In particular, we expose the tight relationship between statistics and computations, with the goal of tailoring the accuracy of the learning process to the available computational resources. Our results are supported by experimental evidence on large-scale datasets and numerical simulations. We also study how large-scale learning can be applied to enable accurate, efficient, and reactive lifelong learning for robotics.

Promoter prediction is worthwhile not only for the detection of orphan genes but also for understanding the mechanisms that regulate gene expression. Promoter prediction therefore remains one of the primary challenges subjects in bioinformatics in the post-genome era. Many methods are used for promoter prediction, such as the presence of the CpG islands, sequence motifs of transcription factor binding sites, and the statistical and chemo- physical properties in the vicinity of transcription start sites. Among these strategies, we have focused on a method which employs wavelet analysis and support vector machine for promoter prediction. The wavelet analysis is based on localized wave packets characterized by both a range of frequency and a location. In our scheme, information from promoter and non-promoter regions is converted to wavelet space as a positive and a negative set, respectively, and the 2 sets are subsequently used to train a support vector machine. Finally, the support vector machine is utilized for promoter prediction.

In addition, it is time consuming, laborious and expensive to perform several experiments to obtain the refractive index of hemoglobin.

In this paper, we propose a novel Sparse Hidden-Dynamic Conditional Random Fields (SHDCRF) model for user intent learning from their search sessions. Through incorporating the proposed hidden state variables, SHDCRF aims to learn a substructure, i.e. a set of related hidden variables, for each intent label and they are used to model the intermediate dynamics between user intent labels and user behavioral variables. In addition, SHDCRF learns a sparse relation between the hidden variables and intent labels to make the hidden state variables explainable. Extensive experiment results, on real user search sessions from a popular commercial search engine show that the proposed SHDCRF model significantly outperforms in terms of intent prediction results that those classical solutions such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Latnet-Dynamic Conditional Random Field (LDCRF).", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1963405.1963411", "venue": "WWW", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2133071032", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207160045", "10872113", "1533857", "13875928", "12464433", "1165695", "11189229", "52874011", "1012366", "11452511", "1744924", "768352", "821981", "7522215", "207166250", "59831582", "18332366", "277918", "32800624", "8482989", "62486342", "7117722", "9389968", "27062746", "14036493", "1300961", "16719259", "709066", "10004430", "64084", "6038991", "15843983", "14352580", "1171329", "61775693", "38476", "5730904", "7027533"], "inbound_citations": ["13447852", "9921210", "2068844", "12523299", "3672821", "46920987", "13037163", "29153607", "16925174", "14992674", "16536028", "5087991", "14053283", "200607"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17013912"}

The proposed model aims not only at providing accurate predictions but most importantly it incorporates interesting and transparent biological patterns. When contrasted with the best-performing existing models, IMP-TYPE reduces the error rates of these methods by 19 and 34% for two out-of-sample tests performed on benchmark datasets. Our empirical evaluations also show that the proposed method provides even bigger improvements, i.e., 29 and 45% error rate reductions, when predictions are performed for sequences that share low (40%) identity with sequences from the training dataset. We also show that IMP-TYPE can be used in a standalone mode, i.e., it duplicates significant majority of correct predictions provided by other leading methods, while providing additional correct predictions which are incorrectly classified by the other methods. Our method computes predictions using a Support Vector Machine classifier that takes feature-based encoded sequence as its input. The input feature set includes hydrophobic AA pairs, which were selected by utilizing a consensus of three feature selection algorithms. The hydrophobic residues that build up the AA pairs used by our method are shown to be associated with the formation of transmembrane helices in a few recent studies concerning integral membrane proteins. Our study also indicates that Met and Phe display a certain degree of hydrophobicity, which may be more crucial than their polarity or aromaticity when they occur in the transmembrane segments. This conclusion is supported by a recent study on potential of mean force for membrane protein folding and a study of scales for membrane propensity of amino acids.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "18567007", "doi": "10.1002/jcc.21053", "venue": "Journal of computational chemistry", "journal": "Journal of computational chemistry", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2132581719", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "140109802"], "inbound_citations": ["214842315", "1054248", "26421355", "51606994", "1642376", "22490092", "3812514", "4008664", "202557088", "10007933", "5181175", "208632698", "48363240", "201641395", "12985469", "174798527", "28420498", "215600957", "18564654", "2190841", "843050", "215205964", "590014", "15534122", "7522629"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13249966"}

Careful microscopic examination of stained blood smear or bone marrow aspirate is still the most significant diagnostic methodology for initial AML screening and considered as the first step toward diagnosis. It is time-consuming and due to the elusive nature of the signs and symptoms of AML; wrong diagnosis may occur by pathologists. Therefore, the need for automation of leukemia detection has arisen. In this paper, an automatic technique for identification and detection of AML and its prevalent subtypes, i.e., M2-M5 is presented. At first, microscopic images are acquired from blood smears of patients with AML and normal cases. After applying image preprocessing, color segmentation strategy is applied for segmenting white blood cells from other blood components and then discriminative features, i.e., irregularity, nucleus-cytoplasm ratio, Hausdorff dimension, shape, color, and texture features are extracted from the entire nucleus in the whole images containing multiple nuclei. Images are classified to cancerous and noncancerous images by binary support vector machine (SVM) classifier with 10-fold cross validation technique.

We devised a deep generative model that consists of an auto-encoder as generator along with one discriminator that are trained to embed the message while, an exclusive extractor network with an audio discriminator is trained fundamentally to extract the hidden message from the encoded host signal. The encoded image is subjected to few common attacks and it is established that the message signal can not be hindered making the proposed method robust towards blurring, rotation, noise, and cropping.

A stochastic logic program consists of a set of labelled clauses p:C where p is in the interval [0,1] and C is a first-order range-restricted definite clause. This paper summarises the syntax, distributional semantics and proof techniques for SLPs and then discusses how a standard Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system, Progol, has been modified to support learning of SLPs. The resulting system 1) finds an SLP with uniform probability labels on each definition and near-maximal Bayes posterior probability and then 2) alters the probability labels to further increase the posterior probability. Stage 1) is implemented within CProgol4.5, which differs from previous versions of Progol by allowing user-defined evaluation functions written in Prolog. It is shown that maximising the Bayesian posterior function involves finding SLPs with short derivations of the examples. Search pruning with the Bayesian evaluation function is carried out in the same way as in previous versions of CProgol.

However, these areas are being worked on separately. CADe systems do not present the radiological characteristics of tumors, and CADx systems do not detect nodules and do not have good levels of automation. As a result, these systems are not yet widely used in clinical settings. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The purpose of this article is to develop a new system for detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules on CT images, grouping them into a single system for the identification and characterization of the nodules to improve the level of automation. The article also presents as contributions: the use of Watershed and Histogram of oriented Gradients (HOG) techniques for distinguishing the possible nodules from other structures and feature extraction for pulmonary nodules, respectively. For the diagnosis, it is based on the likelihood of malignancy allowing more aid in the decision making by the radiologists. A rule-based classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been used to eliminate false positives. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The database used in this research consisted of 420 cases obtained randomly from LIDC-IDRI. The segmentation method achieved an accuracy of 97 % and the detection system showed a sensitivity of 94.4 % with 7.04 false positives per case. Different types of nodules (isolated, juxtapleural, juxtavascular and ground-glass) with diameters between 3 mm and 30 mm have been detected. For the diagnosis of malignancy our system presented ROC curves with areas of: 0.91 for nodules highly unlikely of being malignant, 0.80 for nodules moderately unlikely of being malignant, 0.72 for nodules with indeterminate malignancy, 0.67 for nodules moderately suspicious of being malignant and 0.83 for nodules highly suspicious of being malignant. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: From our preliminary results, we believe that our system is promising for clinical applications assisting radiologists in the detection and diagnosis of lung cancer.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5002110", "pubmed_id": "26759159", "doi": "10.1186/s12938-015-0120-7", "venue": "BioMedical Engineering OnLine", "journal": "BioMedical Engineering OnLine", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2234650031", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["9049047", "14376276", "23334038", "22910811", "11397802", "11892094", "13969096", "18411883", "16138959", "27619723", "36656897", "6031648", "195725540", "6349249", "15467945", "13944993", "21883326", "2629994", "15436061", "19634450", "24724486", "206590483", "144828484", "42781475", "8966205", "10659969", "60577818", "206787478", "19121719", "59263061", "59718844", "26073767", "8014584"], "inbound_citations": ["209265115", "29005281", "7847989", "22730346", "8370324", "208745227", "49296490", "215480222", "215090391", "52343824", "3709780", "58006617", "53009034", "3573021", "155101818", "196349344", "49410826", "199474487", "215429281", "204232171", "275845", "61510422", "4753723", "3881292", "53669877", "46927976", "45966690", "7954650", "67375667", "3880285", "208403077", "3411610", "76660407", "211226851", "52071843", "29295120", "20937299", "209460366", "44123271", "52988837", "159041422", "10153772", "208880820", "203838022", "17602963", "51891954", "207962731", "12663102", "49409434"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15629736"}

This paper proposed two new methods of extracting regional urban extents using DMSP-OLS data, MODIS NDVI data and Land Surface Temperature (LST) data. MODIS NDVI data were used to reduce the over-glow effect, since urban areas generally have lower vegetation index values than the surrounding areas (e.g. agricultural and forest areas). On the other hand, urban areas generally show higher surface temperatures than the surrounding areas. Since urban area is the only class of interest, a one-class classifier, the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), was selected as the classifier. The first method is classification of different data combinations for mapping: (1) OLS data and NDVI data, (2) OLS data and LST data, and (3) OLS data, NDVI data and LST data combined. The second one is a morphological reconstruction based method which combines classification results from OLS plus NDVI data and from OLS plus LST data. In the morphological reconstruction based method, the classification result using OLS and NDVI data was used as a mask image, while the classification result using OLS and LST data was used as a marker image. The north China area covering 14 provinces was selected as study area. Classification results from Landsat TM/ETM+ data from selected areas with different development levels were used as reference data to validate the proposed methods. The results show that the proposed methods effectively reduced the over-glow effect caused by DSMP-OLS data and achieved better results compared to the results from the traditional thresholding technique.

It is gaining greater attention with the surge in the volume of on-line data available. Classical algorithms like k-NN (k-nearest neighbor), SVM (Support Vector Machine) and their variations have been observed to yield only reasonable results in addressing the problem, leaving enough room for further improvement. A class of algorithms commonly referred to as Sparse Methods has been emerged recently from compressive sensing and found numerous effective applications in many areas of data analysis and image processing. Sparse Methods as a tool for text analysis is an alley that is largely unexplored rigorously. This paper presents exploration of sparse representation-based methods for text classification. Based on the success of sparse representation based methods in different areas of data analysis, we intuitively hypothesized that it should work well on text classification problems as well. This paper empirically reinforces the hypothesis by testing the method on Reuters and WebKB data sets. The empirical results on Reuters and WebKB benchmark data show that it can outperform classical classification algorithms like SVM and k-NN. It has been observed that obtaining the basis of representation and sparse codes are computationally costly operations affecting the performance of the system. We also propose a class-wise dictionary refinement algorithm and dynamic dictionary selection algorithm to make sparse coding faster. The addition of dictionary refinement to the classification system not only reduces the time taken for sparse coding but also gives improved classification accuracy.

A question arises: Can beauty be learnt by machines? Every individual have different concept of facial beauty. Somebody can be attracted by someone but might not be by another person. In recent past, many psychologists, neurologists and other scientists have done tremendous work in this area. This work presents a study on the facial attractiveness in a machine learning context. Various techniques applied on SCUT-FBP facial images dataset for learning the facial attractiveness. From the results, we showed that facial beauty is a universal concept that a machine can learn. A model is designed that learns from the facial images with their attractiveness ratings and produced human like evaluation of attractiveness ratings. We extracted features from images and normalized all the features value. After that we proposed some techniques of machine learning like Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision tree and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). An accuracy of 80% was obtained using KNN and 86% was obtained using ANN for multiclass classification. Accuracies of 61% and 62% were reported by SVM using linear kernel and RBF kernel respectively.

Computational prioritization approaches aim to support target selection by ranking candidate targets in the context of a given disease. We propose a novel target prioritization approach, GuiltyTargets, which relies on deep network representation learning of a genome-wide protein-protein interaction network annotated with disease-specific differential gene expression and uses positive-unlabeled machine learning for candidate ranking. We evaluated our approach on six diseases of different types (cancer, metabolic, neurodegenerative) within a 10 times repeated 5-fold stratified cross-validation and achieved AUROC values between 0.92 - 0.94, significantly outperforming a previous approach, which relies on manually engineered topological features. Moreover, we showed that GuiltyTargets allows for target repositioning across related disease areas. Applying GuiltyTargets to Alzheimer\u2019s disease resulted into a number of highly ranked candidates that are currently discussed as targets in the literature. Interestingly, one (COMT) is also the target of an approved drug (Tolcapone) for Parkinson\u2019s disease, highlighting the potential for target repositioning of our method. Availability The GuiltyTargets Python package is available on PyPI and all code used for analysis can be found under the MIT License at https://github.com/GuiltyTargets. Author summary Many drug candidates fail in clinical trials due to low efficacy. One of the reasons is the choice of the wrong target protein, i.e. perturbation of the protein does not effectively modulate the disease phenotype on a molecular level. In consequence many patients do not demonstrate a clear response to the drug candidate. Traditionally, targets are selected based on evidence from the literature and follow-up experiments. However, this process is very labor intensive and often biased by subjective choices. Computational tools could help a more rational and unbiased choice of target proteins and thus increase the chance of drug discovery programs. In this work we propose a novel machine learning based method for target candidate ranking. The method (GuiltyTargets) captures properties of known targets to learn a ranking of candidates. GuiltyTargets compares favorably against existing machine learning based target prioritization methods and allowed us to propose novel targets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/521161", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2910120163", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["6174498", "5496647", "24640493", "205864305", "215620492", "4952738", "8581515", "3511282", "19072686", "15690048", "7662926", "49865375", "214853795", "14101836", "130784", "16942668", "215370396", "2245601", "3943447", "429801", "52185440", "3848317", "44078519", "18837723", "18952026", "52328975", "196641374", "205475729", "13793454", "25322912", "15734106", "8307297", "4088227", "123815955", "49472030", "11016714", "15617300", "6112893", "11524978", "215644316", "45174121", "35553331", "5959482", "10659969"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91886118"}

{"paper_id": "129131244", "title": "Empirical Modeling of 3D Plasma Pressure and Magnetic Field Structures in the Earth\u2019s Plasma Sheet", "authors": [{"first": "Chao", "middle": [], "last": "Yue", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Ions and electrons in the nightside magnetosphere, driven by the dawn-to-dusk convection electric field, flow earthward and are energized. As a result, plasma pressure is enhanced and magnetic field configuration becomes more stretched, forming the necessary conditions for the development of substorms. Determining the physical processes leading to the changes of the plasma and magnetic field configurations, as well as the processes resulting from the configuration variations, is thus crucial to understanding substorms. Accurate evaluation of these processes, including formation of field-aligned currents (FACs), isotropization by current sheet scattering, and some localized instabilities that may responsible for substorm onset, relies on knowing the realistic 3 dimensional (3D) magnetic field configurations, which cannot be provided by current available empirical models with sufficient accuracy or as a function of growth phase development. Therefore, we have developed a 3D force-balanced empirical substorm growth phase magnetic field model, which allows us to investigate the evolution of these configurations during the substorm growth phase and evaluate the physical processes governing the configuration changes. Here, we first statistically analyzed the growth phase pressures using Geotail and THEMIS data, and identified three primary factors causing the growth phase pressure change: solar wind dynamic pressure (PSW), energy loading, and sunspot number. We then constructed a 2D equatorial empirical pressure model and an error model in the near Earth plasma sheet (r \u2264 20 RE) using the Support Vector Regression Machine (SVRM) with the three factors as input. The model predicts the plasma sheet pressure accurately with median errors of 5%, and the predicted pressure gradients agree reasonably well with observed gradients obtained from two-probe measurements. The model shows that pressure increases linearly as PSW increases, while the pressure responses to energy loading and sunspot number are nonlinear. From these model pressure distributions, we were able to establish a realistic 3D growth phase magnetic field configurations that satisfy the physical constraint of force balance with the plasma pressures using a 3D magnetic field model [Zaharia, 2008]. The force-balanced magnetic field configuration shows that Bz decreases in the near Earth region and increases in the tail due to an increasing perpendicular current peaking at the earthward edge of the plasma sheet. The current peak moves towards the Earth as energy loading increases, indicating earthward penetrating of the plasma sheet. Meanwhile, positive dBz/dz is found to develop late in the growth phase, but a Bz minimum at the equator does not form, unlike the prediction by Saito et al. [2010]. The perpendicular current peaks off the equator plane and its peak moves towards the equatorial plane as the growth phase evolves, indicating the thinning of current sheet. In addition, there are typical Region-1 FACs around 12 to 20 RE at the beginning of substorm growth phase and they gradually evolve to Region-2 FACs in the late growth phase with their earthward boundary moving to smaller r. The model magnetic fields agree quantitatively well with observed fields. The magnetic field is substantially more stretched under higher PSW while the dependence on sunspot number is non-linear and less substantial. The excellent agreements between the model results and observations give us confidence that the realistic model can be used at the first time to understand the pressure and magnetic field changes observed during a substorm event by providing accurate evaluations of the effects of energy loading and PSW, as well as the temporal and spatial effects along a spacecraft trajectory. By applying our modeling to a substorm event, we found that the equatorward moving of proton aurora during the growth phase is mainly due to continuous stretching of magnetic field lines, and the ballooning instability is more favorable at late growth phase around midnight tail where there is a localized plasma beta peak. Furthermore, the equatorial mapping of the breakup auroral arc is X ~ \u201314 RE near midnight, coinciding with the location of the maximum growth rate for ballooning instability.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1737221441", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129131244"}

Spatial analysis shows that there is a clear distinction between coastal ( 100 km) samples in their variance and that this variance is mirrored in the sodium concentration, suggesting an important but highly variable contribution from seaspray. We present two 87Sr/86Sr maps at 25 km \u00d7 25 km scale: one based solely on the measured data using a classical kriging approach and one based on a Random Forest model using complementary GEMAS data to predict the strontium isotope composition at the remaining 3000+ GEMAS sampling locations, including appropriate uncertainty assessment. Using a forensic Bayesian likelihood ratio approach, a tool was developed in R to create provenancing likelihood ratio maps. The maps delineate areas of high and low likelihood and allow investigators to direct their resources to areas of interest.

These datasets contain many pieces of data (features) which are irrelevant and redundant to the problem being studied, which makes analysis quite difficult. However, techniques from the domain of machine learning and data mining are well suited to combating these difficulties. Techniques like feature selection (choosing an optimal subset of features for subsequent analysis by removing irrelevant or redundant features) and classifiers (used to build inductive models in order to classify unknown instances) can assist researchers in working with such difficult datasets. Unfortunately, many practitioners of bioinformatics do not have the machine learning knowledge to choose the correct techniques in order to achieve good classification results. If the choices could be simplified or predetermined then it would be easier to apply the techniques. This study is a comprehensive analysis of machine learning techniques on twenty-five bioinformatics datasets using six classifiers, and twenty-four feature rankers. We analyzed the factors at each of four feature subset sizes chosen for being large enough to be effective in creating inductive models but small enough to be of use for further research. Our results shows that Random Forest with 100 trees is the top performing classifier and that the choice of feature ranker is of little importance as long as feature selection occurs. Statistical analysis confirms our results.

To solve these problems, a novel architecture called CNN-ELM has been proposed here. Its core architecture is based on a local image (local receptive field) version of the ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) adopting random feature learning. Using MATLAB 2015a, classification experiments using the raw image data as input, show a comparable or mostly better classification performance compared to the BP trained CNN, with its training speed up to 200 times faster on MNIST, NORB, and CIFAR-10 datasets.

This technique measures the Received Signal Strength (RSS) from APs at each indicated location to construct fingerprints. However, the collection of fingerprints is notoriously laborious and needs to be repeatedly updated due to the changes of environments. To reduce the workload of fingerprinting, we apply Deep Belief Networks to unlabeled RSS measurements to extract hidden features of the fingerprints, and thereby minimize the collection of fingerprints.

Our algorithm is based on the observation that related categories might be learnable using only a small subset of shared relevant features. To find these features we propose to train classifiers jointly with a shared regularization penalty that minimizes the total number of features involved in the approximation. ::: To solve the joint sparse approximation problem we develop an optimization algorithm whose time and memory complexity is O( n log n) with n being the number of parameters of the joint model. ::: We conduct experiments on news-topic and keyword prediction image classification tasks. We test our method in two settings: a transfer learning and multitask learning setting and show that in both cases leveraging knowledge from related categories can improve performance when training data per category is scarce.

In this work, we propose a method to detect the presence and type of gamakas, in a data-driven manner, from the annotated symbolic music alone. We propose features based on the notes of the song for these tasks. These features are used as inputs to a Random Forest Classifier. We digitise 80 songs from a well known reference book of Karnatic music to create a dataset consisting roughly 30000 notes. We train the classifier on around 12000 notes and test on roughly 18000 notes. From our experiments, the accuracy values obtained for predicting gamaka presence and type are ~77% and ~70%, respectively. These are significantly better than random classification accuracies. We also analyse the importance of neighbourhood of notes for the detection and classification of gamakas. It is observed that the best accuracy is obtained for gamaka presence detection when a both-sided neighbourhood of size three is considered; and best accuracy for gamaka type prediction is obtained with a both-sided neighbourhood of size one.

In particular it discusses architectural and algorithmic considerations in the light of the demanding requirements for robustness and increased system longevity. The architectural issues covered reflect recent developments in Object Technology which has demonstrated the benefits of a componentised view of systems, where observation of interface standards can provide for a 'plug and play' approach to system development and evolution. The algorithmic considerations concentrate on the significant progress in the machine learning field specifically looking at combining popular Knowledge Based Systems(KBSs) approaches with those developed in the area of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Adaptive systems promise resistance to change through the modification of internal models as a result of direct experience of the problem domain, and can, under certain conditions, behave robustly in unseen situations. The engineering of Mission Management Knowledge Based processes for the command of Multiple Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles(MIAVs) concerns the coordination of elements of a distributed system so as to generate coherent behaviour. As such the techniques apply to the management and control of envisaged civil information and automation systems in public utilities, transportation and manufacturing as well as military command and control. The ever increasing demand for cost effectiveness, project efficiency and increasing productivity resulting from open competition is resulting in greater demand for coherent, systems solutions for bespoke large scale projects, such as major building construction, air traffic control and road management systems. These integrated systems are characterised by high capital value and extended life time, which together raise a requirement for evolution in system capability and the acceptance of change as an inherent characteristic of system infrastructure. The acceptance of change implies the need for a rigorous approach to the analysis and design of these systems which emphasises the achievement of modularity. In addition, since these systems often are required to operate in dynamic large, complex, uncertain, unstructured, non-benign environments without human intervention, there is a requirement for an intelligent adaptive ability which can react to environmental dynamics. Adaptive systems are more resistant to system and environmental changes potentially resulting in significant cost saving though increased operational life. The engineering of Mission Management systems for Multiple Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles(MIAVs) in particular and the management problem domain in general places heavy reliance on human decision making and supervision. Computerised management systems have been difficult to introduce primarily as a result of inadequacies in the technology. This is, in part, due to difficulties with describing models of the domain with sufficient precision. Experts in management have a good 'feel' for problems in the domain but, despite being effective managers, find it difficult to express their knowledge in anything but an approximate, vague, rule of thumb way. This conflicts with computer systems requirements which need a precise and complete description of domain relationships. Robotic computerised management solutions traditionally involve the Knowledge Based Planning(KBP) of activities over time and their monitoring during execution. This research extends KBP to approximate rule based systems to support initialisation from expert knowledge, while supporting adaption to fine tune approximate rule sets to better describe domain relationships. This approach takes advantage of expressible human expertise while compensating for inaccuracy, ignorance and incompleteness by supporting adaption, giving systems increased resistance to change and therefore greater longevity. Advantage is taken of recent developments in the use of approximate rule based models in the initialisation of adaptive control algorithms, specifically Neurofuzzy algorithms which can tune an approximate model to reflect arbitrary process relationships. Neurofuzzy Networks not only have the well understood adaptive advantages of Associative Memory Networks but also can be initialised with symbolic fuzzy linguistic rules improving their transparency, and thus aiding in system development and maintainability. This work has, in part, been based on research undertaken in the Advanced Systems Research Group (now the Image, Speech and Intelligent Systems Research Group) on an ESPRIT II project PANORAMA (Perception And Navigation fOR Autonomous Mobile Applications) which ended October 1993. The principle integration testbed was a Mercedes 4-wheel-drive vehicle REMI, additional smaller laboratory based robots were used for local system integration and testing, whilst the developed final demonstration was performed on a tracked drilling machine, owned by TAMROCK (Finland). The drilling machine was required to accurately navigate through an unstructured environment, the intention being to perform drilling operations at various drill sites with a location accuracy of +/-5cm. The 10MECU EU Esprit II CIM project represented a major component in the EU research strategy to address automation problems in its industrial base.

However, in spite of its competitiveness, SVM suffers from scalability problems which drastically worsens its performance in terms of memory requirements and execution time. As a consequence, there is a strong emergence of approaches for supporting SVM in efficiently addressing the aforementioned problems without affecting its classification capabilities. In this scenario, methods for Training Set Selection (TSS) represent a suitable and consolidated pre-processing technique to compute a reduced but representative training dataset, and improve SVM\u2019s scalability without deprecating its classification accuracy. Recently, TSS has been formulated as an optimization problem characterized by two objectives (the classification accuracy and the reduction rate) and solved through the application of evolutionary algorithms. However, so far, all the evolutionary approaches for TSS have been based on a so-called multi-objective a priori technique, where multiple objectives are aggregated together into a single objective through a weighted combination. This paper proposes to apply, for the first time, a Pareto-based multi-objective optimization approach to the TSS problem in order to explicitly deal with both its objectives and offer a better trade-off between SVM\u2019s classification and reduction performance. The benefits of the proposed approach are validated by a set of experiments involving well-known datasets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Database Repository.

A genetic algorithm (GA) was implemented to optimize the parameters cost, epsilon, and gamma used in SVM. Several R packages, namely, \u201ce1071,\u201d \u201cGA,\u201d and \u201craster,\u201d were implemented in R in order to use SVM and GA, whereas a geographic information system was utilized to process spatial data and create the continuous surface. In order to evaluate the developed methodology, the Alfeios water basin, Peloponnesus, Greece, was selected as an appropriate test site. Based on the available intensity\u2013duration\u2013frequency curves concerning 38 meteorological stations located within the research area, the daily extreme rainfall value for a 5-year return period was estimated, which served as the depended variable. The model had as independent variables, the longitude, latitude, elevation, slope angle, and slope aspect of the meteorological stations, the minimum, mean and maximum elevation, the mean slope angle, and the mean slope aspect within a radius of 5 km around the stations, the distance of each station from the coastline. The results of a basic statistical analysis revealed that the elevation variables were highly correlated, with values between 0.83 and 0.93. The results of a basic statistical analysis revealed that the elevation variables were highly correlated, with values between 0.82 and 0.93. Also, the analysis revealed that the most important variables among the 1 variables were longitude, distance from the coastline, mean slope aspect, within a 5-km radius and elevation. The performance of the methodology was evaluated using three standard statistical evaluation criteria, the root mean squared error (RMSE), the r square (r2) and the mean squared error (MSE), applied to the study area, and showed good performance. The outcomes of the SVM-GA model were compared with the results of a multilinear regression analysis. The optimized SVM-GA model achieved higher predictive accuracy, with RMSE, r2, and MSE values of 6.35, 0.63, and 40.31, respectively.

Although LMS algorithm has been considered to be a popular method of system identification but it has been seen in many situations that accurate system identification is not achieved by employing this technique. On the other hand, artificial neural network (ANN) has been chosen as a suitable alternative approach to nonlinear system identification due to its good function approximation capabilities i.e. ANNs are capable of generating complex mapping between input and output spaces. Thus, ANNs can be employed for modeling of complex dynamical systems with reasonable degree of accuracy. The use of computers for direct digital control highlights the recent trend toward more effective and efficient heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) control methodologies. The HVAC field has stressed the importance of self learning in building control systems and has encouraged further studies in the integration of optimal control and other advanced techniques into the formulation of such systems. In this thesis we describe the functional link artificial neural network (FLANN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with Back propagation (BP) and MLP with modified BP called the emotional BP and Neuro fuzzy approaches for the HVAC System Identification. The thesis describes different architectures together with learning algorithms to build neural network based nonlinear system identification schemes such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (FLANN) and ANFIS structures. In the case of MLP used as an identifier, different structures with regard to hidden layer selection and nodes in each layer have been considered. It may be noted that difficulty lies in choosing the number of hidden layers for achieving a correct topology of MLP neural identifier. To overcome this, in the FLANN identifier hidden layers are not required whereas the input is expanded by using trigonometric polynomials i.e. with cos(n\u03c0u) and sin(n\u03c0u), for n=0,1,2,\u2026.

As alternative for this problem, a recent technique called Active Testing characterized a dataset based on the pairwise performance differences between possible solutions.

Each new cross-validation test will contribute information to a better estimate of dataset similarity, and thus better predict which algorithms are most promising on the new dataset.

A large body of literature tells us which characteristics impact the most on their prognosis. However, the prediction of each disease course and then the establishment of a therapeutic plan and follow-up tailored to the patient is still very complicated. In order to address this issue, a multidisciplinary approach has become widely accepted, while the Multigene Signature Panels and the Nottingham Prognostic Index are still discussed options. The current technological resources permit to gather many data for each patient. Machine Learning (ML) allows us to draw on these data, to discover their mutual relations and to esteem the prognosis for the new instances. This study provides a primary evaluation of the application of ML to predict breast cancer prognosis. We analyzed 1021 patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer in our Institute and we included 610 of them. Three outcomes were chosen: cancer recurrence (both loco-regional and systemic) and death from the disease within 32 months. We developed two types of ML models for every outcome (Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine). Each ML algorithm was tested in accuracy (=95.29%-96.86%), sensitivity (=0.35-0.64), specificity (=0.97-0.99), and AUC (=0.804-0.916). These models might become an additional resource to evaluate the prognosis of breast cancer patients in our daily clinical practice.

To search the optimal parameters of LSSVM, this paper proposes a hybrid optimization algorithm which combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) with genetic algorithm. The main contributions are twofold: (1) A hybrid optimization method is proposed, which can skip the local optimal pitfall with less learning time by introducing a selection strategy, crossover and mutation operators into PSO; (2) the crossover and mutation operators are controlled by adaptive probability functions. The crossover and mutation probabilities increase when the population fitness is concentrated, and decrease when the fitness is dispersed.

This paper investigates the relevancy of PALSAR orthorectified FBD product at 50-m resolution for regional land cover classification by the support vector machines (SVM). Our test site is the Riau province, Sumatra island, Indonesia, known to hold vast area of natural peatland forest with an extreme biodiversity threatened by industrial deforestation. Since it is demonstrated the radiometric information (HH and HV channels) cannot be solely used to achieve a good classification, the spatial information in these orthorectified data is investigated. A new tool using the recursive feature elimination SVM-based process and the textural Haralick's parameters is introduced. The real contribution of textures within the land cover classification can be understood. A small set of textural parameters is determined at local scale while being optimal for the land cover discrimination. The SVM-based classifier is carried out across the whole Riau province and its results are compared with a Landsat-based estimation. The agreement is over 70% with six classes and 86% for the natural forest map. These results are remarkable since only one PALSAR FBD product is used and this assessment is performed on more than 40 million pixels.

We performed a metabolomics screening in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. ::: ::: ::: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN ::: Two targeted metabolomic assays were conducted on 40 serum samples of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 40 healthy controls. Multivariate methods and classification trees were performed. ::: ::: ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS ::: Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (SPLS-DA) was used to reduce the high dimensionality of a pancreatic cancer metabolomic dataset, differentiating between pancreatic cancer (PC) patients and healthy subjects.

This is especially true for gene expression profiling experiments, given the large number of genes involved and the small number of samples available. Random Forests (RF) is a popular and widely used approach to feature selection for such \"small n, large p problems.\" However, Random Forests suffers from instability, especially in the presence of noisy and/or unbalanced inputs.ResultsWe present RKNN-FS, an innovative feature selection procedure for \"small n, large p problems.\" RKNN-FS is based on Random KNN (RKNN), a novel generalization of traditional nearest-neighbor modeling. RKNN consists of an ensemble of base k-nearest neighbor models, each constructed from a random subset of the input variables. To rank the importance of the variables, we define a criterion on the RKNN framework, using the notion of support. A two-stage backward model selection method is then developed based on this criterion. Empirical results on microarray data sets with thousands of variables and relatively few samples show that RKNN-FS is an effective feature selection approach for high-dimensional data. RKNN is similar to Random Forests in terms of classification accuracy without feature selection. However, RKNN provides much better classification accuracy than RF when each method incorporates a feature-selection step. Our results show that RKNN is significantly more stable and more robust than Random Forests for feature selection when the input data are noisy and/or unbalanced. Further, RKNN-FS is much faster than the Random Forests feature selection method (RF-FS), especially for large scale problems, involving thousands of variables and multiple classes.ConclusionsGiven the superiority of Random KNN in classification performance when compared with Random Forests, RKNN-FS's simplicity and ease of implementation, and its superiority in speed and stability, we propose RKNN-FS as a faster and more stable alternative to Random Forests in classification problems involving feature selection for high-dimensional datasets.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3281073", "pubmed_id": "22093447", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-12-450", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2079177468", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["60993494", "89141", "2820171", "116763350", "33296374", "9627410", "839773", "40128549", "7580221", "115767936", "7055940", "122830292", "123722079", "6401887", "15245447", "8529157", "3640534", "12019872", "57831989", "120323383", "8329346", "1105917", "206420153", "50814231", "46226024", "23369575", "2469856", "6654614"], "inbound_citations": ["16936716", "17392198", "133950260", "17703732", "199391729", "213767562", "20133312", "211060348", "208632999", "6207917", "12150419", "6266327", "211297725", "53285984", "59233196", "26979219", "38613212", "18616885", "10203406", "211059536", "21253582", "8812166", "6654614", "21980555", "16797862", "15850826", "53934503", "202584128", "14126812", "45874468", "25906260", "208190566", "43520750", "214854825", "3836920", "196654660", "12406234", "11534580", "11605910", "10930474", "31361821", "3113573", "4220392", "14532363", "133400126", "55679595"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6654614"}

Kernel density estimation, using kernel bandwidths determined by k-nearest neighbor distances, is used to approximate the density of the underlying dataset. A scale is applied to the resulting kernel density estimate and a line integral is performed along its surface resulting in a density sensitive distance. This work tests the utility of the proposed density sensitive distance measurement using supervised learning. k-Nearest Neighbor classification using both the proposed density sensitive distance measurement and Euclidean distance are compared on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset and the MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits. For perspective, these classifiers are also compared to Support Vector Machine and Random Forests classifiers. Stratified 10-fold cross validation is used to determine the generalization error of each classifier. In all comparisons, k-Nearest Neighbor classification using the proposed density sensitive distance measurement had less generalization error than k-Nearest Neighbor classification using Euclidean distance.

The study areas selected for the present task were Larsemann Hills and Schirmacher Oasis, East Antarctica. RISAT-1 Fine Resolution STRIPMAP (FRS-1) mode data with 3-m spatial resolution was used in the present research attempt. In order to provide additional context to the amount of information in dual polarized RISAT-1 SAR data, a band HH+HV was introduced to make use of the original two polarizations. In addition to the data calibration, transformed divergence (TD) procedure was performed for class separability analysis to evaluate the quality of the statistics before image classification. For most of the class pairs the TD values were comparable, which indicated that the classes have good separability.

Glaucoma is a disease caused by neuro-degeneration of the optic nerve leading to blindness.

A key observation is that pixels spatially close to each other in HSI have probably the same signature, while pixels further away from each other in the space have a high probability of belonging to different classes. In this paper, we propose a novel discriminative feature metric-based affinity propagation (DFM-AP) technique where the spectral and the spatial relationships among pixels are constructed by a new type of discriminative constraint. This discriminative constraint involves chunklet and discriminative information, which are introduced into the BS process. The chunklet information allows for grouping of spectrally-close and spatially-close pixels together without requiring explicit knowledge of their class labels, while discriminative information provides important separability information. A discriminative feature metric (DFM) is proposed with the discriminative constraints modeled in terms of an optimal criterion for identifying an efficient distance metric learning method, which involves discriminative component analysis (DCA). Following this, the representative subset of bands can be identified by means of an exemplar-based clustering algorithm, which is also known as the process of affinity propagation.

Experimental results suggest that on an average the Hybrid Feature Selector gave best results compared to individual techniques with popular filter as well as wrapper based feature selection methods. The proposed algorithm which is a multi-step process utilizes discretization, filters out irrelevant and least relevant features and finally uses a greedy algorithm such as best first search or wrapper subset selector. For experimental validation we have utilized two established measures to compare the performance of statistical classifiers namely; classification accuracy (or error rate) and the area under ROC.

Recently, some studies have utilized local features to represent each video frame and formulate video summarization as a coverage problem of local features. However, the importance of individual local features has not been exploited. In this paper, we propose a novel Bag-of-Importance (BoI) model for static video summarization by identifying the frames with important local features as keyframes, which is one of the first studies formulating video summarization at local feature level, instead of at global feature level. That is, by representing each frame with local features, a video is characterized with a bag of local features weighted with individual importance scores and the frames with more important local features are more representative, where the representativeness of each frame is the aggregation of the weighted importance of the local features contained in the frame. In addition, we propose to learn a transformation from a raw local feature to a more powerful sparse nonlinear representation for deriving the importance score of each local feature, rather than directly utilize the hand-crafted visual features like most of the existing approaches. Specifically, we first employ locality-constrained linear coding (LCC) to project each local feature into a sparse transformed space. LCC is able to take advantage of the manifold geometric structure of the high dimensional feature space and form the manifold of the low dimensional transformed space with the coordinates of a set of anchor points. Then we calculate the l2 norm of each anchor point as the importance score of each local feature which is projected to the anchor point. Finally, the distribution of the importance scores of all the local features in a video is obtained as the BoI representation of the video. We further differentiate the importance of local features with a spatial weighting template by taking the perceptual difference among spatial regions of a frame into account. As a result, our proposed video summarization approach is able to exploit both the inter-frame and intra-frame properties of feature representations and identify keyframes capturing both the dominant content and discriminative details within a video. Experimental results on three video datasets across various genres demonstrate that the proposed approach clearly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TMM.2014.2319778", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Multimedia", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Multimedia", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2094325573", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17859986", "39077227", "286587", "35925816", "45822624", "10825509", "247125", "15041739", "90827", "27487390", "15611611", "6595575", "303727", "6728126", "3185202", "3705093", "130535382", "33677310", "11102951", "15382935", "53306243", "10397481", "18276532", "15849833", "8069027", "9895373", "8705996", "207161932", "6718692", "35954496", "1045818", "6162124", "5867261", "16327416", "2047094"], "inbound_citations": ["28608743", "1468205", "52860236", "13117535", "29476596", "204816399", "6157770", "21720091", "4459515", "4561968", "25427828", "4354867", "22709503", "14654833", "9938543", "53045161", "22979834", "52014291", "29907004", "52286928", "3616892", "10822606", "37484809", "54732684", "22339388", "24879154", "36289603", "7857255", "3845448", "57427752", "203605361", "53082760", "69516815", "1382570", "19695776", "46952535", "10158901", "18035967", "5771724", "50779527", "11439579", "22620990", "10088531", "3449715", "203163196"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24804926"}

In this paper, we try to solve the problem of relation extraction by discovering dependency tree patterns (a pattern is an embedded sub dependency tree indicating a relation instance). Our approach is to find an optimal rule (pattern) set automatically based on the proposed dependency tree pattern mining algorithm. The experimental results show that the extracted patterns can achieve a high precision and a reasonable recall rate when used as rules to extract relation instances. Furthermore, an additional experiment shows that other machine learning based relation extraction methods can also benefit from the extracted patterns by using them as features. Relation extraction is the task that aims to identify relations between pairs of named entities from free text. From the perspective of methodologies employed to conduct relation extraction, current existing methods can be classified into three categories. The first category is rule-based methods, which identifies relations by utilizing inference rules. The rules could be extended regular expres- sions incorporating with pre-defined constraints. The second is to treat relation extraction as a classification problem with a kernel machine such as SVM. The problem is then how to define a kernel function between two relation instances. The third category of relation extraction method is regarding relation extraction as sequence labeling problem. Then the existing methods for se- quence labeling, such as Maximum Entropy (ME) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), could be used to solve the relation extraction problem directly. Our algorithm proposed in this paper belongs to the rules learning framework. The reason we choose the rule-based method is that the rules could contain more semantic information than features used in statistical methods. A pattern is a sub dependency tree that indicates a relation instance. In other words, a pattern corresponds to a trimmed sentence, e.g. a sentence with all unrelated components removed. This is certainly an advantage to the flat patterns which will face significant problems if the sentences are very complex. Experiments show that our patterns are more effective used for relation extraction.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": "Y09-2050", "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "PACLIC", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "956805140", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7579604", "6075461", "11473206", "5165854", "5511339", "14827585", "510619", "206787478", "311673", "7395989", "62705866", "7190877", "11495042", "12363172", "18702644", "195717148"], "inbound_citations": ["96193"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13205080"}

PFRSVM is an in-stream data classification engine adhering to the fundamental rules of stream processing. The classification is performed by PFRSVM using hyperbolic tangent kernel. The fuzzy rough set model takes care of sensitiveness of noisy samples and handles impreciseness in training samples bringing robustness to results. The membership function is function of center and radius of each class in feature space and is represented with kernel. It plays an important role towards sampling the decision surface. The success of PFRSVM is governed by choosing appropriate parameter values. The training samples are either linear or nonlinear separable. The different input points make unique contributions to decision surface. The algorithm is parallelized with a view to reduce training times. The system is built on support vector machine library using Hadoop implementation of MapReduce. The algorithm is tested on large datasets to check its feasibility and convergence. The performance of classifier is also assessed in terms of number of support vectors. The challenges encountered towards implementing big data classification in machine learning frameworks are also discussed. The experiments are done on the cloud environment available at University of Technology and Management, India. The results are illustrated for Gaussian RBF and Bayesian kernels. The effect of variability in prediction and generalization of PFRSVM is examined with respect to values of parameter C. It effectively resolves outliers\u2019 effects, imbalance and overlapping class problems, normalizes to unseen data and relaxes dependency between features and labels. The average classification accuracy for PFRSVM is better than other classifiers for both Gaussian RBF and Bayesian kernels. The experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique. PFRSVM is scalable and reliable in nature and is characterized by order independence, computational transaction, failure recovery, atomic transactions, fault tolerant and high availability attributes as exhibited through various experiments.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Informatica", "journal": "Informatica (Slovenia)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2294745357", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["166449414", "60090930", "57146809", "6231596", "11874035", "60593", "61102253", "65502390", "194951", "28637672", "20991056", "205701394", "198168928", "61950229", "961425", "14500006", "14588615", "1622820", "57892915", "60693966", "16732758"], "inbound_citations": ["214667099"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:40846268"}

The data are recorded from 10 intact subjects repeating 7 grasps 12 times, twice a day for 5 days. The data are publicly available on the Ninapro web page. The analysis for the repeatability is based on the comparison of movement classification accuracy in several data acquisitions and for different subjects.

The accuracy obtained by training and testing on acquisitions at different times is on average 27.03% lower than training and testing on the same acquisition. The results obtained by training and testing on different acquisitions suggest that previous acquisitions can be used to train the classification algorithms.

As the newly identified number of BL enzymes is increasing daily, it is imperative to develop a computational tool to classify the newly identified BL enzymes into one of its classes. There are two types of classification of BL enzymes: Molecular Classification and Functional Classification. Existing computational methods only address Molecular Classification and the performance of these existing methods is unsatisfactory.ResultsWe addressed the unsatisfactory performance of the existing methods by implementing a Deep Learning approach called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We developed CNN-BLPred, an approach for the classification of BL proteins. The CNN-BLPred uses Gradient Boosted Feature Selection (GBFS) in order to select the ideal feature set for each BL classification. Based on the rigorous benchmarking of CCN-BLPred using both leave-one-out cross-validation and independent test sets, CCN-BLPred performed better than the other existing algorithms.Compared with other architectures of CNN, Recurrent Neural Network, and Random Forest, the simple CNN architecture with only one convolutional layer performs the best. After feature extraction, we were able to remove ~95% of the 10,912 features using Gradient Boosted Trees. During 10-fold cross validation, we increased the accuracy of the classic BL predictions by 7%. We also increased the accuracy of Class A, Class B, Class C, and Class D performance by an average of 25.64%. The independent test results followed a similar trend.ConclusionsWe implemented a deep learning algorithm known as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to develop a classifier for BL classification.

It consists of applying computational techniques to extract useful knowledge from the available data, typically expressed in the form of a predictive or descriptive model. Attribute-value data mining systems, which are restricted to data representable in a single table, where each row represents a single data point, are widely used in practice. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems, on the other hand, do not impose such restrictions, but are less commonly used, mainly because of their sometimes excessive execution times. In this work, we investigate several techniques that reduce the execution time of ILP systems, thus improving their applicability. Many ILP systems search a huge space of potential models to find a suitable model by repeatedly generating candidate models and subsequently testing their performance on the input data. Typically, such systems will generate redundant candidates, for example, candidates that are logically equivalent to previously generated ones. Subsumption tests can be used to remove redundant candidates, but are computationally expensive. We introduce techniques that improve the efficiency of these tests. Once a candidate model has been generated, the system evaluates its performance on the available data. At this step we introduce a new framework for compactly representing the input data, which generalizes a number of well known approaches and supports efficient processing of large, disk resident data sets. The evaluation step itself corresponds to executing one or more first-order queries. We study several single-query and multi-query optimization techniques and investigate how different optimization techniques can be combined. Our experiments show that combined optimization techniques can reduce the execution time of ILP systems by several orders of magnitude. After the system has found a suitable model, methods such as cross-validation can be used to estimate its generalization error. However, cross-validation is computationally expensive as it involves repeatedly running the ILP system. We propose new cross-validation algorithms that are significantly faster than traditional methods. By integrating the above techniques in commonly used ILP systems, one obtains fast and powerful tools that can be applied to solve complex data mining tasks.

However, it has been pointed out that the randomness of the ELM parameters would result in fluctuating performance. In this paper, we systematically investigate the performance stabilization effect brought by a regularized variant of the ELM, named Regularized ELM (RELM). Furthermore, by using the PREdiction Sum of Squares (PRESS) statistics formula and a unique property of the RELM, we propose a semi-cross-validation algorithm to effectively realize a robust RELM-based model selection for SLFNs, termed as Automatic Regularized Extreme Learning Machine with Leave-One-Out cross-validation (AR-ELM-LOO).

Hence, modeling is critical in determining the performance of the problem-solving process and the quality of the produced solution. Unfortunately, modeling remains an art and has resisted automation. Additionally, slight variations in the characteristics of a given problem instance make it difficult to represent one class of problems using a unique model. Consequently, a robust approach to modeling is required. ::: My thesis presents an automated approach to modeling. I exploit information contained in the input data in order to customize the constraint model of a given problem instance. I apply my approach to the area of Constraint Programming, focusing on a class of problems where a solution is guaranteed to exist for all problem instances. Specifically, I enhance a generic constraint model of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) by adding new constraints to this model. These additional constraints are selected from a library of constraints by testing features of the problem instance at hand. The resulting constraint model is customized such that it best represents the problem instance given the data provided as input. ::: The resulting framework is applicable to problems where instances are seeded with some initial input data. The techniques present in the framework are generally defined so they can be applied across domains. They cope with the uncertainty in the model refinement process by handling noisy data and incorrect inferences, generating additional information as needed. Furthermore, the framework uses Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to determine the scope of the inferred constraints and it automatically instantiates the constraint model in a format supported by a specialized constraint solver. ::: I evaluate the effectiveness of my approach in two domains, Sudoku puzzles and the building identification (BID) problem. I show how it can infer the most specific constraint model given the available public information, scale to large problem instances, and use a SVM model to efficiently determine constraint scopes. I also evaluate the effectiveness of the framework for the BID problem in areas such as New Orleans and Belgrade where non-homogenous problem structures co-exist and across different Sudoku puzzle variations, demonstrating the resulting improvement when using an inferred model over a generic one. Additionally, I evaluate the framework's ability to augment the initial set of data points with new ones when applying an iterative constraint-propagation algorithm, which leads to more accurate constraint models.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2279561282", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30733367"}

Juslin @psy.umu.se) Department of Psychology, Umea University SE-901 87, Umea, Sweden Abstract An exemplar-based algorithm, PROBEX, (Juslin & Persson, 1999) is shown to make robust decisions in multiple-cue in- ference tasks when very few exemplars are known. We dem- onstrate the crucial role of knowledge of cue directions for performance and confront PROBEX with an artificial envi- ronment specifically construed to favor a non-compensatory algorithm like Take The Best (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996). PROBEX is demonstrated to perform well even in these unfa- vorable conditions. The explanation for the robust perform- ance is that PROBEX approximates Dawes Rule by using in- formation of the cue directions for all cues, while yet making few a priori assumptions about the structure of the environ- ment. Introduction In this paper we will discuss the importance of knowledge of cue directions for probabilistic inference. The cue direction refers to the valence of the relationship between two vari- ables, for example, as represented by the sign of a correla- tion, or a coefficient in a linear equation (e.g., a beta weight in linear regression). We will concentrate on a simple binary choice task format of the following sort, \u201cWhich German city has the higher population: a) Bonn, b) Hamburg?\u201d. In this case, knowledge of a cue direction corresponds to knowing if a binary probability cue, say, that Hamburg, but not Bonn, has a soccer team in the Bundesliga, increases or decreases the probability that alternative (a) (Bonn) is the correct answer to the question. The constraints on a plausible cognitive mechanism for learning cue-directions are complex and multifaceted. In some tasks, learning cue-directions is not important because they are known a priori. In those cases, it is the relative weight of the cues that is important. On the other hand, it is sometimes proposed that knowledge of cue directions is the crucial aspect of learning to make probabilistic inferences (Dawes & Corrigan, 1974). Moreover, inferences have to be made for new and unexpected tasks for which little previous experience is available. This means that the system cannot rely extensively on pre-computed knowledge\u2014which cues are predictive, and the direction of predictive validity, has to be detected on the spot. Finally, a flexible algorithm should map both linear and nonlinear aspects of an environment. These constraints boil down to whether we can find an al- gorithm integrating the ability to represent non-linearity with on-the-spot detection of cue directionality. Is this possible without violating psychological plausibility? In this paper, we show that PROBEX (PROBabilities from EXemplars: Juslin & Persson, 1999) is such an algorithm. It relies on similarity-guided retrieval of exemplars to capture nonlinear relationships and to estimate cue directions. An added bonus is that because PROBEX belongs to the class of lazy algo- rithms (Aha, 1997), which do not require pre-computed knowledge, this is achieved in a fast and frugal fashion. An important development in the judgment literature is the concern with evaluating cognitive algorithms within real environments (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996; Gigerenzer, Todd, & the ABC-group, 1999). Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996) demonstrate that, when applied to the structure of a real environment, simple heuristics that only rely on a single cue perform on par with complex algorithms that integrate multiple cues. Take-The-Best (TTB) relying on the single most valid cue that is applicable, performed as well as linear multiple regression that integrates 9 cues. It was concluded that although TTB falls short of classical norms of rational- ity, it provides the same accuracy at a minimum of compu- tation: It is \u201dfast and frugal\u201d. One shortcoming of the simu- lations in Gigerenzer and Goldstein was that all algorithms were provided with a priori knowledge of cue directions. Connectionist, exemplar-based and decision-tree archi- tectures have been shown to compete evenly with TTB in regard to accuracy (Chater et al, 1999). Specifically, in Jus- lin and Persson (1999) it was shown that PROBEX outper- formed TTB and linear multiple regression in regard to accuracy while relying on no pre-computed knowledge. PROBEX further provided a good quantitative fit to the quantitative point-estimates, binary decisions, and probabil- ity judgments made by human participants (see Dougherty, Gettys, & Ogden, 1999, for a similar approach). In this paper, we complement Juslin and Persson (1999) in three respects: First, we illustrate the crucial role of esti- mating cue directions for the performance of any algorithm. Second, we explore boundary conditions for the robust per- formance of PROBEX by exposing it to an environment deliberately construed to favor a non-compensatory algo- rithm like TTB and a linear, additive algorithm like linear multiple regression. Finally we present a simple demonstra- tion to elucidate why evolution should favor decisions algo- rithms that are robust in states of limited knowledge.", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1578274172", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["8720110", "144727825", "115689385", "3005097", "16384333", "26166298", "117595062", "7529465"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:73630481"}

In this letter, we first propose an automatic steganographic distortion learning framework using a generative adversarial network, which is composed of a steganographic generative subnetwork and a steganalytic discriminative subnetwork. Via alternately training these two oppositional subnetworks, our proposed framework can automatically learn embedding change probabilities for every pixel in a given spatial cover image. The learnt embedding change probabilities can then be converted to embedding distortions, which can be adopted in the existing framework of minimal-distortion embedding. Under this framework, the distortion function is directly related to the undetectability against the oppositional evolving steganalyzer.

These unsupervised and supervised learning methods identified three classes or subtypes of specimens, assigned tumor or nontumor labels to new specimens and detected six potentially mislabeled specimens. The probability parameters of the three classes were utilized to develop a novel gene relevance, ranking, and selection method.

The aim of the churn predictor is to learn the pattern of churners and thus differentiate between churners and non-churners. Handling the large dimensionality and selecting discriminative features are challenging aspects of telecom churn prediction that hinder the performance of predictors. In this study, we propose a churn prediction approach that exploits the discriminative feature selection capabilities of minimum redundancy and maximum relevance in the first step, leading to enhanced feature-label association and reduced feature set.

Rather than estimating an SVM model per speaker, according to the \"one versus all\" discriminative paradigm, the PSVM approach classifies a trial, consisting of a pair of i-vectors, as belonging or not to the same speaker class. Training a PSVM with large amount of data, however, is a memory and computational expensive task, because the number of training pairs grows quadratically with the number of training i-vectors. This paper demonstrates that a very small subset of the training pairs is necessary to train the original PSVM model, and proposes two approaches that allow discarding most of the training pairs that are not essential, without harming the accuracy of the model. This allows dramatically reducing the memory and computational resources needed for training, which becomes feasible with large datasets including many speakers. We have assessed these approaches on the extended core conditions of the NIST 2012 Speaker Recognition Evaluation. Our results show that the accuracy of the PSVM trained with a sufficient number of speakers is 10%-30% better compared to the one obtained by a PLDA model, depending on the testing conditions.

There are many applications that have to deal with Situation Awareness: CRM, HCM, SCM, patient care, power grid management, and cloud services management; the list seems to be endless. Situation awareness requires applications to integrate the management of data, knowledge, processes, and other services such as social networking and middleware. These applications require high personalization as well as rapid and continuous evolution. Additionally, a wide variety of operational and functional requirements must be met, including real time execution and strong temporal support with provenance. Handcrafting these applications is a significant task that requires exhaustive resources for development and maintenance. Due to the resources and time involved in their development, these applications typically fall way short of the desired functionality, operational characteristics, and ease and speed of evolution. We \u2013 Eric S. Chan, Adel Ghoneimy, Zhen Hua Liu, and the author (all at Oracle) \u2013 have developed a model to support Situational Awareness; we call it KIDS \u2013 Knowledge Intensive Data-processing System [2]. The basic ideas are as follows: KIDS manages data, knowledge and processes. KIDS assumes that there are four categories of data (Facts, Perceptions, Hypotheses, and Directives) and four categories of knowledge (Classification, Assessment, Resolution, and Enactment). Facts are what we measure \u2013 facts are quantitative. Facts are classified to derive perceptions \u2013 perceptions are compact qualitative interpretations of facts designed to be easily useable by the human brain. Perceptions are assessed to derive one or more hypotheses, hypotheses are used to derive directives. The enactment of the directives will create new facts; the loop starts again until the problem on hand has been solved. The four categories of data require state of the art data management. This starts with the support of structured and unstructured data and with extensibility for domain specific data. Temporal support with provenance and selective long term retention is a must as is real time processing of queries (rules, models). The management of data has to be done with rich declarative interfaces. OLTP as well as real-time analytics have to be handled concurrently and with great efficiency. While the use of tacit knowledge is always the last resort, the use of formal knowledge is preferred. For formal representations of classification knowledge the preferred choices include Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayesian Networks, and Neural Networks; for assessments the preferred choices include Bayesian Belief Networks and Least-Squares Optimization; for resolutions the preferred choices include Influence Diagrams and Prognosis of Remaining Useful Life; and for enactments the preferred choices include control structures encoded in scripts, plans, schedules, BPEL workflows, and business processes in BPMN. The execution of the various categories of knowledge represents a process, which we call the CARE loop; the existing process management technologies can be leveraged. An additional loop supports the evolution of knowledge based on tacit knowledge and/or improved machine interpretation of the data. All data, knowledge, and processes are stored and managed using temporal databases to enable unambiguous provenance. KIDS poses many technical challenges; real processing of knowledge seems to be one of the major challenges. CEP (Complex Event Processing) is certainly a good start; however, the model, the language, the provenance support, and other components need major enhancements. A challenge as demanding as situation awareness will ultimately only succeed with a solid mathematical foundation. The best fit seems to be the Theory of Categories [3]. The KIDS model is currently used in Oracle to develop cloud management services as well as customer support; it is a domain where the IT experts, including the authors of KIDS, are also the domain experts. The expected benefits of the CARE loop processing are well visible even though the KIDS software is not yet available. We also know that KIDS is a very good model for the management of the bug databases such as JIRA. A project at the Medical Center of the University of Utah in 2010 was instrumental for the evolution of KIDS [4]; this project showed especially the importance of the classification of facts into perceptions.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CIDR", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2293721084", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18895761", "13574279"], "inbound_citations": ["25269868", "4607999", "42408389"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19187235"}

Gene expression data has a special characteristic that there is a mismatch in gene dimension as opposed to sample dimension. All genes do not contribute for efficient classification of samples. A robust feature selection algorithm is required to identify the important genes which help in classifying the samples efficiently. In order to select informative genes (features) based on relevance and redundancy characteristics, many feature selection algorithms have been introduced in the past. Most of the earlier algorithms require computationally expensive search strategy to find an optimal feature subset. Existing feature selection methods are also sensitive to the evaluation measures. The paper introduces a novel and efficient feature selection approach based on statistically defined effective range of features for every class termed as ERGS (Effective Range based Gene Selection). The basic principle behind ERGS is that higher weight is given to the feature that discriminates the classes clearly. Experimental results on well-known gene expression datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Two popular classifiers viz. Nave Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been used for classification. The proposed feature selection algorithm can be helpful in ranking the genes and also is capable of identifying the most relevant genes responsible for diseases like leukemia, colon tumor, lung cancer, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), prostate cancer.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21241823", "doi": "10.1016/j.jbi.2011.01.001", "venue": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "journal": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "mag_id": "1973033483", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199508462", "212438005", "20133312", "1331135", "52813281", "210179265", "1854893", "56349501", "3483745", "13891401", "204818219", "56132960", "64679823", "11149992", "636218", "1227509", "35483158", "49658710", "51973145", "28516594", "53142409", "21117090", "54002666", "204106565", "51614824", "54456969", "212621652", "10149040", "6718386", "52205412", "63047227", "4413783", "202007121", "15245015", "65222777"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:42114809"}

Compared with the static face matching techniques, this approach is more robust and accurate under a coarse correspondence of face images, and has potential to visual interaction and advanced human behaviour recognition in real-world scenarios.", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5244/C.14.25", "venue": "BMVC", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2057043136", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12382173", "194951", "33520001", "7710038", "743542", "807316", "11269423", "62359231", "3103567", "15205944", "1889567", "2841459", "6611218", "136280", "1817782", "8093705", "31757947", "6222990", "18914582", "7164794", "26127529", "7138354", "10047234", "14316761", "17342425"], "inbound_citations": ["1164650", "15175276", "59470903"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9772627"}

In this paper, a new robust TWSVM via $l_{2,p}$ -norm formulations was proposed, because it suppress the influence of outliers better than $l_{1}$ -norm or squared $l_{2}$ -norm minimizations. However, the resulted objective is challenging to solve, because it is non-smooth and non-convex. As an important work, we systematically derive an efficient iterative algorithm to minimize the $p\\mathrm {th}$ order of $l_{2}$ -norm distances. Theoretical support shows that the iterative algorithm is effective in the resolution to improve TWSVM via $l_{2,p}$ -norm instead of squared $l_{2}$ -norm distances.

Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) methods are widely used for fault diagnosis, however, their accuracy is limited by the selection of DGA features and the performance of fault diagnosis models, for example, the classical support vector machine (SVM), is easily affected by unbalanced training samples. This paper presents a transformer fault diagnosis model based on chemical reaction optimization and a twin support vector machine. Twin support vector machines (TWSVMs) are used as classifiers for solving problems involving unbalanced and insufficient samples. Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are used for data preprocessing to ensure the effective identification of feature parameters and improve the efficiency and accuracy of fault diagnosis.

The proposed architecture includes two subnetworks, i.e., generator subnetwork and discriminator subnetwork. We introduce a multiscale generator subnetwork which contains two convolution branches with different kernel sizes, where the smaller one captures the local rain drops information, and the larger one pays close attention to the spatial information. The discriminator subnetwork acts as a supervision signal to promote the generator subnetwork to generate more quality derained image.

Nowadays, when datasets are getting bigger in terms of their size and the number of features, this issue is becoming a relevant limitation. Furthermore, with a growing number of features, there is often a problem that a lot of them may be redundant and noisy which brings down the performance of a classifier.

To solve these problems, a new RUL prediction method based on deep feature representation and transfer learning is proposed in this paper. This method includes an off-line stage and an online stage. In the off-line stage, the Hilbert\u2013Huang transform marginal spectra of the raw vibration signal of auxiliary bearings are first calculated as the input, and then contractive denoising autoencoder is introduced to extract deep features with good and stable fault representation. Second, by using the obtained deep features and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, a new health condition assessment method is proposed to divide the whole life of each bearing into a normal state and a fast-degradation state. Finally, using the extracted deep features and their RUL values, an RUL prediction model for the fast-degradation state is trained by means of a least-square support vector machine. In the online stage, a kind of transfer learning algorithm, i.e., transfer component analysis, is introduced to sequentially adjust the features of target bearing from auxiliary bearings, and then the corresponding RUL is predicted using the corrected features.

This means that GP classifiers are much better suited in a lifelong learning framework, where not all classes are represented initially, but instead new training data arrives during the operation of the robot.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IROS.2012.6386073", "venue": "2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems", "journal": "2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2003768689", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7125159", "15284132", "8396595", "1973951", "1152459", "34485837", "849935", "1982594", "557652", "14702967", "116771243", "62914117", "12747913", "469536", "207663697", "1018203", "195652429", "207669340", "8358534", "12555103", "1430472", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["14081991", "11768956", "31150578", "212645370", "769423", "19702375", "16650794", "2218472", "31753263", "19702055", "6653754", "6796870", "9100321"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14287800"}

These three models were developed and applied for two wells near Lake Okeechobee in Florida, United States. 10 years data-sets including hydrological parameters such as precipitation (P), temperature (T), past groundwater level (G) and lake level (L) were used as input data to forecast groundwater level. Five quantitative standard statistical performance evaluation measures, correlation coefficient (R), normalized mean square error (NMSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS) and Akaike information criteria (AIC), were employed to evaluate the performances of these models.

In the first step, following a wavelet transform, a set of features are selected and fed to a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (MSVM) to detect occurrence and type of fault. Then, faulted zone-the area between two DGs that fault occurs between them- is determined thanks to two facts. First, one of the DG in two sides of the faulted zone endures the lowest voltage.

The aim of the present chapter, however, is to show how the systematicity and productivity arguments can be applied to Connectionism. We will consider, first, a very simple Connectionist network described by David Chalmers, (1990), then a more complex network described by Robert Hadley and Michael Hayward, (1997). Of central importance will be showing how the explanatory principle that is involved in the systematicity arguments bears on Connectionism. What makes it so important to note this explanatory principle is the sheer difficulty of coming up with a Connectionist model that can even display any form of systematicity.

How to attract new customers and retain existing ones becomes a critical issue for e-marketplace operators and sellers as well. This study defines the repeated shopping of online consumers in a certain website as his/her e-marketplace repurchase behavior, which reflects the behavioral loyalty to e-marketplace. Based on the database marketing concept of RFM, we establish a forecast model for consumers' e-marketplace repurchase behavior with six predictor variables associated with an online consumer. They include the number of days since last purchase (recency), cumulative number of purchases (frequency), cumulative and average purchasing amount (monetary), number of repurchased sellers, and the latest rating given in the website.The study used web content mining to crawl transactions of women's clothing at Yahoo!

We captured 18,881 transactions in a five-month period from randomly selected sellers of women's clothing and identified 5,682 buyers who purchased from those sellers and posted ratings. The Logistic regression in SPSS and the Random Forests in STATISTICA were used for data analysis, and the results showed all six predictor variables significantly influenced e-marketplace repurchase behavior, only the effect of average purchasing amount is negative, which is different from that of cumulative purchasing amount. In contrast to the findings by the forecast model of seller repurchase behavior, the impacts of the four RFM variables except the cumulative number of purchases are smaller in e-marketplace repurchase behavior than in the seller's repurchase behavior and the impact of latest rating is also smaller in the forecast model of e-marketplace repurchase behavior.

The combination of alpha2 and theta asymmetry showed the highest classification accuracy of 88.33% in SVM.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31834531", "doi": "10.1007/s10916-019-1486-z", "venue": "Journal of Medical Systems", "journal": "Journal of Medical Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2996393987", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["69970682", "18707761", "51605280", "1676372", "16284813", "506239", "9107019", "62653673", "1101322", "7044218", "10055907", "15841509", "6530435", "17572432", "121570279", "206787478", "59099297", "22341029", "5940387", "140046723", "29124708"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209342224"}

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), typically above 200 nucleotides in sequence length, have recently attracted increasing interests because of their important roles in various cellular processes. While it is straightforward to distinguishing lncRNAs from most small non-coding RNAs using sequence length as the major criteria, it is much more challenging to differentiate between lncRNAs and mRNAs because they share many similarities. In this study, we present a computational method which can effectively classify lncRNAs and mRNAs using sequence-derived features. The algorithm is organized into a two-layer structure. The first layer consists of multiple Support Vector Machine classifiers, each of which takes input a disjoint set of features such as k-mers and sequence-order correlation coefficient factors. The output of first-layer classifiers then serves as input features to the second-layer Naive Bayes classifier. The final two-layer structured classifier achieved 99% accuracy and 0.98 MCC on a benchmark dataset of human RefSeq mRNAs and GENCODE lncRNAs. We also applied our method, which was trained on human transcripts, in predicting transcripts from 9 other vertebrates and achieved satisfactory cross-species performance.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCABS.2017.8114304", "venue": "2017 IEEE 7th International Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and Medical Sciences (ICCABS)", "journal": "2017 IEEE 7th International Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and Medical Sciences (ICCABS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2768321257", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["846427", "43590949", "6865098", "12424855", "18441501", "20931576", "22966330", "4420166", "12295847", "14165675", "1969204", "1361981", "13868659", "7824801", "1740249", "7984264", "2855821", "6699106", "11086279", "1481364", "17165775", "9048197", "961425", "140109802"], "inbound_citations": ["211057790"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2538200"}

However, there are several challenges in MOOCs such as huge drop-out rates, improper automated assessments, varied student engagement, and attention etc. Learning Analytics helps us to contain such issues. Learning analytics, with the help of Big Data Technologies, helps us to interpret humongous MOOCs data to assess progress, predict performance and identify problems. To perform analytics, we developed a workflow using Apache Spark, a scalable inmemory computing framework. The data from edX platform has been used for experiments. It contains the information of more than 2 Lakh students from 39 courses. Initially, detailed statistical analysis has been carried out to understand the learning patterns and the behavior of online learners.

The authors are designing a subphonetic unit called the UNnone which is similar to fenones. A vector quantizer is used to partition the acoustic space into a set of clusters. Once the vector quantizer has been designed, the training vectors are compared to the reference vectors using a Euclidean distance measure. The label corresponding to the closest reference vector is assigned to the input vector. These labels are used as targets for training the MLP. >", "year": 1992, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/NNSP.1992.253697", "venue": "Neural Networks for Signal Processing II Proceedings of the 1992 IEEE Workshop", "journal": "Neural Networks for Signal Processing II Proceedings of the 1992 IEEE Workshop", "mag_id": "2538566350", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63074567"}

This approach retrieves relevant documents by lexical matching between query and document terms. Due to synonymy and polysemy, lexical methods produce imprecise or incomplete results. In this paper we present how named entities are integrated in SENSE (SEmantic N-levels Search Engine). SENSE is an IR system that tries to overcome the limitations of the ranked keyword approach, by introducing semantic levels which integrate (and not simply replace) the lexical level represented by keywords. Semantic levels provide information about word meanings, as described in a reference dictionary, and named entities. Our aim is to prove that named entities are useful to improve retrieval performance. 1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION In recent years a lot of attention has been invested on Named Entities (NE), and their informative and discriminative power within documents. Due to the importance of research on NE, several sub-areas arose, such as entity detection and extraction, entity disambiguation and entity ranking. The typical information extraction task involving NE is Named Entity Recognition (NER). This task has been defined for the first time during the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) [4], and requires the identification and categorization of NE as entity names (for people and organization), place names, temporal expressions and numerical expressions. Named Entities play also a key role in the Information Retrieval context. Indeed, a very common task in that research area is the entity ranking, whose aim is to retrieve entities (rather than documents) that satisfy the user query. Most documents we deal on everyday contain a lot of references to persons, dates, monetary values and places. Moreover, named entity terms are among the most frequently searched terms on the Web. Statistics on Yahoo\u2019s top 10 search terms in 2008 showed that all the ten search terms consist of named entity terms: six persons, one sport \u2217The full version appears in [3] http://buzz.yahoo.com/yearinreview2008/top10/ Appears in the Proceedings of the 1st Italian Information Retrieval Workshop (IIR\u201910), January 27\u201328, 2010, Padova, Italy. http://ims.dei.unipd.it/websites/iir10/index.html Copyright owned by the authors. organization, one role-playing game, one fictional character and one TV show. In this paper we propose a new way of exploiting named entities in Information Retrieval. Named entities mentioned in a document constitute an important part of its semantics. However, when named entities are considered alone they may fail to capture the semantics expressed in a document or in a user query. For that reason we adopt an IR model, called N-levels [2], able to capture semantic information in a text by exploiting word meanings, described in a reference dictionary (e.g. WordNet), and named entities. Thus, we propose an IR system, called SENSE (SEmantic N-levels Search Engine), which manages documents indexed at multiple separate levels: keywords, senses (word meanings) and entities (named entities). The system is able to combine keyword search with semantic information provided by the two other indexing levels. Finally, we present the development of the full-fledged entity level based on a novel model called Semantic Vectors. 2. NAMED ENTITY LEVEL Named entities are phrases that contain the names of persons, organizations, locations and, more generally, entities that can be identified by proper names. In order to identify named entities in a text, several methods can be applied such as Rule-based, Dictionary-based or Statistical ones. We adopted a statistical method exploiting YamCha, a generic open source text chunker useful for a lot of NLP tasks. YamCha adopts a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm called Support Vector Machines (SVMs), introduced by Vapnik in 1995. We trained YamCha using the dataset provided by CoNLL-2003 organization during the SharedTask 2003 [5]. The dataset contains entities extracted from Reuters dataset. In particular three types of entities are extracted: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION and MISC, which contains entities that do not belong to the previous three categories. We extract entities from the CLEF 2008 collection [1]. The results of the entity recognition task are exported into a Lucene index. In detail, each document is split in two fields: HEADLINE and TEXT, in compliance with the document structure in CLEF. Each field contains the set of the recognized entities and, for each entity, the number of occurrences. Building the entity level requires three steps: 1. pre-processing and entity extraction: XML files http://chasen.org/ taku/software/YamCha/ * provided by CLEF 2008 organizers are processed in order to extract entities. Named entities are stored in IOB2 format. In IOB2, words outside the Named Entity are tagged with O, while the first word in the entity is tagged with B-k (to begin class k), and further words receive the I-k tag, indicating that these words are inside the entity; 2. entity indexing: entities extracted in the previous step are stored into an index using Lucene. The entity extraction procedure allows to obtain an entity-based vector space representation, called bag-of-entities (BoE). In this model an entity vector, rather than a word vector, corresponds to a document. 3. Semantic Vector building: in this step semantic vectors are built by exploiting the Lucene index. The main idea behind models based on Semantic Vectors [6] is that words and concepts are represented by points in a mathematical space, and this representation is learned from text in such a way that concepts with similar or related meanings are near to one another in that space. The SemanticVectors package offers tools for indexing a collection of documents and their retrieval. It relies on Apache Lucene to create a basic term-document matrix. Then the Lucene API is exploited to create a Wordspace model from the termdocument matrix, by using Random Projection to perform on-the-fly dimensionality reduction. This is a relevant point because it allows us to use the same entity index produced in step 2 to induce semantic vectors. A detailed discussion on Semantic Vectors can be found in [6], whilst a thorough explanation about the entity index can be found in [3]. 3. EXPERIMENTAL SESSION For the evaluation of the system effectiveness, we used the CLEF Ad Hoc WSD-Robust dataset derived from the English CLEF data, which comprises corpora from\u201cLos Angeles Times\u201d and \u201cGlasgow Herald\u201d, amounting to 166, 726 documents and 160 topics in English and Spanish. The relevance judgments were taken from CLEF. The goal of the evaluation was to prove that the combination of three indexing levels outperforms a single level. In particular, that adding the entity level increases the effectiveness of the search with respect to the keyword and meaning levels. To evaluate system effectiveness, different runs were performed by exploiting a single level at a time, or a combination of two or more levels. Each experiment is identified by the names of the used levels. To measure retrieval performance, we adopted Mean-Average-Precision (MAP) and Geometric-Mean-Average-Precision (GMAP) calculated by trec eval 0.8.1, a simple program supplied by the Text REtrieval Conference organizers, on the basis of 1,000 retrieved items per request. Table 1 shows the results for each run, with an overview on the exploited features. The results confirm our hypothesis: named entity recognition, in conjunction with an IR model capable of expressing semantics, can greatly improve the retrieval performance. If evaluated individually, the entity level does not yield to satisfactory results. This result is due to the presence of topics in which no entity was recognized.

The study reveals that presence of redundant borderline instances and outliers in the data-space severely catalyzes the effect of class imbalance. The Condensed Nearest Neighbor and Tomek-link undersampling techniques are used as the baseline systems for the present study, and an improved undersampling algorithm is proposed to be employed in the pre-processing stage by amalgamating aspects of outlier and redundancy detection to the baseline system. The proposed scheme imparts to detect outlier, redundant and noisy instances having least contribution in estimating accurate class labels. Thus, a data-level solution has been offered to the concerned problem with novelty in effective elimination of majority instances without losing valuable information.

The adaptive quantization is accomplished through an MAP estimation based clustering process whose massive computation of neighborhood constraints makes it difficult for a real-time implementation of video coding applications. The proposed cellular connectionist model aims at designing an architecture for the real-time implementation of the clustering-based adaptive quantization.

On the other hand, random forests have been examined and appeared to be an appropriate solution to effectively classify the students for early in-trouble student detection in a credit system. However, random forests are black-box ensemble models which lack a capability of explanation for the reasoning behind their prediction. Therefore, in this paper, we define a rule extraction algorithm named ExtractingRuleRF to derive an interpretable refined classification rule set from a random forest for a multi-class data classification task. The proposed algorithm follows a greedy approach with two phases: rule refinement and rule extraction. In the first phase, we prepare a ranked weighted rule set with more interpretability and equivalent classification power of the input random forest by retaining its classification scheme. In the second phase, our rule extraction process returns the best rules for the highest accuracy and/or a full coverage based on the priority of each ranked rule. Consequently, the theoretical analysis of the algorithm and experimental results on real educational data sets have shown that ExtractingRuleRF can produce a more effective and interpretable rule-based classification model than its corresponding random forest.

To solve the problem, this paper proposes a machine learning framework with three major parts: useable band determination, band-wise classification and fusion. The framework is compatible with arbitrary classifiers for the band-wise classification. Since some band images acquired during night hours contain little useful information, a selector is designed and placed before each band classifier. Moreover, majority voting, a very efficient method, is employed to fuse the band-wise classification results. Experiments demonstrate that Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), each in turn used as the band-wise classifiers, can yield high accuracy in labelling the TC intensity.

Such measures are usually estimated from tissue segmentation maps produced by publicly available image processing pipelines. However, the reliability of the produced segmentations when using multi-center and multi-scanner data remains understudied. Here, we assess the robustness of six publicly available tissue classification pipelines across images acquired from different MR scanners and sites. Methods We used T1-weighted images of a single individual, scanned in 73 sessions across 27 different sites to assess the robustness of the tissue classification tools. Variability in Dice Kappa values and tissue volumes was assessed for Atropos, BISON, Classify_Clean, FAST, FreeSurfer, and SPM12. We also estimated the sample size necessary to detect a significant 1% volume reduction based on the variability of the estimates from each method within and across scanner models. Results BISON had the lowest overall variability in its volumetric estimates, followed by FreeSurfer, and SPM12. All methods also had significant differences between some of their estimates across different scanner manufacturers (e.g. BISON had significantly higher GM estimates and correspondingly lower WM estimates for GE scans compared to Philips and SIEMENs), and different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels (e.g. FAST and FreeSurfer had significantly higher WM volume estimates for high versus medium and low SNR tertiles as well as correspondingly lower GM volume estimates). BISON also had the smallest sample size requirement across all scanners and tissue types, followed by FreeSurfer, and SPM12.

In this paper, we generalize OR-ELM to deal with multi-target regression problems, using the error l2,1 norm and the Elastic Net theory, which can result in a more sparse network, resulting in our method, Generalized Outlier Robust ELM (GOR-ELM). We use Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the resulting optimization problem. An incremental version of GOR-ELM is also proposed.

Performance Macromodels that facilitates accelerated analog circuit synthesis are constructed and thereby valid only in the functionally correct design space.

A kernel function serves as a separating function, a hypersurface which optimally separates input data into two classes involving minimal support vectors.

While most commonly used kernels are Radial Basis Function (RBF), polyno- mial, spline, multilayer perceptron; we have explored many other un-conventional kernel functions and kernels composed through modifications on the some of the standard kernels functions.

The commonly used quality measure of post-release faults may, therefore, reflect usage instead of the quality of the software development process. Aim: To determine how software faults and software use are related in a post-deployment scenario and, based on that, derive post-deployment quality measure that reflects developers' performance more accurately. Method: We analyze Google Analytics data counting daily new users, visits, time-on-site, visits per user, and release start date and duration for 169 releases of a complex communication application for Android OS. We utilize Linear Regression, Bayesian Network, and Random Forest models to explain the interrelationships and to derive release quality measure that is relatively stable with respect to variations in software usage. Results: We found the number of new users and release start date to be the determining factors for the number of exceptions, and found no direct link between the intensity and frequency of software usage and software faults. Furthermore, the relative increase in the number of crashes was found to be stably associated with a power of 1.3 relative increase in the number of new users. Based on the findings we propose a release quality measure: number of crashes per user for a release of the software, which was seen to be independent of any other usage variables, providing us with a usage independent measure of software quality.

Unlike traditional single sample (an image or a video) setting, this situation assumes the availability of a set of heterogeneous collection of orderless images and videos. The samples can be taken at different check points, different identity documents $etc$. The importance of each image is usually considered either equal or based on a quality assessment of that image independent of other images and/or videos in that image set. How to model the relationship of orderless images within a set remains a challenge. We address this problem by formulating it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in a latent space. Specifically, we first propose a dependency-aware attention control (DAC) network, which uses actor-critic reinforcement learning for attention decision of each image to exploit the correlations among the unordered images. An off-policy experience replay is introduced to speed up the learning process. Moreover, the DAC is combined with a temporal model for videos using divide and conquer strategies. We also introduce a pose-guided representation (PGR) scheme that can further boost the performance at extreme poses. We propose a parameter-free PGR without the need for training as well as a novel metric learning-based PGR for pose alignment without the need for pose detection in testing stage.

Second, they often cannot effectively handle the similarity measure of multi-modal data that may originate from multiple resources. To overcome these limitations, this paper investigates an online kernel ranking framework for learning kernel-based proximity functions, which goes beyond the conventional linear distance metric learning approaches. Based on the framework, we propose a novel Online Multiple Kernel Ranking (OMKR) method, which learns a flexible nonlinear proximity function with multiple kernels to improve visual similarity search in CBIR.

Methods: Standard segmentation priors such as a Potts model or total variation usually fail when dealing with thin and elongated structures. We overcome this difficulty by using a conditional random field model with more expressive potentials, taking advantage of recent results enabling inference of fully connected models almost in real time. Parameters of the method are learned automatically using a structured output support vector machine, a supervised technique widely used for structured prediction in a number of machine learning applications. Results: Our method, trained with state of the art features, is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively on four publicly available datasets: DRIVE, STARE, CHASEDB1, and HRF. Additionally, a quantitative comparison with respect to other strategies is included. Conclusion: The experimental results show that this approach outperforms other techniques when evaluated in terms of sensitivity, F1-score, G-mean, and Matthews correlation coefficient. Additionally, it was observed that the fully connected model is able to better distinguish the desired structures than the local neighborhood-based approach.

However, matching faces with big age gaps remains a challenging problem, primarily due to the significant discrepancy of face appearance caused by aging. To reduce such discrepancy, in this paper we present a novel algorithm to remove age-related components from features mixed with both identity and age information. Specifically, we factorize a mixed face feature into two uncorrelated components: identity-dependent component and age-dependent component, where the identity-dependent component contains information that is useful for face recognition. To implement this idea, we propose the Decorrelated Adversarial Learning (DAL) algorithm, where a Canonical Mapping Module (CMM) is introduced to find maximum correlation of the paired features generated by the backbone network, while the backbone network and the factorization module are trained to generate features reducing the correlation. Thus, the proposed model learns the decomposed features of age and identity whose correlation is significantly reduced. Simultaneously, the identity-dependent feature and the age-dependent feature are supervised by ID and age preserving signals respectively to ensure they contain the correct information.

This proposed loss function is based on the predicted and ground truth ranking of a list of instances instead of pairs or triplets and takes into account the improvement of evaluation measures during training. Through our experiments on two person re- identification datasets, we show that the new loss outperforms other common loss functions and that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on these two datasets.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICIP.2018.8451628", "venue": "2018 25th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)", "journal": "2018 25th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2890302516", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3961724", "7973738", "14124239", "10070153", "9022685", "209928701", "11168734", "207168334", "8604596", "4857212", "14997888", "207323040", "14795862", "206593071", "15636047", "206595765", "2683207", "1322267", "3489845", "4729614", "206594692"], "inbound_citations": ["199576753"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52188130"}

However, most of existing vulnerability search methods are limited to the same architecture, there are only a few researches on cross-architecture cases, of which the accuracy is not high. In this paper, to promote the accuracy of existing cross-architecture vulnerability search methods, we propose a new approach based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Attributed Control Flow Graph (ACFG) to search known vulnerability in firmware across different architectures at function level. We employ a known vulnerability function to recognize suspicious functions in other binary firmware. First, considering from the internal and external characteristics of the functions, we extract the function level features and basic-block level features of the functions to be inspected. Second, we employ SVM to recognize a little part of suspicious functions based on function level features. After the preliminary screening, we compute the graph similarity between the vulnerability function and suspicious functions based on their ACFGs. We have implemented our approach CVSSA, and employed the training samples to train the model with previous knowledge to improve the accuracy.

Several studies have successfully used molecular expression profiling in conjunction with classification techniques for discerning distinct disease groups. However, a majority of these studies do not provide sufficient insights into potential patient-specific variations within the disease groups. Such variations are ubiquitous and manifests across multiple scales with varying resolution. There is an urgent need for novel approaches that falls within the objective of precision medicine and provide novel insights into patient-specific variations and sub-populations within disease groups while discerning the disease groups of interest so as to enable timely and targeted intervention of select subjects. This study presents a selective-voting ensemble classification approach (SVA) for discerning good and poor-prognosis breast cancer samples from their 70-gene molecular expression profile revealing patient-specific variations within the poor-prognosis group. In contrast to traditional classification, SVA adapts the feature sets in a sample-specific manner capturing the proclivity of the samples to each of the disease groups. Correlation between normalized vote counts from SVA and clinical outcomes of the subjects is elucidated. Performance of Support Vector Machine and Nave Bayes classifier is investigated within the SVA framework and compared to established clinical criteria (Nottingham Prognostic Index, Adjuvant Online, St. Gallen) and Mammaprint approach.

Therefore, based on the sparse representation, a self-similarity learning method is proposed to solve the sparse coefficients so that they are more loyal to HR patches. First, the Gaussian mixture model is used to guide the grouping of internal structure similar patches. The neighbor patches of each group and their corresponding sparse coefficients maintain the local geometric angle unchanged in the embedded spaces. Furthermore, the sparse matrix corresponding to similar patches has the property of low rank to capture the global structure of the data.

This causes problems because the predictions based on the data streams become less accurate as time passes. To understand the behavior of data streams, it is important to investigate the changes of the data distributions and the causes of the changes.

Despite being studied extensively, most existing DML approaches typically adopt a single-modal learning framework that learns the distance metric on either a single feature type or a combined feature space where multiple types of features are simply concatenated. Such single-modal DML methods suffer from some critical limitations: (i) some type of features may significantly dominate the others in the DML task due to diverse feature representations; and (ii) learning a distance metric on the combined high-dimensional feature space can be extremely time-consuming using the naive feature concatenation approach. To address these limitations, in this paper, we investigate a novel scheme of online multi-modal distance metric learning (OMDML), which explores a unified two-level online learning scheme: (i) it learns to optimize a distance metric on each individual feature space; and (ii) then it learns to find the optimal combination of diverse types of features. To further reduce the expensive cost of DML on high-dimensional feature space, we propose a low-rank OMDML algorithm which not only significantly reduces the computational cost but also retains highly competing or even better learning accuracy.

Epileptic seizure can be analyzed through the normal and abnormal activity of the brain. This abnormal activity can be observed only through the use of an efficient algorithm. The process of an efficient algorithm always uses signal processing in which an epileptic signal can be considered as an input signal. This paper introduces a technique to detect epileptic signal and to compare the characteristics of the brain signals at different stages. Our algorithm is based on signal processing techniques to detect epilepsy in the EEG signal. The signal processing starts with sampling the signal at 178.6 Hz so that the signal operating frequency follows oversampling criteria. The sampled signal is given to the designed filter so that the unwanted noise can be removed and the signal is ready to be decomposed. Then, the signal is decomposed at five different signal levels so that its frequency spectrum is reduced to less than 200 Hz using different wavelet filters at each level. In the feature extraction, we have used signal features rather than statistical features so that we can still rely on time domain and frequency domain features for an EEG signal. These features are classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to detect the epilepsy in the EEG signal. The results were demonstrated for different sets of brain signal that show the normal behavior of the brain signals and epileptic behavior of the signal with seizure.

Advances like the variants of CRNN, such as Dense Convolutional Network with Connectionist Temporal Classification, has reduced the running time of the networks, but exposing the inner computation cost of the convolutional networks as a bottleneck. Specifically, DenseNet based frameworks use the dense blocks as the core module, but the inner features are combined in the form of concatenation in dense blocks. As a result, the number of channels of combined features delivered as the input of the layers close to the output and the relevant computational cost grows rapidly with the dense blocks getting deeper. This will severely bring heavy computational cost and restrict the depth of dense blocks. In this paper, we propose an efficient convolutional block called Fast Dense Block (FDB). To reduce the computing cost, we redefine and design the way of combining internal features of dense blocks. FDB is a convolutional block similarly as the dense block, but it applies both sum and concatenating operations to connect the inner features in blocks, which can reduce the computation cost to (1/L, 2/L), compared with the original dense block, where L is the number of layers in the dense block. Importantly, since the parameters of standard dense block and our new FDB keep consistent except the way of combining features, and their inputs and outputs have the same size and same number of channels, so FDB can be easily used to replace the original dense block in any DenseNet based framework. Based on the designed FDBs, we further propose a fast network of DenseNet to improve the text recognition performance in images.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1912.07016", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2996083083", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9901844", "4090186", "11084504", "14728290", "9433631", "34147506", "3074096", "14124313", "206592484", "206594692", "2930547", "7495339", "450338", "206594692", "4555207", "5590763", "206741496", "145285313", "206775459", "5808102", "9909874", "17203466", "3391687", "34000088", "6844431", "115963355", "16950249", "206593628", "1799558", "6287870", "52860328", "85543508", "13335354", "52304919", "52296618", "53301402", "19156503", "6928185", "10600578", "1518846", "206725404", "2706459", "201657369", "30005386", "623137", "3619954", "8220996", "8701"], "inbound_citations": ["210911749"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209376258"}

However, extensive positioning regions with a massive fingerprint database may cause high computational complexity and error margins, therefore clustering methods are widely applied as a solution. However, traditional clustering methods in positioning systems can only measure the similarity of the Received Signal Strength without being concerned with the continuity of physical coordinates. Besides, outage of access points could result in asymmetric matching problems which severely affect the fine positioning procedure. To solve these issues, in this paper we propose a positioning system based on the Spatial Division Clustering (SDC) method for clustering the fingerprint dataset subject to physical distance constraints. With the Genetic Algorithm and Support Vector Machine techniques, SDC can achieve higher coarse positioning accuracy than traditional clustering algorithms. In terms of fine localization, based on the Kernel Principal Component Analysis method, the proposed positioning system outperforms its counterparts based on other feature extraction methods in low dimensionality.

Weeds are undesirable plants that grow in agricultural crops, such as soybean crops, competing for elements such as sunlight and water, causing losses to crop yields. The objective of this work was to use Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNNs) to perform weed detection in soybean crop images and classify these weeds among grass and broadleaf, aiming to apply the specific herbicide to weed detected. For this purpose, a soybean plantation was carried out in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, and the Phantom DJI 3 Professional drone was used to capture a large number of crop images. With these photographs, an image database was created containing over fifteen thousand images of the soil, soybean, broadleaf and grass weeds. The Convolutional Neural Networks used in this work represent a Deep Learning architecture that has achieved remarkable success in image recognition. For the training of Neural Network the CaffeNet architecture was used. Available in Caffe software, it consists of a replication of the well known AlexNet, network which won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 (ILSVRC2012). A software was also developed, Pynoviso, which through the use of the superpixel segmentation algorithm SLIC, was used to build a robust image dataset and classify images using the model trained by Caffe software.

However, it is possible to make the individual SVMs behave nearly the same, using a simple yet effective idea we propose in this paper. Our approach makes use of two kernel matrices in each node of a network, a local kernel matrix built with only locally stored features, and an estimate of remote information (about \u201clocal\u201d kernels stored in the other nodes). Using matrix completion, remote information is fully recovered with high probability from a small set of sampled entries.

When an ECU exhibits an internal performance fault, the ECU may malfunction, while the fault condition is active, and later, it may once again give correct results when conditions change. Due to highly unpredictable nature of intermittent faults, it can be extremely difficult to diagnose them. Therefore, there is a need to enhance the fault diagnosis of intermittent faults in ECUs. In this paper, we propose an off-board, data-driven approach that can assist diagnostic engineers to investigate intermittent faults using fleet-wide field failure data. The field failure data may include a large number of intermittent faults and concomitant operating parameters (e.g., vehicle speed, engine speed, control module voltage, powertrain relay voltage, etc.) recorded at the time when the faults occurred. We describe a decision forest method to identify a reduced set of informative operating parameters, i.e., features that separate or characterize the operating conditions of the intermittent fault from baseline, i.e., classes in feature selection space.

In this study, a framework integrating numerical modeling, surrogate models and multi-objective optimization is proposed. This framework was applied to a practical case in Chengdu, China. A water quality model (MIKE21) was developed, providing training datasets for surrogate modeling. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were utilized for training surrogate models. Both surrogate models were validated with the coefficient of determinations (R2) greater than 0.98. SVM performed more stably with limited training data sizes while ANN demonstrated higher accuracies with more training samples. The multi-objective optimization model was developed using the genetic algorithm, with targets of reducing both engineering costs and target aquatic pollutant concentrations. An optimal target concentration after treatment was identified, characterized by the ammonia concentration (1.3 mg/L) in the artificial lake. Furthermore, scenarios with varying water quality in the upstream river were evaluated. Given the assumption of deteriorated upstream water quality in the future, the optimal proportion of pre-treatment in the total costs is increasing.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/w11020391", "venue": null, "journal": "Water", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2917288954", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["129737626", "27254855", "44350513", "31205467", "109269499", "16419959", "14482623", "110748952", "112230941", "140629869", "16887497", "134703168", "154340288", "7377260", "128762208", "60486887", "30042548", "3036436", "49233429", "15677980", "18383392", "156438243", "109496071", "10061700", "60631036", "129809839", "6789514", "131458217", "121392444", "18524633", "129773491", "33827786"], "inbound_citations": ["214648465"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:102494453"}

However, their manual maintenance makes a big lag between their contents and the up-to-date information of entities. Cumulative citation recommendation (CCR) concentrates on identifying worthy-citation documents from a large volume of stream data for a given target entity in knowledge bases. Most previous approaches first carefully extract human-designed features from entities and documents, and then leverage machine learning methods such as SVM and Random Forests to filter worthy-citation documents for target entities. There are some problems in handcraft features for entities and documents: (1) It is an empirical process that requires expert knowledge, thus cannot be easily generalized; (2) The effectiveness of humanly designed features has great effect on the performance; (3) The implementation of the feature extraction process is resource dependent and time-consuming. In this paper, we present a Joint Deep Neural Network Model of Entities and Documents for CCR, termed as DeepJoED, to identify highly related documents for given entities with several layers of neurons, by automatically learn feature extraction of the entities and documents, and train the networks in an end-to-end fashion.An extensive set of experiments have been conducted on the benchmark dataset provided in the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Knowledge base acceleration (KBA) task in 2012.

In this paper, we study how to improve model accuracy of GBDT while preserving the strong guarantee of differential privacy. \\textit{Sensitivity} and \\textit{privacy budget} are two key design aspects for the effectiveness of differential private models. Existing solutions for GBDT with differential privacy suffer from the significant accuracy loss due to too loose sensitivity bounds and ineffective privacy budget allocations (especially across different trees in the GBDT model). Loose sensitivity bounds lead to more noise to obtain a fixed privacy level. Ineffective privacy budget allocations worsen the accuracy loss especially when the number of trees is large. Therefore, we propose a new GBDT training algorithm that achieves tighter sensitivity bounds and more effective noise allocations. Specifically, by investigating the property of gradient and the contribution of each tree in GBDTs, we propose to adaptively control the gradients of training data for each iteration and leaf node clipping in order to tighten the sensitivity bounds. Furthermore, we design a novel boosting framework to allocate the privacy budget between trees so that the accuracy loss can be reduced.

{"paper_id": "18454590", "title": "A survey of hybrid ANN/HMM models for automatic speech recognition", "authors": [{"first": "Edmondo", "middle": [], "last": "Trentin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Marco", "middle": [], "last": "Gori", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Abstract In spite of the advances accomplished throughout the last decades, automatic speech recognition (ASR) is still a challenging and difficult task. In particular, recognition systems based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) are effective under many circumstances, but do suffer from some major limitations that limit applicability of ASR technology in real-world environments. Attempts were made to overcome these limitations with the adoption of artificial neural networks (ANN) as an alternative paradigm for ASR, but ANN were unsuccessful in dealing with long time-sequences of speech signals. Between the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, some researchers began exploring a new research area, by combining HMMs and ANNs within a single, hybrid architecture. The goal in hybrid systems for ASR is to take advantage from the properties of both HMMs and ANNs, improving flexibility and recognition performance. A variety of different architectures and novel training algorithms have been proposed in literature. This paper reviews a number of significant hybrid models for ASR, putting together approaches and techniques from a highly specialistic and non-homogeneous literature. Efforts concentrate on describing and referencing architectures and algorithms, their advantages and limitations, as well as on categorizing them into broad classes. Early attempts to emulate HMMs by ANNs are first described. Then we focus on ANNs to estimate posterior probabilities of the states of an HMM and on \u201cglobal\u201d optimization, where a single, overall training criterion is defined over the HMM and the ANNs. Connectionist vector quantization for discrete HMMs, and other more recent approaches are also reviewed. It is pointed out that, in addition to their theoretical interest, hybrid systems have been allowing for tangible improvements in recognition performance over the standard HMMs in difficult and significant benchmark tasks.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S0925-2312(00)00308-8", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2040118574", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1701422", "60437303", "207116557", "61008692", "16693657", "894840", "14298205", "27656951", "8911025", "61058350", "61058350", "14700006", "41994273", "28114910", "12767657", "1572803", "32623167", "34659398", "5536590", "19960929", "3958369", "26438179", "9049364", "61036407", "60886106", "186248191", "9923325", "8683616", "2763403", "113803681", "37480532", "40446839", "12292955", "64321642", "56858298", "44432196", "61727617", "29925383", "1975998", "12465945", "38623065", "17585358", "5657646", "61769210", "31480143", "37636425", "15375627", "58091673", "60452117", "59645163", "64582816", "5216458", "60961505", "18864457", "56673303", "58451198", "18744453", "46066535", "22735028", "19411537", "3172629", "61826819", "17868735", "10013344", "10473918", "62139126", "204173", "8013859", "14595475", "118224933", "7788300", "13618539", "11358505", "60702503", "2077908", "13281790", "11616510", "10802530", "61818881", "14570181", "62245742", "28697690", "15812234", "236321", "9563026", "18990685", "207975157", "205118721", "38265738", "60666828", "14711886", "8785536", "46411788", "5280330"], "inbound_citations": ["3090807", "19038239", "16636178", "2858317", "14727214", "8501557", "1834491", "25227079", "59288823", "44061020", "4337478", "9183991", "32822805", "33512035", "2826171", "37777845", "8813484", "13641473", "140311", "11398138", "22385929", "7634598", "214594227", "17149252", "206501104", "17643315", "52125537", "5233330", "14670355", "18254844", "19540651", "6263461", "102348696", "1743278", "16558728", "6279899", "13847952", "5464406", "8811996", "2781430", "22446496", "214672832", "17351726", "24958427", "29972858", "14862572", "15465598", "195775467", "17940604", "41674364", "86693451", "1388119", "598095", "674224", "57763972", "15297249", "8277198", "17761310", "9686396", "51800091", "17646331", "15226377", "16110982", "17363040", "8416660", "16885157", "14545785", "16653117"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18454590"}

Therefore, to get the well-pleasing input weights, two biologically inspired, unsupervised learning methods were introduced to optimize the traditional ELM networks, namely the generalized hebbian algorithm (GHA) and intrinsic plasticity learning (IPL). The GHA is able to extract the principal components of the input data of arbitrary size, while the IPL tunes the probability density of the neuron\u2019s output towards a desired distribution such as exponential distribution or weber distribution, thereby maximizing the networks information transmission. With the incorporation of the GHA and IPL approach, the optimized ELM networks generates a discriminative feature space and preserves much more characteristic of the input data, accordingly, achieving a better task performance. Based on the above two unsupervised methods, a simple, yet effective hierarchical feature mapping extreme learning machine (HFMELM) is further proposed. With almost no information loss in the layer-wise feature mapping process, the HFMELM is able to learn the high-level representation of the input data. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, extensive experiments on several datasets are presented, the results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the traditional ELM networks.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11063-018-9869-6", "venue": "Neural Processing Letters", "journal": "Neural Processing Letters", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2884154926", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["206089312", "8576181", "15589402", "15037168", "8124921", "12450925", "206757279", "7028394", "14976896", "63894699", "13998723", "26893209", "9279281", "18105393", "8327677", "1803922", "13822802", "5463828", "5769519", "35728497", "5117817", "26861163", "682660", "8515258", "43627098", "30609731", "17628627", "14555837", "15017201", "10138295", "117819162", "2825141", "6772438", "144400005", "7046067", "1578694", "7958742", "14201947", "9433631"], "inbound_citations": ["52155059", "204887188", "210845124"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51890023"}

Species distribution models (SDMs) provide useful information about potential presence or absence, and environmental conditions suitable for a species; and high\u2010resolution models across large extents are desirable. A primary feature of SDMs is the underlying spatial resolution, which can be chosen for many reasons, though we propose that a hybrid lattice, in which grid cell sizes vary with the density of forest inventory plots, provides benefits over uniform grids. We examine how the spatial grain size affected overall model performance for the Random Forest\u2010based SDM, DISTRIB, which was updated with recent forest inventories, climate, and soil data, and used a hybrid lattice derived from inventory densities. 2. Modeled habitat suitability was compared between a uniform grid of 10 \u00d7 10 and a hybrid lattice of 10 \u00d7 10 and 20 \u00d7 20 km grids to assess potential improvements. The resulting DISTRIB\u2010II models for 125 eastern U.S. tree species provide information on individual habitat suitability that can be mapped and statistically analyzed to understand current and potential changes. 3. Model performance metrics were comparable among the hybrid lattice and 10\u2010km grids; however, the hybrid lattice models generally had higher overall model reliability scores and were likely more representative of the inventory data. 4. Our efforts to update DISTRIB models with current information aims to produce a more representative depiction of recent conditions by accounting for the spatial density of forest inventory data and using the latest climate data.

Here, let us consider a simple restriction: the input is a nite sequence or it might be a singleton set. Then the restricted problem is called the grammar compression to nd the smallest CFG generating just the input. In the last decade many researchers have tackled this problem because of its scalable applications, e.g., expansion of data storage capacity, speeding-up information retrieval, DNA sequencing, frequent pattern mining, and similarity search. We would review the history of grammar compression and its wide applications together with an important future work. The study of grammar compression has begun with the bad news: the smallest CFG problem is NP-hard. Hence, the rst question is: Can we get a near-optimal solution in a polynomial time? (Is there a reasonable approximation algorithm?) And the next question is: Can we minimize the costs of time and space? (Does a linear time algorithm exist within an optimal working space?) The recent results produced by the research community answer armatively the questions. We introduce several important results and typical applications to a huge text collection. On the other hand, the shrinkage of the advantage of grammar compression is caused by the data explosion, since there is no working space for storing the whole data supplied from data stream. The last question is: How can we handle the stream data? For this question, we propose the framework of stream grammar compression for the next generation and its attractive application to fast data transmission.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ICGI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2165258139", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["64642541", "32382136", "7965436", "2167441", "6900082", "911", "60537516", "14338056", "47452971", "167324", "2852254", "281518", "18418", "6981265", "182791", "99428", "6870842", "6867226", "4595292", "52855899", "3009699", "12207519", "10328664", "195857669", "5708228", "60827152", "221927", "11707067", "10495415", "33379398", "33379398", "32679612", "3892509", "207079088", "37538129", "12470028", "19211571", "718086", "2040628", "10780522", "42755988", "29575748", "3189222", "33134272", "17734298", "15982955", "15001790", "15001790", "31911807", "14574061", "18638493", "10692517", "1649653", "9267632", "20900807"], "inbound_citations": ["1378287"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15367159"}

Recent developments in statistical classification techniques are ideally suited to this application, as they are designed to output a class label (2). Attempts to use these techniques to classify scans on a timepoint-by-timepoint basis run into problems of drift in the classifier predictions (fig. 1), which are difficult to detrend in real time (3). To circumvent this problem, we introduce the concept of an \u2018answer block\u2019, designed to compare classifier or ROI values between rest and task, allowing superior performance, probabilistic outputs and minimization of training time. Methods: Data Acquisition 16 healthy volunteers were scanned in a 3T Bruker system using echo-planar functional images (TR=1.1s, TE=27.5ms, 21 interleaved axial slices, 4mm thickness, 1mm slice-gap, 200mm FOV, 64x64 matrix). Subjects were asked to follow a task 1 / task 2 / rest paradigm for 30s blocks of each, with a selection of 4 imagery tasks: playing tennis, navigating around their house, visualizing faces and singing \u2018jingle bells\u2019 whilst remaining motionless. Between 7 and 10 blocks of each type were acquired from each subject. State Prediction The datasets were split into \u2018training\u2019 and \u2018test\u2019 sets, with the training set comprised of two full blocks of tasks and rest. Classification of a test block was made by comparing classifier prediction scores for the second half of the answer block to the first half, when subjects had been asked to change from task to rest or rest to task at the same time. If scores were higher in the first half a \u20181\u2019 was predicted, else a \u2018-1\u2019. This also allows a probabilistic response by using a t-test to compare means in the first and second halves of the block. For comparison with a more traditional interpretation, a block of the same overall length was taken with subjects maintaining the same state throughout (task or rest), and if the average classifier of scans in that block was greater than 0, a \u20181\u2019 was predicted, else \u2018-1\u2019. For ROI results, a similar scheme was employed, with average intensity values over a predetermined ROI (taken from a block design analysis of this dataset (4)) used, and a decision boundary constructed from the training data. Mathematically, answer blocks are motivated by considering that a linear classifier predicts via: prediction = w.x + b; where x is the vector of voxel intensities, and w a \u2018weight vector\u2019. The vector x of voxel intensities is composed of components relating to baseline, task activation, drift and random noise. Assuming drift is approximately equal between two adjacent blocks (reasonable if drift is low frequency) subtraction should just leave the effects of task activation and random noise, circumventing the problems of drift. Similar is also true for the ROI averaging case. Results: Using an answer block improved classification of our dataset from 53% to 84% when using a statistical classifier (Support Vector Machines, (5)) and from 53% to 64% when using simple averaging over an ROI. Discussion: Using answer blocks rather than individual classification of scans or blocks allows an experimenter to ignore effects of drift or transition scans. This may allow a reduction in length of training, as smaller training sets produce more drift, which is less of a problem when using answer blocks. We speculate that this technique could be extended to allow transmission of extra information by gaining temporal resolution of blocks, by comparing at which stage task is most significantly greater than rest. This idea will be further investigated. The ability to assign probabilistic values to classifications is of great benefit. For impaired subjects, such as minimally conscious patients, results are likely to be less clear than healthy volunteers and calculation of the degree of statistical confidence in the response is essential. Answer blocks may still be affected by drift if the magnitude of drift over a task / rest block are greater than changes due to the BOLD response. It is also still preferable to detrend drift on the training set where possible, to avoid the classifier \u2018learning\u2019 the drift to the detriment of the task / rest contrast. Whether this is realistic in cases where drift is non-linear and unpredictable remains to be discovered. Conclusions: Answer blocks improve performance of classification of fMRI into task / rest states using either ROI or machine learning techniques, whilst also giving probabilistic values for block classification.

This framework employs a low-cost \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d markerless sensor device called the Leap Motion controller (LM). During a rehabilitation procedure, we consider patients flexing and extending their fingers when their hands are placed above the LM. Various forms of measurement errors are expected including patients placing their hands out of reach of the LM \u201csweet-spot\u201d. Experimental results show that this sweet-spot is always along the middle position of the device and within 25 cm elevation above its surface. During our evaluation, data collection was conducted using an \u201cartist's hand\u201d fixed above the LM when performing static gestures. This is because artist's hand gives more accurate measurements than a human hand as it can maintain a posture as long as is required. We have applied machine learning techniques such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These techniques help in recognising and classifying performed gestures. In addition, these techniques can learn about measurement errors and compensate for them. Experimental results show a significant benefit when applying LDA and SVM yielding a performance accuracy above 88 %, which is far better than the baseline performance of 67.25%. Furthermore, as our approach enables more accurate measurements to be obtained, more meaningful feedback can be generated to help the patients that make use of the LM for hand rehabilitation exercises.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/iccece46942.2019.8941805", "venue": "2019 International Conference on Computing, Electronics & Communications Engineering (iCCECE)", "journal": "2019 International Conference on Computing, Electronics & Communications Engineering (iCCECE)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2996808144", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["49888433", "8755975", "15491372", "18185069", "3119257", "6839194", "6721504", "194951", "28193137", "17907083", "17914369", "113580300", "11288368", "1818831"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209496694"}

Utilization of solid magnetic refrigerant in MRT aids its compactness and enhances environmental friendliness system of refrigeration. Manganite refrigerants have recently attracted attention from experimental and modeling perspectives due to its stability, cost-effectiveness as well as tunable magnetic properties as compared to the existing metal gadolinium refrigerant. However, magnetic ordering temperature of manganite refrigerants plays a crucial role in the implementation of MRT at ambient condition.

Similarly, EMS performs better than the conventional SVR-based model as well as GSA-optimized SVR-based model (GSVR).

The results from breast cancer data set depicts that when the number of instances increased from 286 to 699, the percentage of correctly classified instances increased from 69.23% to 96.13% for Random Forest i.e. for dataset with same number of attributes but having more instances, the Random Forest accuracy increased.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "38301456", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["59849738", "1159048", "89141", "206420153", "12470146", "89141", "12980089", "9372284", "9056508", "9952478", "9442002", "17584818", "11204830", "89141", "1117445", "16009674"], "inbound_citations": ["54436843", "6785059", "25503281", "54017674", "15648676", "210891001", "204812090", "213185464", "211248886", "201131358", "11286786", "209449070", "11082065", "55883721", "210848042", "199573806", "62337444", "2573011", "62088495", "15842676", "201847485", "214623831", "214611167", "209494687", "202780721", "61806176", "3303469", "54832431", "48354864", "213180862", "49672676", "199011573", "159043419", "35861557", "51995848", "57721211", "17619211", "213185538", "15689705", "67769812", "201239673", "59554918", "18680988", "201803668", "209382779", "201046993", "16010698", "17158638", "17401898", "210133060", "19652730", "30578093", "166222759", "56657824", "54932890", "30857679", "209898745", "213175906", "37959503", "195842881", "211297377", "86400002", "146118721", "204919593", "18888277", "17250698", "56439199", "15297617", "212633779", "199551162", "207994469", "3941815", "49188165", "53356129", "6900396"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11193695"}

MTL provides a natural framework for exchanging information across the narrowband signal-approximation problems and constructing an aggregate (across frequencies) source-localization map. Efficient algorithms based on block coordinate descent (BCD) are developed for solving the source-localization problem. Complex-valued predictor screening rules for reducing the computational complexity of the algorithm are also developed.

In this work, we propose KinNet, a fine-to-coarse deep metric learning framework for kinship verification. In the framework, we transfer knowledge from the large-scale-data-driven face recognition task, which is a fine-grained version of kinship recognition, by pre-training the network with massive data for face recognition. Then, the network is fine-tuned to find a metric space where kin-related peoples are discriminant. The metric space is learned by minimizing a soft triplet loss on the augmented kinship dataset. An augmented strategy is proposed to balance the amount of images per family member. Finally, we ensemble four networks to further boost the performance.

Advanced image processing techniques together with robust classifier using two-dimensional (2D) echocardiograms may aid for automated classification of the extent of infarcted myocardium. Therefore, this paper proposes novel algorithms namely Curvelet Transform (CT) and Local Configuration Pattern (LCP) for an automated detection of normal, moderately infarcted and severely infarcted myocardium using 2D echocardiograms. The methodology extracts the LCP features from CT coefficients of echocardiograms. The obtained features are subjected to Marginal Fisher Analysis (MFA) dimensionality reduction technique followed by fuzzy entropy based ranking method. Different classifiers are used to differentiate ranked features into three classes normal, moderate and severely infarcted based on the extent of damage to myocardium. The developed algorithm has achieved an accuracy of 98.99%, sensitivity of 98.48% and specificity of 100% for Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using only six features. Furthermore, we have developed an integrated index called Myocardial Infarction Risk Index (MIRI) to detect the normal, moderately and severely infarcted myocardium using a single number. The proposed system may aid the clinicians in faster identification and quantification of the extent of infarcted myocardium using 2D echocardiogram.

In contrast to previous studies using simplified stimuli, we designed a scenario with four animated avatars and observed that the magnitude and extension of the visual bias are related to the semantics embedded in the scene, i.e., visual cues that are congruent with environmental statistics (moving lips and vocalization) induce the strongest bias. We implement a deep learning model that processes stereophonic sound, facial features, and body motion to trigger a discrete behavioural response. After training the model, we exposed the iCub to the same experimental conditions as the human subjects, showing that the robot can replicate similar responses in real time.

That is, this study suggests the classification process using canonical correlation classification technique after principal component analysis for the mixed multitemporal data. The result of this proposed classification process is compared with the canonical correlation classification result of one date images, multitemporal imagery and a mixed image after principal component analysis for one date images. The satellite images which are used are the Landsat 5 TM images acquired on July 26, 1994 and September 1, 1996. Ground truth data for accuracy assessment is obtained from topographic map and aerial photograph, and all of the study area is used for accuracy assessment. The proposed compound classification process showed superior efficiency to appling canonical correlation classification technique for only one date image in classification accuracy by 8.2%. Especially, it was valid in classifying mixed urban area correctly. Conclusively, to improve the classification accuracy when extracting land cover information using Landsat TM image, appling canonical correlation classification technique after principal component analysis for multitemporal imagery is very useful.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "847337008", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126839204"}

The refraction power of this lens is specified by ophthalmologists before the surgery. There are different formulas that propose the IOL power based on corneal power and axial length. Six common formulas is used in this study and the one which minimizes the postoperative error for a specific patient have to be selected. Methods - Refraction is measured three times at most, during six month after surgery and the best result is considered as postoperative refraction for each patient. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify the data to two groups based on axial length and corneal power. Each class needs a formula with a specific tendency toward stronger or weaker IOL lenses according to the feature vector. Results - Experimental tests lead to a nearly diagonal confusion matrix which supports the performance of the proposed method strongly. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is 0.47 which shows 6% decrease in postoperative refraction error compared to the best reported result. Conclusions - In calculating IOL power, we expect stronger IOL powers for eyes having shorter axial length or weaker corneal power. In the contrary, a weaker IOL power is expected for longer axial length and stronger corneal power. But experimental results show that for the first group, formulas proposing weaker powers win the race for decreased postoperative refraction error while for the second group, formulas leading to stronger powers perform better. This shows that these formulas overestimate and underestimate for marginal cases.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2586971495", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["34869374", "52874011", "36695883", "38953511", "6288316", "13361605", "36422232", "25454035", "116001059", "21799030", "7055318"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59054344"}

Characteristic features of the hand are initially extracted from images captured by the surface's camera system and then classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

In this paper, we explored transfer learning for gastrointestinal bleeding detection on small-size imbalanced endoscopy images, and showed how image representations learned with CNN on large-scale annotated datasets can be efficiently transferred to other tasks with limited amount of training data. We first transferred pre-trained Inception V3 model trained on the ImageNet dataset to compute mid-level image representation, and then fine-tuned the trained model with labeled endoscopy images, and resumed training from already learned weights. Additionally, we introduce both data augmentation and image resampling to increase the size of the training database and the positive sample rate to perform the Transfer Learning.
