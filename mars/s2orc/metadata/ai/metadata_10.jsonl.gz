With the development of the economy, the demand for logistics benefits is becoming more important. The appropriate use of technologies related to IoT to improve logistics efficiency, such as cloud computing, mobile computing and data mining, has become a topic of considerable research interest. Picking operations are currently an extremely important and cumbersome aspect of logistics center tasks. To shorten the picking distance and improve work efficiency, this paper uses the genetic algorithm, ant colony algorithm and cuckoo algorithm to optimize the picking path in a fishbone-layout warehouse and establishes an optimized model of the warehouse picking path under the fishbone layout. Data-mining technology is used to simulate the model and obtain the simulation data under the condition of multiple orders. The results provide a theoretical basis for the study of the fishbone-layout picking path model and has certain practical significance for the efficient operation of logistics enterprises. Through optimization, it is conducive to the sustainable development of enterprises and to achieving long-term profitability.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/su11041148", "venue": null, "journal": "Sustainability", "mag_id": "2916248842", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211541480"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:159358128"}

Physical contact between a robot and human operator establishes a coupled system with stability and performance characteristics partly dependent on interaction port impedance behavior. Operator impedance is estimated in this research based on changes in arm muscle activity, recorded through electromyographic (EMG) signals. A switching impedance controller employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for operator state estimation is used in an interaction system with a one degree-of-freedom haptic device. Results from performance (e.g. speed, accuracy) trials investigating a stochastic approach to position control are presented in comparison to other standard approaches. This research serves a basis for the exploration of advanced control tools and ultimately developing a novel human-robot interface.

However, current methods face great challenges in video subtitle recognition, due to complex backgrounds, diverse fonts, and low contrast between texts and backgrounds. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end pipeline for recognizing subtitles of video. Connectionist Text Proposal Network (CTPN) is utilized for video subtitle detection, while Residual Network (ResNet), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) are used to recognize Chinese and English subtitles in video images. Specifically, the subtitle area in video images is firstly located via the CTPN method. Afterwards, the detected subtitle area is inputted into the ResNet for extracting the feature sequences. Next, a bidirectional GRU layer is employed to model the feature sequences. Finally, CTC is adopted to calculate the loss and output the final result. On two public datasets ICDAR2003 and ICDAR2013, the proposed method can get better performance with 92.3% and 89.2% recognition accuracy in all of the current methods.

For steganalysis, we have extracted 548-dimensional merge features and trained ELM to approximate the functional relationship between the merge features and class label. Further, we use a cognitive ensemble of ELM classifier with risk-sensitive hinge loss function for accurate steganalysis. As the hinge loss error function is shown to be better than mean-squared error function for classification problems, here, the individual ELM classifiers are developed based on hinge loss error function. The cognition in the ensemble of ELM obtains the weighted sum of individual classifiers by enhancing the outputs of winning classifiers for a sample, while penalizing the other classifiers for the sample. Thus, the cognitive ensemble ELM classifier positively exploits the effect of initialization in each classifier to obtain the best results.

In this study, we compare the classification accuracy among nine decision tree methods; which are divided into two main categories; the first is single decision tree C4.5, CART, Decision Stump, Random Tree and REPTree. The second category is ensample decision tree such Bagging (C4.5 and REPTree), AdaBoost (C4.5 and REPTree), ADTree, and Random Forests. In addition to the previous comparative analyses, we evaluate the behaviors of these methods with/without applying attribute selection (A.S.) techniques such as Chi-square attribute selection and Gain Ratio attribute selection. Usually, the ensembles learning methods: bagging, boosting, and Random Forest; enhanced classification accuracy of single decision tree due to the natures of its mechanism which generate several classifiers from one dataset and vote for their classification decision. The values of enhancement fluctuate between (4.99\u20136.19%). In majority of datasets and classification methods, Gain ratio attribute selection slightly enhanced the classification accuracy (\u223c1.05%) due to the concentration on the most promising genes having the effective information gain that discriminate the dataset.

Secondly, the spectral and textural features are extracted by the statistical tonal analysis and gray level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) of the sky image. Finally, a c-support vector classification (C-SVC) model with radial basis function (RBF) kernel function is built to classify the different clouds in the sky images.

It is acknowledged that Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) as the observation density functions achieve excellent digit recognition performance at high signal to noise ratios (SNRs). Moreover, many years of research have led to good techniques to reduce the impact of noise, distortion and mismatch between training and test conditions on the recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, we still await systems that are truly robust against these confounding factors. The present paper extends recent work on acoustic modeling based on Reservoir Computing (RC), a concept that has its roots in Machine Learning. By introducing a novel analysis of reservoirs as non-linear dynamical systems, new insights are gained and translated into a new reservoir design recipe that is extremely simple and highly comprehensible in terms of the dynamics of the acoustic features and the modeled acoustic units. By tuning the reservoir to these dynamics, one can create RC-based systems that not only compete well with conventional systems in clean conditions, but also degrade more gracefully in noisy conditions.

Identification of central people may be used to inform building an efficient surveillance and prevention program. ::: Methods ::: Three social contact network models were used in this thesis, Erdos-Renyi network, Barabasi-Albert network and Jefferson County contact network using FRED platform. We simulated mild and severe epidemic outbreaks on them and calculated infection risk and infection speed of each individual. Network measurements, degree, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, PageRank, and clustering coefficient were measured on the ability to identify groups of different infection risk level and infection speed. Random Forest and variable importance were used to estimate the most important factors in predicting infection risk ::: Results ::: For Barabasi-Albert and Erdos-Renyi networks, centrality measurements are critical factors in identifying infection risk. Degree is the most important factor in Barabasi-Albert network while closeness and degree are the most important in the mild outbreak and severe outbreak respectively in the Erdos-Renyi network. Results of Jefferson County contact network in FRED find out the importance of location sizes. The highly clustered structure of location-based model makes betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient important in predicting infection risk. ::: Conclusion ::: Different network structures and characteristics of the disease will influence the importance of network measurements. Network structures also influence the correlations between network measurements. Random forest is a powerful tool for classifying infection risk.

Most criminals try to disguise their voice before making a malefic call or a terrorist threat. Their aim is to change the register of their voice quality in order to falsify their identity (voice disguise) or to mimic the voice of another person (voice forgery). This chapter proposes to analyse two different kinds of disguise: The first is the transformation of the voice by non-electronic and deliberate means; the second is the conversion of the voice by electronic and deliberate means. By considering both kinds of disguise (electronic and non-electronic) our analyses of voice transformation are based on an acoustic approach, which we use to measure specific changes in speech, and on an automatic approach to detect voice disguise. Four kinds of disguises which are considered the most common are studied: high pitched voice, low pitched voice, a hand over the mouth and pinched nostrils. A constraint of audibility and intelligibility has been imposed on the speakers who have recorded the database. The acoustic analysis of specific features reveals some differences according to the form of disguise, while in the automatic experiment we found the best way to detect a voice disguise is to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) technique. The level of performance is an AUC (area under curve) at 0.79.

H.264/AVC provides a major advance on preceding video coding standards obtaining as much as twice the coding efficiency over these standards (Richardson I.E.G., 2003, Wiegand T. & Sullivan G.J., 2007). Furthermore, this new codec inserts video related information within network abstraction layer units (NALUs), which facilitates the transmission of H.264/AVC coded sequences over a variety of network environments (Stockhammer, T. & Hannuksela M.M., 2005) making it applicable for a broad range of applications such as TV broadcasting, mobile TV, video-on-demand, digital media storage, high definition TV, multimedia streaming and conversational applications. Real-time wireless conversational and broadcast applications are particularly challenging as, in general, reliable delivery cannot be guaranteed (Stockhammer, T. & Hannuksela M.M., 2005). The H.264/AVC standard specifies several error resilient strategies to minimise the effect of transmission errors on the perceptual quality of the reconstructed video sequences. However, these methods assume a packet-loss scenario where the receiver discards and conceals all the video information contained within a corrupted NALU packet. This implies that the error resilient methods adopted by the standard operate at a lower bound since not all the information contained within a corrupted NALU packet is un-utilizable (Stockhammer, T. et al., 2003). Decoding partially damaged bitstreams, where only corrupted MBs are concealed, may be advantageous over the standard approach. However, visually distorted regions which are not accurately detected by the syntax analysis of the decoder generally cause severe reduction in quality experienced by the end-user. This chapter investigates the application of pixel-level artefact detection mechanisms which can be employed to detect the visually impaired regions to be concealed. It further shows that heuristic thresholds are not applicable for these scenarios. On the other hand, applying machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can significantly increase the decoder\u2019s capability of detecting visual distorted regions. Simulation results will show that the SVMs manage to detect 94.6% of the visually impaired MBs resulting in Peak Signal-to-Noise (PSNR) gains of up to 10.59 dB on a", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/8026", "venue": "Digital Video", "journal": "Digital Video", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1596410913", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["23421961", "17516772", "18367144", "3622329", "18112109", "8753756", "52874011", "17297979", "23175660", "12132121", "6067055", "7597857", "1536643", "9107511", "14465079", "12943358", "39518831", "15662973", "26881819", "42079998", "14047450", "13952716", "15338195", "1880126", "1635680", "14067434", "7990036", "44342320", "6246867", "41574353", "9319079", "13028774", "59789274", "6915376", "15484771", "15352869"], "inbound_citations": ["18719795"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54920799"}

SMO sequentially picks a pair of training samples for joint optimization, which minimizes the usage of memory. However, to find such two samples, SMO uses one outer loop through the entire training set looking for a sample which violates the KKT conditions, and one inner loop to look for a sample which heuristically maximizes the increase of the SVM objective function. While there is limited room for improvement in the inner loop, the outer loop can be reduced significantly if we can locate a small subset of training samples which potentially contains the Support Vectors (SVs).We present a Fisher Discriminant Analysis(FDA) based approach to locate potential SVs in a small core subset, which enables the SVM training to be focused effectively on a promising small region instead of the entire SV-sparse training set.

Mammography is currently the best method for early detection. Due to the breast tissue type and different kinds of lesions, by using low dose x-ray in mammography, the detection of lesions in mammograms becomes very ambiguous and a tedious work . Early detection is the most effective ways to reduce the mortality rate. Our main aim in this paper is detection and recognition of tumors in digital mammograms. Mammograms usually have a large size so the processing of the entire mammogram takes a lot of time. To reduce the size and therefore the processing time and also to decrease the False Positive Rate, a two-step algorithm is used. At the first step some unimportant regions such as background and pectoral muscle are eliminated and at the second step an ROI detection algorithm is proposed which extracts the most likely regions to tumors. To recognize the tumors in the detected regions, some features are extracted from each region. To find the most effective features for tumor detection, several data mining feature extraction and feature selection methods are used and then compared. To increase the performance and reduce the number of features a GA based algorithm is proposed. Finally, SVM is used as our classifier, because it has the best results in comparison with other tools in our application. Experimental results show that the performance of proposed methods is better than other previous methods.

Generally, the gaming community disapproves of the use of game bots, as bot users obtain unreasonable rewards without corresponding efforts. However, bots are hard to detect because they are designed to simulate human game playing behavior and they follow game rules exactly. Existing detection approaches either disrupt players' gaming experiences, or they assume game bots are run as standalone clients or assigned a specific goal, such as aim bots in FPS games. In this paper, we propose a manifold learning approach for detecting game bots. It is a general technique that can be applied to any game in which avatars' movement is controlled by the players directly. Through real-life data traces, we show that the trajectories of human players and those of game bots are very different. In addition, although game bots may endeavor to simulate players' decisions, certain human behavior patterns are difficult to mimic because they are AI-hard. Taking Quake 2 as a case study, we evaluate our scheme's performance based on real-life traces.

First, we present a thorough experimental study to show the superiority of the generalization capability of the support vector machine (SVM) approach in the automatic classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) beats. Second, we propose a novel classification system based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve the generalization performance of the SVM classifier. For this purpose, we have optimized the SVM classifier design by searching for the best value of the parameters that tune its discriminant function, and upstream by looking for the best subset of features that feed the classifier. The experiments were conducted on the basis of ECG data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database to classify five kinds of abnormal waveforms and normal beats. In particular, they were organized so as to test the sensitivity of the SVM classifier and that of two reference classifiers used for comparison, i.e., the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier and the radial basis function (RBF) neural network classifier, with respect to the curse of dimensionality and the number of available training beats. The obtained results clearly confirm the superiority of the SVM approach as compared to traditional classifiers, and suggest that further substantial improvements in terms of classification accuracy can be achieved by the proposed PSO-SVM classification system. On an average, over three experiments making use of a different total number of training beats (250, 500, and 750, respectively), the PSO-SVM yielded an overall accuracy of 89.72% on 40438 test beats selected from 20 patient records against 85.98%, 83.70%, and 82.34% for the SVM, the kNN, and the RBF classifiers, respectively.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "18779082", "doi": "10.1109/TITB.2008.923147", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2125654608", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["6964298", "121975815", "206608886", "7832643", "11704561", "17011989", "7153167", "2863817", "28637672", "1375403", "2474873", "15966549", "6906514", "8122137", "15874442", "110593930", "20845798", "41404305", "207930805", "12564685", "1013798", "62698647"], "inbound_citations": ["46973202", "13892369", "35439862", "20398801", "15525410", "54476491", "96427796", "115114812", "62759960", "10214884", "16477385", "208039758", "14161658", "24850185", "195883619", "16051522", "111285465", "35074645", "18784091", "73609005", "56085978", "4932887", "419045", "54460641", "3101667", "53280813", "25130870", "11252923", "8019295", "211233296", "16639030", "201742355", "8399984", "7438472", "67443621", "53043105", "28782266", "13971020", "55440560", "24623215", "16374741", "60701264", "77389807", "31993620", "10506487", "54464404", "63207435", "15135462", "6811852", "3893644", "52899614", "197867568", "3668547", "198146374", "54476005", "19701690", "49331541", "13819876", "16074197", "16333771", "17224931", "54205675", "60857877", "17402000", "20748621", "43602306", "51993253", "46429111", "215098087", "11747237", "13223828", "203605241", "11804170", "32683276", "14640851", "13936588", "36232906", "4081925", "206549822", "59528160", "32354775", "209457339", "16124021", "22960025", "17281716", "3101536", "135253831", "19132545", "35540493", "97807677", "16790767", "29946379", "198930917", "3722646", "16896506", "1700138", "7796456", "1744477", "44035742", "18574980", "30274258", "18223710", "204821898", "189817274", "5877143", "16245691", "19035498", "15253094", "20091358", "15545281", "557646", "3005087", "30252202", "14493357", "7333295", "15033389", "46807917", "21571592", "9648225", "13829996", "1469472", "155102340", "43553207", "15310873", "18227818", "14118914", "3299304", "18998885", "28875557", "55881080", "209335524", "14931461", "22853731", "215552618", "4888744", "204046", "25602303", "40534820", "14040593", "16681328", "214734864", "196178922", "16431040", "4801656", "17531426", "31662782", "13976104", "34636518", "67789055", "11528070", "16049400", "54603323", "22096632", "62700873", "25033083", "13318378", "204081428", "18979477", "3664004", "31472826", "22412388", "114672629", "203567114", "45733238", "25460010", "21400692", "2716708", "7919402", "12231547", "32803115", "120189807", "26043020", "53365281", "28398899", "6246840", "7083286", "202095569", "35674678", "201142398", "14350501", "17064885", "17880211", "17910090", "9080488", "5360953", "15460543", "5106093", "55544413", "10957696", "54034273"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7854606"}

To address this issue, in this paper, a novel concept transfer learning approach is proposed.

A hierarchical semantic representation for concepts is proposed, where a semantic slot is represented as a composition of {\\em atomic concepts}. Based on this new hierarchical representation, transfer learning approaches are developed for adaptive LU.

Therefore, an accurate prediction of the inhabitant behavior is very helpful to provide the required assistance. This work aims to propose a prediction model that satisfies the accuracy as well as the rapidity of the learning phase. To do so, we propose to improve the existing extreme learning machine (ELM) model by defining a recurrent form. This form ensures a temporal relationship of inputs between observations at different time steps. The new model uses feedback connections to the input layer from the output layer which allows the output to be included in the long-term prediction. A recurrent dynamic network, with feedback connections of the output of the network, is proposed to predict the future series representing future activities of the inhabitant.

Moreover, considering that the experiments of marine diesel engines are always time, money and energy consuming, the main purpose of this study is to determine the better predictive approach based on a small amount of training data.

The mental stress level are measured using the Perceived Stress Scale 14 (PSS-14) and categorized into stressed and stress-free groups. The proposed BCI is then used to classify the subjects' mental stress level on EEG features extracted using the Higuchi's fractal dimension of EEG, Gaussian mixtures of EEG spectrogram, and Magnitude Square Coherence Estimation (MSCE) between the EEG channels. Classification on the EEG features are then performed using the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Many spam detection techniques based on machine learning techniques have been proposed. As the amount of spam has been increased tremendously using bulk mailing tools, spam detection techniques should counteract with it. To cope with this, parameters optimization and feature selection have been used to reduce processing overheads while guaranteeing high detection rates. However, previous approaches have not taken into account feature variable importance and optimal number of features. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no approach which uses both parameters optimization and feature selection together for spam detection. In this paper, we propose a spam detection model enabling both parameters optimization and optimal feature selection; we optimize two parameters of detection models using Random Forests (RF) so as to maximize the detection rates. We provide the variable importance of each feature so that it is easy to eliminate the irrelevant features. Furthermore, we decide an optimal number of selected features using two methods; (i) only one parameters optimization during overall feature selection and (ii) parameters optimization in every feature elimination phase. Finally, we evaluate our spam detection model with cost-sensitive measures to avoid misclassification of legitimate messages, since the cost of classifying a legitimate message as a spam far outweighs the cost of classifying a spam as a legitimate message.

In this paper, an optimized genetic-neuro-fuzzy controller is proposed. This controller works in according with a real-time optimization algorithm which optimally combines the features of Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks. The genetic procedures search the optimal membership functions whereas the neural methods optimize the fuzzy rules. The target is to reduce the settling time and rise time with overshoot equal to zero. The novelty of this approach is that the optimization procedures occur at the same time and not separately. The results show that the settling time and the rise time are reduced by comparing them with the same quantities of optimized PD and PID controllers.

This paper presents a discriminative data representation learning framework by employing a simple yet powerful marginal regression function with probabilistic graphical structure adaptation. A marginally structured representation learning (MSRL) method is proposed by seamlessly incorporating distinguishable regression targets analysis, graph structure adaptation, and robust linear structural learning into a joint framework. Specifically, MSRL learns marginal regression targets from data rather than exploiting the conventional zero\u2013one matrix that greatly hinders the freedom of regression fitness and degrades the performance of regression results. Meanwhile, an optimized graph regularization term with self-improving adaptation is constructed based on probabilistic connection knowledge to improve the compactness of the learned representation. Additionally, the regression targets are further predicted by utilizing the explanatory factors from the latent subspace of data, which can uncover the underlying feature correlations to enhance the reliability.

The proposed algorithm is composed of two stages: the multilayer ELM (ML-ELM) feature mapping stage and the ELM learning stage. The ML-ELM feature mapping stage is recursively built by alternating between feature map construction and maximum pooling operation. In particular, the input weights for constructing feature maps are randomly generated and hence need not be trained or tuned, which makes the algorithm highly efficient. Moreover, the maximum pooling operation enables the algorithm to be invariant to certain transformations. During the ELM learning stage, elastic-net regularization is proposed to learn the output weight. Elastic-net regularization helps to learn more compact and meaningful output weight. In addition, we preprocess the input data with the dense scale-invariant feature transform operation to improve both the robustness and invariance of the algorithm.

However, achieving full automation of insulator defect detection is still very challenging due to the visual complexity of defects and the small number of defective insulators. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a novel insulator surface defect detection system using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed system consists of two stages. First, a Faster R-CNN network is adopted to localize the key catenary components, and the image areas that contain the insulators are obtained. Then, the classification score and anomaly score are determined from a deep multitask neural network that is composed of a deep material classifier and a deep denoising autoencoder. The defect state is determined by analyzing the classification score and anomaly score.

These frameworks rarely match the accuracy of state-of-the-art ensemble approaches. For many data stream tasks, speed is important: fast, accurate frameworks are needed for time-dependent applications. We propose the Enhanced Concept Profiling Framework (ECPF), which aims to recognise recurring concepts and reuse a classifier trained previously, enabling accurate classification immediately following a drift. The novelty of ECPF is in how it uses similarity of classifications on new data, between a new classifier and existing classifiers, to quickly identify the best classifier to reuse. It always trains both a new classifier and a reused classifier, and retains the more accurate classifier when concept drift occurs. Finally, it creates a copy of reused classifiers, so a classifier well-suited for a recurring concept will not be impacted by being trained on a different concept. In our experiments, ECPF classifies significantly more accurately than a state-of-the-art classifier reuse framework (Diversity Pool) and a state-of-the-art ensemble technique (Adaptive Random Forest) on synthetic datasets with recurring concepts.

With the advent of the connectionist model of brain function, features from brain networks may provide increased discriminatory power for brain state classification. ::: ::: ::: METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS ::: In this study, we introduce a novel framework where in both functional connectivity (FC) based on instantaneous temporal correlation and effective connectivity (EC) based on causal influence in brain networks are used as features in an SVM classifier. In order to derive those features, we adopt a novel approach recently introduced by us called correlation-purged Granger causality (CPGC) in order to obtain both FC and EC from fMRI data simultaneously without the instantaneous correlation contaminating Granger causality. In addition, statistical learning is accelerated and performance accuracy is enhanced by combining recursive cluster elimination (RCE) algorithm with the SVM classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of the CPGC-based RCE-SVM approach using a specific instance of brain state classification exemplified by disease state prediction. Accordingly, we show that this approach is capable of predicting with 90.3% accuracy whether any given human subject was prenatally exposed to cocaine or not, even when no significant behavioral differences were found between exposed and healthy subjects. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE ::: The framework adopted in this work is quite general in nature with prenatal cocaine exposure being only an illustrative example of the power of this approach. In any brain state classification approach using neuroimaging data, including the directional connectivity information may prove to be a performance enhancer. When brain state classification is used for disease state prediction, our approach may aid the clinicians in performing more accurate diagnosis of diseases in situations where in non-neuroimaging biomarkers may be unable to perform differential diagnosis with certainty.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3000328", "pubmed_id": "21151556", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0014277", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1971917261", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["10810368", "5277499", "1909790", "12776668", "147650429", "20744508", "15259731", "23130484", "37916704", "40414537", "20506392", "2932786", "25301946", "39551002", "23844127", "14669455", "25154270", "31492850", "24169837", "13565578", "17059664", "55855868", "42934248", "123722079", "7138354", "62634291", "1366011", "6209399", "207165665", "17161344", "12127679", "1620323", "6185169", "37853169", "1456297", "2757918"], "inbound_citations": ["14241139", "39731647", "6227286", "5001073", "9084216", "208539679", "34018224", "14651543", "202583057", "18501488", "5835640", "215470431", "6840802", "59410716", "215429808", "211228581", "25466422", "2094490", "3663407", "199155704", "39581179", "14615148", "215009037", "6873593", "214938048", "24349065", "11848874", "45508733", "2099553", "215178360", "18714616", "18790663", "11709205", "215472742", "17722076", "3763249", "25796297"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14905857"}

Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and DACE models have been used, but Genetic Programming is another way to create surrogate models and little research has been done about it. An advantage of using simpler models in small satellite missions, such as Cubesats, is that they are less demanding regarding circuits (both in money and in power consumption) and memory.

The proposed solution involves deriving a signed distance map for each semantic class from a ground truth label map and training a DCNN to predict this distance map instead of a score map for each class. Since the distance between a target pixel and its nearest object boundary measures how far the pixel penetrates an object, the distance maps encode spatial context, particularly spatial smoothness. Positive pixel values in the distance maps correspond to the correct class and negative values correspond to the incorrect class. A final label map is derived from the predicted distance maps by selecting the class with the maximum distance. Since neighboring pixels in the distance maps have similar values, the segmentation results are smoother than current approaches. The results are shown to be even better than performing post-processing using fully connected Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), a common approach to smoothing the segmentations produced DCNNs. Experimental results on the semantic labeling challenge dataset show the proposed approach outperforms most state-of-the-art methods. Our main contribution, though, is the novel idea of replacing the pixel-wise class score maps of DCNNs with distance maps. This is therefore orthogonal and complementary to other techniques employed by the state-of-the-art methods and could therefore be used to improve upon them.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.01.023", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "3004996399", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214341374"}

This approach is particularly useful for perennial crops such as oil palm, which have long breeding cycles, and for which the optimal method for GS is still under debate. In this study, we evaluated the effect of different marker systems and modeling methods for implementing GS in an introgressed dura family derived from a Deli dura x Nigerian dura (Deli x Nigerian) with 112 individuals. This family is an important breeding source for developing new mother palms for superior oil yield and bunch characters. The traits of interest selected for this study were fruit-to-bunch (F/B), shell-to-fruit (S/F), kernel-to-fruit (K/F), mesocarp-to-fruit (M/F), oil per palm (O/P) and oil-to-dry mesocarp (O/DM). The marker systems evaluated were simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). RR-BLUP, Bayesian A, B, C\u03c0, LASSO, Ridge Regression and two machine learning methods (SVM and Random Forest) were used to evaluate GS accuracy of the traits.ResultsThe kinship coefficient between individuals in this family ranged from 0.35 to 0.62. S/F and O/DM had the highest genomic heritability, whereas F/B and O/P had the lowest. The accuracies using 135 SSRs were low, with accuracies of the traits around 0.20. The average accuracy of machine learning methods was 0.24, as compared to 0.20 achieved by other methods. The trait with the highest mean accuracy was F/B (0.28), while the lowest were both M/F and O/P (0.18). By using whole genomic SNPs, the accuracies for all traits, especially for O/DM (0.43), S/F (0.39) and M/F (0.30) were improved. The average accuracy of machine learning methods was 0.32, compared to 0.31 achieved by other methods.ConclusionDue to high genomic resolution, the use of whole-genome SNPs improved the efficiency of GS dramatically for oil palm and is recommended for dura breeding programs.

Despite obvious benefits, their use is often limited to an academic context, largely because of expensive domain customizations, which means that the performance in domain-specific applications often fails to meet expectations. This article proposes cost-efficient remedies: (i) we leverage metadata through a filtering mechanism, which increases the precision of document retrieval, and (ii) we develop a novel fuse-and-oversample approach for transfer learning to improve the performance of answer extraction. Here, knowledge is inductively transferred from related, yet different, tasks to the domain-specific application, while accounting for potential differences in the sample sizes across both tasks. The resulting performance is demonstrated with actual use cases from a finance company and the film industry, where fewer than 400 question-answer pairs had to be annotated to yield significant performance gains.

We identify four potential benefits of Cloud Robotics and Automation: 1) Big Data: access to remote libraries of images, maps, trajectories, and object data, 2) Cloud Computing: access to parallel grid computing on demand for statistical analysis, learning, and motion planning, 3) Collective Robot Learning: robots sharing trajectories, control policies, and outcomes, and 4) Human computation: using crowdsourcing access to remote human expertise for analyzing images, classification, learning, and error recovery.We present four Cloud Robotics and Automation systems in this dissertation. First, we develop a system for Cloud-based grasping of 2D polygonal objects with uncertainty in shape using an analytic conservative estimate of the probability of force closure. Second, we develop a system for Cloud-based grasping of 2D polygonal objects with uncertainty in pose, using a quasi-static simulation that is less conservative than the approach for the first system. These two systems demonstrate the usefulness of Cloud-based parallelism for handling uncertainty. Third, we develop a system for recognizing and grasping household objects using the Google Object Recognition Engine as a web service and using Cloud storage of object and grasp information.

With the help of real dataset it is demonstrated that the latter approach will be better than Clustering based pre-fetching technique with traditional caching policy like LRU in terms of bandwidth utilization and access latency.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.15866/irecos.v9i8.2594", "venue": null, "journal": "International Review on Computers and Software", "mag_id": "2051839756", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202893618"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62768987"}

The latest research shows that the convolutional neural network (CNN) still dominates the image semantic segmentation field. However, down-sampling operated during the training process of CNNs leads to unclear segmentation boundaries and poor classification accuracy. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep architecture, termed FuseCRFNet, which seamlessly incorporates a fully-connected Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model into a depth-based CNN framework. The proposed segmentation method uses the properties of pixel-to-pixel relationships to increase the accuracy of image semantic segmentation. More importantly, we formulate the CRF as one of the layers in FuseCRFNet to refine the coarse segmentation in the forward propagation, in meanwhile, it passes back the errors to facilitate the training.

Field monitoring is necessary to acquire an exact image of activity and performance in the field. However, recording, managing and interpreting leakage current waveforms, the shape of which is correlated to surface activity, is a major task. The problem is commonly by-passed with the extraction, recording and investigation of values related to peak and charge, an approach reported to produce questionable results. The present thesis focuses on the investigation and classification of field leakage current waveforms. At first, a detailed background of measuring and analyzing leakage current both in lab and field conditions is provided. Then, the monitoring sites, two 150kV Substations, as well as the developed custom-made software and the newly constructed High Voltage Test Station where the results of this thesis are to be implemented, is briefly described. More than 100.000 waveforms are investigated, recorded through a period exceeding ten years. Field related noise is thoroughly described and evaluated. Three different types of noise are identified and their impact on the size of accumulated data and on data interpretation is investigated. Three different techniques to overcome the problem are applied and evaluated. Activity portraying waveforms are further investigated. Further classification of activity portraying waveforms is performed employing signal processing, feature extraction and selection algorithms as well as pattern recognition techniques such as Wavelet Multi-Resolution Analysis, Fourier Analysis, Neural Networks (NNs), student\u2019s t-test, minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Naive Bayesian Classifier and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Overall results provide a full image of the various aspects of field leakage current monitoring. A detailed image of field waveforms, revealing several new attributes, is documented. New approaches for the classification of leakage current waveforms are introduced, applied on field waveforms and evaluated.

Identifying visemes (i.e., the smallest visual units of spoken text) is useful when there are no language models or dictionaries available, which is often the case for languages besides English; however, it is a challenge, as temporal information cannot be extracted. In parallel, previous works demonstrated that exploring data acquired simultaneously under multiple views can improve the recognition accuracy in comparison to single-view data. For many different applications, however, most of the available audio-visual datasets are obtained from a single view, essentially due to acquisition limitations. In this work, we address viseme recognition in still images and explore the synthetic generation of additional views to improve overall accuracy. For that, we use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained with synthetic data and map from mouth images acquired in a single arbitrary view to frontal and side views \u2013 in which the face is rotated vertically at approximately 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0. Then, we use a state-of-art Convolutional Neural Network for classifying the visemes and compare its performance when training only with the original single-view images versus training with the additional views artificially generated by the GANs.

Genotype-environment association (GEA) methods, which identify adaptive loci based on associations between genetic data and environmental variables, are particularly promising for distinguishing these loci. Univariate statistical methods have dominated GEA, despite the high dimensional nature of genomic data sets. Multivariate and machine learning methods, which can analyze many loci simultaneously, may be better suited to these large data sets since they consider how groups of markers covary in response to environmental predictors. These methods may also be more effective at detecting important adaptive processes, such as selection on standing genetic variation, that result in weak, multilocus signatures. Here we evaluate four of these methods, as well as a popular univariate approach, using published simulations of multilocus selection. We found that the machine learning method, Random Forest, performed poorly as a GEA. The univariate approach performed better, but had low detection rates for loci under weak selection. Constrained ordinations showed a superior combination of low false positive and high true positive rates across all levels of selection. These results were robust across demographic history, sampling designs, and sample sizes. Although further testing is needed on more complex genetic architectures, this study indicates that constrained ordinations are an effective means of detecting adaptive processes that result in weak, multilocus molecular signatures, providing a powerful tool for investigating the genetic basis of local adaptation and improving management actions.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/129460", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2608933202", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["46912329", "123472832", "1403308", "28743802", "31819077", "85720092", "206182207", "33968183", "17577524", "26619208", "16036351", "53138472", "14176798", "6588532", "3957912", "11880961", "18401995", "25638019", "16086635", "23206041", "3935588", "1746430", "19663974", "10739417", "6372869", "4502519", "4671839", "6393598", "205364696", "17511685", "17307327", "8247364", "27880545", "22161175", "4496234", "27067681", "205485691", "3950919", "15089077", "2130307", "215676253", "2107923", "39406561"], "inbound_citations": ["214722927", "49875379", "52090307", "3307253", "215128389", "213915229"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:90137205"}

Despite vast research on land degradation, the processes and drivers for abandonment remain hardly understood. One reason for this gap may be the little attention that was paid to site-specific information about abandonment of arable land in irrigation agriculture. In this study, analysis of time series from Landsat satellite data is recognized as highly suitable to establish retrospective and current land use changes. A methodological framework was developed, which utilizes Random Forest (RF) machine learning to classify arable land and to discriminate between used and unused fields. It further subdivides fields classified as \u201cunused\u201d in sparse, open and dense shrubland by analyzing the intensity of their vegetation signal in the satellite data. The framework also encloses a ruleset for accurate decisions for extremely heterogeneously vegetated fields. These steps, together with the application of the methodological framework to the study region in the observation period 1998-2016 permit to receive area-wide information on the timing when a land parcel was abandoned. The RF regression was applied to assess the most important spatial parameters (drivers) leading to land abandonment. The complexity of the crop rotations, long fallow cycles, and the data scarcity challenged the detection of abandoned land. The annual maps show that abandonment mainly occurred on fields at the edges of the irrigation area and on fields close to main drainage systems. The methodological framework is now ready for the identification of abandoned land hotspots, time steps and drivers and can hence support regional land use planners to improve land management, e.g. to take site specific decisions on the potential reuse of fields, irrigation maintenance, or alternative land use options.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2967838971", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202193304"}

However, reliable and high quality acquisition of these signals in the home environment is difficult. Instead, electrocardiogram (ECG) and Respiratory (Res) signals are easier to record and may offer a practical alternative for home monitoring of sleep. Therefore, automatic sleep staging was performed using ECG, Res (thoracic excursion) and EEG signals from 31 nocturnal recordings of the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) polysomnography Database. Feature vectors were extracted from 0.5 min (standard) epochs of sleep data by time-domain, frequency domain, time-frequency and nonlinear methods and optimized by using the Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) method. These features were then classified by using a SVM. Classification based upon EEG features produced a Correct Classification Ratio CCR=0.92. In comparison, features derived from ECG signals alone, that is the combination of Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and ECG-Derived Respiration (EDR) signals produced a CCR=0.54, while those features based on the combination of HRV and (thoracic) Res signals resulted in a CCR=0.57. Overall comparison of the results based on standard epochs of EEG signals with those obtained from 5-minute (long) epochs of cardiorespiratory signals, revealed that acceptable CCR=0.81 and discriminative capacity (Accuracy=89.32%, Specificity=92.88% and Sensitivity=78.64%) were also achievable when using optimal feature sets derived from long epochs of the latter signals in sleep staging.

In this way, it avoids the need for isolation and lab cultivation of individual species that provided a major obstacle of cultivation-based methods. For this reason, the field offers enormous opportunities to enhance our understanding of the microbial world in general with potential applications in many different areas, e.g., ecology, agriculture, biotechnology and medicine (Gill et al., 2006; Cox-Foster et al., 2007; Chistoserdova, 2010; Virgin and Todd, 2011). ::: ::: Unfortunately, due to the novelty of the field, designing statistical analysis methods and guiding procedures for goal oriented analysis of such data sets are still at its infancy. The paper by Dinsdale et al. (2013) aims to fill this gap by providing a numerical comparison of a variety of different clustering (K-means, unsupervised random forest and partitioning around medoid), classification (linear discriminant analysis, classification tree, Random Forest, canonical discriminant analysis), dimension reduction (principal component analysis and canonical discriminant analysis) and visualization methods (multidimensional scaling) for metagnomics by studying the metabolic functions of 212 microbial metagenomes within and between 10 environments. For this reason, the data set used for the numerical analysis was grouped into 10 different environments (coastal marine water, deep water, saline evaporation pond, mat community, open water, coral reef water, hydrothermal spring water, human associated, terrestrial animal associated, freshwater) and most environments were covered by multiple sequencing technologies. ::: ::: Using this real data set allowed a discussion of the results of the individual analysis methods in a comparative manner revealing their advantages and disadvantages in a practical context. For instance, all analyses methods found the presence of phage genes within the microbial community to be a good predictor to classify a microbial community as \u201chost-associated\u201d or \u201cfree-living.\u201d In addition to the comparative analysis, the paper explains also the used methods in a way that the reader does not need to be familiar with them before reading the paper. This makes the paper a comprehensive, introductory source of information. Overall, this is a very helpful study for scientists interested in metagenomics, particularly microbial ecologists, to understand how the methods behave for a real data set making this paper much more useful than generic review papers. ::: ::: On a statistical note, the paper by Dinsdale et al. (2013) covers methods from three important areas of machine learning and statistics (Clarke et al., 2009; Haste et al., 2009). First, unsupervised learning methods to analyze data without a label are covered by discussing a variety of clustering methods. Second, supervised learning methods to analyze data with a label, e.g., a class identifier to distinguish different environments from each other, are included for some of the most important classification methods. Third, visualization methods are forming a natural starting point for any statistical data analysis in general and for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) (Tukey, 1977) in particular. For this reason, it is very important to add visualization methods to the paper for reminding the reader that a data visualization should always be part of a metagenomcis analysis because it can help for getting insights into such multivariate and high-dimensional data. ::: ::: There are a couple of additional topics I would like to have seen included in the paper that are of relevance for metagenomics. First of all, for any multivariate data set there is the problem of a multiple testing correction (Dudoit and van der Laan, 2007) that needs to be conducted when testing statistical hypothesis. It would be interesting to know if metagenomcis data have characteristics that deviate from other genomics data, especially with respect to their covariance structure, or if similar procedures can be applied and which of these are recommended. Second, for classification and clustering methods it is necessary to perform a feature selection in a way that the actual analysis is conducted for lower dimensional profile vectors. For instance, a method like the lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) (Tibshirani, 1994) that does not convolute covariates into meta-variables, e.g., like principle component analysis (PCA), but conserves the interpretation of the selected variables in terms of the original variables. This has the advantage that 'interesting' features correspond to well-defined individual genomic variables making a biological interpretation of obtained results usually easier. Third, it would have been interesting to discuss network-based systems biology approaches that are directly aiming to estimate interaction patterns between the covariates of the data (de Matos Simoes and Emmert-Streib, 2012). This would also allow to connect to visualization methods because the resulting network structures could be explored visually and in this way could lead to the generation of novel biological hypotheses about the problem. ::: ::: Finally, I think it is also noteworthy to mention that the authors make the data and the R-code they used for their analysis publicly available (http://dinsdalelab.sdsu.edu/metag.stats/index.html) allowing the interested reader to reproduce the results of the paper. This is commendable and forms a good example for other studies.

Welded joint identification is also important for providing information for automatic control of welding process. Faced with the complex characteristics of industrial environment, such as weak texture, weak contrast and corrosion, we propose a detection and identification method of welded joints based on deep neural network. Firstly, aimed at the problem of insufficient training samples, combined with image processing and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), the high-quality training samples are generated. Secondly, the updating mechanism of training samples is established to guarantee that the deep neural network model could cover all samples. Finally, the detection and identification of welded joints are realized by the deep neural network which could avoid the handcrafted features of conventional machine learning methods. Experiments show that the proposed method could quickly and efficiently finish the detection and identification task of welded joints.

The dataset is collected from NRS Medical Hospital, India, and comprises patients EEG/MRI findings, details of convulsion and type of seizure disorder. Although many studies have been performed to classify seizures based on para-clinical evidence obtained from conventional MRI and EEG, very little work had been hitherto done to characterize various types of seizures by taking into consideration associated clinical factors such as concomitant diseases, impaired-ADL, etiology of seizures, drug/alcohol abuse and family-history. This paper presents a supervised machine-learning approach that classifies seizure types (partial and generalized) using a dataset containing 150 records. In this paper, multiple machine learning techniques are applied and their performance is examined. The impact of feature engineering and parameter tweaking are explored with the objective of achieving superior predictive performance. Out of the various machine learning algorithms used, namely ANN,kNN and Random Forest, the the kNN classifier showed the best results (90% accuracy and 87% sensitivity). The model is evaluated on the testing data by using k-fold cross validation.

We demonstrate that subgraph vectors learnt by our approach could be used in conjunction with classifiers such as CNNs, SVMs and relational data clustering algorithms to achieve significantly superior accuracies.

Principal curve is a widely used approach for this purpose. However, many existing methods work only for data with structures that are not self-intersected, which is quite restrictive for real applications. A few methods can overcome the above problem, but they either require complicated human-made rules for a specific task with lack of convergence guarantee and adaption flexibility to different tasks, or cannot obtain explicit structures of data. To address these issues, we develop a new regularized principal graph learning framework that captures the local information of the underlying graph structure based on reversed graph embedding. As showcases, models that can learn a spanning tree or a weighted undirected $\\ell_1$ graph are proposed, and a new learning algorithm is developed that learns a set of principal points and a graph structure from data, simultaneously. The new algorithm is simple with guaranteed convergence. We then extend the proposed framework to deal with large-scale data.

Our technique is based on the use of large margin methods in conjunction with the kernels constructed from first order rules induced by an ILP system. The proposed approach learns a multi-class classifier by using a divide and conquer reduction strategy that splits multi-classes into binary groups and solves each individual problem recursively hence generating an underlying decision list structure. The method is applied to assigning protein domains to folds. Experimental evaluation of the method demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach to solving multi-class classification problems in bioinformatics.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1809400.1809424", "venue": "SKDD", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2100611040", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10151608", "5594501", "12643399", "6517579", "6869184", "16094930"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16065844"}

Most of the medical databases have heterogeneous features with different levels of severity patterns. Feature extraction and classification of high risk patterns may have potential benefits for decision making. In the medical applications, data classification algorithms are used to detect the disease severity that can help in early prediction of new type of disease patterns. Also, machine learning algorithms are more accurate, high true positive rate and reliable for heterogeneous features. Traditional classification models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, Feed forward neural networks, Regression models, etc are used to classify the homogeneous disease datasets with limited feature space. As the size of the Alzheimer's disease patterns and its categories are increasing, traditional data classification models are failed to process the disease patterns due to inconsistent, class imbalance, and sparsity issues, which may affect the disease prediction rate and error rate. Therefore, an efficient classification model for predicting the severity level of the heterogeneous feature types is essential with high true positivity and low error rate. In this paper, a novel feature selection based classification model is proposed to improve the disease classification rate and testing the new type of disease patterns for real-time patient disease prediction. In the proposed model, a novel probabilistic based feature selection measure for classification algorithm is designed and implemented for real-time patient disease prediction using the training datasets.

However, conventional neurofuzzy models usually need enhanced representational power for applications that require context and state (e.g., speech, time series prediction, control).

Previously, it was proved that deterministic finite state automata (DFA) can be synthesized by or mapped into recurrent neural networks by directly programming the DFA structure into the weights of the neural network. Based on those results, a synthesis method is proposed for mapping fuzzy finite state automata (FFA) into recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, this mapping is suitable for direct implementation in very large scale integration (VLSI), i.e., the encoding of FFA as a generalization of the encoding of DFA in VLSI systems. The synthesis method requires FFA to undergo a transformation prior to being mapped into recurrent networks. The neurons are provided with an enriched functionality in order to accommodate a fuzzy representation of FFA states. This enriched neuron functionality also permits fuzzy parameters of FFA to be directly represented as parameters of the neural network. We also prove the stability of fuzzy finite state dynamics of the constructed neural networks for finite values of network weight and, through simulations, give empirical validation of the proofs.

Many existing studies adopted a dose-response matrix design, aiming for the characterization of drug combination sensitivity and synergy. However, there is lack of consensus on the definition of sensitivity and synergy, leading to the use of different mathematical models that do not necessarily agree with each other. We proposed a cross design to enable a more cost-effective testing of sensitivity and synergy for a drug pair. We developed a drug combination sensitivity score (CSS) to summarize the drug combination dose-response curves. Using a high-throughput drug combination dataset, we showed that the CSS is highly reproducible among the replicates. With machine learning approaches such as Elastic Net, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines, the CSS can also be predicted with high accuracy. Furthermore, we defined a synergy score based on the difference between the drug combination and the single drug dose-response curves. We showed that the CSS-based synergy score is able to detect true synergistic and antagonistic drug combinations. The cross drug combination design coupled with the CSS scoring facilitated the evaluation of drug combination sensitivity and synergy using the same scale, with minimal experimental material that is required. Our approach could be utilized as an efficient pipeline for improving the discovery rate in high-throughput drug combination screening. The R scripts for calculating and predicting CSS are available at https://github.com/amalyutina/CSS. Author summary Being a complex disease, cancer is one of the main death causes worldwide. Although new treatment strategies have been achieved with cancers, they still have limited efficacy. Even when there is an initial treatment response, cancer cells can develop drug resistance thus cause disease recurrence. To achieve more effective and safe therapies to treat cancer, patients critically need multi-targeted drug combinations that will kill cancer cells at reduced dosages and thereby avoid side effects that are often associated with the standard treatment. However, the increasing number of possible drug combinations makes a pure experimental approach unfeasible, even with automated drug screening instruments. Therefore, we have proposed a new experimental set up to get the drug combination sensitivity data cost-efficiently and developed a score to quantify the efficiency of the drug combination, called drug combination sensitivity score (CSS). Using public datasets, we have shown that the CSS robustness and its highly predictive nature with an accuracy comparable to the experimental replicates. We have also defined a CSS-based synergy score as a metric of drug interaction and justified its relevance.

In this work, we propose a novel BCI system through which a whole word can be typed with much higher word typing speed and accuracy. In our presented system, we have integrated a custom-built smart dictionary to give word suggestions upon few key characters initially typed by the user. Upon the suggested words, the user can select one out of the given suggestions to complete word typing. Our novel paradigm significantly reduces the word typing time and makes words typing more convenient. In the classification part, we have also adopted a new classifier, Random Forest (RF) instead of a commonly used Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our results with four subjects using the presented word typing system demonstrate an average typing time of 1.66 minutes per word, whereas the conventional took 2.9 minutes, improving the typing time by 42.75%.

Natural images contain complex contents of multiple objects with complicated background, clutter, and occlusions, which prevents image features from belonging to a specific category.

We jointly learn a discriminative dictionary called anchor in the feature space and its corresponding soft label called anchor label in the label space, where the combination of anchor and anchor label is referred to as bi-dictionary. The learnt bi-dictionary is utilized to bridge the semantic gap in image classification. First, SRLP constructs smoothed reconstruction problems for bi-dictionary learning. Then, SRLP produces the reconstruction coefficients in the feature space over the anchor to infer soft labels of samples in the label space.

In order to obtain the training and testing data for evaluation and construction of the system, images that illustrate moving cars on a road are acquired. From these, several positive and negative windows are extracted that visualizes wheels and non-wheels. For the classification stage, the learning algorithm used is Random Forest. Moreover, with the Random Forest as the foundation, two different concepts were introduced to further improve the predictions.

So, for example, imageability effects that are hypothesised to originate at the semantic level should also be found in errors that arise elsewhere. Hence phonological errors, which are hypothesised to arise late in lexicalisation, should show an imagea-bility effect. She presents data that appear to be inconsistent with these predictions. f show that these predictions are not necessarily those made by an interactive model of lexicalisation.

Previous work has evaluated the use of end-to-end systems for ASR on well known corpora (WSJ, Switchboard, TIMIT, etc.) in high-resource languages like English and Mandarin. In this work, we investigate the use of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) networks, recurrent encoder-decoders with attention, two end-to-end ASR systems for keyword search and speech recognition on low resource languages. We find end-to-end systems can generate high quality 1-best transcripts on low-resource languages, but, because they generate very sharp posteriors, their utility is limited for KWS. We explore a number of ways to address this limitation with modest success. Experimental results reported are based on the IARPA BABEL OP3 languages and evaluation framework.

Patients and Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted in medical, surgical, and mixed intensive care units (ICUs) at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, including adult (\u226518 years of age) ICU-unique patients admitted between October 1, 2004, and April 30, 2011. Our primary objective was prediction of AKI using extant clinical data following ICU admission. We used random forest classification to provide continuous AKI risk score. Results We included 4572 and 1958 patients in the training and validation mutually exclusive cohorts, respectively. Acute kidney injury occurred in 1355 patients (30%) in the training cohort and 580 (30%) in the validation cohort. We incorporated known AKI risk factors and routinely measured vital characteristics and laboratory results. The model was run throughout ICU admission every 15 minutes and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 on validation. It was 92% sensitive and 68% specific and detected 30% of AKI cases at least 6 hours before the criterion standard time (AKI stages 1-3). For discrimination of AKI stages 2 to 3, the model had 91% sensitivity, 71% specificity, and 53% detection of AKI cases at least 6 hours before AKI onset.

In this paper, we extend this work by combining our method for selecting extreme examples with two incremental learning algorithms, AQ11 and GEM. Using these new systems, AQ11-PM and GEM-PM, and using two real-world applications, those of computer intrusion detection and blasting cap detection in X-ray images, we conducted a lesion study to analyze the trade-offs between predictive accuracy, examples held in memory, learning time, and concept complexity.

We also present results from an experiment using the STAGGER Concepts, a synthetic data set involving concept drift, suggesting that our methods perform comparably to the FLORA2 system in terms of predictive accuracy, but store fewer examples.

The graph construction is driven by the locally linear embedding (LLE) of either the spatio-temporal or the appearance features associated to the detections. Interestingly, the neighborhood of a node in each appearance graph is defined to include all nodes for which the appearance feature is available (except the ones that coexist at the same time). This allows to connect the nodes that share the same appearance even if they are temporally distant, which gives our framework the uncommon ability to exploit the appearance features that are available only sporadically along the sequence of detections. Once the graphs have been defined, the multi-object tracking is formulated as the problem of finding a label assignment that is consistent with the constraints captured by each of the graphs.

If we apply a conventional clustering technique over the combined dataset, then every time a new batch of data comes, the process can be slow and wasteful. Moreover, it can be challenging to store the combined dataset in memory due to its ever-increasing size. As a result, various incremental clustering techniques have been proposed. These techniques need to efficiently update the current clustering result whenever a new batch arrives, to adapt the current clustering result/solution with the latest data. These techniques also need the ability to detect concept drifts when the clustering pattern of a new batch is significantly different from older batches. Sometimes, clustering patterns may drift temporarily in a single batch while the next batches do not exhibit the drift. Therefore, incremental clustering techniques need the ability to detect a temporary drift and sustained drift. In this paper, we propose an efficient incremental clustering algorithm called UIClust. It is designed to cluster streams of data chunks, even when there are temporary or sustained concept drifts. We evaluate the performance of UIClust by comparing it with a recently published, high-quality incremental clustering algorithm. We use real and synthetic datasets.

Many people tend to increasingly use them in order to share their personal opinion on current topics of their everyday life as well as express their emotions about situations in which they are interested.

To this direction, the analysis of people\u2019s sentiments has drawn the attention of many scientists worldwide and offers a fertile ground for increasing research. Furthermore, a social network that is adopted by an ever growing percentage of people is Twitter. Twitter is an online news and social networking service where users post and interact with messages; such messages conceal people\u2019s feelings and sentiments. Therefore, Twitter can be seen as a source of information and holds a vast amount of data that can be exploited for sentiment analysis research. In view of above, the purpose of this paper is to provide a guideline for the decision of optimal pre-processing techniques and classifiers for sentiment analysis over Twitter. In this context, three well-known Twitter datasets (OMD, HCR and STS-Gold) were used and a set of experiments was conducted. In particular, firstly, an extended comparison of sentiment polarity classification methods for Twitter text and the role of text preprocessing in sentiment analysis are discussed in depth. Secondly, four well-known learning-based classifiers (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors and C4.5) have been evaluated based on confusion matrices. Thirdly, the most common ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking and Voting) are examined and compared to base classifiers\u2019 results. Finally, a case study concerning the application of Twitter sentiment analysis in an e-learning context is presented. The main result of the utilization of the Twitter-based learning application is that the exploitation of students\u2019 emotional states can be used to enhance adaptivity in the learning content as well as deliver recommendations about activities and provide personalized assistance.

Despite extensive knowledge on ALAN, being a measure of human activity that directly impacts numerous aspects of animal behaviour, such as orientation and distribution, little is known about its effects on density distribution on a large spatial scale. That is why we decided to explore by means of the Species Distribution Modelling approach (SDM) how ALAN as one of 33 predictors determines farmland and forest bird species densities. In order to safeguard study results from any inconsistency caused by the chosen method, we used two approaches, i.e. the Generalised Additive Model (GAM) and the Random Forest (RF). Within each approach, we developed two models for two bird species, the Black woodpecker and the European stonechat: the first with ALAN, and the second without ALAN as an additional predictor. Having used out-of-bag procedures in the RF approach, information-theoretic criteria for the GAM, and evaluation models based on an independent dataset, we demonstrated that models with ALAN had higher predictive density power than models without it. The Black woodpecker definitely and linearly avoids anthropogenic activity, defined by the level of artificial light, while the European stonechat tolerates human activity to some degree, especially in farmland habitats. What is more, a heuristic analysis of predictive maps based on models without ALAN shows that both species reach high densities in regions where they are deemed rare. Hence, the study proves that urbanisation processes, which can be reflected by ALAN, are among key predictors necessary for developing Species Density Distribution Models for both farmland and forest bird species.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecocom.2019.100809", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Complexity", "mag_id": "2990574175", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213483980"}

Time-of-use tariffs are widely considered to be the most promising solution for optimising energy consumption in the residential sector. Although there exists a large body of research on demand response in electricity pricing, a practical framework to forecast user adaptation under different Time-of-use tariffs has not been fully developed. The novelty of this work is to provide the first top-down statistical modelling of residential customer demand response following the adoption of a Time-of-use tariff and report the model's accuracy and the feature importance. The importance of statistical moments to capture various lifestyle constraints based on smart meter data, which enables this model to be agnostic about household characteristics, is discussed. 646 households in Ireland during pre/post-intervention of Time-of-use tariff is used for validation.

As a very special yet important case of object recognition, hand-held object recognition plays an important role in intelligence technology for its many applications such as visual question-answering and reasoning. In real-world scenarios, the datasets are open-ended and dynamic: new object samples and new object classes increase continuously. This requires the intelligence technology to enable hybrid incremental learning, which supports both data-incremental and class-incremental learning to efficiently learn the new information. However, existing work mainly focuses on one side of incremental learning, either data-incremental or class-incremental learning while do not handle two sides of incremental learning in a unified framework. To solve the problem, we present a Hybrid Incremental Learning (HIL) method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), which can incrementally improve its recognition ability by learning new object samples and new object concepts during the interaction with humans. In order to integrate data-incremental and class-incremental learning into one unified framework, HIL adds the new classification-planes and adjusts existing classification-planes under the setting of SVM. As a result, our system can simultaneously improve the recognition quality of known concepts by minimizing the prediction error and transfer the previous model to recognize unknown objects. We apply the proposed method into hand-held object recognition and the experimental results demonstrated its advantage of HIL. In addition, we conducted extensive experiments on the subset of ImageNet and the experimental results further validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jvcir.2018.11.009", "venue": "J.

Despite the large literature and the advancements in this research field, the univocal attribution of tephra deposits to specific volcanic sources remains too often elusive. In this contribution, we test the application of a machine learning technique named Support Vector Machine to attempt shedding new light upon tephra deposits related to one of the most complex and debated volcanic regions on Earth: the Pliocene-Pleistocene magmatism in Italy. The machine learning algorithm was trained using one of the most comprehensive global petrological databases (GEOROC); 17 chemical elements including major (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3T, CaO, MgO, MnO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5) and selected trace (Sr, Ba, Rb, Zr, Nb, La, Ce) elements were chosen as input parameters. We first show the ability of support vector machines in discriminating among different Pliocene-Pleistocene volcanic provinces in Italy and then apply the same methodology to determine the volcanic source of tephra samples occurring in the Caio outcrop, an Early Pleistocene sedimentary section located in Central Italy. Our results show that: 1) support vector machines can successfully resolve high-dimensional tephrochronological problems overcoming the intrinsic limitation of two- and three-dimensional discrimination diagrams; 2) support vector machines can discriminate among different volcanic provinces in complex magmatic regions; 3) in the specific case study, support vector machines indicate that the most probable source for the investigated tephra samples is the so-called Roman Magmatic Province.

Abstract If bilingualism is a common phenomenon, research on bilingualism using recurrent networks is not. Few models using recurrent neural networks were developed in the past years in an attempt to address, among others, the question: is the lexical knowledge about two (or more) languages kept apart? French\u2019s (1998) results have shown that there are two separate regions in the lexicon, each one corresponding to one specific language. The present study extends French\u2019s model by including syntactic differences between the languages in addition to the exclusively lexical ones in the original simulation. Our network not only kept the lexicons apart, but also represented more fine grained structural differences between the languages in the hidden layer activation space. Keywords: acquisition. bilingualism; connectionism; language Introduction Studies in bilingual knowledge and learning have grown into a full blown research field during the past twenty years (or so). In the past few years, experimental and sophisticated tools have allowed for considerable advances in the area, making room for the investigation of central questions about memory and language processing in bilinguals. Computational modeling is also part of this landscape (for reviews, see French & Jacquet, 2004, and Thomas & van Heuven, 2005) and connectionist models are plenty: BIA (Bilingual Interactive Activation; Dijkstra & van Heuven, 1998), BIMOLA (Bilingual Model of Lexical Access; Grosjean, 1997), SOMBIP (Self-Organizing Connectionist Model of Bilingual Processing; Li & Farkas, 2002), Hasta La Vista, Baby (Scutt, 1997), BSRN (Bilingual Simple Recurrent Network; French, 1998) and BLLCN (Bilingual Language Learning in Connectionist Networks; Liang, 2004). Among these, Simple Recurrent Networks (SRNs) simulations allow for important aspects of the problem to be explored \u2013 on the one hand, the bilingual acquisition of language and, on the other, the dynamics of the mechanisms responsible for bilingual knowledge organization. French (1998) put forward a simulation in which two small artificial languages are acquired by an SRN. Among the interesting results he obtained, it is of special interest to us the fact that in his simulation the very same network was able to separately represent the lexical knowledge of each language. Another result was that within each language cluster, word classes (i.e., subject nouns, verbs, and object nouns) were correctly identified and categorized. This was interpreted as an indication of the sensitivity of the system to the statistical regularities of the input, namely, the transitional dependencies present in word co-occurrence patterns in sentences. Clearly, French\u2019s (1998) is a step towards a richer understanding of the dynamics underlying bilingual knowledge and organization. In special, it is a step towards understanding how lexical and structural bilingual distinctions are accomplished through time, much in the way posited by Elman (1990). In this connection, a question can be posed: what if syntactical complexity is added to the grammar of the model, so that languages are distinguished not only by their lexicons, but also by their different structures? It is hoped that by adding syntactical complexity light will be shed on the mechanisms underlying bilingual knowledge. Computational simulations are of interest in connection with questions like this, because they offer the chance of manipulating variables believed to be active during bilingual language acquisition, but which cannot be controlled for in human data gathering. The Simulation An SRN was trained on two small artificial languages, just like in French (1998). For each of the languages, 4 adjectives were (optionally) added in the subject position. Thus, for each language, 16 words of were used (Table 1), resulting in 4 different syntactic structures (Table 2; notice that both objects and adjectives were optional). The intended syntactical difference between languages is thus brought about by differences in adjectives position: they always occurred before nouns in alpha and after them in beta (which, for mnemonic reasons, are referred to, respectively, as English and French). It must be noted that", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2772674291,2624561030", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7279603", "56992238", "142912549", "2763403", "17733121", "8089157", "141243826", "34932504", "34092078", "11749011", "145604017"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12569190"}

At the same time, interest in another paradigm of cognitive modeling, one that has been variously referred to as neural network modeling, parallel distributed processing, and connectionism, has been growing. Certain characteristics of connectionist models, in particular their broad bandwidth information channels which permit parallel, multidirectional information flow, seem especially relevant to current language generation problems. Other useful properties of these models, such as their content addressable memory capacity, their ability to respond to novelty, their capacity to degrade gracefully and the existence of automatic learning procedures, would contribute to the solutions of other language generation problems. This paper gives an overview of the connectionist paradigm and a brief summary of some of the language processing research being done under it. It then describes the results of some experiments aimed at training connectionist networks to perform two language generation tasks. In one study a network was trained to produce appropriate words given a set of semantic attributes, and in another study a network was trained to produce syntactically well-formed phrases given the unordered words. The networks finally did achieve their intended behaviors, and in doing so they exhibited evidence of having acquired linguistic knowledge of synonymy relations and collocation relations in addition to proper semantic associations.

Indeed, the knowledge of an accurate topography and a landcover classification is a prior knowledge for any hydrological and erosion model. Badlands tend to be the most significant areas of erosion in the world with the highest erosion rate values. Monitoring and predicting erosion within 10 badland mountainous catchments is highly strategic due to the arising downstream consequences and the need for natural hazard mitigation engineering.

It is even more challenging to avoid loss of the signal of interest during the artifact correction process, where the signal of interest can be multiple magnitudes weaker than the artifact. To address these issues, we propose a novel discriminative ocular artifact correction approach for feature learning in EEG analysis. Without extra ocular movement measurements, the artifact is extracted from raw EEG data, which is totally automatic and requires no visual inspection of artifacts. Then, artifact correction is optimized jointly with feature extraction by maximizing oscillatory correlations between trials from the same class and minimizing them between trials from different classes. We evaluate this approach on a real-world EEG dataset comprising 68 subjects performing cognitive tasks. The results showed that the approach is capable of not only suppressing the artifact components but also improving the discriminative power of a classifier with statistical significance.

Although the observer9s own (self-)motion affects the object9s pattern of motion on the retina, the visual system is able to factor out the influence of self-motion and recover the world-relative motion of the object (Matsumiya and Ando, 2009). This is achieved by using information in global optic flow (Rushton and Warren, 2005; Warren and Rushton, 2009; Fajen and Matthis, 2013) and other sensory arrays (Dupin and Wexler, 2013; Fajen et al., 2013; Dokka et al., 2015) to estimate and deduct the component of the object9s local retinal motion that is due to self-motion. However, this account (known as \u201cflow parsing\u201d) is qualitative and does not shed light on mechanisms in the visual system that recover object motion during self-motion. We present a simple computational account that makes explicit possible mechanisms in visual cortex by which self-motion signals in the medial superior temporal area interact with object motion signals in the middle temporal area to transform object motion into a world-relative reference frame. The model (1) relies on two mechanisms (MST-MT feedback and disinhibition of opponent motion signals in MT) to explain existing data, (2) clarifies how pathways for self-motion and object-motion perception interact, and (3) unifies the existing flow parsing hypothesis with established neurophysiological mechanisms. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT To intercept targets, we must perceive the motion of objects that move independently from us as we move through the environment. Although our self-motion substantially alters the motion of objects on the retina, compelling evidence indicates that the visual system at least partially compensates for self-motion such that object motion relative to the stationary environment can be more accurately perceived. We have developed a model that sheds light on plausible mechanisms within the visual system that transform retinal motion into a world-relative reference frame. Our model reveals how local motion signals (generated through interactions within the middle temporal area) and global motion signals (feedback from the dorsal medial superior temporal area) contribute and offers a new hypothesis about the connection between pathways for heading and object motion perception.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6601960", "pubmed_id": "27488630", "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4593-15.2016", "venue": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "mag_id": "2497097262", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202858022", "3613175", "13666450", "49694944", "215159757", "49475007", "10837266"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207516240"}

Until now, these algorithms were tested only on a few real networks or unrealistic artificial ones. In this work, we use the more realistic generative model developed by Lancichinetti et al. to compare seven algorithms: Edge-betweenness, Eigenvector, Fast Greedy, Label Propagation, Markov Clustering, Spinglass and Walktrap.

As such, they can be viewed as a hierarchy of template and document specific content. This hierarchical template representation has several important advantages for document clustering and classification. First, templates capture common topics among the documents, while filtering out the potentially noisy variabilities such as personal information. Second, template representations scale far better than document representations since a single template captures numerous documents. Finally, since templates group together structurally similar documents, they can propagate properties between all the documents that match the template. In this paper, we use these advantages for document classification by formulating an efficient and effective hierarchical label propagation and discovery algorithm. The labels are propagated first over a template graph (constructed based on either term-based or topic-based similarities), and then to the matching documents. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm using a large donated email corpus and show that the resulting template graph is significantly more compact than the corresponding document graph and the hierarchical label propagation is both efficient and effective in increasing the coverage of the baseline document classification algorithm. We demonstrate that the template label propagation achieves more than 91% precision and 93% recall, while increasing the label coverage by more than 11%.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2835776.2835780", "venue": "WSDM '16", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2255862008", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["59593475", "15813440", "1111139", "207628158", "2301999", "8536512", "198120229", "3177797", "16759", "16849508", "3931863", "3008108", "11615972", "8941218", "16213214", "339574", "5119155", "14306654", "7105713", "59837376", "6920888", "5730518", "508435", "116930672"], "inbound_citations": ["18673157", "173185101", "53034583", "53033764", "201652669", "49891119", "50767110", "7481015", "59234986", "7979807", "4155935", "5759934", "8316743", "202895127", "209832420", "17503968", "15826310"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12304341"}

They may bring irreversible damages to the system and cause leakage of privacy. Thus, it is of vital importance to promptly detect these anomalies. Traditional supervised methods such as Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to classify normality and abnormality. However, in some case the abnormal status are largely rarer than normal status, which leads to decision bias of these methods. Generative adversarial network (GAN) has been proposed to handle the case. With its strong generative ability, it only needs to learn the distribution of normal status, and identify the abnormal status through the gap between it and the learned distribution.

To cope with the discrete features, in this paper, we propose an efficient GAN-based model with specifically-designed loss function.

But there is still a discussion about their compatibility as the basis of Cognitive Science. A more fundamental explanation of this two leading cognitive mechanisms in physical basis can give a better explanation of the mind and brain phenomena. I propose the concepts of PATTERN RECOGNITION-PROCESSING-LEARNING as NECESSARY AND SUF- FICIENT PRINCIPLE to build a solid foundation of cognitive science. This encloses a general body-mind, physical, psychological, neural, functional and computational reductionist explanation of the mind cognitive phenomena. Supporting arguments are: 1- Pattern recognition is a necessary principle for cognitive science. It is a key process in many different scientific areas, but no cognitive science model takes it formally for a general brain-mind theory. 2- The equivalence of the physical-neural-computational mechanisms of pattern recognition as the basis of the cognitive phenomena in performing all cognitive functions (sensory, memory, learning, processing, logical, feeling, emotions, thought, consciousness, etc) , which are here demonstrated. 3- I also propose some key biological cognitive processes and strategies strictly related to pattern recognition processing. 4- A definitional-explicative modeling building theory is also shown giving simple, understandable and unambiguous definitions and scientific explanation of most key cognitive concepts like thinking, self and consciousness. Such a theory is of fundamental importance because those type of cognitive concepts lacks even a reasonable definition. With a scientific-objective definitions we can evaluate, compare and estimate its consistency and also propose experimental and empirical experiments. As an example I suggest one preliminary definition of self-consciousness as: \u201dthe recognition by the pattern recognition system of the patterns of its own activity\u201d. 5- A mathematical-logical formalism study of cognitive pattern recognition is here proposed as theoretical basis. Here a general formal definition of pattern recognition is proposed in the cognitive science scope. 6- With this theoretical formulation we are able to include other cognitive properties to any basic definition as far as needed, demonstrating it as a solid and promising theory. As any candidate as a complete theory of cognitive science, this model allow us to reinterpret all branches of human reasoning, including the philosophy and foundations of science and the human understanding of the universe.

Analyzing driving behavior can help us assess driver performances, improve traffic safety, and, ultimately, promote the development of intelligent and resilient transportation systems. While some efforts have been made for analyzing driving behavior, existing methods can be improved via representation learning by jointly exploring the peer and temporal dependencies of driving behavior. To that end, in this paper, we develop a Peer and Temporal-Aware Representation Learning based framework (PTARL) for driving behavior analysis with GPS trajectory data. Specifically, we first detect the driving operations and states of each driver from GPS traces. Then, we derive a sequence of multi-view driving state transition graphs from the driving state sequences, in order to characterize a driver's driving behavior that varies over time. In addition, we develop a peer and temporal-aware representation learning method to learn a sequence of time-varying yet relational vectorized representations from the driving state transition graphs. The proposed method can simultaneously model both the graph-graph peer dependency and the current-past temporal dependency in a unified optimization framework. Also, we provide effective solutions for the optimization problem. Moreover, we exploit the learned representations of driving behavior to score driving performances and detect dangerous regions.

Accurate prediction of protein residues that physically bind to ligands is important for drug design and protein docking studies. Most of the successful protein-ligand binding predictions were based on known structures. However, structural information is not largely available in practice due to the huge gap between the number of known protein sequences and that of experimentally solved structures. Results: This paper proposes a dynamic ensemble approach to identify protein-ligand binding residues by using sequence information only. To avoid problems resulting from highly imbalanced samples between the ligand-binding sites and non ligand-binding sites, we constructed several balanced data sets and we trained a random forest classifier for each of them. We dynamically selected a subset of classifiers according to the similarity between the target protein and the proteins in the training data set. The combination of the predictions of the classifier subset to each query protein target yielded the final predictions. The ensemble of these classifiers formed a sequence-based predictor to identify protein-ligand binding sites.

Methods This prospective study enrolled consecutive patients who underwent neck MR scans and subsequent thyroidectomy during the study interval. The diagnosis and aggressiveness of PTC were determined by pathological evaluation of thyroidectomy specimens. Thyroid nodules were segmented manually on the MR images, and radiomic features were then extracted. Predictive machine learning modelling was used to evaluate the prediction of PTC aggressiveness. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values for the model performance were obtained for radiomic features, clinical characteristics, and combinations of radiomic features and clinical characteristics. Results The study cohort included 120 patients with pathology-confirmed PTC (training cohort: n = 96; testing cohort: n = 24). A total of 1393 features were extracted from T2-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images for each patient. The combination of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator for radiomic feature selection and Gradient Boosting Classifier for classifying PTC aggressiveness achieving the AUC of 0.92. In contrast, clinical characteristics alone poorly predicted PTC aggressiveness, with an AUC of 0.56.

Early prediction of person at risk of Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) with or without the onset of Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) or Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) still remains a continuing challenge to clinicians. In this work, we have presented a novel integrated index for prediction of SCD with a high level of accuracy by using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. To achieve this, nonlinear features (Fractal Dimension (FD), Hurst's exponent (H), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Approximate Entropy (ApproxEnt), Sample Entropy (SampEnt), and Correlation Dimension (CD)) are first extracted from the second level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposed ECG signal. The extracted nonlinear features are ranked using t-value and then, a combination of highly ranked features are used in the formulation and employment of an integrated Sudden Cardiac Death Index (SCDI). This calculated novel SCDI can be used to accurately predict SCD (four minutes before the occurrence) by using just one numerical value four minutes before the SCD episode. Also, the nonlinear features are fed to the following classifiers: Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The combination of DWT and nonlinear analysis of ECG signals is able to predict SCD with an accuracy of 92.11% (KNN), 98.68% (SVM), 93.42% (KNN) and 92.11% (SVM) for first, second, third and fourth minutes before the occurrence of SCD, respectively.

In previous researches, much attention was focused on structure information or node attributes, in order to analyze the global or local properties. Considering the nature of Microblog social network, we proposed a link prediction system combining multiple features from different perspectives, and learn a classifier from these feature subsets to predict the potential links. We train classifiers using SVM, Nai ve Bayes, and Random Forest and Logistic Regression algorithms and evaluate them using the microblog network dataset. The results show that our features perform better than the traditional features, and the combination of multiple features can achieve highest accuracy.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.17706/jcp.11.1.72-82", "venue": "JCP", "journal": "JCP", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2399665801", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9131786", "9274608", "16340411", "18071775", "61440772", "9904814", "6880734", "11311905", "15720296", "10375686", "16865524", "16314394", "9571906", "12227229", "5239541", "8687130", "16842093", "207372751", "2262951", "1570972", "179152", "14054595", "89141"], "inbound_citations": ["7285977", "57764487"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:877767"}

Therefore, the use of computational machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for screening putative drug-like molecule has gained significance. In this regard, a target-based predictive model using machine learning approaches was built to develop fast and efficient virtual screening procedures to screen anti-dosRS molecules. In the present study, we have used various structural and physiochemical attributes of compounds from HTS dataset to train and build a chemoinformatics predictive model based on four state-of-art supervised classifiers (Random forest, SMO, J48, and Naive Bayes). The trained model was applied to test dataset for validating the robustness, accuracy, and sensitivity of the predictive model in screening active anti-dosRS molecules. The Cost-Sensitive Classifier (CSC) with Random Forest (RF) algorithm based predictive model showed a high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (83.13%) to identify active and inactive molecules, respectively from assay dataset (ID: 1159583).

This path planning model improves on the existing mathematical modeling and pattern recognition approaches by utilizing different sources of data to drive and validate it: video data was used for the open space scenarios and virtual reality experiments were applied for constrained space scenarios. For open space scenarios with video coverage, the density map of the video is extracted to calibrate the origin/destination popularities and the route probabilities among them. Factors related to space syntax, such as the traveling distance and turning angle, are proven effective features of the path planning model in this scenario. For constrained space scenarios, where the coverage of videos is usually limited, virtual reality experiments can be applied to learn the route choice model parameters at a fine granularity, particularly considering the crowdedness of the surroundings besides the space syntax factors. The navigation behaviors of players under different configurations in the virtual reality experiments were retrieved to train the route choice models using Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The trained route choice model then simulates the crowd motion more realistically under different densities.

The classification of these features is performed using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The evaluation of the proposed method is applied on Digital Database For Screening Mammography (DDSM). The system classifies normal from abnormal cases with high accuracy rate (96%).

Performance is measured in term of multiple risk and return measures. A comprehensive signal processing framework is built to facilitate rapid development and testing of multiple candidate trading systems. A subset of the most promising trading systems, 14 in total, are presented in this thesis. The trading systems are not only designed to function as decision support systems for human trader, but also to function as autonomous traders in their own right. They are built to be applicable in real life, any academic value is a welcomed side effect. Many of the trading systems are heavily influenced by machine learning methods, with a special focus on time series prediction. Support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and regression are the primary methods applied for low level machine learning. Evolutionary algorithms are applied as high level meta-parameter tuning. In addition to machine learning methods, classical portfolio optimization methods using modern portfolio theory are applied, some in combination with machine learning methods. The trading systems are tested by means of simulation on data from two stock markets -- the OBX index on Oslo stock exchange and Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow). Results indicate that the Dow index is highly efficient. No trading system was able to outperform the benchmark when using transaction costs. Results on the OBX index indicate some inefficiencies with potential for exploitation. Many trading systems manage to generate higher return than the benchmark. Some achieve excess return with the same level of risk. The efficient portfolio trading system yields highest return given the same level of risk as the buy-and-hold portfolio. In general results tend to support the efficient market hypothesis. Given the same risk level, experiments from this thesis finds that efficient portfolios can outperform uniform ones in inefficient markets as these are not efficient enough in themselves as in the case of OBX. No strategy was found that can substantially outperform an efficient portfolio. Support Vector Machines are identified to be the best time series predictors among the machine learning techniques used. Evolution is found to be a powerful tool in identifying and training trading systems. Future work will focus on evolution as an integral part of the trading systems.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "604080029", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["40395359"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:106881621"}

This survey is organized around four potential benefits of the Cloud: 1) Big Data: access to libraries of images, maps, trajectories, and descriptive data; 2) Cloud Computing: access to parallel grid computing on demand for statistical analysis, learning, and motion planning; 3) Collective Robot Learning: robots sharing trajectories, control policies, and outcomes; and 4) Human Computation: use of crowdsourcing to tap human skills for analyzing images and video, classification, learning, and error recovery. The Cloud can also improve robots and automation systems by providing access to: a) datasets, publications, models, benchmarks, and simulation tools; b) open competitions for designs and systems; and c) open-source software.

Nowadays, a lot of images are being generated due to extensive use of smart phone and being spreaded worldwide due to the popularity of social media and high speed internet services. To remove the language ambiguity problem, images are required sophisticated analysis instead of simple textual base analysis and hence CBIR is developed. It is a new way to retrieve images based on color, texture, and shape features of the images. The major challenges of the CBIR systems are the retrieval accuracy and the computational complexity. In this paper, color moments are used due to its small feature vector which will reduce computational complexity. Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix is used as texture feature to extract a repetitive pattern of the image. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a classifier and it will remove irrelevant images and hence improve retrieval accuracy. The linear and non-linear SVM classifier is used to predict category of the query images and filter out the irrelevant images. In non-linear SVM classifier, three different kernels: Polynomial, Radial Bases Function (RBF) and Sigmoidal function are used. It is proved that RBF performs good due to its exponential kernel and hence resolve the problem in infinite dimensions.

Keywords \u2014 classification, machine learning, Linear Discriminant Analysis, decision rules, oblique decision rules I. Introduction Machine learning is the wide branch of the computer science that contents algorithms and methods of building models from the data. The nature of the data and the goal of the analysis usually divide machine learning into two main groups: supervised and unsupervised learning. In the case of the unsupervised learning, data examples do not contain any decision attribute. In the case of the supervised learning data examples contain two types of attributes: one (or more) is considered as the dependent from the remaining ones and is called the decision attribute or just the class. Then it is claimed that there exist some dependencies between conditional attributes and the class. In other words, supervised algorithms try to find (or describe) existing dependencies in the data. The name of the supervised learning comes from the fact, that the built model can be evaluated on the data which class labels are known. Supervised methods are also divided into two groups due to the nature of the dependent attribute: if the decision attribute takes values from the finite set (set of discrete values) it is commonly named as the classification and the regression otherwise. There are many of algorithms of classification. Just to mention the most important of them: artificial neural networks [16] , Support Vector Machines [4], decision trees [15], linear discriminant analysis [8]. As the most popular methods of regression apart from also applicable neural networks and Support Vector Machines, also splines [3], kernel estimators [21][27], radial basis functions [5], additive models [9], projection pursuit regression [9] should be mentioned. All algorithms of the supervised and unsupervised learning can be also divided due to the criterion of the model being transparent (or just interpretable) for the user or in other words \u2013 the transparency of the decision making process. conditional attributes and the class.

One option is to assign these nodes to both clusters, which is equivalent to overlap of nodes and data redundancy occurs.

Data fusion has been widely investigated for integrating different source of data in classification of urban area. Thermal infrared imagery (TIR) contains information on emitted radiation and has unique radiometric properties. However, due to coarse spatial resolution of thermal data, its application has been restricted in urban areas. On the other hand, visible image (VIS) has high spatial resolution and information in visible spectrum. Consequently, there is a complementary relation between thermal and visible imagery in classification of urban area. This paper evaluates the potential of aerial thermal hyperspectral and visible imagery fusion in classification of urban area. In the pre-processing step, thermal imagery is resampled to the spatial resolution of visible image. Then feature level fusion is applied to construct hybrid feature space include visible bands, thermal hyperspectral bands, spatial and texture features and moreover Principle Component Analysis (PCA) transformation is applied to extract PCs. Due to high dimensionality of feature space, dimension reduction method is performed. Finally, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classify the reduced hybrid feature space.

In this paper, we propose a generative data augmentation method for temporal stream of the Temporal Segment Networks with the dynamic image. The dynamic image compresses the motion information of video into a still image, removing the interference factors such as the background. Thus it is easier to generate images with categorical motion information using GAN. We use the generated dynamic images to enhance the features, with regularization achieved as well, thereby to achieve the effect of video augmentation. In order to deal with the uneven quality of generated images, we propose a Self-Paced Selection (SPS) method, which automatically selects the high-quality generated samples to be added to the network training.

Although there have been lots of studies on using software product metrics to identify defect-prone modules, defect prediction algorithms are still worth exploring. For instance, it is not easy to directly implement the Apriori algorithm to classify defect-prone modules across a skewed dataset. Therefore, we propose a novel supervised approach for software defect prediction based on atomic class-association rule mining (ACAR). It holds the characteristics of only one feature of the antecedent and a unique class label of the consequent, which is a specific kind of association rules that explores the relationship between attributes and categories. It holds the characteristics of only one feature of the antecedent and a unique class label of the consequent, which is a specific kind of association rules that explores the relationship between attributes and categories. Such association patterns can provide meaningful knowledge that can be easily understood by software engineers. A new software defect prediction model infrastructure based on association rules is employed to improve the prediction of defect-prone modules, which is divided into data preprocessing, rule model building and performance evaluation. Moreover, ACAR can achieve a satisfactory classification performance compared with other seven benchmark learners (the extension of classification based on associations (CBA2), Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayesian, Decision Tree, OneR, K-nearest Neighbors and RIPPER) on NASA MDP and PROMISE datasets. In light of software defect associative prediction, a comparative experiment between ACAR and CBA2 is discussed in details. It is demonstrated that ACAR is better than CBA2 in terms of AUC, G-mean, Balance, and understandability. In addition, the average AUC of ACAR is increased by 2.9% compared with CBA2, which can reach 81.1%.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2018.07.042", "venue": "Expert Syst.

On the other hand, modeling gas production from shale reservoirs is a complex multi-variate problem that requires proper integration of data from multiple disciplines, such as geology, petrophysics, geomechanics, completions, and surface-based measurements, etc. This study demonstrates the application of data-driven machine learning algorithms, integrating geoscientific, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), distributed temperature sensing (DTS) fiber-optic, completions, flow scanner production log, and surface data to model daily gas production from a 28-stage stimulated horizontal well drilled in the Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian basin in North America. In addition, this study aims to utilize the data from a fiber-optic monitoring system, such as DAS and DTS to evaluate the well performance. We build supervised data-driven machine learning models using Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to understand the well performance and forecast the daily gas production. The study compares the forecasted results, tests the level of accuracy, and addresses different issues with these machine learning algorithms. A spatio-temporal database is constructed and used to perform sensitivity analyses to identify the key drivers for gas production. The results show that RF and ANN algorithms can be used to predict daily gas production with significantly high accuracy; however, RF algorithm is the best predictor in terms of highest accuracy (96%), less computational time and cost. Based on sensitivity analysis, it appears that Poisson's ratio, minimum horizontal stress, DAS, casing pressure, gamma log are the most important parameters to predict gas production.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.petrol.2019.01.013", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering", "mag_id": "2909582448", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211016993"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134837964"}

However, the DCCA learning process is unsupervised and thus lacks the class label information of training samples on the two views. In order to take full advantage of the class information of training samples, we propose a discriminative version of DCCA referred to as supervised DCCA (SDCCA) for feature learning, which explicitly considers the class information of samples. Compared with DCCA, the SDCCA method can not only guarantee the nonlinear maximal correlation between two views, but also minimize within-class scatter of the samples. With supervision, SDCCA can extract more discriminative features for pattern classification tasks.

Meanwhile, class imbalance learning often occurs simultaneously in class incremental learning when the new class emerges. Previous studies mainly proposed different methods to handle this problem. But these methods focus on classification tasks with a fixed class set and cannot adjust the peripheral contour features of the original instance distribution. As a result, the classification performance degrades seriously in an open dynamic environment, and the synthetic instances are always clustered within the original distribution. In order to solve class imbalance learning effectively in class incremental learning, we propose a Central-diffused Instance Generation Method to generate the instances of minority class as the new class emerging, called CdIGM. The key is to randomly shoot direction vectors of fixed length from the center of new class instances to expand the instance distribution space. The vectors diffuse to form a distribution which is optimized to satisfy properties that produce a multi-classification discriminative classifier with good performance. We conduct the experiments on both artificial data streams with different imbalance rates and real-world ones to compare CdIGM with some other proposed methods, e.g. SMOTE, OPCIL, OB and SDCIL. The experiment results show that CdIGM averagely achieves more than 4.01%, 4.49%, 8.81% and 9.76% performance improvement over SMOTE, OPCIL, OB and SDCIL, respectively, and outperforms in terms of overall and real-time accuracy.

At first, I apply several statistical analysis supported by several data visualization approaches. Then, I implement various classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, AdaBoost Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Neighbors Classifiers, and 4 Ensemble Models to classify 15 different classes of crimes. The outcomes are captured using two popular test methods: train-test split, and k-fold cross-validation.

The main task of feature selection and feature reduction is a reduction dimension in feature space while, at the same time, ensuring that is no loss in the minimum of accuracy. There are several factors to consider in reduction dimension of a term - document matrix of feature space. It can lead to removal of irrelevant and useless features; including as a result, more efficient categories, easier analysis more accurately of sentiment after reduction.

Searching for these threats is akin to searching for needles in an ever-growing field of haystacks. This thesis considers novel automated image analysis methods to automate or assist elements of cargo inspection. The four main contributions of this thesis are as follows. Methods are proposed for the measurement and correction of detector wobble in large-scale transmission radiography using Beam Position Detectors (BPDs). Wobble is estimated from BPD measurements using a Random Regression Forest (RRF) model, Bayesian fused with a prior estimate from an Auto-Regression (AR). Next, a series of image corrections are derived, and it is shown that 87% of image error due to wobble can be corrected. This is the first proposed method for correction of wobble in large-scale transmission radiography. A Threat Image Projection (TIP) framework is proposed, for training, probing and evaluating Automated Threat Detection (ATD) algorithms. The TIP method is validated experimentally, and a method is proposed to test whether algorithms can learn to exploit TIP artefacts. A system for Empty Container Verification (ECV) is proposed. The system, trained using TIP, is based on Random Forest (RF) classification of image patches according to fixed geometric features and container location. The method outperforms previous reported results, and is able to detect very small amounts of synthetically concealed smuggled contraband. Finally, a method for ATD is proposed, based on a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained from scratch using TIP, and exploits the material information encoded within dual-energy X-ray images to suppress false alarms. The system offers a 100-fold improvement in the false positive rate over prior work.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2909533902", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133523572"}

Finally, the characterization of ML algorithms is discussed and Random Forest (RF), a variant of Decision Tree algorithms, is presented as the best methodology for modeling travel mode choice.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.15446/dyna.v86n211.79743", "venue": null, "journal": "Dyna", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2990651761", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["55038688", "17526433", "155851280", "153447405", "54502675", "60855865", "55060015", "153296073", "1444402", "110528862", "28025607", "109492088", "111291004", "2245808", "53873286", "109827319", "36185836", "490415", "14451301", "64349675", "120118103", "17468712", "206608807", "11364442", "61206295", "27199139", "111111684", "111141229", "128075270", "110533100", "153424785", "119515169", "51962317", "51865583", "119252761", "73707963", "60745877", "132316646", "2725060", "6263878", "88322", "154376761", "5262555", "207738357", "5145897", "89141", "7138354", "206787478", "865255", "2027822", "108887091", "2346961", "2638864", "19302961", "167314819", "158487002", "114890447", "73654583", "59446356", "53218720", "110703297", "109944659", "109571952", "120482652", "40505731", "15601544", "109954481", "109350910", "110957142", "110265191", "109507743", "152712140", "110222591", "154557978", "114944552", "70094874", "108859472", "154897699", "114613211", "113648055", "89609696", "55663040", "10344554", "153625688", "122848280", "110819640"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210897421"}

In order to prove the feasibility of this hypothesis, we have carried out an experiment of typeface design for Chinese characters. The problem to be solved in this experiment is the contradiction between traditional Chinese character design method and large-scale diversification of information needs. We propose to design a Chinese character typeface family instead of designing a typeface which provides diverse character experience based on the concept of \u201cone character with thousands of forms\u201d. In order to obtain the typeface family, we adopt Generative Adversarial Networks and select different typical Chinese typefaces as data for model training, finally generate the diverse typefaces. This design method is completely different from the traditional typeface design method and it has produced a new typeface design form. In general, the designer initiated the button of design creativity according to the design problem.

The proposed extension deals with the multi-class transductive learning problem, which consists in learning several classes with a set of labels for each class. Learning several classes (i.e. more than two classes) simultaneously is generally a challenging problem, but the proposed method builds on strong results introduced in imaging to overcome the multi-class issue.

Crop phenology is dynamic as it changes with times of the year. Such biophysical processes also look spectrally different to remote sensing satellites. Some crops may depict similar spectral properties if their phenology coincide, but differ later when their phenology diverge. Thus, conventional approaches that select only images from phenological stages where crops are distinguishable for classification, have low discrimination. In contrast, stacking images within a cropping season limits discrimination to a single feature space that can suffer from overlapping classes. Since crop backscatter varies with time, it can aid discrimination. Therefore, our main objective is to develop a crop sequence classification method using multitemporal TerraSAR-X images. We adopt first order markov assumption in undirected temporal graph sequence. This property is exploited to implement Dynamic Conditional Random Fields (DCRFs). Our DCRFs model has a repeated structure of temporally connected Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Each node in the sequence is connected to its predecessor via conditional probability matrix. The matrix is computed using posterior class probabilities from association potential. This way, there is a mutual temporal exchange of phenological information observed in TerraSAR-X images. When compared to independent epoch classification, the designed DCRF model improved crop discrimination at each epoch in the sequence. However, government, insurers, agricultural market traders and other stakeholders are interested in the quantity of a certain crop in a season. Therefore, we further develop a DCRF ensemble classifier. The ensemble produces an optimal crop map by maximizing over posterior class probabilities selected from the sequence based on maximum F1-score and weighted by correctness. Our ensemble technique is compared to standard approach of stacking all images as bands for classification using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and standard CRFs.

Such services are based on detecting and recognizing Activities of Daily Living (ADL) by using diverse types of sensors at the elder's home that transmit activity data to a remote backend for processing. However, these have a limited reach due to high costs, mostly due to elevated prices of the hardware required, as well as the installation costs. Meanwhile, Smart Home technologies are reaching more homes every year. These are based on identical sets of sensors as those prescribed for remote health monitoring systems. Extensive research has taken place in recognizing ADL given the sensor signals. However, these methodologies require prescribed sensors, the floor plan of the house and the location of the sensors. In this thesis, we first propose a generic IoT interface that enables the backend to connect to arbitrary sensors, such as those typically found in Smart Homes. Regardless of the brand and communication protocol they use, the sensor data is transmitted to a backend where it can be processed by the ADL recognition algorithms and other telemonitoring services. We evaluate our design in the Philips HomeLab environment where generic sensors are installed. The system correctly transmits the activity detected by the sensors to a remote cloud service. Then, we propose a methodology based on Multidimensional Scaling to estimate the location and distribution of sensors based entirely on monitored sensor activity. Finally, we propose a methodology combining heuristics and Support Vector Machines to classify and label the sensors by the type of room in which they are placed, such as Kitchen, Bedroom or Bathroom. We train and test our model based on 4 different houses where volunteers had sensors monitoring their activity for at least 80 days. Our proposed methodology correctly identifies 5 different key locations and fully characterizes the interior of the house. Our heuristic classifier achieves a sensitivity of 0.84 and specificity of 0.98. The SVM classifier achieves a precision of 0.78 and recall of 0.78. This results in an automated method of generating the configuration data needed by the fore mentioned ADL recognition algorithms.

The effect of participant gender and age and kin-relation pair of the stimulus is analyzed using quantitative measures such as accuracy, discriminability index $d'$ , and perceptual information entropy. Utilizing the information obtained from the human study, a hierarchical kinship verification via representation learning (KVRL) framework is utilized to learn the representation of different face regions in an unsupervised manner. We propose a novel approach for feature representation termed as filtered contractive deep belief networks ( fc DBN). The proposed feature representation encodes relational information present in images using filters and contractive regularization penalty. A compact representation of facial images of kin is extracted as an output from the learned model and a multi-layer neural network is utilized to verify the kin accurately. A new WVU kinship database is created, which consists of multiple images per subject to facilitate kinship verification. The results show that the proposed deep learning framework (KVRL- fc DBN) yields the state-of-the-art kinship verification accuracy on the WVU kinship database and on four existing benchmark data sets. Furthermore, kinship information is used as a soft biometric modality to boost the performance of face verification via product of likelihood ratio and support vector machine based approaches. Using the proposed KVRL- fc DBN framework, an improvement of over 20% is observed in the performance of face verification.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1805.10557", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28113665", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2016.2609811", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing ( Volume: 26, Issue: 1, Jan. 2017 )", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2520903215", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["28773498", "10772493", "4105041", "4346161", "41796133", "1428192", "18894064", "6143965", "27143506", "143891669", "144583579", "13592552", "9920459", "29539398", "10475617", "3183928", "13363382", "831208", "1273759", "408523", "7725855", "2317914", "2255779", "44918", "4689654", "11309864", "11724192", "18657235", "13406213", "28976092", "5755181", "14147124", "23245145", "46188393", "145540666", "17240533", "37696103", "39322233", "1537535", "12331515", "11979599", "2309950", "8141422", "12008458", "6844431", "9347196", "12080325", "28637672", "5066923", "369876", "206590483", "7511562", "9898157", "208935309", "42281583", "18494720"], "inbound_citations": ["212705645", "22178487", "44114648", "203078388", "53115262", "59843071", "209695784", "203605791", "52964976", "123116980", "214610716", "5968537", "209423691", "69526913", "9175763", "52960951", "201144131", "67875613", "8510999", "215238581"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7792791"}

More significantly, it is currently unknown how classifier choices and trends generalize across multiple institutions, due to heterogeneous acquisition and intensity characteristics (especially when considering MR imaging data). In this work, we empirically evaluate and compare a number of different classifiers and classifier ensembles in a multi-site setting, for voxel-wise detection of prostate cancer (PCa) using radiomic texture features derived from high-resolution in vivo T2-weighted (T2w) MRI.MethodsTwelve different supervised classifier schemes: Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Trees (DTs), and their ensemble variants (bagging, boosting), were compared in terms of classification accuracy as well as execution time. Our study utilized 85 prostate cancer T2w MRI datasets acquired from across 3 different institutions (1 for discovery, 2 for independent validation), from patients who later underwent radical prostatectomy. Surrogate ground truth for disease extent on MRI was established by expert annotation of pre-operative MRI through spatial correlation with corresponding ex vivo whole-mount histology sections. Classifier accuracy in detecting PCa extent on MRI on a per-voxel basis was evaluated via area under the ROC curve.ResultsThe boosted DT classifier yielded the highest cross-validated AUC (= 0.744) for detecting PCa in the discovery cohort. However, in independent validation, the boosted QDA classifier was identified as the most accurate and robust for voxel-wise detection of PCa extent (AUCs of 0.735, 0.683, 0.768 across the 3 sites). The next most accurate and robust classifier was the single QDA classifier, which also enjoyed the advantage of significantly lower computation times compared to any of the other methods.ConclusionsOur results therefore suggest that simpler classifiers (such as QDA and its ensemble variants) may be more robust, accurate, and efficient for prostate cancer CAD problems, especially in the context of multi-site validation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6396464", "pubmed_id": "30819131", "doi": "10.1186/s12880-019-0308-6", "venue": "BMC Medical Imaging", "journal": "BMC Medical Imaging", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2932274656", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10898225", "5988059", "39524924", "17498788", "4567724", "207738357", "1836349", "56776745", "17030953", "1088806", "22355842", "12394453", "65401481", "2594813", "59849738", "10344554", "34872970", "2776777", "17943955", "40022764", "123244804", "9064834", "19239977", "12700546", "12553267", "2995286", "4014041", "28443760", "11722295", "205932854", "206786900", "206764015", "379259", "195592288", "1346547", "56563878", "4583279", "7553535", "14669208", "29081876", "24400915", "34493649", "4074916", "8540654"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67867277"}

While effective, this method suffers from the growing number of support vectors in the underlying classifiers as the number of training examples increases.

By using the anonymous structure of the Internet, attackers set out new techniques, such as phishing, to deceive victims with the use of false websites to collect their sensitive information such as account IDs, usernames, passwords, etc. Understanding whether a web page is legitimate or phishing is a very challenging problem, due to its semantics-based attack structure, which mainly exploits the computer users\u2019 vulnerabilities. Although software companies launch new anti-phishing products, which use blacklists, heuristics, visual and machine learning-based approaches, these products cannot prevent all of the phishing attacks. In this paper, a real-time anti-phishing system, which uses seven different classification algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) based features, is proposed. The system has the following distinguishing properties from other studies in the literature: language independence, use of a huge size of phishing and legitimate data, real-time execution, detection of new websites, independence from third-party services and use of feature-rich classifiers. For measuring the performance of the system, a new dataset is constructed, and the experimental results are tested on it.

We formulate a problem of learning robust classifier in the framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), where the adversarial attack on classifier acts as a generator, and the critic network learns to distinguish between regular and adversarial images. The classifier cost is augmented with the objective that its adversarial examples should confuse the adversary critic.

An imputation method is proposed based on Random Forest algorithm. Missing data set is separated according to missing features. Random Forest regression model is built to iteratively impute after the determination of stopping criterion. The optimal combination of decision tree numbers and variables numbers randomly sampled at each split in Random Forest are identified by taking the minimum normalized root mean square error as objective function. Imputation results on highway tunnel operational missing data indicate that the method provides significantly higher precision and better robustness than KNN, SVD, MICE, PPCA, reducing normalized root mean square error by at least 25% .

Skinner, scholars (and parents!) have wondered how children move from the blooming, buzzing confusion of infancy, through the tumult of childhood and adolescence, into adulthood. Does development occur continuously over time or in a series of dramatic stages? Is development driven by learning or by biological maturational processes? What is the nature of experience, and how does it generate change? The study of development has always been organized around these big questions. And answers to these questions have a profound influence on daily life, forming a framework for how parents think about their own children, and influencing both national policy and educational curricula. ::: ::: This book defines and refines two major theoretical approaches within developmental science that address the central issues of development-connectionism and dynamical systems theory. Spencer, Thomas, and McClelland have brought together chapters that provide an introduction, overview, and critical evaluation of each approach, including three sets of case studies that illustrate how both approaches have been used to study topics ranging from early motor development to the acquisition of grammar. They also present a collection of commentaries by leading scholars, which offer a critical view from both an \"outsiders\" and an \"insiders\" perspective. The book is unique in the range of its treatment-it begins to delineate how developmental science can incorporate advances within neuroscience and computational modeling, and brings the new ideas of connectionism and dynamic systems theory into sharper focus, clarifying their usefulness and explanatory power.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195300598.001.0001", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1935480888", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["10436266", "148320881", "43444420", "8775812", "7069311", "143637046", "1339674", "14144744", "151412990", "35473351", "37308021", "15074600", "26166298", "19003520", "63562717", "15572239", "6144184", "14521178", "58769192", "2832081", "151829829", "22542599", "18102082", "13447684", "2556627", "148241643", "20670356", "8943490", "209396626", "148166458", "118854757", "19038497", "17883700", "10976078", "14371762", "18296864", "1691932", "122153", "15778703", "15938776"], "inbound_citations": ["16486140"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7386261"}

As most existing XML classifiers are capable of processing only static data, there is a need to develop new approaches dedicated for streaming environments. In this paper, we propose a new classification algorithm for XML data streams called XSC. The algorithm uses incrementally mined frequent subtrees and a tree-subtree similarity measure to classify new documents in an associative manner. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated against eight state-of-the-art stream classifiers on real and synthetic data.

The granitic rocks selected are from the north region of Portugal existing in ancient masonry structures. Several experiments were performed to build a database of 55 records containing the mechanical and physical parameters mentioned above. The predictive capacity of the models was evaluated using the coefficient of correlation, R, and the root mean square error, RMSE. The results showed a good predictive capacity of the developed models. Vasconcelos et al. (2008) established statistical correlations between ultrasonic pulse velocity and fci and fcd. Furthermore, they developed simple correlations between other mechanical and physical properties of granites such as tensile and compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, porosity, dry density and the normalized mode I fracture energy. In fact, the existence of accurate predictive models can be of advantage, avoiding the need of performing compressive tests when the availability of specimens is a concern. The application of intelligent tools such as Data Mining (DM) techniques for determination of the compressive mechanical parameters has been practically restrained to the Artificial Neural Networks. Nevertheless, this technique has only been applied to predict the compressive strength (Singh et al. 2001; Zorlu et al. 2008; Martins et al. 2012). The SVM technique has been applied by Martins et al. (2012) to forecast the uniaxial compressive strength and the modulus of elasticity of granites. As far as the authors knowledge, the work carried out under this research concerning the prediction of stress crack indicators based on the physical properties through intelligent tools is original. Besides, the prediction of resistance under compression of granites is also limited compared to other rock materials used in construction and the results presented here aim at contributing to the state of art. The intelligent tools used in this study are the DM techniques denominated Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and multiple regressions (MR). 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Brief description of the granites used Most of the granites used in this study were collected from the Northern region of Portugal. This region presents climatic conditions that favour the granite weathering and its outcrops often display different degrees of weathering. It is known that the weathering state influence considerably the strength and elastic properties. It is obvious that the weathering state leads to a significant reduction of tensile and compressive strength, as well as of the modulus of elasticity. In this study samples were extracted from blocks of rocks that could be used to extract building stones. Following the Geological Society of London classification (GSL, 1995) most of the rocks present a weathering degree between grades II and III. The granites considered in this study are fine to medium, medium to coarse, and coarse-grained, have biotite or two mica and present iron in fissures that is responsible for discoloration. Some of them have porphyritic textures. A more detailed description of the used granites can be found in Graca (2008). Tables 1 and 2 present an overview of the descriptive statistics of the rock properties used in the database, namely the physical properties as ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), density \u03c1, and porosity \u03b7.

The variability in the climate can be represented by the ocean-atmospheric oscillations which provide the forecast opportunity for the streamflow. Prediction of future water availability accurately and reliably is a key step for successful water resource management in the arid regions. Four popular ocean-atmospheric indices were used in this study for annual streamflow volume prediction. They were Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Multivariate Relevance Vector Machine (MVRVM), a data driven model based on Bayesian learning approach was used as a prediction model. The model was applied to four unimpaired stream gages in Utah that spatially covers the state from north to south. Different models were developed based on the combinations of oscillation indices in the input. A total of 60 years (1950-2009) of data were used for the analysis. The model was trained on 50 years of data (1950-1999) and tested on 10 years of data (2000-2009). The best combination of oscillation indices and the lead-time were identified for each gage which was used to develop the prediction model. The predicted flow had reasonable agreement with the actual annual flow volume. The sensitivity analysis shows that the PDO and ENSO have relatively stronger effect compared to other oscillation indices in Utah. The prediction results from the MVRVM were compared with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) where MVRVM performed relatively better.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4236/jwarp.2014.66062", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Water Resource and Protection", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2083001587", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["20317305", "14554100", "119843264", "128575711", "140572312", "53534572", "3067430", "19372166", "109657729", "128395671", "14000268", "51815834", "53378798", "128402690", "110091091", "121027857", "7596571", "3043576", "7138354", "7138354", "14209424", "64543020", "195707283", "5307916", "17144304"], "inbound_citations": ["133337733", "129677665", "158945711"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54037139"}

In this paper, regional texture information is extracted from the hyperspectral data by using a Spatial Pixel Association (SPA) processing to further improve the classification performance of SVM techniques. A novel approaches over SVM by exploiting SPA characteristics is proposed in order to increase the classification accuracy. Moreover, a new method that can be used to solve the misclassified-pixels problem, Control Process of Growing Classes (CPoGC), is also proposed in this manuscript. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, experiments on AVIRIS hyperspectral data over Indian Pine Site (IPS) are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed classification approaches against some existing SVM based techniques such as SC-SVM and PSO-SVM, and some traditional methods like K-NN and K-means.

To improve the stroke predicting accuracy is a necessary measure for reducing the happening of stroke. As a non-invasive and portable method? Transcranial Doppler (TCD) can provide valuable information in diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease by measuring the blood flow speed in intracranial arteries. How to improve diagnosis accuracy performance based on TCD data set is a necessary demand for realizing cerebrovascular disease TCD intelligent diagnosis system. But TCD data set often presents an imbalanced phenomenon for less patients' data over all examiners. This imbalanced phenomenon easily makes a lower predicting accuracy of cerebrovascular patients. In this paper, an improved fuzzy support vector machine model is proposed by combining class center distance and information entropy. The model efficiently utilizes the advantages of class center distance and information entropy. Moreover, the imbalanced fuzzy support vector machine is used by combining an adaptive imbalanced regulator. The different influence of the imbalance regulating factor value on the classification effect were discussed in detail for finding a suitable regulating factor value.

CMEs can cause severe disturbances in the interplanetary space and even affect human activities in many respects, causing damages to infrastructure and losses of revenue. Fast and accurate prediction of CME arrival time is then vital to minimize the disruption CMEs may cause when interacting with geospace. In this paper, we propose a new approach for partial-/full-halo CME Arrival Time Prediction Using Machine learning Algorithms (CAT-PUMA). Via detailed analysis of the CME features and solar wind parameters, we build a prediction engine taking advantage of 182 previously observed geo-effective partial-/full-halo CMEs and using algorithms of the Support Vector Machine (SVM). We demonstrate that CAT-PUMA is accurate and fast. In particular, predictions after applying CAT-PUMA to a test set, that is unknown to the engine, show a mean absolute prediction error $\\sim$5.9 hours of the CME arrival time, with 54% of the predictions having absolute errors less than 5.9 hours. Comparison with other models reveals that CAT-PUMA has a more accurate prediction for 77% of the events investigated; and can be carried out very fast, i.e. within minutes after providing the necessary input parameters of a CME. A practical guide containing the CAT-PUMA engine and the source code of two examples are available in the Appendix, allowing the community to perform their own applications for prediction using CAT-PUMA.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1802.02803", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3847/1538-4357/aaae69", "venue": "ApJ, 855, 109, 2018", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2787377517", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["69997935", "117913905", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": ["153308330", "212634116", "173188053", "208857777"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4708271"}

The lifting algorithm has a strong ability to adapt to various scenarios with a high accuracy, and has played a great role in many fields. But in astronomy, the application of lifting algorithms is still rare. In response to the low classification accuracy of the dark star/galaxy source set in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), a new research result of machine learning, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), has been introduced. The complete photometric data set is obtained from the SDSS-DR7, and divided into a bright source set and a dark source set according to the star magnitude. Firstly, the ten-fold cross-validation method is used for the bright source set and the dark source set respectively, and the XGBoost algorithm is used to establish the star/galaxy classification model. Then, the grid search and other methods are used to adjust the XGBoost parameters. Finally, based on the galaxy classification accuracy and other indicators, the classification results are analyzed, by comparing with the models of function tree (FT), Adaptive boosting (Adaboost), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Stacked Denoising AutoEncoders (SDAE), and Deep Belief Nets (DBN).

They want to see their online grocery companies turning profits and maybe even making innovations. Who will buy what product? Which channel is more profitabledigital or non-digital? Which demographic group is most productive for sales? How much influence do rewards have on sales? How effective are email campaigns on sales? How can the data be mined to cross sell and thus exploit hidden relationships in the data, to gain competitive advantage in customer retention? The data is made up of continuous and nominal variables. I will analyze this transactional, demographic and geographic data with a goal to glean insights to help this grocery business to increase preorder penetration and density in orders so as to optimize truck routing and maximize sales. Statistical Problem The net sales for these customers will be analyzed over a period of time to see if there are any differences over time and more so any significant drivers. Frequency of sales will be looked at as a measure. The channel of sale will be further dissected so as to point to the more profitable channels for sales. It will look at a slice of group of customers from a frozen food company to see who the loyal customers are and perhaps find out what seems to be the patterns and metrics that they exhibit. The Statistical methods of Multi-linear Regression, Boosted Decision Trees, and Bootstrap Random Forest were used to confirm the conjecture that the digital customer base seems to be a more profitable.

A latent discriminative model, which combines the strengths of Latent Dynamic Conditional Random Field (LDCRF) and semi-CRF, is proposed to detect new words together with their POS synchronously regardless of the types of new words from Chinese text without being pre-segmented. Unlike semi-CRF, in proposed latent discriminative model, LDCRF is applied 10 generate candidate entities, which accelerates the training speed and decreases the computational cost. The complexity of proposed hidden semi-CRF could be further adjusted by tuning the number of hidden variables and the number of candidate entities from the Nbest outputs of LDCRF model. A new-word-generating framework is proposed for model training and testing, under which the definitions and distributions of new words conform to the ones in real text. The global feature called \"Global Fragment Features\" for new word identification is adopted. We tested our model on the corpus from SIGHAN-6.

However, predicting water consumption fluctuations is complicated, given their non-stationary and non-linear characteristics. In this paper, a multiple random forests model, integrated wavelet transform and random forests regression (W-RFR), is proposed for the prediction of daily urban water consumption in southwest of China. Raw time series were first decomposed into low- and high-frequency parts with discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). The random forests regression (RFR) method was then used for prediction using each subseries. In the process, the input and output constructions of the RFR model were proposed for each subseries on the basis of the delay times and the embedding dimension of the attractor reconstruction computed by the C-C method, respectively. The forecasting values of each subseries were summarized as the final results. Four performance criteria, i.e., correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and threshold static (TS), were used to evaluate the forecasting capacity of the W-RFR. The results indicated that the W-RFR can capture the basic dynamics of the daily urban water consumption. The forecasted performance of the proposed approach was also compared with those of models, i.e., the RFR and forward feed neural network (FFNN) models. The results indicated that among the models, the precision of the predictions of the proposed model was greater, which is attributed to good feature extractions from the multi-scale perspective and favorable feature learning performance using the decision trees.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11269-017-1774-7", "venue": "Water Resources Management", "journal": "Water Resources Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2754358410", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["31774940", "207109639", "154975407", "129539818", "111117385", "89141", "14804709", "96647258", "48492243", "31039418", "110070910", "32292346", "123611556", "14755018", "113006941", "2356353", "6809347", "128824975", "57422871", "84527740", "108505936", "14139856", "43992238", "154052130", "13195700", "123887069", "53333068", "18086320", "6980118"], "inbound_citations": ["159115775", "86861487", "155980866", "135430419", "117335241", "208869726", "102484795"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:158418088"}

This indicates an urgent demand for improving the experience of TV-to-Online (T2O). In this paper, a transfer learning approach as well as a prototype system for effortless T2O experience is developed. In the system, a key component is high-precision product search, which is to fulfill exact matching between a query item and the database ones. The matching performance primarily relies on distance estimation, but the data characteristics cannot be well modeled and exploited by a simple Euclidean distance. This motivates us to introduce distance metric learning (DML) for improving the distance estimation. However, in traditional DML methods, the side information (such as the similar/dissimilar constraints or relevance/irrelevance judgements) in the target domain is leveraged. These methods may fail due to limited side information. Fortunately, this issue can be alleviated by utilizing transfer metric learning (TML) to exploit information from other related domains. In this paper, a novel manifold regularized heterogeneous multitask metric learning framework is proposed, in which each domain is treated equally. The proposed approach allows us to simultaneously exploit the information from other domains and the unlabeled information. Furthermore, the ranking-based loss is adopted to make our model more appropriate for search. Experiments on two challenging real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Outcomes were disability and pain intensity measured with questionnaires at 2 weeks and 3 months, and 1-year trajectories of LBP based on weekly responses to text messages.

Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) identification has been found incapable to accurately capture the dynamics in these applications over the entire operating region, while nonlinear identification methods still often result in over-laborious and expensive process modeling tools with a too complex model for control synthesis. The concept of data-driven Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) modeling offers an in-between-solution over LTI and nonlinear identification by describing the signal relations in a linear manner which vary with the operating point of the system. Furthermore, the LPV modeling and control framework is considered to have the potential to become the long-waited solution for the modeling and control problems of the process field. Through the case study of Propane-Propene splitter, which is a commonly used high-purity distillation column, this thesis explores the potential of LPV modeling and identification for process systems. Importantly, the PP-splitter represents a particularly challenging process system due to its Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) nature and significant nonlinear behavior in the high-purity operating region. The results presented in this thesis shows that, although such a system could impose problems for local LPV identification approaches (identification w.r.t. constant operating conditions), the application of global LPV identification (identification w.r.t. varying operating conditions) has found to be able to identify the dynamics of the system even under severe noise conditions. Moreover, the global methodology presented in this thesis, which is called the LPV Least-Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), belongs to an emerging trend of novel approaches which adopt machine learning theories in the system identification.

Newly introduced machine learning methods however may allow for direct estimation of attenuation maps from non attenuation-corrected PET data (PETNAC).

Pseudo-CT was used for subsequent AC of these validation data sets resulting in independently attenuation-corrected PET data. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Visual inspection revealed a high degree of resemblance of generated pseudo-CT images compared to the acquired CT images in all validation data sets, with minor differences in individual anatomical details. Quantitative analyses revealed minimal underestimation below 5% of standardized uptake value (SUV) in all brain regions in independently attenuation-corrected PET data compared to the reference PET images. Color-coded error maps showed no regional bias and only minimal average errors around \u00b10%.

To come up with the solution one can make use of technologies with the increase of machine learning, artificial intelligence and other relevant fields of information technology, it becomes feasible to automate this process and to save some of the intensive amounts of labor that is put into detecting credit card fraud. Initially, we will collect the credit card usage data-set by users and classify it as trained and testing dataset using a random forest algorithm and decision trees. Using this feasible algorithm, we can analyze the larger data-set and user provided current data-set. Then augment the accuracy of the result data. Proceeded with the application of processing of some of the attributes provided which can find affected fraud detection in viewing the graphical model of data visualization.

The prediction procedure should yield accurate results in a fast enough fashion to alert patients of impending seizures. Methods: We quantitatively analyze the human iEEG data to obtain insights into how the human brain behaves before and between epileptic seizures. We then introduce an efficient pre-processing method for reducing the data size and converting the time-series iEEG data into an image-like format that can be used as inputs to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Further, we propose a seizure prediction algorithm that uses cooperative multi-scale CNNs for automatic feature learning of iEEG data. Results: 1) iEEG channels contain complementary information and excluding individual channels is not advisable to retain the spatial information needed for accurate prediction of epileptic seizures. 2) The traditional PCA is not a reliable method for iEEG data reduction in seizure prediction. 3) Hand-crafted iEEG features may not be suitable for reliable seizure prediction performance as the iEEG data varies between patients and over time for the same patient. 4) Seizure prediction results show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods by achieving an average sensitivity of 87.85% and AUC score of 0.84. Conclusion: Understanding how the human brain behaves before seizure attacks and far from them facilitates better designs of epileptic seizure predictors.

The use of multiple features requires an equal number of data dimensions, and thus classification in as high a dimensional space as possible can improve final classification results. Finally, the MDCA algorithm uses a relatively small number of simple operations, which leads to a fast processing time. Simulation results for the MDCA algorithm demonstrate good potential.

In this study, we present a novel life-threatening arrhythmias detection algorithm that combines a number of previously proposed ECG parameters by using support vector machines classifiers. A total of 13 parameters were computed accounting for temporal (morphological), spectral, and complexity features of the ECG signal. A filter-type feature selection (FS) procedure was proposed to analyze the relevance of the computed parameters and how they affect the detection performance. The proposed methodology was evaluated in two different binary detection scenarios: shockable (FV plus VT) versus nonshockable arrhythmias, and VF versus nonVF rhythms, using the information contained in the medical imaging technology database, the Creighton University ventricular tachycardia database, and the ventricular arrhythmia database. sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) analysis on the out of sample test data showed values of SE=95%, SP=99%, and SE=92% , SP=97% in the case of shockable and VF scenarios, respectively.

Advances in measurement tools in these networks make it easy to move towards dynamic pricing and non-fixed electricity tariffs. In this environment, the forecasted electricity price is declared to wholesale and retail consumers via Advanced Measurement Instruments (AMI). Therefore, motivated by different factors such as optimizing the economic/environmental issues or increasing the reliability, the customers are able to react to prices and manage their consumption. This pattern of reaction brings about extensive changes in the load and price curves of the network. On the other hand, environmental concerns resulting from the use of fossil fuels have increased the exploitation of renewable energies. But, as the penetration of renewable energy sources increases, serious improvements and modifications for the existing electric grid are needed to accommodate and integrate these intermittent sources. In this paper, a hybrid model is presented for simultaneous short term forecasting of electricity prices considering Distributed Generation (DG) in the price-sensitive environment of smart grids.

For this purpose we performed microarray analysis on 20 patients and estimated that we could predict advanced stage disease with 100% accuracy and the response to platin-based chemotherapy with 76.92% accuracy using leave-one-out cross validation techniques in combination with Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs).MethodsIn the current study we evaluate whether tumour characteristics in an independent set of 49 patients can be predicted using the pilot data set with principal component analysis or LS-SVMs.ResultsThe results of the principal component analysis suggest that the gene expression data from stage I, platin-sensitive advanced stage and platin-resistant advanced stage tumours in the independent data set did not correspond to their respective classes in the pilot study. Additionally, LS-SVM models built using the data from the pilot study \u2013 although they only misclassified one of four stage I tumours and correctly classified all 45 advanced stage tumours \u2013 were not able to predict resistance to platin-based chemotherapy. Furthermore, models based on the pilot data and on previously published gene sets related to ovarian cancer outcomes, did not perform significantly better than our models.ConclusionWe discuss possible reasons for failure of the model for predicting response to platin-based chemotherapy and conclude that existing results based on gene expression patterns of ovarian tumours need to be thoroughly scrutinized before these results can be accepted to reflect the true performance of microarray technology.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2259320", "pubmed_id": "18211668", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2407-8-18", "venue": "BMC Cancer", "journal": "BMC Cancer", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2086430651", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["25522077", "42886983", "15399244", "2311891", "25930654", "16121011", "10011710", "58145487", "23387903", "7202989", "25023228", "340493", "10689824", "31239187", "2098213", "30773781", "19016634"], "inbound_citations": ["207452655", "55293407", "12690351", "7201682", "215227180", "18989042", "845004"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2221755"}

Methods Resting-state high-density EEG recording data from 20 left TLE patients, 20 right TLE patients and 35 healthy controls was used. Epochs without interictal spikes were selected. The cortical source activity was obtained for 82 regions of interest and whole-brain directed functional connectivity was estimated in the theta, alpha and beta frequency bands. These connectivity values were then used to build a classification system based on two two-class Random Forests classifiers: TLE vs healthy controls and left vs right TLE. Feature selection and classifier training were done in a leave-one-out procedure to compute the mean classification accuracy. Results The diagnosis and lateralization classifiers achieved a high accuracy (90.7% and 90.0% respectively), sensitivity (95.0% and 90.0% respectively) and specificity (85.7% and 90.0% respectively). The most important features for diagnosis were the outflows from left and right medial temporal lobe, and for lateralization the right anterior cingulate cortex. The interaction between features was important to achieve correct classification. Significance This is the first study to automatically diagnose and lateralise TLE based on EEG. The high accuracy achieved demonstrates the potential of directed functional connectivity estimated from EEG periods without visible pathological activity for helping in the diagnosis and lateralization of TLE.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5842753", "pubmed_id": "29527470", "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2017.09.021", "venue": "NeuroImage: Clinical", "journal": "NeuroImage: Clinical", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2756690038", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["1845458", "482155", "10546603", "33479282", "2363336", "205117717", "12625158", "41450206", "13917933", "378857", "17693701", "2743700", "5835640", "379259", "14864905", "89141", "17654166", "20282354", "1335810", "1431197", "25626536", "8722840", "7312979", "9858674", "222515", "379518", "16451230", "12424707"], "inbound_citations": ["145925150", "21706580", "215361075", "208266235", "52298631", "196811752", "92426087"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3787805"}

Here, we evaluated the combination of Landsat and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to estimate land use/cover change in the dynamic tropical landscape of Tanintharyi, southern Myanmar. We classified Landsat and L-band SAR data, specifically Japan Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2), using Random Forests classifier to map and quantify land use/cover change transitions between 1995 and 2015 in the Tanintharyi Region. We compared the classification accuracies of single versus combined sensor data, and assessed contributions of optical and radar layers to classification accuracy. Combined Landsat and L-band SAR data produced the best overall classification accuracies (92.96% to 93.83%), outperforming individual sensor data (91.20% to 91.93% for Landsat-only; 56.01% to 71.43% for SAR-only). Radar layers, particularly SAR-derived textures, were influential predictors for land cover classification, together with optical layers. Landscape change was extensive (16,490 km2; 39% of total area), as well as total forest conversion into agricultural plantations (3214 km2). Gross forest loss (5133 km2) in 1995 was largely from conversion to shrubs/orchards and tree (oil palm, rubber) plantations, and gross gains in oil palm (5471 km2) and rubber (4025 km2) plantations by 2015 were mainly from conversion of shrubs/orchards and forests.

In tropical countries like India, monitoring cropping practices using optical remote sensing during Kharif and Rabi seasons is constraint due to the cloud cover, which can be well addressed by microwave remote sensing. In the proposed research, the strength of C-band polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series images were evaluated to classify groundwater irrigated croplands for the Kharif and Rabi cropping seasons of the year 2013. The present study was performed in the Berambadi experimental watershed of Kabini river basin, southern peninsular India. A total of fifteen polarimetric variables were estimated includes four backscattering coefficients (HH, HV, VH, VV) and eleven polarimetric indices for all Radarsat-2 SAR images. The cumulative temporal sum (seasonal and dual-season) of these parameters was supervised classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with intensive ground observation samples.

To prove the feasibility of the approach, we applied it to the simpler case of identifying the disease class of patients with a view to extending the method to specific diseases in future work. Standard clinical gait information of healthy individuals, and NND/JIA patients was sourced from hospitals participating in MD-PAEDIGREE. To classify the data into one of the three categories: healthy, NND, and JIA, certain parameters were carefully selected from the signals and used to train Random Forest (RF), boosting, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Cross-validation was used to test the effectiveness of our approach and it yields a classification accuracy of 100% for RF, SVM, and MLP classifiers and 96.4% for boosting. Training and testing for all the classifiers took mere milliseconds, providing opportunities for real-time applications.

This paper introduces a self-organizing map (SOM)-based computational model of sensory abnormalities in autism, and of a feedback system to compensate for them. Feedback relies on a measure of balance of coverage over four (sensory) domains. Different methods to compute this measure are discussed, as is the flexibility to configure the system using different control mechanisms. Statistically significant improvements throughout training are demonstrated for compensation of a simple (i.e., monotonically decreasing) hypersensitivity in one of the domains. Fine-tuning control parameters can lead to further gains, but a standard setup results in good performance. Significant improvements are also shown for complex hypersensitivities (i.e., increasing and decreasing through time) in two domains. Although naturally best suited to compensate hypersensitivities-stimuli filtering may mitigate neuron migration to a hypersensitive domain-the system is also shown to perform effectively when compensating hyposensitivities. With poor coverage balance in the model akin to poor global perception, WCC would be consistent with inadequate feedback, resulting in uncontrolled hyper- and/or hyposensitivities characteristic of autism, as seen in the topologies of the resulting SOMs.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "18701370", "doi": "10.1109/TNN.2008.2000447", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2119698875", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["142562467", "144115047", "61442128", "11933133", "32320463", "12543002", "53051416", "15680883", "17974968", "25872787", "21422814", "140317699", "12534802", "15564318", "16274993", "144640351", "8148536", "198120309", "6143902", "11428795", "16648739", "1371882", "9731622", "16448545"], "inbound_citations": ["19847920", "18320683", "147587513", "494992", "133606435"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14572660"}

However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using ELM may not be effective for natural signals (e.g., images/videos), even with a large number of hidden nodes. To address this issue, in this paper, a new ELM-based hierarchical learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The proposed architecture is divided into two main components: 1) self-taught feature extraction followed by supervised feature classification and 2) they are bridged by random initialized hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) unsupervised multilayer encoding is conducted for feature extraction, and an ELM-based sparse autoencoder is developed via l 1 constraint. By doing so, it achieves more compact and meaningful feature representations than the original ELM; 2) by exploiting the advantages of ELM random feature mapping, the hierarchically encoded outputs are randomly projected before final decision making, which leads to a better generalization with faster learning speed; and 3) unlike the greedy layerwise training of deep learning (DL), the hidden layers of the proposed framework are trained in a forward manner. Once the previous layer is established, the weights of the current layer are fixed without fine-tuning. Therefore, it has much better learning efficiency than the DL. Extensive experiments on various widely used classification data sets show that the proposed algorithm achieves better and faster convergence than the existing state-of-the-art hierarchical learning methods. Furthermore, multiple applications in computer vision further confirm the generality and capability of the proposed learning scheme.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null,

It has been observed that facial changes are occurred due to variations in facial expression, illumination condition, pose, etc. and these changes are often appeared only some regions of the whole image. The global features extracted from the whole image are not able to cope with these facial changes. To cope with the above facial changes face images are divided into a number of non-overlapping smaller sub-images and discriminant features are extracted from these sub-images as well as from the whole image. All these extracted local and global features are fused to form a large feature vector. We have used generalized two-dimensional fisher's linear discriminate (G-2DFLD) method to extract these local and global discriminant features. We have used the fisher's linear discriminate (FLD) method to extract lower dimensional discriminant features from the fused large feature vector. A Multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied on these reduced feature vector for classification.

The amounts of IL-10 and IL-12 secreted by dendritic cells (DCs) after stimulation with 42 individual L. plantarum strains were measured and correlated with the strain-specific genomic composition using comparative genome hybridisation and the Random Forest algorithm. This in silico \"gene-trait matching\" approach led to the identification of eight candidate genes in the L. plantarum genome that might modulate the DC cytokine response to L. plantarum. Six of these genes were involved in bacteriocin production or secretion, one encoded a bile salt hydrolase and one encoded a transcription regulator of which the exact function is unknown. Subsequently, gene deletions mutants were constructed in L. plantarum WCFS1 and compared to the wild-type strain in DC stimulation assays.

Generally, it is costly and time consuming to get labels for learning samples, especially for the task of multi-label annotation where many class labels must be assigned to the same instance. To overcome this difficulty, semi-supervised multi-label learning aims to exploit unlabeled data readily available to help build a multi-label predictive model. Nevertheless, most semi-supervised solutions for the multi-label learning tasks use a batch method for labeling (e.g., label propagation), and are not suitable for online classification tasks. In this paper, a new online semi-supervised multi-label classifier based on the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) algorithm is presented. Online GNG-based algorithms are already used in several applications, but the existing algorithms are unable to tackle the problem of multi-label classification. There is a real need of online semi-supervised multi-label algorithms. Our main contribution is to propose an online multi-label algorithm based on GNG able to provide on the fly annotation of data without explicit storage of the training instances, i.e, with limited memory usage. The proposed algorithm is experimentally tested on five different data-sets from three different application domains. The performance results of the approach is compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

It uses a tree-like model that decides consequences outcomes from events. However, in some application, decision tree does not perform well. Another widely used approach is neural network, which has promising performance. It has been developed and become one of the most popular computing systems in research field. The traditional approach in training neural network is backpropagation. However, it has several drawbacks. One of them is the training time. In recent decades, Extreme learning machine (ELM) was proposed for training single hidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN) in the extremely fast way.

When we consider the distance metric as a parameter of $K$-NN, learning an appropriate distance metric for $K$-NN can be seen as minimizing the empirical risk of $K$-NN. In this paper, we design a new type of continuous decision function of the $K$-NN classification rule which can be used to construct the continuous empirical risk function of $K$-NN. By minimizing this continuous empirical risk function, we obtain a novel distance metric learning algorithm named as adaptive nearest neighbor (ANN). We have proved that the current algorithms such as the large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN), neighbourhood components analysis (NCA) and the pairwise constraint methods are special cases of the proposed ANN by setting the parameter different values. Compared with the LMNN, NCA, and pairwise constraint methods, our method has a broader searching space which may contain better solutions.

In general, the innovation information obtained from a Kalman filter is used for test statistic calculations in Autonomous Integrity Monitored Extrapolation (AIME). However, the innovation of the Kalman filter is degraded by error tracking and closed-loop correction effects, leading to time delays in soft fault detection. Therefore, the key issue of improving real-time performance is providing accurate innovation to AIME. In this paper, the proposed algorithm incorporates Least Squares-Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) regression theory into AIME. Because the LS-SVM has a good regression and prediction performance, the proposed method provides replaced innovation obtained from the LS-SVM driven by real-time observation data. Based on the replaced innovation, the test statistics can follow fault amplitudes more accurately; finally, the real-time performance of soft fault detection can be improved.

Current advances in bag-of-feature approaches have brought significant insights into recognizing human actions within complex context. It is, however, a common practice in literature to consider action as merely an orderless set of local salient features. This representation has been shown to be oversimplified, which inherently limits traditional approaches from robust deployment in real-life scenarios. In this work, we propose and show that, by taking into account global configuration of local features, we can greatly improve recognition performance. We first introduce a novel feature selection process called Sparse Hierarchical Bayes Filter to select only the most contributive features of each action type based on neighboring structure constraints. We then present the application of structured learning in human action analysis. That is, by representing human action as a complex set of local features, we can incorporate different spatial and temporal feature constraints into the learning tasks of human action classification and localization. In particular, we tackle the problem of action localization in video using structured learning with two alternatives: one is Dynamic Conditional Random Field from probabilistic perspective; the other is Structural Support Vector Machine from max-margin point of view.

For safe railway operation, the electrification system in the railway infrastructure, which supplies electric power to trains, is an essential facility for stable train operation. Due to its important role, the electrification system needs to be rigorously and regularly inspected and managed. This paper presents a supervised learning method to classify Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) data into ten target classes representing overhead wires, movable brackets and poles, which are key objects in the electrification system. In general, the layout of the railway electrification system shows strong spatial regularity relations among object classes. The proposed classifier is developed based on Conditional Random Field (CRF), which characterizes not only labeling homogeneity at short range, but also the layout compatibility between different object classes at long range in the probabilistic graphical model. This multi-range CRF model consists of a unary term and three pairwise contextual terms. In order to gain computational efficiency, MLS point clouds are converted into a set of line segments to which the labeling process is applied. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a local classifier considering only node features for producing the unary potentials of the CRF model. As the short-range pairwise contextual term, the Potts model is applied to enforce a local smoothness in the short-range graph; while long-range pairwise potentials are designed to enhance the spatial regularities of both horizontal and vertical layouts among railway objects. We formulate two long-range pairwise potentials as the log posterior probability obtained by the naive Bayes classifier. The directional layout compatibilities are characterized in probability look-up tables, which represent the co-occurrence rate of spatial relations in the horizontal and vertical directions. The likelihood function is formulated by multivariate Gaussian distributions. In the proposed multi-range CRF model, the weight parameters to balance four sub-terms are estimated by applying the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The results show that the proposed multi-range CRF can effectively classify individual railway elements, representing an average recall of 97.66% and an average precision of 97.07% for all classes.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs8121008", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2564924987", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["53612895", "120047621", "7227235", "292287", "18180191", "267952", "206590944", "29696476", "11200969", "9779450", "207251944", "242941", "11859305", "11953171", "9117693", "25842396", "2814093", "119630303", "11866341"], "inbound_citations": ["59300851", "197488479", "203595717", "43993628", "201135085", "53722624"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32481094"}

We propose here such an extension by showing how standard regression trees optimizing a quadratic loss can be adapted and learned while taking into account the uncertainties in the inputs.

To solve this difficult 4-way classification problem (AD, MCI, cMCI and healthy controls), a competition was hosted by Kaggle to invite the scientific community to apply their machine learning approaches on pre-processed sets of T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) data and the demographic information from the international Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database. This paper summarizes our competition results. We first proposed a hierarchical process by turning the 4-way classification into five binary classification problems. A new feature selection technology based on relative importance was also proposed, aiming to identify a more informative and concise subset from 426 sMRI morphometric and 3 demographic features, to ensure each binary classifier to achieve its highest accuracy. As a result, about 2% of the original features were selected to build a new feature space, which can achieve the final four-way classification with a 54.38% accuracy on testing data through hierarchical grouping, higher than several alternative methods in comparison. More importantly, the selected discriminative features such as hippocampal volume, parahippocampal surface area, and medial orbitofrontal thickness, etc. as well as the MMSE score, are reasonable and consistent with those reported in AD/MCI deficits. In summary, the proposed method provides a new framework for multi-way classification using hierarchical grouping and precise feature selection. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The transformation of precipitation into runoff requires knowledge about the proportion of drainage-effective areas and their spatial distribution in the catchment area. Common simulation methods use the coefficient of imperviousness as an important parameter to estimate the overland flow, which subsequently contributes to the pipe flow. The coefficient of imperviousness is the percentage of area covered by impervious surfaces such as roofs or road surfaces. It is still common practice to assign the coefficient of imperviousness for each particular land parcel manually by visual interpretation of aerial images. Based on classification results of these imagery we contribute to an objective automatic determination of the coefficient of imperviousness. In this context we compare two classification techniques: Random Forests (RF) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Experimental results performed on an urban test area show good results and confirm that the automated derivation of the coefficient of imperviousness, apart from being more objective and, thus, reproducible, delivers more accurate results than the interactive estimation. We achieve an overall accuracy of about 85 % for both classifiers. The root mean square error of the differences of the coefficient of imperviousness compared to the reference is 4.4 % for the CRF-based classification, and 3.8 % for the RF-based classification.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-3-1355-2018", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2799987896", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": ["125445943", "89141", "206787478", "103046420", "93398364", "6518359", "62739295", "114171597", "85230329", "129024232", "13723630", "64294544", "55845170", "207251944", "110518929", "10659969", "18002117", "25842396", "687754", "58294"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133740521"}

Up to now nomination of an automated anomaly detection method in a non linear time series of earthquake precursor has been an attractive and challenging task. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) have revealed strong potentials in accurate time series prediction. This paper presents the first study of an integration of ANN and PSO method in the research of earthquake precursors to detect the unusual variations of the thermal and total electron content (TEC) seismo-ionospheric anomalies induced by the strong earthquake of Saravan. In this study, to overcome the stagnation in local minimum during the ANN training, PSO as an optimization method is used instead of traditional algorithms for training the ANN method. The proposed hybrid method detected a considerable number of anomalies 4 and 8 days preceding the earthquake. Since, in this case study, ionospheric TEC anomalies induced by seismic activity is confused with background fluctuations due to solar activity, a multi-resolution time series processing technique based on wavelet transform has been applied on TEC signal variations. In view of the fact that the accordance in the final results deduced from some robust methods is a convincing indication for the efficiency of the method, therefore the detected thermal and TEC anomalies using the ANN + PSO method were compared to the results with regard to the observed anomalies by implementing the mean, median, Wavelet, Kalman filter, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) methods. The results indicate that the ANN + PSO method is quite promising and deserves serious attention as a new tool for thermal and TEC seismo anomalies detection.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asr.2013.12.017", "venue": null, "journal": "Advances in Space Research", "mag_id": "2093625649", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:122877217"}

To allow the algorithm to classify all people with LBP, additional criteria can help therapists make decisions for people who do not clearly fit into a subgroup (ie, unclear classifications). Recent studies indicated that classifications are unclear for approximately 34% of people with LBP. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: To guide improvements in the algorithm, it is imperative to determine whether people with unclear classifications are different from those with clear classifications. ::: ::: ::: DESIGN ::: This study was a secondary analysis of data from 3 previous studies investigating the algorithm. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Baseline data from 529 people who had LBP were used (3 discrete cohorts). The primary outcome was type of classification, that is, clear or unclear.

However, the manual design of a genetic programming classification algorithm is a non-trivial time consuming process. This research investigates the hypothesis that automating the design of a GP classification algorithm for data classification can still lead to the induction of effective classifiers and also reduce the design time. Two evolutionary algorithms, namely, a genetic algorithm (GA) and grammatical evolution (GE) are used to automate the design of GP classification algorithms. The classification performance of the automated designed GP classifiers i.e. GA designed GP classifiers and GE designed GP classifiers are compared to each other and to manually designed GP classifiers on real-world problems. Furthermore, a comparison of the design times of automated design and manual design is also carried out for the same set of problems. The automated designed classifiers were found to outperform manually designed classifiers across problem domains. Automated design time is also found to be less than manual design time.

Support vector machine, as a supervised learning method, is adopted in this paper to develop a multi-class classifier to distinguish between different transportation modes including driving a car, riding a bicycle, taking a bus, walking, and running. Data from different mobile phone sensors were trained and tested to evaluate the model. Sensors from which the data were obtained include accelerometer, gyroscope, rotation vector, and Global Positioning System (GPS). A Gaussian kernel was applied as part of the classifier and unlike some ambiguity seen in the literature, a complete model selection is conducted. A small window size of one second was considered, so the model can be useful in a broader range of applications. For the first time, the data from gyroscope and rotation vector sensors were used in experiments based on individual sensor data. The study showed that such data can contribute to high detection rates. It was found that including attributes that have similar behavior among different modes can negatively impacts the detection rates. When using multiple sensors, high average overall accuracies of 98.86% and 97.89% were achieved with and without using the GPS data, respectively. These results offer improvements compared to what is reported in the literature.

The limitations of mammography as a screening and diagnostic modality, especially in young women with dense breasts, necessitated the development of novel and more effective strategies with high sensitivity and specificity. Thermal imaging (thermography) is a noninvasive imaging procedure used to record the thermal patterns using Infrared (IR) camera.

To date, biometrics is widely used as an alternative to password authentication. Fingerprint is of the oldest biometric technique. It uses the patterns of ridge and valley which can be found on the surface of human finger to recognize human identity. Meanwhile, finger vein biometrics is one of the newest biometric technique. Finger vein biometrics uses the pattern of blood vein inside human finger to recognize human identity. Both fingerprint and finger vein biometrics are the main focus of study in this research. A fingerprint feature extraction method, namely Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) is explored and implemented. Besides, an improved finger vein feature extraction method termed as enhanced maximum curvature (EMC) methods is proposed. When EMC is combined with HOG, delicate vein line pattern can be extracted effectively. The proposed method is able to produce better performance as compared to the existing finger vein feature extraction methods. Multimodal biometrics combines more than one biometric sources to address problems such as high intra-class variations, high inter-class similarity and noisy data in unimodal biometrics. In this work, a novel method to combine the HOG features of fingerprint and finger vein biometrics is designed based on Kernel Data Fusion. The method converts the fingerprint and finger vein features into matrix kernels and uses Support Vector Machine for classification. The proposed method has yielded significantly improvement as compared to sole fingerprint or finger vein biometrics as over 99% of recognition accuracy can be achieved with the use of RBF Kernel.

Results of the feature selection indicate that the 10 most important variables include PC 1, PC 2 and their GLCM mean along with 6 MS bands. Three different sets of predictor variables (5 and 10 most important variables and all 32 variables) were classified with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. Producer accuracy of bamboo was found to be highest when 10 most important variables selected from RFE were classified with SVM (82%). However object-based image analysis (OBIA) achieved higher classification accuracy than PBIA using the same 32 variables, but with less number of training samples. Using object-based SVM classifier, the producer accuracy of bamboo reached 94%. The significance of this study is that the present framework is capable of accurately identifying bamboo patches as well as detecting other tree species in a tropical region with heterogeneous land use land cover (LULC), which could further aid the mandate of National Bamboo Mission and related programs.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2013.08.011", "venue": "Int.

Given the MR image data, segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) myocardium is the most common task to be addressed for recovering and studying LV wall motion. However, most of segmentation methods heavily rely on the imaging appearance for extracting the myocardial contours (epi- and endo-cardium). These methods cannot guarantee a consistent volume of the heart wall during cardiac cycle in reconstructed 3D LV wall models, which is contradictory to the assumption of approximately constant myocardial tissue. In the paper, we propose a probability-based segmentation method to estimate the probabilities of boundary pixels in the trabeculated region near the solid wall belonging to blood or muscle. It helps avoid artifactually moving the endocardium boundary inward during systole, as commonly happens with simple threshold-based segmentation methods. Our method takes s stack of 2D cine MRI slices as input, and produces the 3D probabilistic segmentation of the heart wall using a generative adversarial network (GAN). Based on numerical experiments, our proposed method outperformed the baseline method in terms of evaluation metrics on a synthetic dataset. Moreover, we achieved very good quality reconstructed results with on a real 2D cine MRI dataset (there is no truly independent 3D ground truth).

In this work, we present results on the development of an approach that takes advantage of this opportunity to predict soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 90 m on a daily time step at multiple depths in the profile. Three types of water balance model were examined: (i) single layer model with saturated flow (ii) multi-layer model with saturated flow and (iii) multi-layer model with unsaturated flow. Five layers were considered: 0\u20135, 5\u201315, 15\u201330, 30\u201360, and 60\u2013100 cm, which coincide with the layers of the Soil Landscape Grid of Australia which is available at ~90 m spatial resolution. Pedotransfer functions were used to predict the bucket size for each soil layer. Precipitation and evapotranspiration are estimated by gridded SILO precipitation data (5 km, 1 day) and the MODIS 16 ET product (1 km, 8 day), respectively. Soil moisture predictions were tested against four publicly and privately owned soil moisture networks. The multi-layer model incorporating unsaturated flow performed the best in terms of predicting soil moisture for the whole profile (0\u20131 m) with a median correlation coefficient (r) of just over 0.7 across all sites. When classifying the sites according to the land use; cropping sites showed better median correlation (~0.8) than grazing sites (~0.7). However, grazing sites seem to have more consistent results for all the layers. To understand the relative importance of the water balance model predictions as compared to other environmental properties, a Random Forest model was fitted to a suite of variables e.g. soil order, month, temperature and etc., that vary in space, time or both space and time. For the analysis, only calibrated soil moisture network sites (OzNet) were considered. Soil moisture which was derived from unsaturated soil water balance model was the 9th most important variable. To assess the quality of the predictive model, leave-one-out-site cross validation (LOOSCV) was performed and across all sites the prediction quality was reasonable (Concordance = 0.66, Accuracy = 0.06 cm 3 cm\u22123).

As a classic method of intelligent hysteresis modeling, the traditional artificial neural network (TANN) algorithm can model the hysteresis nonlinearity accurately, however, the high-frequency dynamic hysteresis modeling based on TANN is difficult to be achieved on-line.

Hence, a comprehensive approach towards geospatial mapping of bio-energy potential from surplus crop residues of selected crops (rice. wheat, cotton and sugarcane) over the Haryana state of India is implemented by utilizing a hybrid model combining both statistical and remote sensing technique. Bioenergy potential was calculated from crop production statistics collected at district level. The grain production data were converted into gross residue potential using residue production ratio. The crop residue was further converted into collectable crop residue using collectable coefficient. To generate the spatial map of the selected crops, potential crop masks were prepared using multi-temporal satellite data. These crop masks were then converted to crop fraction at 1 km grid level. MODIS NPP data product was then processed and converted into same 1 km to account the spatial variability of biomass potential. Using these crop fractions as independent variables, relationship was established with NPP as dependent variable using a machine learning technique (Random Forest algorithm). These crop specific response curves (crop fraction vs NPP) were utilized as a weight to disaggregate district level gross biomass potential to 1 km grid level.

Collaborative Filtering (CF) models have proved to be effective at powering recommender systems for online streaming services with explicit customer feedback data. CF models do not perform well in scenarios in which feedback data is not available, in cold start situations like new product launches, and situations with markedly different customer tiers (e.g., high frequency customers vs. casual customers). Generative natural language models that create useful theme-based representations of an underlying corpus of documents can be used to represent new product descriptions, like new movie plots. When combined with CF, they have shown to increase the performance in cold start situations. Outside of those cases though in which explicit customer feedback is available, recommender engines must rely on binary purchase data, which materially degrades performance. Fortunately, purchase data can be combined with product descriptions to generate meaningful representations of products and customer trajectories in a convenient product space in which proximity represents similarity. Learning to measure the distance between points in this space can be accomplished with a deep neural network that trains on customer histories and on dense vectorizations of product descriptions. We developed a system based on Collaborative (Deep) Metric Learning (CML) to predict the purchase probabilities of new theatrical releases. We trained and evaluated the model using a large dataset of customer histories, and tested the model for a set of movies that were released outside of the training window.

The purpose of this research paper is to present a new framework for using phonocardiography (PCG) signal to detect psychological stress based on non-linear entropy based features extracted using empirical mode decomposition (EMD). These PCG signals are used to extract time duration of cardiac cycles consisting of consecutive S1 peaks to form Inter-beat Interval (IBI) signal. The IBI signal is decomposed to sub-band signals using EMD to form Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Then non-linear features namely \u2014 Permutation Entropy (PEn), Fuzzy Entropy (FzEn) and K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) entropy estimator are evaluated. Ranking methods namely \u2014 Entropy method, Bhattacharya space algorithm, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) method and Wilcoxon method are then used in order to optimize the system. The extracted entropy features are fed to Least-Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) for classification and highest accuracy, sensitivity and specificity obtained using the proposed system is 96.67%, 100% and 93.33% respectively. The proposed system opens a new research area of using PCG signal for psychological stress detection which can be easily used for home-care and is relatively inexpensive in comparison to other biophysical measures like Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electrocardiography (ECG).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2019.01.006", "venue": "Appl.

However, medical images from difference devices or the same device with different parameter settings are often contaminated with different amount and types of noises, which violate the above assumption. Therefore, the models trained using data from one device or setting often fail to work for that from another. Moreover, it is very expensive and tedious to label data and re-train models for all different devices or settings. To overcome this noise adaptation issue, it is necessary to leverage on the models trained with data from one device or setting for new data. In this paper, we reformulate this noise adaptation task as an image-to-image translation task such that the noise patterns from the test data are modified to be similar to those from the training data while the contents of the data are unchanged. In this paper, we propose a novel Noise Adaptation Generative Adversarial Network (NAGAN), which contains a generator and two discriminators. The generator aims to map the data from source domain to target domain. Among the two discriminators, one discriminator enforces the generated images to have the same noise patterns as those from the target domain, and the second discriminator enforces the content to be preserved in the generated images. We apply the proposed NAGAN on both optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and ultrasound images. Results show that the method is able to translate the noise style. In addition, we also evaluate our proposed method with segmentation task in OCT and classification task in ultrasound.

Brain Tumor Segmentation is an important and challenging task because of the variety in shapes, sizes and texture content of the various types of brain tumors. Specifically, MICCAI BraTS organizes Brain Tumor Segmentation challenge every year. Since the evolution of CNNs it has obtained state-of-the-art results in the majority of computer vision related tasks. On BraTS Challenge 2017, an assemble average of various CNN models (EMMA) holds the state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we have proposed a model inspired by the classic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The proposed network has two models namely, Generator or Segmentor which generates label map of the input image and a Discriminator which helps the Generator model for an optimum solution by taking into account both short as well as long-distance spatial correlations between pixels with the help of a novel multi-scale loss function. The proposed architecture has three GANs in a cascaded fashion, each for Whole Tumor, Tumor Core and Enhancing Tumor, where the former network helps in effective reduction of false positives for the later networks. Our method also employs a multi-scale loss function derived from intermediate layers of Discriminator rather than depending just on a final layer cross-entropy loss. A mutli-scale loss function also reduces unnecessary smoothing on contours.

We found that SET proteins are more conserved than the NSET proteins. The rates of evolution between SET and NSET protein primarily depend upon their noncomplex (protein complex association number = 0) forming nature, phylogenetic age, multifunctionality, membrane localization, and transmembrane helix content irrespective of their essentiality, total druggability (total number of drugs/target), m-RNA expression level, and tissue expression breadth. We also introduced two novel terms-killer druggability (number of drugs with killing side effect(s)/target), essential druggability (number of drugs targeting essential proteins/target) to explain the evolutionary rate variation between SET and NSET proteins. Interestingly, we noticed that SET proteins are younger than NSET proteins and multifunctional younger SET proteins are candidates of acquiring killing side effects. We provide evidence that higher killer druggability, multifunctionality, and transmembrane helices support the conservation of SET proteins over NSET proteins in spite of their recent origin.

While a number of pre and post correlation techniques have been proposed so far, possible utilization of the supervised machine learning algorithms to detect GNSS meaconing and spoofing is currently being examined. One of the supervised machine learning algorithms, the Support Vector Machine classification (C-SVM), is proposed for utilization at the GNSS receiver level due to fact that at that stage of signal processing, a number of measurements and observables exists. It is possible to establish the correlation pattern among those GNSS measurements and observables and monitor it with use of the C-SVM classification, the results of which we present in this paper. By adding the real-world spoofing and meaconing datasets to the laboratory-generated spoofing datasets at the training stage of the C-SVM, we complement the experiments and results obtained in Part I of this paper, where the training was conducted solely with the use of laboratory-generated spoofing datasets. In two experiments presented in this paper, the C-SVM algorithm was cross-fed with the real-world meaconing and spoofing datasets, such that the meaconing addition to the training was validated by the spoofing dataset, and vice versa.

Accordingly, the development of air quality predictive models can be very useful as such models can provide early warnings of pollution levels increasing to unsatisfactory levels. The literature review conducted within the research context of this thesis revealed that only a limited number of widely used machine learning algorithms have been employed for the modelling of the concentrations of atmospheric gases such as ozone, nitrogen oxides etc. Despite this observation the research and technology area of machine learning has recently advanced significantly with the introduction of ensemble learning techniques, convolutional and deep neural networks etc. Given these observations the research presented in this thesis aims to investigate the effective use of ensemble learning algorithms with optimised algorithmic settings and the appropriate choice of base layer algorithms to create effective and efficient models for the prediction and forecasting of specifically, ground level ozone (O3). ::: Three main research contributions have been made by this thesis in the application area of modelling O3 concentrations. As the first contribution, the performance of several ensemble learning (Homogeneous and Heterogonous) algorithms were investigated and compared with all popular and widely used single base learning algorithms. The results have showed impressive prediction performance improvement obtainable by using meta learning (Bagging, Stacking, and Voting) algorithms. The performances of the three investigated meta learning algorithms were similar in nature giving an average 0.91 correlation coefficient, in prediction accuracy. Thus as a second contribution, the effective use of feature selection and parameter based optimisation was carried out in conjunction with the application of Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and Bagging based learning techniques providing significant improvements in prediction accuracy. The third contribution of research presented in this thesis includes the univariate and multivariate forecasting of ozone concentrations based of optimised Ensemble Learning algorithms. The results reported supersedes the accuracy levels reported in forecasting Ozone concentration variations based on widely used, single base learning algorithms. ::: In summary the research conducted within this thesis bridges an existing research gap in big data analytics related to environment pollution modelling, prediction and forecasting where present research is largely limited to using standard learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines often available within popular commercial software packages.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2729534524", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52884029"}

Accurate quantification algorithms are required to enhance the understanding of different biological phenomena. We present a novel approach based on image-segmentation of multi-cellular regions in bright field images demonstrating enhanced quantitative analyses and better understanding of cell motility. We present MultiCellSeg, a segmentation algorithm to separate between multi-cellular and background regions for bright field images, which is based on classification of local patches within an image: a cascade of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is applied using basic image features. Post processing includes additional classification and graph-cut segmentation to reclassify erroneous regions and refine the segmentation. This approach leads to a parameter-free and robust algorithm. Comparison to an alternative algorithm on wound healing assay images demonstrates its superiority. The proposed approach was used to evaluate common cell migration models such as wound healing and scatter assay. It was applied to quantify the acceleration effect of Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) on healing rate in a time lapse confocal microscopy wound healing assay and demonstrated that the healing rate is linear in both treated and untreated cells, and that HGF/SF accelerates the healing rate by approximately two-fold. A novel fully automated, accurate, zero-parameters method to classify and score scatter-assay images was developed and demonstrated that multi-cellular texture is an excellent descriptor to measure HGF/SF-induced cell scattering. We show that exploitation of textural information from differential interference contrast (DIC) images on the multi-cellular level can prove beneficial for the analyses of wound healing and scatter assays.

We were interested whether the microarray platform also qualifies for a diagnostic setting which requires robustness of the technique itself and the markers used. Several types of microarray platforms exist, e.g. short DNA-oligonucleotide and cDNA microarrays. Platforms have evolved by increasing the information content on each array, mainly by shrinking the feature size of represented probes. These differences can cause difficulties in data comparisons and might impair the transferability of results from research studies to large-scale clinical trials. Therefore, we designed a validation study to address the robustness and accuracy of diagnostic marker patterns in a prospective cohort of patients. Gene expression signatures had been identified to discriminate different leukemia types using Affymetrix DNA-oligonucleotide microarrays HG-U133A and HG-U133B. These predefined diagnostic gene expression signatures were tested in a study using the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray and the GeneChip 2.0 Dx diagnostics platform. The study included prospectively collected samples from leukemia patients at diagnosis. More than 90% of the samples had been sent consecutively to our laboratory between January and July 2004. The median shipment time was 24 hours. The median percentage of blasts in acute leukemias was 80%. A total number of 411 target preparations was performed and resulted in 400 hybridization cocktails (97.3% success rate). The sample target preparation protocol included the current assay recommendations for nucleic acid quantification and cleanup, IVT labeling and hybridization and allows to prepare samples in less than 24 hours. The microarrays were automatically washed and stained with the fluidics station. A scanner with removable 48-array autoloader carousel maximized array throughput. For statistical comparison both array designs were normalized using the recommended set of 100 housekeeping genes (scaling to common target intensity). The U133 set reference data matrix was applied to train the classifier (Support Vector Machines). The 400 independent blinded validation samples were predicted using the set of differentially expressed genes from the training data set. Overall 378/400 (94.5%) of the independent test samples were correctly classified. Some of the misclassifications could be explained by the underlying biology of the respective samples. In conclusion, new advances in gene expression profiling, particularly with regard to instrumentation and reliability of assays for sample target preparation have paved the way to now enroll patients in prospective multi-center trials. In these microarrays can be tested as an additional routine diagnostic method in parallel to gold standard procedures. Moreover, the design of a custom 11 microns feature-sized array will also optimize costs and needs for sample material.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1182/blood.V104.11.2038.2038", "venue": null, "journal": "Blood", "mag_id": "2587093290", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:78210555"}

Faster and simpler solutions based on ELISA assay on fibroblast (EF) have confirmed that pATM is a relevant biomarker (Pereira et al, IJROBP 2018). ::: The purpose of this study was to develop a predictive assay on lymphocytes based on the quantification of the pATM proteins by ELISA method. ::: Materials and methods. A retrospective study was performed in blind on 102 blood lymphocytes from 56 radioresistant (RR) and 46 radiosensitive (RS) patients of two cancer types, prostate and head and neck. First, all patients were divided into 2 groups, RR (CTCAE<2) and RS (CTCAE\u22652). The global quantity of pATM molecules was assessed by ELISA method.

This paper presents hierarchical classification approach to obtain accurate map of rubber tree growth age distribution using SPOT-5 satellite imagery. The objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of pixel-based and object-oriented classifiers for rubber growth classification. At the first level, the general land cover was classified into eight land cover classes (soil, water body, rubber, mature oil palm, young oil palm, forest, urban area, and other vegetation) using Mahalanobis distance (MD), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Thereafter, the best classification map, k-NN output, was used to select only pixels that belong to the rubber class from the SPOT-5 image. The extracted pixels served as input into the next classification hierarchy where four classifiers, MD, k-NN, SVM, and decision tree (DT), were implemented to map rubber trees into three intra-classes (mature, middle-aged, and young rubbers). The result produced overall accuracy of 97.48%, 96.90%, 96.25%, and 80.80% for k-NN, SVM, MD, and DT respectively.

There are a lot of factors that increase the risk of developing cervical cancer like human papilloma virus, sexual transmitted diseases, and smoking. Identifying those factors and building a classification model to classify whether the cases are cervical cancer or not is a challenging research. This study aims at using cervical cancer risk factors to build classification model using Random Forest (RF) classification technique with the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and two feature reduction techniques recursive feature elimination and principle component analysis (PCA). Most medical data sets are often imbalanced because the number of patients is much less than the number of non-patients. Because of the imbalance of the used data set, SMOTE is used to solve this problem. The data set consists of 32 risk factors and four target variables: Hinselmann, Schiller, Cytology, and Biopsy.

The anticancer effect of the extract was obtained by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay on HeLa cells. After that, a support vector regression (SVR) model optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) was constructed to depict the relationship between the chemical constituents and anticancer effect of the extract.

In Experiment 1 the children had to fill out two types of verb forms with homophones in their 1st (verb-final d) and 3rd person (verb-final dt) singular present tense. In both types the two verb forms had a very low frequency but the 1st person homophone of one type had the same spelling as a noun or adjective ending in d, or ended in such a word. The children made significantly more d intrusions on the 3rd person of these verbs than on the 3rd person of control verbs. In Experiment 2 three types of past tenses with stem-final d and suffix de had to be filled out, differing in the type of orthographic cluster preceding the stem-d. The pattern of results supports an account in which phonologically similar verbs are activated by the sublexical word-final sound sequence, which gives rise to intrusion errors when that sequence is homophonous between past tenses ending in de and dde. As the same phenomenon manifests itself at the levels of full forms and sublexical patterns, a model that automatically captures systematic correspondences between phonological and orthographic representations can best explain these findings. Connectionist and exemplar accounts are the prime candidates for such an explanation. Words-and-rules models, on the other hand, have several problems explaining the data.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1075/ml.4.2.04san", "venue": null, "journal": "The Mental Lexicon", "mag_id": "2005339377", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["85554269"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62692190"}

This paper introduces an intelligent middleware based on an unsupervised learning technique called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) algorithm. GANs contain two networks: a generator (G) network and a detector (D) network. The G creates fake data similar to the real samples and combines it with real data from the sensors to confuse the attacker. The D contains multi-layers that have the ability to differentiate between real and fake data. The output intended for this algorithm shows an actual interpretation of the data that is securely communicated through the WSN. The framework is implemented in Python with experiments performed using Keras.

The problem of classification is considered as one of the important problems for the development of applications and for efficient data analysis.

This paper presents a comparative study of various classifiers and the results achieved for offline handwritten Gurmukhi characters and numerals recognition. Various classifiers used and evaluated in this study include k-nearest neighbors, linear-support vector machine (SVM), RBF-SVM, Naive Bayes, decision tree, convolution neural network and random forest classifier. For the experimental work, authors used a balanced data set of 13,000 samples that includes 7000 characters and 6000 numerals. To assess the performance of classifiers, authors have used the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis which is an open source tool for machine learning. The performance is assessed by considering various parameters such as accuracy rate, size of the dataset, time taken to train the model, false acceptance rate, false rejection rate and area under receiver operating characteristic Curve. The paper also highlights the comparison of correctness of tests obtained by applying the selected classifiers. Based on the experimental results, it is clear that classifiers considered in this study have complementary rewards and they should be implemented in a hybrid manner to achieve higher accuracy rates.

Also, we find the configuration to make the system optimal both from the medical and computational points of view. Besides we will identify the most informative factors to predict the exacerbations. Methods: TelEPOC database is composed by daily reports sent by the patients with the following information: heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, steps walked and a questionnaire form about symptoms. According to this, an alarm system composed by three levels of exacerbation (green, yellow and red) is established. On this data the Random Forests Algorithm was applied to predict when a patient will present a red alarm. We used a 10-fold cross validation to estimate the performance of the model. The development was implemented using the packages Scikit-Learn and Pandas from the programming language Python. Results and Conclusions: We achieved an Area under the ROC curve of 0.87 for the task of predicting whether a patient will suffer an exacerbation within the next three days. The EWS was capable of making reliable predictions with enough time in advance when a patient is going to present a red alarm.

HUMS is the acronym for Health and Usage Monitoring System, which is a system that monitors the critical components of a helicopter during the flight using different types of sensors, such as accelerometers. The main goal of HUMS is to detect failures during the flight and warn the helicopter crew as quickly as possible to prevent a crash, whereas HUMS is also useful in optimizing a helicopter\u2019s maintenance program. ::: In this report HUMS acceleration data is used that describes an unknown failure related to the oil cooler fan shaft, located in the main gearbox of the helicopter. The goal of this report is to find out how to extract the vibrational information of the oil cooler fan shaft from the available accelerometer signals and how to determine the type of failure. Subsequently a suitable model has to be found that can be effectively trained to detect this failure in the future. ::: The work starts with selecting the right accelerometer for detecting the vibrations of the oil cooler fan shaft. In order to extract the vibrational information of the oil cooler fan shaft from the accelerometer signal the principle of Time Synchronous Averaging is used to remove vibrations from other components. ::: Condition indicators are identified, whose values are expected to be sensitive for a change in the health state of the oil cooler fan shaft. The first type of condition indicator used is OMx, showing the energy at a frequency of x times the shaft rotational frequency. The second type of condition indicator used is MODx, showing the energy of the first sidebands at x times the shaft rotational frequency. Furthermore, the RMS and Kurtosis are used, showing respectively the average vibration energy of the signal and how peaked the data is. By looking at the behavior of the different indicators, the type of failure is estimated to be an unbalanced fan. ::: The available vibration data of the oil cooler fan shaft is divided into a part for training and a part for testing the model. Different types of clustering algorithms are used for generating healthy and unhealthy clusters from the training data and classifying the health state of the testing points. Only the most relevant condition indicators are used for this modeling procedure: OM1, Kurtosis and RMS. The performances of K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, Support Vector Machine, Multivariate Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Model are compared using confusion matrices and calculating time. The first three methods use both healthy and unhealthy training data, making them less suitable for detecting unknown failures; failures that were not present in the training data but can occur in real life. ::: The Multivariate Gaussian is evaluated for different types of training data: only healthy, only unhealthy and a combination of healthy and unhealthy training data. This method determines the health state of the testing data by looking at the p-value of the model at the location of the data point. The Gaussian Mixture Model uses only healthy training data and also determines the health state of the testing data by comparing the p-value with a threshold value. ::: The p-value of a single n-dimensional Gaussian can be calculated using the n-dimensional chi-squared distribution. For a Gaussian Mixture Model the p-value cannot be calculated with a chi-squared distribution. Instead, the Gaussian Mixture Model probability density function has to be integrated by a Monte-Carlo or Riemann integration procedure. ::: After creating the p-value boundary, the behavior of the Mahalanobis distance over the p-value boundary is examined. The Mahalanobis distance appears to be constant for the dominant mixture component at that point of the boundary. The Mahalanobis distances of the constant parts belonging to different mixture components are not equal, which is in this case caused by covariance differences, but can also be caused by different weight factors: components with smaller covariance and higher weight factor have a higher Mahalanobis distance. The Mahalanobis distance values of the Gaussian Mixture Model appear to be lower than those of a single multivariate Gaussian with the same p-value, which is caused by overlapping mixture components. ::: Based on the classification performance and the computational time required, Hierarchical Clustering appears to be superior for classifying the investigated failure of the oil cooler fan shaft. In order to improve the model\u2019s capability to detect failure modes that were not present in the training data, it is important to use a model that uses only healthy training data and high dimensional data points, based on many condition indicators. It is then smarter to use an eight-dimensional Gaussian that is capable of detecting a wide variety of failures by looking at disturbances of eight condition indicator values. The Gaussian Mixture Model appears to be too computationally intensive for this relatively easy clustering task, but probably has superior performance in classification problems with a less clear separation between healthy and unhealthy data.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2291525407", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55536346"}

Usually, probability estimation performance is measured by conditional log likelihood (CLL). In this paper, we first study the probability estimation performance of AODE and compare it to naive Bayes, tree- augumented naive Bayes, CLLTree, C4.4 (the improved version of C4.5 for better probability estimation) and Support Vector Machines. From our experiments, we find that AODE performs significantly better than the algorithms used to compare except C4.4, and performs slightly better than C4.4 although its classification accuracy is significantly better than C4.5. We then propose an efficient forward greedy feature selection algorithm for AODE and use the CLL score for attribute selection.

The CSELM adopts k-medoids clustering to group the dataset into different clusters based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance, and uses a new Softplus ELM algorithm to discover a common trend in a cluster of time series pieces (within the same period) and then predict the future trend. The Softplus ELM improves ELM using a new activation function, Softplus, to solve the nonlinear and continuous problems of time series data streams and adopting partial least squares (PLS) to avoid the instability of output weight coefficients. The DTW based clustering in CSELM improves the efficiency while tolerating some data loss and uncertain outliers of sensor time series. Softplus based on PLS optimizes the performance and increases the accuracy of ELM.

In higher dimensions, this line is called a hyperplane.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4842-4470-8_22", "venue": "Building Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models on Google Cloud Platform", "journal": "Building Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models on Google Cloud Platform", "mag_id": "2976158687", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204088138"}

However, keywords are usually associated with images instead of individual regions in the training data set. This poses a major challenge for any learning strategy. In this dissertation, we present a novel framework for region-based image annotation using Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL). MIL is a variation of supervised learning, where the task is to learn a concept given positive and negative bags of instances. In the framework, images are viewed as bags, each of which contains a few instances corresponding to the segmented image regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MIL solution for image annotation problems through a Sequential Point-Wise Diverse Density (SPWDD) algorithm. Moreover, we propose a novel Asymmetrical Support Vector Machine-based MIL algorithm (ASVM-MIL), which extends the conventional Support Vector Machine (SVM) by introducing asymmetrical loss functions for false positives and false negatives. In turn, this induces a decision boundary that is more distant from one class than from the other. Our experiments show that ASVM-MIL can improve the image annotation performance, especially for keywords with diverse appearance. The experiment results also show that ASVM-MIL can achieve very competitively result on the benchmark MUSK data sets. In addition, we propose an interactive image annotation scheme, in which image annotation is initialized based on statistical modelling and refined through users' interaction and natural language processing. Particularly, we propose a novel relevance feedback solution: semantic feedback, which allows an annotation system to interact with users directly at the semantic level. The learning mechanism built in the semantic feedback can substantially improve the image annotation performance in the long-run.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "22123982", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59774384"}

In this book chapter, we review related techniques and extend iOVFDT into iOVFDF (\u2018F\u2019 for forest of Trees) for temporal data stream mining. A framework for follow-up research is reported in this article. A major issue to the current temporal data mining algorithms is due to the inherent limitation of batch learning. But in real-life, the hidden concepts of data streams may change rapidly, and the data may amount to infinity. In the big data era, incremental learning is attractive since it does not require processing the full volume of dataset. Under this framework we propose to research and develop a new breed of temporal data stream algorithms\u2014iOVFDF. We integrate for a \u201cmeta-classifier\u201d called iOVFD Forest over a collection of iOVFDT classifiers.

In this paper, we discuss our work on utilizing climate big-data associated with wind power, collected from several wind farms over four years, for exploring the correlation between regional wind speed and wind power. Once this huge amount of data are analyzed, it can be used to develop policies for siting wind-power facilities, designing smart charging algorithms, or evaluating the capacity of electrical distribution systems to meet the actual requirement of power load. Our work started with collecting related climate data for building data model to perform analytics work and experiments using Support Vector Regression (SVR) method. Also, we observed the correlations between other factors related to wind speed and wind energy from our empirical model.
