Speaker verification is done by the use of some parameters (features) from the speakers voice which can be used to differentiate among many speakers. The efficiency of speaker verification system mainly depends on the feature set providing high inter-speaker variability and low intra-speaker variability. There are many methods used for speaker verification. Some systems use Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients as features (MFCCs), while others use Hidden Markov Models (HMM) based speaker recognition, Support Vector Machines (SVM), GMMs . In this paper simple intra-pitch temporal information in conjunction with pitch synchronous cepstral coefficients forms the feature set. The distinct feature of a speaker is determined from the steady state part of five cardinal spoken English vowels. The performance was found to be average when these features were used independently. But very encouraging results were observed when both features were combined to form a decision for speaker verification. For a database of twenty speakers of 100 utterances per speaker, an accuracy of 91.04% has been observed. The analysis of speakers whose recognition was incorrect is conducted and discussed .", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1908.05553", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2968983443", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["120819319", "23640937", "412322", "25444198", "110183784", "15815244", "14124969", "16697470", "732137"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199668694"}

Several biological studies have shown sequence specificity of nucleosome presence, clearly underlined by the organization of precise nucleotides substrings. Taking into consideration such advances, the identification of nucleosomes on a genomic scale has been successfully performed by DNA sequence features representation and classical supervised classification methods such as Support Vector Machines and Logistic regression.

To alleviate the effect of `domain shift', the major challenge in domain adaptation, studies have attempted to align the distributions of the two domains. Recent research has suggested that generative adversarial network (GAN) has the capability of implicitly capturing data distribution. In this paper, we thus propose a simple but effective model for unsupervised domain adaption leveraging adversarial learning. The same encoder is shared between the source and target domains which is expected to extract domain-invariant representations with the help of an adversarial discriminator. With the labeled source data, we introduce the center loss to increase the discriminative power of feature learned. We further align the conditional distribution of the two domains to enforce the discrimination of the features in the target domain. Unlike previous studies where the source features are extracted with a fixed pre-trained encoder, our method jointly learns feature representations of two domains. Moreover, by sharing the encoder, the model does not need to know the source of images during testing and hence is more widely applicable. We evaluate the proposed method on several unsupervised domain adaption benchmarks and achieve superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art results.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1811.12751", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2903457322", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2127515", "15860720", "6755881", "52459", "1033682", "206594692", "7646250", "51994025", "207763512", "10627900", "556999", "13798326", "12757870", "745350", "16852518", "59566327", "206597087", "3840500", "4547917", "206592766", "14124313", "16439870", "12453047", "1395439", "4357800", "17169365", "19059279", "4711865", "11324902", "51729348", "15019934"], "inbound_citations": ["182952605", "198229781", "210473228"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54434684"}

The health care industry contains lots of medical data, therefore machine learning algorithms are required to make decisions effectively in the prediction of heart diseases.

It collects radiance from the ground with hundreds of channels which results in hundreds of co-registered images. How to process this huge amount of data is a great challenge, especially when no information of the image scene is available. Under this circumstance, anomaly detection becomes more difficult. Several methods are devoted to this problem, such as the well-known RX algorithm and high-moment statistics approaches. The RX algorithm can detect all anomalies in single image but it can not discriminate them. On the other hand, the high-moment statistics approaches use criterion such as skewness and kurtosis to find the projection directions to detect anomalies. In this paper we propose an effective algorithm for anomaly detection and discrimination extended from RX algorithm, called Background Whitened Target Detection Algorithm. It first modeled the background signature with Gaussian distribution and applied the whitening process. After the process, the background will distribute as i.i.d. Gaussian in all spectral bands. Those pixels did not fit in the distribution will be the anomalies. Then Automatic Target Detection and Classification Algorithm (ATDCA) is applied to search for those distinct spectrum automatically and classify them as anomalies. Since ATDCA can also estimated the abundance fraction of each target resident in one pixel by applying Sum-to-one and Nonnegativity constraints, the proposed method can also be applied in a constrained fashion.

However, in the field of machine learning, the knowledge offered by the expert is rarely used. Recently, Qi et al. [1] proposed a fast learning model for TWSVM using privilege information termed as FTWSVMPI where privilege information is acquired by Oracle function. Oracle function needs to solve two additional TWSVM based Quadratic Programming Problems (QPPs) which leads to higher computational cost. Therefore, to avoid to solve two additional TWSVM based QPPs, in this paper, we propose a novel method to extract privilege information from the dataset itself. Using this privilege information, we further introduce an improved version of Twin Support Vector Machine termed as I-TWSVMPI.

To meet the demand of the rapid retrieval, many approximate nearest neighobor methods have been proposed to accelerate the exhaustive search process. Hashing is such an example with great balance of time and accuracy. Hashing methods achieve quick retrieval by converting the high-dimensional raw data into a binary hash code, keeping the similarity of original data in mapped hash codes. Many hashing approaches use the Euclidean distance as similarity measurement. However, data in many datasets are distributed on a non-linear manifold, such that geodesic distance on manifold can represents the semantic similarity of original data points more accurately than the Euclidean distance. This enables better preservation of the sematic similarity in the hash code when mapping the original dataset to low- dimensional space. In this paper, we propose to use Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP) for dimensional reduction and utilize iterative quantization to reduce quantization loss during hashing process.

One of the key challenges in PHM is to accurately predict impending failures in the equipment. In recent years, solutions for failure prediction have evolved from building complex physical models to the use of machine learning algorithms that leverage the data generated by the equipment. However, failure prediction problems pose a set of unique challenges that make direct application of traditional classification and prediction algorithms impractical. These challenges include the highly imbalanced training data, the extremely high cost of collecting more failure samples, and the complexity of the failure patterns. Traditional oversampling techniques will not be able to capture such complexity and accordingly result in overfitting the training data. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel algorithm for failure prediction using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN-FP). GAN-FP first utilizes two GAN networks to simultaneously generate training samples and build an inference network that can be used to predict failures for new samples. GAN-FP first adopts an infoGAN to generate realistic failure and non-failure samples, and initialize the weights of the first few layers of the inference network. The inference network is then tuned by optimizing a weighted loss objective using only real failure and non-failure samples. The inference network is further tuned using a second GAN whose purpose is to guarantee the consistency between the generated samples and corresponding labels.

This way, a smoothness prior is used while learning the dictionaries and not just to make inference. This is in contrast with competing approaches that learn dictionaries without such a prior. Pixel-level classification results on the Graz02 bikes dataset demonstrate that dictionaries learned in our discriminative setting with neighborhood smoothness constraints can equal the state-of-the-art performance of bottom-up (i.e. superpixel-based) segmentation approaches.

Therefore, the development of novel computational methods is needed to identify potential AIP candidates prior to in vitro experimentation. In this study, we proposed a random forest (RF)-based method for predicting AIPs, called AIPpred (AIP predictor in primary amino acid sequences), which was trained with 354 optimal features. First, we systematically studied the contribution of individual composition [amino acid-, dipeptide composition (DPC), amino acid index, chain-transition-distribution, and physicochemical properties] in AIP prediction. Since the performance of the DPC-based model is significantly better than that of other composition-based models, we applied a feature selection protocol on this model and identified the optimal features. AIPpred achieved an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.801 in a 5-fold cross-validation test, which was \u223c2% higher than that of the control RF predictor trained with all DPC composition features, indicating the efficiency of the feature selection protocol. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of AIPpred on an independent dataset, with results showing that our method outperformed an existing method, as well as 3 different machine learning methods developed in this study, with an AUC value of 0.814. These results indicated that AIPpred will be a useful tool for predicting AIPs and might efficiently assist the development of AIP therapeutics and biomedical research.

In many applications the user only requires a map of one particular class of interest, e.g. a specific vegetation type or an invasive species. One-class classifiers are appealing alternatives to common supervised classifiers because they can be trained with labeled training data of the class of interest only. However, training an accurate one-class classification (OCC) model is challenging, particularly when facing a large image, a small class and few training samples. To tackle these problems we propose an iterative OCC approach. The presented approach uses a biased Support Vector Machine as core classifier. In an iterative pre-classification step a large part of the pixels not belonging to the class of interest is classified. The remaining data is classified by a final classifier with a novel model and threshold selection approach. The specific objective of our study is the classification of raised bogs in a study site in southeast Germany, using multi-seasonal RapidEye data and a small number of training sample. Results demonstrate that the iterative OCC outperforms other state of the art one-class classifiers and approaches for model selection.

This study was conducted based on the example of the site of coniferous forests in the Lower Angara region (Krasnoyarsk krai), where a large outbreak of the Siberian moth took place in 1944\u20131995. The remote assessment of the state of dark coniferous forests revealed the trends of the SWVI (or NDMI) and NDVI indices that characterize long-term changes in the vegetation cover over the period 2000\u20132018. The SWVI index is the most informative indicator: a sharp decrease in average values and increase in the coefficient of variation of the index are noted for dead and severely damaged wood stands (crown defoliation of more than 75%). The area of dead forests was calculated according to the difference images of the indices (\u0394SWVI) with the threshold criterion l\u03c3 (the standard deviation). In 2000, the area of forests that died under the impact of the Siberian moth was approximately 19 200 ha. Alter two major fires in 2004 and 2011 and as a result of destructive factors combination, the area of dead forests increased up to 20 400 ha by 2017\u20132018. Reforestation within the boundaries of dead stands was estimated from the classification of Landsat images (June 20, 2017; June 23, 2018) by the Random Forest algorithm using the selection of templates from detailed Resurs-P images with a spatial resolution of 1 m (Geoton-LI\u2014July 22, 2015 and December 3, 2018), which were taken during different seasons.

In this work, sequence-based prediction of relative solvent accessibility (RSA) is employed as a basis for a simple MQA method for soluble proteins, and subsequently extended to the much less explored case of (alpha-helical) membrane proteins. In analogy to soluble proteins, the level of exposure to the lipid of amino acid residues in transmembrane (TM) domains is captured in terms of the relative lipid accessibility (RLA), which is predicted from sequence using lowcomplexity Support Vector Regression models. On an independent set of 23 TM proteins, the new SVR-based predictor yields correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.56 between the predicted and observed RLA profiles, as opposed to CC of 0.13 for a baseline predictor that utilizes TMLIP2H empirical lipophilicity scale (with standard deviations of about 0.15). A simple MQA approach is then defined by ranking models of membrane proteins in terms of consistency between predicted and observed RLA profiles, as a measure of similarity to the native structure. The new method does not require a set of decoy models to optimize parameters, circumventing current limitations in this regard. Several different sets of models, including those generated by fragment based folding simulations, and decoys obtained by swapping TM helices to mimic errors in template based assignment, are used to assess the new approach. Predicted RLA profiles can be used to successfully discriminate near native models from non-native decoys in most cases, significantly improving the separation of correct and incorrectly folded models compared to a simple baseline approach that utilizes TMLIP2H. As suggested by the robust performance of a simple MQA method for soluble proteins that utilizes more accurate RSA predictions, further significant improvements are likely to be achieved.

However, their approach to the analysis of data with substantial numerical content has been largely limited to constructing clauses that: (a) provide qualitative descriptions (\u201chigh\u201d, \u201clow\u201d etc.) of the values of response variables; and (b) contain simple inequalities restricting the ranges of predictor variables. This has precluded the application of such techniques to scientific and engineering problems requiring a more sophisticated approach. A number of specialised methods have been suggested to remedy this. In contrast, we have chosen to take advantage of the fact that the existing theoretical framework for ILP places very few restrictions of the nature of the background knowledge. We describe two issues of implementation that make it possible to use background predicates that implement well-established statistical and numerical analysis procedures. Any improvements in analytical sophistication that result are evaluated empirically using artificial and real-life data. Experiments utilising artificial data are concerned with extracting constraints for response variables in the text-book problem of balancing a pole on a cart. They illustrate the use of clausal definitions of arithmetic and trigonometric functions, inequalities, multiple linear regression, and numerical derivatives. A non-trivial problem concerning the prediction of mutagenic activity of nitroaromatic molecules is also examined. In this case, expert chemists have been unable to devise a model for explaining the data. The result demonstrates the combined use by an ILP program of logical and numerical capabilities to achieve an analysis that includes linear modelling, clustering and classification.

Unfortunately, there are unavoidable shortcomings; including the time-consuming and expensive nature of the experimental method to predict DTI. Therefore, it motivates us to develop an effective computational method to predict DTI based on protein sequence. In the paper, we proposed a novel computational approach based on protein sequence, namely PDTPS (Predicting Drug Targets with Protein Sequence) to predict DTI. The PDTPS method combines Bi-gram probabilities (BIGP), Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). In order to evaluate the prediction capacity of the PDTPS, the experiment was carried out on enzyme, ion channel, GPCR, and nuclear receptor datasets by using five-fold cross-validation tests. The proposed PDTPS method achieved average accuracy of 97.73%, 93.12%, 86.78%, and 87.78% on enzyme, ion channel, GPCR and nuclear receptor datasets, respectively. The experimental results showed that our method has good prediction performance. Furthermore, in order to further evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed PDTPS method, we compared it with the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) classifier on enzyme and ion channel datasets, and other exiting methods on four datasets. The promising comparison results further demonstrate that the efficiency and robust of the proposed PDTPS method.

Concerning security, biometric system is one of the best options available in this technology driven era. Places such as nuclear facilities, airports, banks etc. are on the frontline of security threats. Therefore, biometrics such as Iris, face and fingerprint recognition is frequently used to avoid any security breach. However, the possibility of imitating, replicating or even the stealing of original data has made these tools unreliable. As a result, there has been a growing interest in finding a better biometric system and brain activity-based biometrics such as Electroencephalography (EEG) and Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) come with the advantage of being quite impossible to mimic. This paper presents a thorough and in depth review of the state of the art studies and research on brain activity-based biometrics. These studies and selected research projects are reviewed based on their feature extraction, methods, classification and most importantly, performance. Reviewing the most recent studies and research, we have found that time and frequency based features are better to be considered together for a brain activity-based biometric system. Together they are effective and efficient and give us a higher performance rate. Furthermore, we have found that Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is the best classification option with 100% accuracy and it can be used for a higher number of users for a biometric system.

It is argued that this method, unlike many current statistically based machine learning methods, implies a view of grammar learning that bears close affinity to the views linguists have of the logical problem of language acquisition. Two experiments in grammar learning using this technique are described, using a unification grammar formalism, and positive-only data. What is Inductive Logic Programming? Inductive Logic Programming (Muggleton & DeRaedt 1994:629-679) is a machine learning technique that builds logical theories \uf8e7here, (full) first order logic\uf8e7 to explain observations. \u2018Explain\u2019 here means that it is possible to deduce the evidence from the axioms of the theory (and not be able to deduce negative evidence). ILP is best introduced via the following schema and consequent derivation: (1) Background & Hypothesis Evidence We do not assume a tabula rasa: for reasons that every linguist will be familiar with, it is necessary to assume a fairly rich set of background assumptions to constrain the space of possible hypotheses. Given this background, and the evidence, the task is to come up with a hypothesis such that when it is conjoined with the background, the evidence can be deduced from it. 32 James Cussens & Stephen Pulman Each of the components in the above schema is represented as a set of logical statements.

Since Background & Evidence is by hypothesis, consistent, it will be the case by Herbrand's theorem (provided that we restrict the form of H and E) that there is some finite set of ground clauses that are true in every model of that expression. Step 3 of the derivation is: (3) Find set of clauses C true in every model of: Background & Evidence. Notice that we represent this set of clauses as a negation, to make succeeding steps tidier. Since this set of clauses is true in every model of Background & Evidence, then the following step of the derivation holds: (4) Background & Evidence C Hypothesis Note that Hypothesiswill be a subset of C .

TF-IDF features are sparse and do not consider the correlation among the words which constructs the latent concepts in the document. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) removes sparseness of the TF-IDF features by representing it in a low dimensional matrix and extracts those hidden concepts.

The main goal of this work is to develop a reliable machine learning algorithm to identify the cognitive workload induced during rescue missions, which is evaluated through drone control simulation experiments. In addition, we aim to minimize the computing resources usage while maximizing the cognitive workload detection accuracy for a reliable real-time operation.

Nowadays in the frames of research advanced signal processing techniques are combined with high level machine learning approaches, focusing towards automatic fault diagnosis and decision making. A plethora of Health Indicators (HIs) have been proposed to feed in machine learning models in orderto track the system degradation. Cyclic Spectral Analysis (CSA), including Cyclic Spectral Correlation (CSC) and Cyclic Spectral Coherence (CSCoh), has been proved as a powerful tool for rotating machinery fault detection. Due to the periodic mechanism of bearing fault impacts, the HIs extracted from the Cyclostationary (CS) domain can detect bearing defects even in premature stage. On the other hand, supervised machine learning approaches with labelled training and testing datasets cannot be yet realistically applied in industrial applications. In order to overcome this limitation, a novel semi-supervised Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) with negative samples (NSVDD) fault detection approach is proposed in this paper. The NSVDD model utilizes CS indicators to build the feature space, and fits a hyper-sphere to calculate the Euclidean distances in order to isolate the healthy and faulty data. An uniform object generation method is adopted to generate artificial outliers as negative samples for the NSVDD. A systematic fault detection decision strategy is proposed to estimate the bearing status simultaneously with the detection of fault initiation. Furthermore, a multi-level anomaly detection framework is built based on data at i) single sensor level, ii) machine level and iii) entire machine fleet level. Three run-to-failure bearing datasets including signals from twelve bearings are used to implement the proposed fault detection methodology. Results show that, the CS based indicators outperform time indicators and Fast Kurtogram (FK) based Squared Envelope Spectrum (SES) indicators. Moreover, the proposed NSVDD model show superior characteristics in anomaly detection compared to three classification methodologies, i.e. the Back-Propagation Neural Network, the Random Forest and the K-Nearest Neighbour.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.106682", "venue": null, "journal": "Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing", "mag_id": "2964294029", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213778846"}

These graphs often evolve over time. Learning effective representations preserving graph topology, as well as latent patterns in temporal dynamics, has drawn increasing interests. In this paper, we investigate the problem of dynamic graph embedding that maps a time series of graphs to a low dimensional feature space. However, most existing works in the field of dynamic representation learning either consider temporal evolution of low-order proximity or treat high-order proximity and temporal dynamics separately. It is challenging to learn one single embedding that can preserve the high-order proximity with long-term temporal dependencies. We propose a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based model, named DynGraphGAN, to learn robust feature representations. It consists of a generator and a discriminator trained in an adversarial process. The generator generates connections between nodes that are represented by a series of adjacency matrices. The discriminator integrates a graph convolutional network for high-order proximity and a convolutional neural network for temporal dependency to distinguish real samples from fake samples produced by the generator. With iterative boosting of the performance of the generator and discriminator, node embeddings are learned to present dynamic evolution over time. By jointly considering high-order proximity and temporal evolution, our model can preserve spatial structure with temporal dependency. DynGraphGAN is optimized on subgraphs produced by random walks to capture more complex structural and temporal patterns in the dynamic graphs. We also leverage sparsity and temporal smoothness properties to further improve the model efficiency.

A simple geometric interpretation of Twin SVM is that each hyperplane is closest to the points of its own class and as far as possible from the points of the other class. This method defines two nonparallel hyper-planes by solving two related SVM-type problems. Localized Twin SVM is a classification approach via local information which is based on Twin SVM, and has been proved by experiments having a better performance than conventional Twin SVM.

We incorporate a constraint into the standard SNMF model to learn the matrices of similarity and cluster simultaneously.

Objectives The goal of this study was to determine in a large sample of suicide attempts which variables are associated with family history of attempted suicide. Methods In an emergency room, 539 adult suicide attempters were recruited. The two dichotomous dependent variables were family history of suicide attempt (10%) and of completed suicide (4%). Independent variables were 101 clinical variables explored with two data mining techniques: Random Forest and Forward Selection. Results A model for family history of completed suicide could not be developed. A classificatory model for family history of attempted suicide included the use of alcohol in the intent and family history of completed suicide, provide a sensitivity of 78.4%, a specificity of 98.7% and accuracy of 96.6%. Conclusions A classificatory model for family history of completed suicide could not be developed using data mining techniques. But it suggested that the use of alcohol in the intent and family history of completed suicide may be associated with familial attempted suicide.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S0924-9338(09)70963-0", "venue": null, "journal": "European Psychiatry", "mag_id": "2038850685", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:144980482"}

We applied the Random Forests algorithm to classify dual-pol SAR images and polarimetric descriptors derived from two full-polarimetric Radarsat-2 C-band images acquired during the low and high water seasons of Lago Grande de Curuai floodplain, lower Amazon, Brazil. We used the Kappa index of agreement (\u03ba), Allocation Disagreement (AD) and Quantity Disagreement (QD), and Producer's and User's accuracy measurements to assess the classification results. Our results showed that single-season full-polarimetric C-band data can yield more accurate classifications than single-season dual-pol C-band SAR imagery and similar accuracies to dual-season dual-pol C-band SAR classifications. Still, dual-season PolSAR achieved the highest accuracies, showing that seasonality is paramount for obtaining high accuracies in wetland land cover classification, regardless of SAR image type. On average, single-season classifications of low-water periods were less accurate than high-water classifications, likely due to plant phenology and flooding conditions. Classifications using model-based polarimetric decompositions (such as Freeman\u2013Durden, Yamaguchi and van Zyl) produced the highest accuracies (\u03ba greater than 0.8; AD ranging from 7.5% to 2.5%; QD ranging from 15% to 12%), while eigenvector-based decompositions such as Touzi and Cloude\u2013Pottier had the worst accuracies (\u03ba ranging from 0.5 to 0.7; AD greater than 10%; QD smaller than 10%). Vegetation types with dense canopies (Shrubs, Floodable Forests and Emergent Macrophytes), whose classification is challenging using C-band, were accurately classified using dual-season full-polarimetric SAR data, with Producer's and User's accuracies between 80% and 90%.

To do so, we train the network of interest up to convergence several times, modifying its characteristics at each training. The initial and final accuracies observed during this beforehand process are stored in a database. We then make use of both curve fitting and Support Vector Machines techniques, the latter being trained on the created database, to predict the accuracy of the network, given its accuracy on the primary iterations of its learning. This approach can be of particular interest when the space of the characteristics of the network is notably large or when its full training is highly time-consuming. The results we obtained are promising and encouraged us to apply this strategy to a topical issue: hyper-parameter optimisation (HO).

Consequently, the food basket has continuously declined while the global demand for food has grown twofold. There is need for continuous monitoring and spatial information update of agriculture activities. This will support decision and policy making organs to take necessary actions towards enhancing food security. However, economic factors, farm management, natural aspects (such as weather, soils e.t.c.) and government policy for instance, influence types of crops planted in a season. Therefore, data acquisition and mapping methods need to consider these dynamics. The study adopts microwave remote sensing with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for data acquisition. Microwave remote sensing is daylight and weather independent thus guarantees the highest temporal density of images regardless of climatic zones. This also means that images at different phonological stages can be captured by radar sensors. ::: ::: Crop phenology is dynamic as it changes spatially in different times of the year. Such biophysical processes also look spectrally different to radar sensors. Some crops may depict similar spectral properties if their phenology coincide, but differ later when their phenology diverge. Thus, crop mapping methods using single-date remote sensing images can not offer optimal results in case of crops with similar phenology. In addition, methods stacking images within a cropping season for classification limits discrimination to a single high dimensional feature space vector that can suffer from overlapping classes. However, phenology can aid discrimination of crops since their backscatter varies with time. Therefore, this research seeks to fill this gap by developing a crop sequence classification method using multitemporal SAR images. The method is built to use spatial and temporal context. ::: ::: The study designed first order and higher order undirected Dynamic Conditional Random Fields ::: (DCRFs) for spatial-temporal crop classification. Basically, the DCRFs model has a repeated structure of temporally connected conditional random fields (CRFs). Each node in the sequence is connected to its temporal neighbours via conditional probability matrix. The matrix is computed using posterior class probabilities estimated by random forest classifier. We use the matrix on one hand to encode expert and image based phenological information in higher order DCRFs. On the other hand, the matrix integrates only image based phenological information in first order DCRFs. When compared to independent epoch classification, the designs improved crop discrimination at each epoch with higher order DCRFs having the highest accuracy in the sequence. However, stakeholders and policy makers need to know the quantity and spatial coverage of crops in a given season so as to ensure food security and a balanced ecosystem. Therefore, we went an extra step to develop a DCRFs ensemble classifier. The DCRFs ensemble considers a set of computed posterior crop type probabilities at each epoch in order to generate an optimal label of a node. This is done by maximizing over posterior crop type probabilities selected from the sequence based on maximum F1-score and weighted by user accuracy. Our ensemble technique is compared to standard approach of stacking all images as bands for classification using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and CRFs. So far it outperforms MLC and CRFs using crop type posterior probabilities estimated by both first and higher order DCRFs.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2560283618", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["28436772"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132108692"}

First, we propose a natural way of specifying the loss function for GANs by drawing a connection with supervised learning. Second, we shed light on the statistical performance of GANs through the analysis of a simple LQG setting: the generator is linear, the loss function is quadratic and the data is drawn from a Gaussian distribution. We show that in this setting: 1) the optimal GAN solution converges to population Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as the number of training samples increases; 2) the number of samples required scales exponentially with the dimension of the data; 3) the number of samples scales almost linearly if the discriminator is constrained to be quadratic.

High latency causes the system's feedback to lag behind user actions and thus significantly degrades the interactivity of the user experience. This paper presents algorithms for reducing latency when recognizing actions. We use a latency-aware learning formulation to train a logistic regression-based classifier that automatically determines distinctive canonical poses from data and uses these to robustly recognize actions in the presence of ambiguous poses. We introduce a novel (publicly released) dataset for the purpose of our experiments. Comparisons of our method against both a Bag of Words and a Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifier show improved recognition performance for both pre-segmented and online classification tasks. Additionally, we employ GentleBoost to reduce our feature set and further improve our results.

The first approach consists of the classification of a set of acoustic features extracted from exhalations of a person performing fluid or fragmented movements. In the second approach, the intrapersonal synchronization between the respiration and kinetic energy of body movements is used to distinguish the same qualities. First, the value of synchronization between modalities is computed using the Event Synchronization algorithm. Next, a set of features, computed from the value of synchronization, is used as an input to machine learning algorithms. Both approaches were applied to the multimodal corpus composed of short performances by three professionals performing fluid and fragmented movements. The total duration of the corpus is about 17 min. The highest F-score (0.87) for the first approach was obtained for the binary classification task using Support Vector Machines (SVM-LP). The best result for the same task using the second approach was obtained using Naive Bayes algorithm (F-score of 0.72).

Yet, this information is critical for enhancing management capability and engaging in international initiatives such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD +). The use of multi-source inventories (i.e., remote-sensing, field, and other data) in integrated models has shown increasing promise for accurately estimating forest attributes at lower costs. In this study, we compared the use of Landsat 8 OLI versus RapidEye satellite imagery in four modeling approaches (generalized linear model (GLM), generalized additive model (GAM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Random Forests), with and without auxiliary information (e.g., soils characteristics, distance to roads, etc.) to estimate percent canopy cover by pixel for an ~ 1,000,000 ha area in Zambia. We derived plot-level canopy cover as the dependent variable, using field-measured data collected according to current National Forest Inventory (NFI) protocol. Using cross-validation statistics, Landsat 8 OLI exhibited better results than RapidEye across modeling approaches likely due to the additional short-wave infrared bands which consistently improved model performance (average root mean squared prediction error = 10.1% versus 11.0%). The GAM approach was more precise, though more challenging to fit. For both remote sensing data sources and all modeling approaches, other auxiliary information improved the model; soil variables were commonly selected for inclusion using a Genetic Algorithm. Using a binomial GAM with Landsat 8 OLI and soil variables, and by applying the current FAO forest/non-forest definition (i.e., canopy cover > 10% for a 0.5 ha area), we estimated the total forest area as 758,100 ha (95% bootstrapped confidence interval of \u00b1 3,953 ha). Overall, our research indicates that sufficiently accurate forest area estimates for Zambia can be obtained using canopy cover GAM models that incorporate NFI data and freely-available remote sensing imagery and soil information.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2016.03.028", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2334020449", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211254188", "46783629", "8879102", "92026885", "134085936", "86867166", "3563902", "52278810", "42913025", "209516482"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131472911"}

Unlike the previous studies, we first constructed several binary classifiers, then assembled a tertiary classifier for three secondary structure states (helix, sheet and coil) based on these binary classifiers. The SVM method achieved a good performance of segment overlap accuracy SOV=76.2 % through sevenfold cross validation on a database of 513 non-homologous protein chains with multiple sequence alignments, which out-performs existing methods. Meanwhile three-state overall per-residue accuracy Q(3) achieved 73.5 %, which is at least comparable to existing single prediction methods. Furthermore a useful \"reliability index\" for the predictions was developed.

Objects are modelled as flexible constellations of parts conditioned on local observations. For each object class the probability of a given assignment of parts to local features is modelled by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We propose an extension of the CRF framework that incorporates hidden variables and combines class conditional CRFs into a unified framework for part-based object recognition. The random field captures spatial coherence between region labels. The parameters of the CRF are estimated in a maximum likelihood framework and recognition proceeds by finding the most likely class under our model. The main advantage of the proposed CRF framework is that it allows us to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data (i.e. local features) often used in generative approaches, an assumption that might be too restrictive for a considerable number of object classes. In the second part of this work we extend the detection model and develop a discriminative recognition system which both detects the presence of objects and finds their regions of support in an image. Our part based model allows joint object detection and region labelling; in contrast to previous methods ours can be trained with a combination of examples for which we have labelled support regions and examples for which we only know whether the object is present in the image. We extend the detection model by incorporating a segmentation variable; the segmentation variable is assumed to be observed in the fully labelled data and hidden on the partially labelled one. Our latent variable model learns sets of part labels for each image site, which allows us to merge part-based detection with part-based region labelling (or segmentation).

Such scenario requires adaptive algorithms that are able to process constantly arriving instances, adapt to potential changes in data, use limited computational resources, as well as be robust to any atypical events that may appear. Ensemble learning has proven itself to be an effective solution, as combining learners leads to an improved predictive power, more flexible drift handling, as well as ease of being implemented in high-performance computing environments. In this paper, we propose an enhancement of popular online ensembles by augmenting them with abstaining option. Instead of relying on a traditional voting, classifiers are allowed to abstain from contributing to the final decision. Their confidence level is being monitored for each incoming instance and only learners that exceed certain threshold are selected. We introduce a dynamic and self-adapting threshold that is able to adapt to changes in the data stream, by monitoring outputs of the ensemble and allowing to exploit underlying diversity in order to efficiently anticipate drifts. Additionally, we show that forcing uncertain classifiers to abstain from making a prediction is especially useful for noisy data streams. Our proposal is a lightweight enhancement that can be applied to any online ensemble method, improving its robustness to drifts and noise.

Although supervised methods perform overall better than unsupervised methods, they are not widely used since they are more labor-intensive due to the need for great amounts of manual input. Our research showed increased performance of supervised methods over unsupervised methods. In addition, when using a deep learning based supervised method, training on only one subject already outperformed the commonly used unsupervised methods. We therefore recommend using deep learning lesion segmentation methods in MS research. Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system, characterized by neurodegeneration and demyelination. To enable both atrophy and lesion load measurements in subjects with MS, accurate lesion segmentation is necessary. Over the last decade, several (semi-)automatic lesion segmentation methods have been developed, which can be divided into two groups: supervised methods, which require manual delineation to train the method properly, and unsupervised methods, which do not require any training. Unsupervised methods are less labor-intensive, but show overall poor agreement with manual delineation. Aims Therefore, the aim of this research was twofold: first, we investigated the volumetric and spatial agreement of two supervised and two unsupervised automated lesion segmentation methods. Second, we assessed whether input from only one subject\u2019s manual delineation in the deep learning based supervised method already improved the volumetric and spatial agreement over unsupervised methods. Methods A total of fourteen subjects with RRMS were scanned between December 2016 and June 2017 on a 3T whole-body MR scanner (GE Discovery MR750) with an 8-channel phased-array head coil. The protocol included a 3D T1-weighted fast spoiled gradient echo sequence (FSPGR with TR/TE/TI = 8.2/3.2/450 ms and resolution 1.0x1.0x1.0 mm) and a 3D T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequence (FLAIR with TR/TE/TI = 8000/130/2338 ms at resolution 1.0x1.0x1.2 mm). An expert rater (experience >10 years) manually delineated the lesions on FLAIR images. Next, a total of four automated lesion segmentation methods were tested in comparison to manual segmentation, all based on different underlying algorithms. We tested two unsupervised methods, i.e. Lesion-Topology preserving Anatomical Segmentation (LesionTOADS) and Lesion Segmentation Toolbox with Lesion Prediction Algorithm (LST) and two supervised methods, i.e. FMRIB Software Library\u2019s Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm (FSL BIANCA) and Valverde\u2019s nicMSlesions . For the two supervised methods, we used input from all fourteen manually delineated subjects and used leaveone- out cross-validation. For LST LPA, the probability threshold was set on 0.55 as reported previously . BIANCA was optimized on our dataset (all and equal number of lesion and non-lesion points in the training set, any location of the non-lesion training points, a 3D patch with patch size 5, spatial weighting of 2, and threshold 0.99). For nicMSlesions, default parameters were used with threshold 0.5. No optimization was needed for LesionTOADS. For our second aim, we further tested nicMSlesions with input from only one manually delineated subject for its performance on the other thirteen subjects. We looked at volumetric and spatial agreement of the various methods compared to manual, using repeated measures ANOVA with, when appropriate, post-hoc Wilcoxon Signed Ranks testing. Results were considered significant upon p < 0.05. Results An example of the performance of the manual and automatic lesion segmentation methods is visualized in Figure 1 (note: here, the supervised methods are trained on fourteen subjects with leave-one-out cross-validation). The automated segmentation method used significantly affected both volumetric agreement (F(4,52) = 25.650, p < 0.001) and spatial agreement (F(3,39) = 27.954, p < 0.001) (Table 1). Post-hoc testing showed that manual volumes differed significantly from those of LST LPA, LesionTOADS and nicMSlesions, but not from those of BIANCA (Figure 2). For the single-subject training of nicMSlesions, one subject failed the training and was therefore not included in any of the further analyses. The singlesubject (1 to 13) that was used for training significantly affected the volumetric agreement (F(13,156) = 25.465, p < 0.001), but not the spatial agreement (F(12,144) = 1.497, p = 0.132) (Table 2). All single-subject trained nicMSlesions variants had greater spatial agreement with manual than the unsupervised lesion segmentation methods (Figure 3). Discussion and conclusion The two supervised methods showed better volumetric and spatial agreement to manual than the unsupervised methods, with BIANCA showing the best volumetric and nicMSlesions showing the best spatial agreement. Since the settings of nicMSlesions were set to default, it is possible that better volumetric agreement can be obtained upon optimization of the method. Furthermore, our results show that manual lesion segmentation input from even one single subject is sufficient to train nicMSlesions with its default parameters in such a way that it outperforms the unsupervised methods LST LPA and LesionTOADS. Although training on multiple subjects shows even better volumetric and spatial agreement, studies without great amounts of manual delineations can use nicMSlesions with only one subject\u2019s input and improve their automatic lesion segmentation over the commonly used unsupervised methods. Results should be confirmed in multi-vendor images and in subjects with different MS phenotypes.

In this project, we have further developed a computer-aided detection tool, the adaptive multiple feature method (AMFM), for the detection of interstitial lung diseases based on MDCT-generated volumetric data. Materials and Methods We performed MDCT (Siemens Sensation 16 or 64 120 kV, B50f convolution kernel, and \u22640.75-mm slice thickness) on 20 human volunteers recruited from four cohorts studied under an National Institutes of Health\u2013sponsored Bioengineering Research Partnership Grant: 1) normal never smokers; 2) normal smokers; 3) those with emphysema, and 4) those with interstitial lung disease (total: 11 males, 9 females; age range 20\u201375 years, mean age 40 years). A total of 1,184 volumes of interest (VOIs; 21 \u00d7 21 pixels in plane) were marked by a senior radiologist and a senior pulmonologist as emphysema (EMPH, n = 287); ground-glass (GG, n = 147), honeycombing (HC, n = 137), normal nonsmokers (NN, n = 287), and normal smokers (NS, n = 326). For each VOI, we calculated 24 volumetric features, including statistical features (first-order features, run-length, and co-occurrence features), histogram, and fractal features. We compared two methods of classification (a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Bayesian classifier) using a 10-fold cross validation method and McNemar\u2019s test.

However due to their position in the landscape they are both critical for ecosystem service provision as well as highly threatened. Therefore there is a need to detect and map the extent of small valley-bottom wetlands to aid conservation and restoration efforts. We investigated five research questions concerning small, valley-bottom palmiet wetlands in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), South Africa: (1) What is the best technique to detect palmiet wetlands?, (2) what is the best approach to map their extent?, (3) how best to analyse their potential extent and historical changes?, (4) what is their current extent and distribution and how has this changed historically?, and (5) what are the main drivers of this change? We used three different approaches to answer the various questions: multispectral imagery (the Landsat series) combined with Support Vector Machine classification, aerial photograph analysis with photographs from three time-steps and predictive modelling of wetland habitat suitability (using the MaxEnt model). Our main findings suggest that (1) multispectral classification using Landsat8 was best for palmiet wetland detection (76% accuracy), whereas (2) aerial photographs were the most useful in mapping extent. (3) Analysing changes in extent over time was best achieved using aerial photography, due to their high resolution and long historical record in South Africa (1940 compared to 1970 in the Landsat series). (4) South African palmiet wetlands are in decline, having decreased by on average 31% in area since the 1940/50s (overall loss of 6.36 km 2 ). Palmiet wetlands have also become increasingly fragmented, with weighted wetland perimeter increasing by 29% over the same period.

Using time series prediction methods, it is possible to pursue the behaviors of earthquake precursors in the future and to announce early warnings when the differences between the predicted value and the observed value exceed the predefined threshold value. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are widely used due to their many advantages for classification and regression tasks. This study is concerned with investigating the Total Electron Content (TEC) time series by using a SVM to detect seismo-ionospheric anomalous variations induced by the three powerful earthquakes of Tohoku (11 March 2011), Haiti (12 January 2010) and Samoa (29 September 2009). The duration of TEC time series dataset is 49, 46 and 71 days, for Tohoku, Haiti and Samoa earthquakes, respectively, with each at time resolution of 2 h. In the case of Tohoku earthquake, the results show that the difference between the predicted value obtained from the SVM method and the observed value reaches the maximum value (i.e., 129.31 TECU) at earthquake time in a period of high geomagnetic activities. The SVM method detected a considerable number of anomalous occurrences 1 and 2 days prior to the Haiti earthquake and also 1 and 5 days before the Samoa earthquake in a period of low geomagnetic activities. In order to show that the method is acting sensibly with regard to the results extracted during nonevent and event TEC data, i.e., to perform some null-hypothesis tests in which the methods would also be calibrated, the same period of data from the previous year of the Samoa earthquake date has been taken into the account. Further to this, in this study, the detected TEC anomalies using the SVM method were compared to the previous results (Akhoondzadeh and Saradjian, 2011; Akhoondzadeh, 2012) obtained from the mean, median, wavelet and Kalman filter methods. The SVM detected anomalies are similar to those detected using the previous methods. It can be concluded that SVM can be a suitable learning method to detect the novelty changes of a nonlinear time series such as variations of earthquake precursors.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/angeo-31-173-2013", "venue": null, "journal": "Annales Geophysicae", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2163545874", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["194951", "122811239", "122409784", "55323649", "58731659", "118824373", "5398743", "121206615", "122636521", "118124910", "53879697", "120109296"], "inbound_citations": ["125917831", "119630129", "126120082", "134667237", "195812912"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53659582"}

Methods: Individual probabilities of having a certain chronic disease were estimated using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. A training set was created from a general practitioners database of 276 723 cases that included diagnosis and claims data on medication. Model performance for 29 chronic diseases was evaluated using Receiver-Operator Curves, by measuring the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Results: The diseases for which model performance was best were Parkinson's disease (AUC = .89, 95% CI = .77-1.00), diabetes (AUC = .87, 95% CI = .85-.90), osteoporosis (AUC = .87, 95% CI = .81-.92) and heart failure (AUC = .81, 95% CI = .74-.88). Five other diseases had an AUC > .75: asthma, chronic enteritis, COPD, epilepsy and HIV/AIDS. For 16 of 17 diseases tested, the medication categories used in theory-based algorithms were also identified by our method, however the RF models included a broader range of medications as important predictors.

This reinforcement among the tasks depends on whether the individual tasks can benefit from common intermediate features. Abstract In training two networks on tasks that are different on the sur- face, but similar, or even isomorphic, at a higher level of de- scription, similarities between the network solutions are plau- sible if not expected. Such similarities tend to become evi- dent when two networks with shared weights are trained on similar tasks. After training, the shared weights were used as part of a third network that was trained on a third task similar to the first two. This \u201chead start\u201d results in significantly shorter training times than a network that starts with random weights. Shared hidden unit response profiles were analyzed across networks trained on structurally analogous tasks to re- veal parallel, but nonidentical features. Identical Elements in a Network The central idea introduced in this paper is that a network can learn high-level features common to different tasks, and use them in learning a novel task, assuming it has similar high-level attributes. This Identical Elements Neural Net- work (IENN) approach uses simultaneous training of multi- ple tasks, but differs from MTL in that the tasks do not share a common input. In principle, the tasks can have in- puts that have very different coding, dimensionality, etc. Some of the weights learned from simultaneous training are then used to initialize a network that is trained on a novel task. These transferred weights remain fixed. Background Experimental evidence for transfer was described early in the last century by Thorndike & Woodworth (1901), who proposed the identical elements theory of transfer. The the- ory proposes that two different \u201cmental functions\u201d may share cognitive structures in their processing. Two events may seem similar or identical at an abstract level of description or representation, yet very different on the surface. Analogical reasoning depends upon feature ab- straction at a level that is sufficient to subsume concrete features of multiple situations. Using this higher-level rep- resentation, a mapping can be established between features in the concrete instances (Gentner, 1983). Such an analogi- cal mapping is a mechanism, probably not unique, for trans- fer of knowledge from one domain to another. To the extent that the structures underlying analogy can be represented as patterns, the connectionist framework is a natural approach (e.g., Holyoak & Thagard, 1988; Halford et al, 1993). A distributed approach to structural mapping was put forward by Hummel & Holyoak (1994). Several symbolic-connectionist models have addressed the process- ing of structural mapping in the context of language proc- essing (e.g., Mitchell, 1993). Some other connectionist models have addressed transfer phenomena without explicitly addressing analogy; that is, these models do not focus on the development of a struc- tural mapping. Pratt et al. (1991) demonstrated that using weights from a network trained on one task to initialize a network to be trained on a similar task could improve learn- ing performance. The Multi-task Learning (MTL) approach of Caruana (1997) demonstrated that a single network The IENN approach requires more than one hidden layer. Only the weights between hidden layers are shared by mul- tiple tasks, thus allowing different numbers of input and output units for the individual tasks. This also enables a novel task to use the shared weights without interfering with performance on the original tasks. 1 Network Architecture and Training Feedforward networks were trained using backprop (cross- entropy error). The networks were strictly layered with two hidden layers. Two inputs activated all units in the first hidden layer (H 1 ), which subsequently activated all units in the second hidden layer (H 2 ), which activated the sole out- put unit. Each hidden layer had 16 units. Training was conducted in one of three modes: single network with ran- dom initial weights, single network with prespecified weights between the two hidden layers, and two networks with yoked (shared) weights between the hidden layers. Mode 1: Single Network with random initial weights. This was the control condition for each study. Network weights and biases were initialized to random values, and trained to a time/error criterion.

We show that the predictive power of the generated models, which just require standard 2D compound representations as input, is comparable to that of Random Forest (RF) models and fully-connected Deep Neural Networks trained on circular (Morgan) fingerprints. Notably, including additional fully-connected layers further increases the predictive power of the ConvNets by up to 10%. Analysis of the predictions generated by RF models and ConvNets shows that by simply averaging the output of the RF models and ConvNets we obtain significantly lower errors in prediction for multiple data sets, although the effect size is small, than those obtained with either model alone, indicating that the features extracted by the convolutional layers of the ConvNets provide complementary predictive signal to Morgan fingerprints. Lastly, we show that multi-task ConvNets trained on compound images permit to model COX isoform selectivity on a continuous scale with errors in prediction comparable to the uncertainty of the data. Overall, in this work we present a set of ConvNet architectures for the prediction of compound activity from their Kekul\u00e9 structure representations with state-of-the-art performance, that require no generation of compound descriptors or use of sophisticated image processing techniques.

Most present-day systems for this purpose rely on some variant of a generate-and-test procedure that repeatedly examines a set of potential candidates (termed here as the hypothesis space). On each iteration a search procedure is employed to find the best clause. The worst-case time-complexity of such systems depends critically on: (1) the size of the hypothesis spaces examined; and (2) the cost of estimating the goodness of a clause. To date, attempts to improve the efficiency of such ILP systems have concentrated either on examining fewer clauses within a given hypothesis space, or on efficient means of estimating the goodness of clauses. The principal means of restricting the size of the hypothesis space itself has been through the use of language and search constraints. Given such constraints, this paper is concerned with investigating the use of a dimensionality reduction method to reduce further the size of the hypothesis space. Specifically, for a particular kind of ILP system, clauses in the search space are represented as points in a high-dimension space. Using a sample of points from this geometric space, feature selection is used to discard dimensions of little or no (statistical) relevance. The resulting lower dimensional space translates directly, in the worst-case, to a smaller hypothesis space. We evaluate this approach on one controlled domain (graphs) and two real-life datasets concerning problems from biochemistry (mutagenesis and carcinogenesis). In each case, we obtain unbiased estimates of the size of the hypothesis space before and after feature selection; and compare the the results obtained using a complete search of the two spaces.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/11536314_21", "venue": "ILP", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1573983055,2595191652", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["17632749", "5673972"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27665754"}

This technique is widely used in clinical medicine. Magnetic resonance imaging is a non-invasive technique that can reflect the proton diffusion motion in human body tissues. Many diffusion weighted images are available on the Internet due to the development of remote diagnosis. However, investigation of academic literature indicates that the copyright information problem for diffusion weighted images has not been studied. To protect the privacy of patients and the copyright information of medical images, we develop a reversible visible watermarking algorithm for medical images via support vector regression. First, a diffusion weighted image is divided into 13 directions, and the b0 direction is selected to embed the watermark. Second, the pixel values of the watermarked image are predicted via support vector regression, and the prediction errors are calculated. Third, a whole location map is generated according to texture classification to increase the watermark robustness. Finally, the relationship between the whole location map and prediction errors is used to process medical images and thus enhance the robustness of the watermarking algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has good robustness. Unknown key information makes the removal of the watermark difficult. Furthermore, the algorithm does not damage medical images and ensures image visibility. These properties can guarantee the integrity of patient information and the authenticity of medical images.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/icsp.2018.8652283", "venue": "2018 14th IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing (ICSP)", "journal": "2018 14th IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing (ICSP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2920587988", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8566948", "202106185", "45431671", "68387", "9094238", "42848058", "16446608"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67873751"}

Relative to controls, PSP patients showed diffusion tensor (DT) MRI abnormalities of the corpus callosum, superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), cingulum and uncinate fasciculus bilaterally, and right inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Corpus callosum and SCP DT MRI measures distinguished PSP from PD patients with high accuracy (area under the curve ranging from 0.89 to 0.72). In PSP, DT MRI metrics of the corpus callosum and superior cerebellar peduncles were the best predictors of global disease severity scale scores. DT MRI metrics of the corpus callosum, right superior longitudinal and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and left uncinate were the best predictors of executive dysfunction.

Cytogenetic biodosimetry detects dicentric chromosomes (DCs) that arise from exposure to ionizing radiation, and determines radiation dose received from the frequency of DCs. We present image segmentation methods to rank high quality cytogenetic images and eliminate suboptimal metaphase cell data based on novel quality measures. Improvements in DC recognition increase the accuracy of dose estimates, by reducing false positive (FP) DC detection. A set of chromosome morphology segmentation methods selectively filtered out false DCs, arising primarily from extended prometaphase chromosomes, sister chromatid separation and chromosome fragmentation. This reduced FPs by 55% and was highly specific to the abnormal structures (\u226597.7%). Additional procedures were then developed to fully automate image review, resulting in 6 image-level filters that, when combined, selectively remove images with consistently unparsable or incorrectly segmented chromosome morphologies. Overall, these filters can eliminate half of the FPs detected by manual image review. Optimal image selection and FP DCs are minimized by combining multiple feature based segmentation filters and a novel image sorting procedure based on the known distribution of chromosome lengths. Consequently, the average dose estimation error was reduced from 0.4Gy to <0.2Gy with minimal manual review required. These image filtering approaches constitute a reliable and scalable solution that results in more accurate radiation dose estimates.

In this paper, we propose a replicable DML method, called Include and Exclude (IE) loss, to force the distance between a sample and its designated class center away from the mean distance of this sample to other class centers with a large margin in the exponential feature projection space. With the supervision of IE loss, we can train CNNs to enhance the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, leading to great improvements on several public datasets ranging from object recognition to face verification. We conduct a comparative study of our algorithm with several typical DML methods on three kinds of networks with different capacity. Extensive experiments on three object recognition datasets and two face recognition datasets demonstrate that IE loss is always superior to other mainstream DML methods and approach the state-of-the-art results.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1803.02504", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2018.02.040", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2962952900,2793453263,2952571162", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["207763512", "14124313", "206592484", "206594692", "8217340", "1849990", "2814088", "290159", "206592295", "10611748", "206592766", "4711865", "4642300", "10600578", "13740328", "7986092", "8432978", "14832074", "2936324", "2134321", "852459", "1395439", "30582", "1345207", "47325215", "2771025", "3978858", "15985564", "20578663", "14542261", "1136006", "19142960", "206741496", "990233", "1829423", "60282629", "18268744", "17716267", "9898157", "1799558", "15276198", "1289873", "6075369", "31884", "12998557", "17188384", "758953", "6383512", "5785086", "1958211", "15537961", "20249677"], "inbound_citations": ["53383208", "108352958", "67790754"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3726507"}

To overcome the limitation, identifying the optimal number of features is critical for analyzing the data. In this paper, we introduce a newly designed feature selection technique, called Summit Selection, which boosts model performances by determining optimal features in noisy mixed data. First, testing all features is conducted to determine an initial base feature that satisfies a pre-defined criterion for maintaining the highest performance score. Then, a continuous evaluation is managed to build a model by successively adding or removing features based solely on the performance score tested with chosen computational models. To show the effectiveness of our proposed technique, a performance evaluation study was conducted to determine fraudulent activities in the UCSD Data Mining Contest 2009 Dataset. We compared our proposed technique with different feature extraction techniques such as PCA, ANOVA test, and Mutual Information (MI). Specifically, multiple machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) are tested with the feature extraction techniques to determine performance differences. As results, we found that our proposed technique showed about 8.78% performance improvement in detecting fraudulent activities.

SNN have proven their effectiveness in image classification on simple datasets such as MNIST. However, to process natural images, a pre-processing step is required. Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filtering is typically used together with on-center/off-center coding, but it results in a loss of information that is detrimental to the classification performance. In this paper, we propose to use whitening as a pre-processing step before learning features with STDP. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that whitening allows STDP to learn visual features that are closer to the ones learned with standard neural networks, with a significantly increased classification performance as compared to DoG filtering. We also propose an approximation of whitening as convolution kernels that is computationally cheaper to learn and more suited to be implemented on neuromorphic hardware. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that it performs similarly to regular whitening. Cross-dataset experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 also show that it is fairly stable across datasets, making it possible to learn a single whitening transformation to process different datasets.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2002.10177", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3008199512", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6219133", "214929760", "308212", "2932299", "3637557", "211194293", "102481370", "5047371", "15169345", "210838487", "18268744", "195908774", "130535382", "6309804", "85607599", "4358477", "12520365", "5039751", "16408546", "2046662"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211259437"}

Recent developments in global land-cover mapping focused on spatial resolution improvement with more heterogeneous features to integrate the spatial, spectral, and temporal information. Although the high dimensional input features as a whole lead to discriminatory strengths to produce more accurate land-cover maps, it comes at the cost of an increased classification complexity. The feature selection method has become a necessity for dimensionality reduction in classification with large amounts of input features. In this study, the potential of feature selection in global land-cover mapping is explored. A total of 63 features derived from the Landsat Thematic Mapper TM spectral bands, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS time series enhanced vegetation index EVI data, digital elevation model DEM, and many climate-ecological variables and global training samples are input to k-nearest neighbours k-NN and Random Forest RF classifiers. Two filter feature selection algorithms, i.e. Relieff and max-min-associated MNA, were employed to select the optimal subsets of features for the whole world and different biomes. The mapping accuracies with/without feature selection were evaluated by a global validation sample set. Overall, the result indicates no significant accuracy improvement in global land-cover mapping after dimensionality reduction. Nevertheless, feature selection has the capability of identifying useful features in different biomes and improves the computational efficiency, which is valuable in global-scale computing.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/01431161.2016.1244365", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of remote sensing", "mag_id": "2541453841", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["92616612", "195933402"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63645973"}

However, none of them could reflect well the semantic complexity of TCM and systemic characteristics of TCM treatment. This paper conducted a research on the inherent rules of TCM clinic records with a topic model. On the basis of LDA model, weighted mechanism was adopted for each feature word to improve the distinguishing ability and interpretability between the topics. Meanwhile, the modeled topic is taken as the feature for the classification of SVM (Support Vector Machine) to improve the classification accuracy. The topic number of LDA topic model is confirmed by the KL distance and similarity between the topics. After analyzing the relationship between topic model and TCM differentiation and treatment, MULTI-RELATIONSHIP Topics LDA MODEL was proposed on the basis of LDA model and Author-topic model to automatically extract the topic structures between the four parties and explore the relationship of the multiple parties with clinical significance. In the meantime, relevancy between the parties and the feature word weighted mechanism are used to improve the MULTI-RELATIONSHIP Topics LDA MODEL and the classification accuracy of the topics.

In one hand, traditional and emerging access control models cannot handle indeterminate data access scenarios in IoT by applying deterministic access policies. On the other hand, moving towards resilient access control paradigms needs new attitudes and current manual risk analysis methods that rely on vulnerability calculations do not fit in IoT. This holds true as considering vulnerability as the key player in risk assessment is no longer efficient way to tackle with indeterminate access scenarios due to complicated dependency and scalability of IoT environment. Moreover, most of the IoT devices are not patchable so by discovering new vulnerabilities the vulnerable devices need to be replaced. Therefore, IoT needs agile, resilient and automatic authentication process. This work suggests a novel authentication method based on our previous work in which uncertainty was introduced as one of the neglected challenges in IoT. Uncertainty in authentication derived from incomplete information about incident happening upon authenticating an entity. Part of IoT characteristics makes such an uncertainty worse. Therefore, we have proposed an uncertainty-aware authentication model based on Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Our prediction model is able to consider the uncertainty factor of mobile entities as well as fixed ones in authentication. In doing so, we have built our prediction model using boosting classifiers (AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting algorithms) besides voting classifier. We have compared the results with our previous work.

Pre-clustering is a useful technique to prepare proper data from an imbalanced dataset for a classifier. It can be used to extract the feature of a dataset first and improve classification performance. Density peak based on Euclidean distance proves its effectiveness and generality in clustering.

This parameter cannot be simply predicted since there are nonlinear and unknown relationships between permeability and other reservoir properties. To obtain information about permeability, core samples are analyzed or well tests are performed conventionally. These are, however, very expensive and time-consuming to perform. Well log data is another source of information which is always available and much cheaper than core sample and well testing analysis. Thus establishing a relationship between reservoir permeability and well log data can be very helpful in estimation of this vital parameter. However, establishing relationship between well logs and permeability is not a simple task and cannot be done using a simple linear or nonlinear method. Relevance Vector Regression (RVR) is one of the robust artificial intelligence algorithms proved to be very successful in recognition of relationships between input and output parameters. The aim of this paper is to show the application of RVR in prediction of permeability in three wells located in a carbonate reservoir in the south part of Iran. To do this, genetic algorithm (GA) was used as an optimizer to find the best logs for prediction of permeability. Comparing the results of RVR with that of a Support Vector Regression (SVR) indicated more accuracy of RVR in prediction of permeability. However, SVR can still be considered as a second option for prediction of petrophysical properties due to its reliable efficiency.

This fact makes the training of sequence classifier be time consuming and the application of sequential learning from large scale data is difficult, especially when the available training data are sparsely labeled. This paper proposed a novel learning approach to build the sequence classifiers from a large amount of partially labeled training data. The mechanism of semi-supervised learning for classifier building from the partially labeled data is embedded in the computing framework of ensemble learning, which is adapted for distributed learning over large scale dataset. For its practical evaluation, we conducted the empirical experiments by using Conditional Random Field (CRF) as the basic learner to detect concepts in large scale document set.

An automated detection of ventricular beat in the ECG is proposed, which is an extension of a recently published switching Kalman filter (skf) approach. The latter technique enables automatic selection of the most likely mode (beat type), and makes novelty detection possible by incorporating a mode for unknown morphologies (X-factor). The previously published technique is semi-supervised and relies on the manual annotation of the different clusters (or modes), thus making it less readily applicable in Big Data scenarios. Here we propose to extend the switching Kalman filter technique by automating the labelling of the modes. Each heartbeat in a mode was classified individually using a feature-based approach, and the cluster was assigned a given type by majority voting. Two different feature-based classifications were tested. First, ecgkit, a state-of-the-art toolkit recently made available online provides a heartbeat classification based on clustering and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Second, a Support Vector Machine (svm) approach was used with the same features as ecgkit. Therefore two different automated switching Kalman filter techniques were tested, ecgkit-skf and svm-skf, that differed only in the way the modes were classified. Both approaches were assessed on an independent subset of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (22 individual subjects, 30-minute recordings), and were compared to the semi-supervised switching Kalman filter approach (skf), as well as to the classification techniques, ecgkit and svm. F1 varied from 81.2% for ecgkit, 85.4% for svm, 91.8% for ecgkit-skf, 92.3% for svm-skf, and 98.6% for skf.

Using a spatial-contextual term, this study modifies the decision function and constraints of a support vector machine (SVM) and proposes two kinds of spatial-contextual SVMs for hyperspectral image classification. One machine, which is based on the concept of Markov random fields (MRFs), uses the spatial information in the original space (SCSVM). The other machine uses the spatial information in the feature space (SCSVMF), i.e., the nearest neighbors in the feature space. The SCSVM is better able to classify pixels of different class labels with similar spectral values and deal with data that have no clear numerical interpretation. To evaluate the effectiveness of SCSVM, the experiments in this study compare the performances of other classifiers: an SVM, a context-sensitive semisupervised SVM, a maximum likelihood (ML) classifier, a Bayesian contextual classifier based on MRFs (ML_MRF), and nearest neighbor classifier.

A novel data selection methodology is proposed which enables online classification of detected disturbances without requiring the estimation of unknown (future) process behavior, as is the case in previously reported approaches. The proposed method is benchmarked in two case studies using the Pensim process model of Birol et al. (2002) implemented in RAYMOND . Both a simple k Nearest Neighbors ( k -NN) and complex Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) are employed for classification to demonstrate the generic nature of the proposed approach. In addition, the influence of different data pretreatment methods on the classification performance is discussed, together with a motivation for selecting the correct pretreatment steps. Finally, the influence of the number of available training batches is studied. The results demonstrate that a good classification performance can be achieved with the proposed data selection method even with a low number of faulty training batches by exploiting knowledge on the nature of the to-be-diagnosed faults in the data pretreatment.

In the context of a feasibility study, the intervention was performed by 5 operators, each 5 ::: times, on a specially designed phantom. The coordinate information is processed into 7 features characterizing the ::: intervention. Three classifiers, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a combination of ::: these (SVM+HMM) are trained on manually annotated data and cross-validated for intra- and inter-operator variability. ::: Standard test metrics are used to compare the performance of each classifier. ::: Results. HMM alone and SVM alone are comparable classifiers, but feeding the output of the SVM into an HMM results ::: in significantly better classifications: accuracy of 97.8%, sensitivity of 93.1% and specificity of 98.4%. ::: Conclusion. The use of trajectory information can provide a robust real-time phase recognition of surgical phases for ::: needle-based interventions.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2253619", "venue": "Medical Imaging", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2593412873", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Physics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1668055", "215658130", "17246383", "20801251", "8248806", "22572907", "9855967", "818172", "37790570", "2161700", "43364985", "32909811", "39623802", "17952638"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28926142"}

Also, it is estimated that the number of deaths from COPD increased \\(30\\%\\) in 2015 and COPD will become the third major cause of death worldwide by 2030. These statistics about lung diseases get worse when one considers fibrosis, calcifications and other diseases. For the public health system, the early and accurate diagnosis of any pulmonary disease is mandatory for effective treatments and prevention of further deaths. In this sense, this work consists in using information from lung images to identify and classify lung diseases. Two steps are required to achieve these goals: automatically extraction of representative image features of the lungs and recognition of the possible disease using a computational classifier. As to the first step, this work proposes an approach that combines Spatial Interdependence Matrix (SIM) and Visual Information Fidelity (VIF). Concerning the second step, we propose to employ a Gaussian-based distance to be used together with the optimum-path forest (OPF) classifier to classify the lungs under study as normal or with fibrosis, or even affected by COPD. Moreover, to confirm the robustness of OPF in this classification problem, we also considered Support Vector Machines and a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network for comparison purposes. Overall, the results confirmed the good performance of the OPF configured with the Gaussian distance when applied to SIM- and VIF-based features. The performance scores achieved by the OPF classifier were as follows: average accuracy of \\(98.2\\%\\), total processing time of 117 microseconds in a common personal laptop, and F-score of 95.2% for the three classification classes.

Although several classification models have been developed for this purpose, there is no consensus on which classifier performs better at identifying driving styles. Therefore, more research is needed to evaluate classification models by comparing performance metrics. In this paper, a data-driven machine-learning methodology for classifying driving styles is introduced. This methodology is grounded in well-established machine-learning (ML) methods and literature related to driving-styles research. The methodology is illustrated through a study involving data collected from 50 drivers from two different cities in a naturalistic setting. Five features were extracted from the raw data. Fifteen experts were involved in the data labeling to derive the ground truth of the dataset. The dataset fed five different models (Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), fuzzy logic, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Random Forests (RF)). These models were evaluated in terms of a set of performance metrics and statistical tests. The experimental results from performance metrics showed that SVM outperformed the other four models, achieving an average accuracy of 0.96, F1-Score of 0.9595, Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.9730, and Kappa of 0.9375. In addition, Wilcoxon tests indicated that ANN predicts differently to the other four models.

This research conducted a comparative analysis of different datasets (e.g., Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), ALOS PALSAR L-band data, and their combinations) and modeling algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and linear regression (LR)) for AGB estimation in a subtropical region under non-stratification and stratification of forest types. The results show the following: (1) Landsat TM imagery provides more accurate AGB estimates (root mean squared error (RMSE) values in 27.7\u201329.3 Mg/ha) than ALOS PALSAR (RMSE values in 30.3\u201333.7 Mg/ha). The combination of TM and PALSAR data has similar performance for ANN and SVR, worse performance for RF and KNN, and slightly improved performance for LR. (2) Overestimation for small AGB values and underestimation for large AGB values are major problems when using the optical (e.g., Landsat) or radar (e.g., ALOS PALSAR) data. (3) LR is still an important tool for AGB modeling, especially for the AGB range of 40\u2013120 Mg/ha. Machine learning algorithms have limited effects on improving AGB estimation overall, but ANN can improve AGB modeling when AGB values are greater than 120 Mg/ha. (4) Forest type and AGB range are important factors that influence AGB modeling performance.

Although most patients with ACS are hospitalized explicitly for that reason, up to 36% of patients who were admitted for VOEs subsequently developed ACS, usually within several days of admission. Since ACS can be associated with hypoxemia and respiratory failure, leading to a need for blood transfusion and ventilatory support, the ability to predict which patients are at high risk for this serious complication might lead to better clinical outcomes. Using the results of standard-of-care blood testing obtained upon hospital admission, we present a novel model to predict the risk of developing ACS following hospitalization for a VOE. To generate this model, we retrospectively evaluated the records of 1,263 participants in the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), with either sickle cell anemia (with or without co-incident alpha thalassemia) or HbSC disease, who were hospitalized for an acute VOE. During their hospitalization, 148 of these patients developed ACS, defined in the CSSCD as a new pulmonary infiltrate on a chest x-ray or evidence of pleuritic chest pain, with or without dyspnea; the remaining patients, who did not develop ACS, served as controls. Case patients were aged 7 to 55 years, with a mean age of 23 years; control patients were aged 5 to 72 years with a mean age of 24.5 years. Males were slightly more likely to develop ACS; 56% of case patients were male, compared with 46% of control patients (OR 1.5, 1.05\u20132.10). There was a significant difference in the distribution of SCD genotype, with fewer patients with HbSC disease and sickle cell anemia-alpha thalassemia in the control group (p=0.002). For each patient, we included in the model the hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, white blood cell count with differential, and platelet count at hospital admission, along with their age, gender, and SCD genotype. Random Forest (RF) software, implemented in the R language, was used to create a set of 500 classification and regression trees using 80% of the subjects, and was then tested on the remaining 20%. For each test patient, each randomly generated decision tree classified the patient as high or low risk, and the consensus of the 500 tree forest was used to predict if the patient would develop ACS. This data driven approach produced a robust predictive model, while reducing analyst input and eliminating the need to identify important confounders a priori , as would be the case if attempting these analyses using stepwise logistic regression. The RF model correctly classified 95% of the patients for the development of ACS, with 67% sensitivity and 99% specificity. Neutrophil bands and platelet counts were identified by RF as the two most important predictors for the development of ACS, concordant with the potential roles of infection and infarction in its pathogenesis. With future validation, perhaps including prospective studies, this simple model, along with other predictors such as serum phospholipase A2 and studies of genetic modulators of this phenotype, could aid in identifying individuals who are at high risk for developing ACS. Ultimately, for patients hospitalized with VOEs, better identification of the risk of developing ACS might lead to more appropriate treatment with better clinical outcomes.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1182/blood.v110.11.3390.3390", "venue": null, "journal": "Blood", "mag_id": "2550086415", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:78524129"}

Based on the type of video the packets are classified as RTPS or nRTPS thereby providing differentiated QoS.

Savanna ecosystems are significant components of the global C cycle, covering about one fifth of the global land mass, but they have received less attention in C monitoring protocols. Our goal was to estimate C storage across a broad savanna ecosystem using field surveys and freely available satellite images. We first mapped tree canopies at 2.5 m resolution with a spatial subset of high resolution panchromatic images to then predict regional wall-to-wall tree percent cover using 30-m Landsat imagery and the Random Forests algorithms. We found that a model with summer and winter spectral indices from Landsat, climate and topography performed best. Using a linear relationship between C and % tree cover, we then predicted tree C stocks across the gradient of tree cover, explaining 87% of the variability. The spatially explicit validation of the tree C model with field-measured C-stocks revealed an RMSE of 8.2 tC/ha which represented ~ 30% of the mean C stock for areas with tree cover, comparable with studies based on more advanced remote sensing methods, such as LiDAR and RADAR. Sample spatial distribution highly affected the performance of the RF models in predicting tree cover, raising concerns regarding the predictive capabilities of the model in areas for which training data is not present. The 50,000 km 2 has ~ 41 Tg C, which could be released to the atmosphere if agricultural pressure intensifies in this semiarid savanna.

Various different statistical approaches to binary classification are available in the literature, such as logistic regression, linear or quadratic discriminant analysis and neural networks. Another method which have recently become popular is called Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1999). This technique seems to perform better in terms of prediction quality compared to the alternatives mentioned. Its optimization problem is well defined and can be solved through a quadratic programming (Groenen et al., 2008). Moreover, the classification rule SVMs provide is relatively simple and can be immediately used with new samples. However, a disadvantage is that the nonlinear SVM interpretation in terms of predictor variables is not always possible and that the standard dual formulation of SVM may be difficult to comprehend (Groenen et al., 2008). ::: This paper focuses on linear SVMs, specifically on the primal linear SVM problem. The primal formulation is used as it is easier to interpret, than a standard dual one. Groenen et al. (2008) formulates the SVM in terms of a loss function regularized by a penalty term. This formulation is called an SVM loss function with an absolute hinge error. Other researchers tackled similar SVM formulation using various methods. For example, Zhang (2004) and Bottou (2010) proposed a stochastic gradient descent method. In Collins et al. (2008) the exponential gradient search method is applied. In our paper we discuss an iterative majorization approach to minimizing the SVM loss function introduced by Groenen et al. (2008). Its advantage is that at each iteration of the algorithm we are guaranteed to decrease the loss value until convergence is reached. As the SVM loss function with an absolute hinge error is convex and coercive, iterative majorization converges to a global minimum after a sufficient number of iterations. ::: The main focus of our paper is the development of an original line search method for optimizing the SVM loss function \u2013 the Change Point Method (CPM). The great advantage of the CPM is that it is exact. We also combine the CPM with different search directions (e.g. majorization, coordinate descent) in order to create an efficient optimization method for solving SVM problems.

Indiana Ave., Bloomington, IN 47405-7000 In classical cognitive models, representations of inputs are deliberately built into the operational structure by a model\u2019s designers. Network systems by contrast usually automatically construct responses following some generic learning scheme, and consequently lack overt representations altogether. Instead, the system\u2019s representations are read off the system according to a chosen analytical methodology. The performance of such models is therefore independent of how their representations are labeled. Simple recurrent networks (SRNs) are among the most successful network models of cognition (Elman, 1990, 1995). These networks are often taken to represent inputs in the values of their hidden layer nodes, which can be analyzed using principal component analysis or hierarchical clustering. Under this interpretation, representations in networks are context-sensitive, static, and non- compositional. Significantly different properties result from taking as the representation of a sequence the function which that sequence causes the network to compute. Consider a typical SRN with input weights W in , output weights W out , and recurrent connections in the hidden layer with weight matrix C, and call the vector of weights in the hidden layer H. Let S denote the closure of the set of legal inputs to the network under concatenation, so that S contains all legal sequences (and also an empty input, e). Call the set of possible output vectors O, and call the function which maps input sequences to output vectors i:S AE O, so that i(s)=o exactly when o is the output resulting from running sequence s through the network. Consider the following function: if s = e h r ' ( s , h ) = \uf8f1 \uf8f2 r u Sigmoid C h W t if s = t . u in r\u2019 can be interpreted as the function which computes, for an initial value on the hidden layer, h, the value on the hidden layer which results after processing input sequence s. Define the family of functions which results from currying r r r\u2019 over s: r s ( h ) = r ' ( s , h ) , r s \u2208 R . Then R is the representation scheme of the SRN. i(s) can be easily reconstructed from r s . A straightforward homomorphism can be constructed between concatenation over S and function composition in R, making the representations of any SRN classically compositional, regardless of the prior training of the network (see Fodor & Lepore, 2002; Zadrozny, 1994). This analysis also reveals a limited form of inherent systematicity, in that the same representation function, and hence the same causal mechanism, is employed in processing a particular lexeme or sequence regardless of the context in which it appears (see Davies, 1991). If the computation specified by r s picks out a type of representation, then any particular application of that function can be taken to be a token. The computation performed is independent of its context, but the specific hidden layer value which results will not be. Therefore, tokens of computations can be picked out by specifying the input/output pair (where both input and output are hidden layer values) which that application involved. The method of hierarchical clustering which is so useful in analyzing hidden layer values can then be performed on this pair, and so this technique can be applied essentially unchanged. Additionally, the extra information stored in the source values allows the method to be applied to sequences as well as single inputs. Since these representations are the system\u2019s disposition to respond to a particular lexeme, rather than the residue of state information which results from that response, these representations are active processes rather than static data structures. Since the important Therefore, representations capture all of the knowledge which is involved in generating the internal state of the network. Because the representation scheme given here appropriately encapsulates an SRN\u2019s knowledge and presents representations as dynamic processes rather than static structures, it is intuitively appealing as a model for how SRNs represent. Inasmuch as it is appealing, SRNs represent compound phrases compositionally and context- independently, which implies that these properties may not account for some of the interesting properties with which they have been credited (Fodor & Lepore, 2002).

I NTRODUCTION For researchers and practitioners, modeling is an essential instrument to realize and improve system dynamics [1]. In physical modeling, similarity is used to simulate the real system. For example, an analog computer may be used to build something that behaves almost like the original system. However, to model a complicated engineering system, one must use different method, such as pure mathematical representation, as an analog computer representation would be huge and complicated [2]. Such mathematical representations can be found from fundamental principles, for instance: Newton\u2019s laws, Kirchhoff\u2019s laws, conservation laws, etc. However, this approach is inappropriate for complicated systems [3]. System identification, which is the science of deriving mathematical procedures that form a suitable mathematical model of a system from available input and output data, is good modeling candidate for complex systems. It has caught the attention of researchers and practitioners for many years [4], [5].

The first method is a two-stage process with a fuzzy-set theoretic (FST) approach to evaluation of the strengths of network links (or equivalently, actor-actor relationships) followed by a simple linear classifier to separate the actor classes. Since this method uses a lot of contextual information including actor profiles, actor-actor tweet and reply frequencies, it may be termed as a context-dependent approach. To handle the situation of limited availability of actor data for learning network link strengths, we also present a second method that performs actor classification by matching their short-term (say, roughly 25 days) tweet patterns with the generic tweet patterns of the prototype actors of different classes. Since little contextual information is used here, this can be called a context-independent approach. Our experimentation with over 500 randomly sampled records from a twitter database consists of 441,234 actors, 2,045,804 links, 6,481,900 tweets, and 2,312,927 total reply messages indicates that, in the context-independent analysis, a multilayer perceptron outperforms on both on classification accuracy and a new F-measure for classification performance, the Bayes classifier and Random Forest classifiers. However, as expected, the context-dependent analysis using link strengths evaluated using the FST approach in conjunction with some actor information reveals strong clustering of actor data based on their types, and hence can be considered as a superior approach when data available for training the system is abundant.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s13278-011-0017-9", "venue": "Social Network Analysis and Mining", "journal": "Social Network Analysis and Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1974570422", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11048511", "15420112", "29051307", "18515496", "1766526", "12427199", "16750484", "45729490", "1823590", "2341021", "681127", "2690560", "15001270", "2074078", "466762", "16666058", "14584794", "609178"], "inbound_citations": ["15156633", "2256429", "15077682", "9878059", "204867079", "15595105", "195848569", "13841235", "14593157", "32261617", "15737189", "12326887", "214589494", "15947266", "12220404", "14397556", "14728431", "3572635", "17372341", "16903916", "5288292", "3339274", "59061684", "8169206", "17013075", "5883842", "7317223", "2388777", "23760488", "11099037", "53082369", "18403036"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9699169"}

Despite tremendous progress in primary biometric traits (e.g., face and fingerprint) based person identification, a single biometric trait alone can not meet the desired recognition accuracy in forensic scenarios. Tattoos, as one of the important soft biometric traits, have been found to be valuable for assisting in person identification. However, tattoo search in a large collection of unconstrained images remains a difficult problem, and existing tattoo search methods mainly focus on matching cropped tattoos, which is different from real application scenarios. To close the gap, we propose an efficient tattoo search approach that is able to learn tattoo detection and compact representation jointly in a single convolutional neural network (CNN) via multi-task learning. While the features in the backbone network are shared by both tattoo detection and compact representation learning, individual latent layers of each sub-network optimize the shared features toward the detection and feature learning tasks, respectively. We resolve the small batch size issue inside the joint tattoo detection and compact representation learning network via random image stitch and preceding feature buffering. We evaluate the proposed tattoo search system using multiple public-domain tattoo benchmarks, and a gallery set with about 300K distracter tattoo images compiled from these datasets and images from the Internet. In addition, we also introduce a tattoo sketch dataset containing 300 tattoos for sketch-based tattoo search.

The detection of the brain malformations is currently performed by visual inspection of MRI images, making the diagnostic process sensible to the operator experience and subjectiveness. The method we propose addresses these problems by automatically reproducing the neuroradiologist\u2019s approach. One-class SVMs are appropriate to cope with heterogeneous brain abnormalities that are considered outliers. The MK framework allows to efficiently combine the different geometric features that can be used to describe brain structures. Moreover, the regularized discriminative direction analysis is exploited to highlight the specific malformative patterns for each patient. We performed two different experiments. Firstly, we tested the proposed method to detect the malformations of the corpus callosum on a 104 subject dataset. Results showed that the proposed pipeline can classify the subjects with an accuracy larger than 90% and that the discriminative direction analysis can highlight a wide range of malformative patterns (e.g., local, diffuse, and complex abnormalities). Secondly, we compared the diagnosis of four neuroradiologists on a dataset of 128 subjects. The diagnosis was performed both in blind condition and using the classifier and the discriminative direction outputs. Results showed that the use of the proposed pipeline as an assisted diagnosis tool improves the inter-subject variability of the diagnosis. Finally, a graphical representation of the discriminative direction analysis was proposed to enhance the interpretability of the results and provide the neuroradiologist with a tool to fully and clearly characterize the patient malformations at single-subject level.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27179447", "doi": "10.1016/j.media.2016.05.001", "venue": "Medical image analysis", "journal": "Medical image analysis", "mag_id": "2346366818", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31402603"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22817137"}

These new data are of great interest to map land cover thanks to the combination of the three high resolutions that will allow a depiction of scene dynamics. However, their efficient exploitation involves new challenges, especially for adapting traditional classification schemes to data complexity. More specifically, it requires: (1) to determine which classifier algorithms can handle the amount and the variability of data; (2) to evaluate the stability of classifier parameters; (3) to select the best feature set used as input data in order to find the good trade-off between classification accuracy and computational time; and (4) to establish the classifier accuracy over large areas. This work aims at studying these different issues, and more especially at demonstrating the ability of state-of-the-art classifiers, such as Random Forests (RF) or Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify HR-SITS. For this purpose, several studies are carried out by using SPOT-4 and Landsat-8 HR-SITS in the south of France. Firstly, the choice of the classifier is discussed by comparing RF and SVM algorithms on HR-SITS. Both classifiers show their ability to tackle the classification problem with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 83.3 % for RF and 77.1 % for SVM. But RF have some advantages such as a small training time, and an easy parameterization. Secondly, the stability of RF parameters is appraised. RF parameters appear to cause little influence on the classification accuracy, about 1% OA difference between the worst and the best parameter configuration. Thirdly, different input data \u2013 composed of spectral bands with or without spectral and/or temporal features \u2013 are proposed in order to enhance the characterization of land cover. The addition of features improves the classification accuracy, but the gain in OA is weak compared with the increase in the computational cost.

The underlying machine learning algorithms including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), K-NN Regression (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Lasso Regression models are adapted to compute a cumulative score in terms of influencer index. Findings indicate that engagement, outreach, sentiment, and growth play a key role in determining the influencers. Further, the ensemble of the four models resulted in the highest accuracy of 93.7% followed by the KNN regression with 93.6%.

However, most of the existing tracking algorithms cannot achieve satisfactory performance in both of the two aspects. To address this issue, in this paper, we advocate a novel and efficient visual tracker by exploiting the excellent feature learning and classification capabilities of an emerging learning technique, that is, extreme learning machine (ELM). The contributions of the proposed work are as follows: 1) motivated by the simplicity and learning ability of the ELM autoencoder (ELM-AE), an ELM-AE-based feature extraction model is presented, and this model can provide a compact and discriminative representation of the inputs efficiently and 2) due to the fast learning speed of an ELM classifier, an ELM-based appearance model is developed for feature classification, and is able to rapidly distinguish the object of interest from its surroundings. In addition, in order to cope with the visual changes of the target and its backgrounds, the online sequential ELM is used to incrementally update the appearance model.

Other life threatening complications of MetS include cardiovascular diseases (CVD), heart attack and stroke. It has also been shown that early screening and detection of people at risk may help in preventing or delaying MetS and its further complications.

The choice of the meta level classifier is based on different pairwise diversity measures. This is then followed by a final voting stage.

In recent years, several studies have suggested the association between changes in DNAm and its effect on human age. The high dimensional nature of this type of data significantly increases the execution time of modeling algorithms. To mitigate this problem, we propose a two-stage parallel algorithm for selection of age related CpG-sites. The algorithm first attempts to cluster the data into similar age ranges. In the next stage, a parallel genetic algorithm (PGA), based on the MapReduce paradigm (MR-based PGA), is used for selecting age-related features of each individual age range. In the proposed method, the execution of the algorithm for each age range (data parallel), the evaluation of chromosomes (task parallel) and the calculation of the fitness function (data parallel) are performed using a novel parallel framework. In this paper, we consider 16 different healthy DNAm datasets that are related to the human blood tissue and that contain the relevant age information. These datasets are combined into a single unioned set, which is in turn randomly divided into two sets of train and test data with a ratio of 7:3, respectively. We build a Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) model on the selected CpG-sites from the train set. To evaluate the model accuracy, we compared our results with state-of-the-art approaches that used these datasets, and observed that our method performs better on the unseen test dataset with a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of 3.62 years, and a correlation (R2) of 95.96% between age and DNAm. In the train data, the MAD and R2 are 1.27 years and 99.27%, respectively. Finally, we evaluate our method in terms of the effect of parallelization in computation time.

In this work, we propose to use a smooth approximation of the Wasserstein GANs. We show that this smooth approximation is close to the original objective. Moreover, obtaining gradient information of this approximate formulation is computationally effortless and hence one can easily apply first order optimization methods to optimize this objective. Based on this observation, we proposed a class of algorithms with guaranteed theoretical convergence to stationarity. Unlike the original non-smooth objective, our proposed algorithm only requires solving the discriminator to approximate optimality.

It usually begins with questionnaire surveys to collect customer affective demands and responses. However, this process is expensive, which can only be conducted periodically in a small scale.

However, the existing studies focus on the polarity classification from a single perspective (such as positive and negative). The classification of multiple affective attributes receives less attention. In this paper, 3-class classifications of four different affective attributes (i.e. Soft-Hard, Appealing-Unappealing, Handy-Bulky, and Reliable-Shoddy) are performed by using two classical machine learning algorithms (i.e. Softmax regression and Support Vector Machine) and two deep learning methods (i.e. Restricted Boltzmann machines and Deep Belief Network) on an Amazon dataset.

As a result of this, the task of idea detection is broken down to problem and solution extraction. The task of idea extraction is similar to Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the problems and solutions may be seen as special entities. These techniques worked well although the results contained a lot of noise that need to be removed. ::: ::: Automatic idea generation was conducted using a dataset from the Journal of Science. Old ideas were defined as the existing pairs in the same abstract and new ideas were generated by predicting new links between problems and solutions that do not occur together in one abstract. Evaluation was performed using metrics that are widely used in information retrieval. The F1 scores (higher than 0.90) provides good evidence that the proposed method is capable of generating useful ideas. ::: ::: A ground truth data set that contained pairs was constructed from the publications of the International Conference on Neural Information Pro-cessing Systems and the Journal of Machine Learning Research. This data was annotated by human volunteers, and it was used for training idea detection models using Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Long-short Term Memory (LSTM). To evaluate the performance of the models, the precision and recall were computed. ::: ::: Idea analysis was studied by analyzing citations, which are considered to be containers for ideas.

Normally posed as optimisation problems, our interest is in problems that have the following characteristics: (a) optimal, or even near-optimal solutions are very rare; (b) it is expensive to obtain the value of the objective function for large numbers of data instances; and (c) there is domain knowledge in the form of experience, rules-of-thumb, constraints and the like, which is difficult to translate into the usual constraints for numerical optimisation procedures. Here we investigate the use of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to construct models within a procedure that progressively attempts to increase the number of near-optimal solutions. Using ILP in this manner requires a change in focus from discriminatory models (the usual staple for ILP) to generative models. Using controlled datasets, we investigate the use of probability-sampling of solutions based on the estimated cost of clauses found using ILP. Specifically, we compare the results obtained against: (a) simple random sampling; and (b) generative deep network models that use a low-level encoding and automatically construct higher-level features. Our results suggest: (1) Against each of the alternatives, probability-sampling from ILP-constructed models contain more near-optimal solutions; (2) The key to the effectiveness of ILP-constructed models is the availability of domain knowledge. We also demonstrate the use of ILP in this manner on two real-world problems from the area of drug-design (predicting solubility and binding affinity), using domain knowledge of chemical ring structures and functional groups. Taken together, our results suggest that generative modelling using ILP can be very effective for optimisation problems where: (a) the number of training instances to be used is restricted, and (b) there is domain knowledge relevant to low-cost solutions.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10994-019-05842-x", "venue": "Machine Learning", "journal": "Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2983807605", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["2351818", "26530550", "37584572", "53809290", "15956928", "52079369", "6126501", "41254749", "3166992", "18401632", "1143258", "1033682", "12183969", "29828273", "13636806", "15772014", "7523281", "16721087", "16762143", "15675979", "195863448", "15781700", "11139077", "10621079", "30760189", "447738", "40420741", "704994", "9220714", "39944625", "22386810", "15982740"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207988508"}

Learners' on-task effort has been acknowledged for strongly relating to their educational outcomes, reflecting how actively they are engaged in that activity. However, effort is not directly observable. Multimodal data can provide additional insights into the learning processes and may allow for effort estimation. This paper presents an approach for the classification of effort in an adaptive assessment context. Specifically, the behaviour of 32 students was captured during an adaptive self-assessment activity, using logs and physiological data (i.e., eye-tracking, EEG, wristband and facial expressions). We applied k-means to the multimodal data to cluster students' behavioural patterns. Next, we predicted students' effort to complete the upcoming task, based on the discovered behavioural patterns using a combination of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and the Viterbi algorithm. We also compared the results with other state-of-the-art classification algorithms (SVM, Random Forest). Our findings provide evidence that HMMs can encode the relationship between effort and behaviour (captured by the multimodal data) in a more efficient way than the other methods. Foremost, a practical implication of the approach is that the derived HMMs also pinpoint the moments to provide preventive/prescriptive feedback to the learners in real-time, by building-upon the relationship between behavioural patterns and the effort the learners are putting in.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3375462.3375498", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3011751567", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["54437981", "16506546", "39857214", "144856389", "6405472", "9456756", "7857667", "3474321", "6105732", "29454518", "1574588", "3450463", "42719854", "17835858", "14223188", "6038763", "7187573", "30721345", "39702234", "19003018", "142574268", "1900253", "6009318", "10344554", "82236", "722222", "14661353", "31014895", "142734630", "42180477", "17240286", "2295041", "46924288", "19177803", "27572397", "14391082", "9673362", "207247552", "1073471", "67870631", "6717286", "59336181", "27036795", "22205637", "43690125", "86614828", "40536687", "17722903", "206930890", "51868129", "10611409", "14408340", "121553584", "517240", "16457542", "17360785", "145503373", "143162808", "141929902", "15120295"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212688153"}

Firstly, the basic principle of estimating the concentration of suspended sediment is detailed, and some main influence factors are analyzed.

Conventional approaches to this problem usually involves two steps: i) projecting samples from different domains into a common space, and ii) computing (dis-)similarity in this space based on a certain distance. In this paper, we present a novel pairwise similarity measure that advances existing models by i) expanding traditional linear projections into affine transformations and ii) fusing affine Mahalanobis distance and Cosine similarity by a data-driven combination. Moreover, we unify our similarity measure with feature representation learning via deep convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we incorporate the similarity measure matrix into the deep architecture, enabling an end-to-end way of model optimization. We extensively evaluate our generalized similarity model in several challenging cross-domain matching tasks: person re-identification under different views and face verification over different modalities (i.e., faces from still images and videos, older and younger faces, and sketch and photo portraits). The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of our model over other state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1605.04039", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27187945", "doi": "10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2567386", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2353169560", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["202473", "324005", "13536642", "1345207", "5942627", "14306093", "4962044", "3139626", "464387", "7166661", "26346530", "14737860", "2145760", "1658229", "16594465", "14634330", "15772353", "41312633", "195908774", "56507745", "1395439", "3043202", "12148694", "206593071", "17569238", "2495132", "938105", "3732882", "2316457", "207323040", "4269137", "21440926", "16458", "31281854", "17485723", "17510114", "15225312", "13417115", "47325215", "11464769", "7973738", "10070153", "11864530", "14942230", "16908656", "125018302", "27871", "5785086", "2814088", "682896", "7883766", "14204872", "5874434", "64350183", "15981452", "15309809"], "inbound_citations": ["197661430", "23293907", "209320250", "53082028", "196621849", "210931908", "212704632", "204900919", "102352528", "14536072", "202564995", "4796796", "102352688", "70051021", "52191447", "211548858", "9338669", "4663111", "204837634", "52057446", "53700018", "202095954", "51717429", "198171988", "197677814", "131773768", "195886226", "208109823", "53081897", "4951598", "53082787", "53319653", "543326", "164386501", "135464932", "202699290", "53250057", "204836990", "85515321", "52157304", "52954446", "11452840", "30700911", "155106639", "3606040", "9759547", "58672045", "69527867", "10834713", "208547724", "32343257", "204824181", "54439906", "59620002", "49870158", "67176071", "128356924", "54464253", "90258566", "53081729", "59336318", "19231802", "211006248", "19100902"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1217966"}

However, how to extract critical spatial\u2013temporal features from wide-area system stability dynamics still remains an open issue. Emphasizing on short-term voltage stability (SVS) assessment, this paper develops a novel sequential feature learning approach to address this problem in two steps. First, based on visualized voltage contours, it tactfully constructs a comprehensive spatial\u2013temporal sequence model to dynamically characterize multiplex spatial\u2013temporal SVS evolution trends.

In this paper, we simultaneously address these challenges by proposing a new Determinantal Point Processes based loss function for probabilistic modeling of diversity and quality. With this new loss function, we develop a variant of the Generative Adversarial Network, named \"Performance Augmented Diverse Generative Adversarial Network\" or PaDGAN, which can generate novel high-quality designs with good coverage of the design space. We demonstrate that PaDGAN can generate diverse and high-quality designs on both synthetic and real-world examples and compare PaDGAN against other models such as the vanilla GAN and the BezierGAN. Unlike typical generative models that usually generate new designs by interpolating within the boundary of training data, we show that PaDGAN expands the design space boundary towards high-quality regions.

An SVM is associated with each cell in a recursive partitioning of the space of patterns (hypotheses) into increasingly finer subsets. The hierarchy is traversed coarse-to-fine and each chain of positive responses from the root to a leaf constitutes a detection. Our objective is to design and build a network which balances overall error and computation. ::: ::: Initially, SVMs are constructed for each cell with no constraints. This \"free network\" is then perturbed, cell by cell, into another network, which is \"graded\" in two ways: first, the number of support vectors of each SVM is reduced (by clustering) in order to adjust to a pre-determined, increasing function of cell depth; second, the decision boundaries are shifted to preserve all positive responses from the original set of training data. The limits on the numbers of clusters (virtual support vectors) result from minimizing the mean computational cost of collecting all detections subject to a bound on the expected number of false positives. ::: ::: When applied to detecting faces in cluttered scenes, the patterns correspond to poses and the free network is already faster and more accurate than applying a single pose-specific SVM many times.

Growing number of remote sensing satellites are making it easier to map the crop areas in a rapid and cost-effective way. Grape being an commercial fruit crop of India, it is useful to map the grape areas for acreage estimation and monitor its health continuously to get optimum yield. The main contribution of this paper is mapping areas under export and non-export grapes and their health estimation based on hybrid classification-clustering approach using Sentinel-2 satellite data. Nashik district of Maharashtra, India was chosen as study area which is known to be a famous grape belt. We have used Sentinel-2 image of 31st December 2016 to carry out the classification. Two step classification approach have been followed wherein first step involves classification of grape and non-grape areas using broadband spectral features. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and Tasseled Crop Transformation (TCT) components viz. Brightness (BR), Greenness (GR) and Wetness (WT) estimated using Sentinel-2 data and slope estimated from ASTER DEM were used during the first step. We evaluate the performance of classifiers such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Result shows RF performs best among all classifiers with overall classification accuracy of 93.57 % on validation dataset. Further, comparison of grape areas estimated using our proposed approach with statistics obtained from district agriculture department shows deviation of only 1.84 % in the total grape area. Second step involves classification of export and non-export grapes. Texture features such as entropy, homogeneity and dissimilarity estimated from red-edge bands (Bands 5,6,7) of sentinel-2 have been fed as an input to the same set of classifiers. Results depict the maximum classification accuracy of 81.82 % using RF classifier. Further, estimated export grape area was compared with district agriculture statistics which shows the deviation of 7.98 %. It is also important to monitor the crop health continuously to get the better yield and returns. We have further carried out the health estimation of non-export grape areas. The objective was to get the clusters of healthy, low stressed and high stressed grape areas. ISODATA clustering has been carried out using the indices such as Difference Vegetation Index (DVI), Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index (IRECI) and NDVI45, Red-Edge Position (REP) and NDVI. Comparison of clusters with ground truth yield data of 31 fields shows that the fields with high stress have obtained lesser yields than others.

This paper explores to what extent predictive models can be used to predict network traffic, what protocols are tunneled in the DNS protocol and more specifically whether the predictive performance is enhanced when analyzing DNS-queries and responses together and which feature set that can be used for DNS-tunneled network prediction. The tested protocols are SSH, SFTP and Telnet and the machine learning models used are Multi Layered Perceptron and Random Forests. To train the models we extract the IP Packet length, Name length and Name entropy of both the queries and responses in the DNS traffic. With an experimental research strategy it is empirically shown that the performance of the models increases when training the models on the query and respose pairs rather than using only queries or responses.

However, it is disadvantageous that deep learning methods require a large number of labeled images as a training dataset to adjust its deep neural networks. In this paper, in order to apply the deep learning method to rat behavior observation, we adopted two transfer learning methods to reduce dataset and realized detecting rats in various environments without any intrusive devices or markers. In addition, with the help of track by detection method, we have completed the long-term tracking of multiple rats.

Stilp and colleagues recently reported efficient coding of robust correlation (r = .97) among complex acoustic attributes (attack/decay, spectral shape) in novel sounds. Discrimination of sounds orthogonal to the correlation was initially inferior but later comparable to that of sounds obeying the correlation. These effects were attenuated for less-correlated stimuli (r = .54) for reasons that are unclear. Here, statistical properties of correlation among acoustic attributes essential for perceptual organization are investigated. Overall, simple strength of the principal correlation is inadequate to predict listener performance. Initial superiority of discrimination for statistically consistent sound pairs was relatively insensitive to decreased physical acoustic/psychoacoustic range of evidence supporting the correlation, and to more frequent presentations of the same orthogonal test pairs.

CTG is frequently used for assisting the obstetricians to obtain detailed physiological information of fetal and pregnant woman as a technique of diagnosing fetal well-being. However, the visual analysis of the CTG traces requires a high level of expertise of the obstetricians and can cause inter- and intra-observer variability. Therefore, this research aimed at realizing a clinical decision support system for diagnosing fetal risk through advanced machine learning method applied to relevant features extracted from CTG recordings. In this paper, a CTG dataset consisting of 2126 recordings and 21 features obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository is used for classification. After selecting more relevant features from total features based on Principle Component Analysis (PCA), data are trained and tested through Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm integrated with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to obtain a strong classifier for classifying the unknown CTG data and predicting the fetal state. Fetal state is divided into two classes as normal and pathological.

Examples of symbolic data patterns occur in modelling natural (human) language, while the prediction of water level of River Thames is an example of processing non-symbolic data. If the content of a sequence will be varying through different time steps, the sequence is called temporal or time-series. In general, a temporal sequence consists of nominal symbols from a particular alphabet, while a time-series sequence deals with continuous, real-valued elements (Antunes & Oliverira, 2001). Processing both these sequences mainly consists of applying the current known patterns to produce or predict the future ones, while a major difficulty is that the range of data dependencies is usually unknown. Therefore, an intelligent system with memorising capability is crucial for effective sequence processing and modelling. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is an artificial neural network in which self-loop and backward connections between nodes are allowed (Lin & Lee 1996; Schalkoff, 1997). Comparing to feedforward neural networks, RNNs are well-known for their power to memorise time dependencies and model nonlinear systems. RNNs can be trained from examples to map input sequences to output sequences and in principle they can implement any kind of sequential behaviour. They are biologically more plausible and computationally more powerful than other modelling approaches, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which have non-continuous internal states, feedforward neural networks and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which do not have internal states at all.

The two-stage hybrid algorithms adopt Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a classification tool, and the extended Sequential Forward Search (SFS), Sequential Forward Floating Search (SFFS), and Sequential Backward Floating Search (SBFS), respectively, as search strategies, and the generalized F-score (GF) to evaluate the importance of each feature. The new accuracy measure is used as the criterion to evaluated the performance of a temporary SVM to direct the feature selection algorithms. These hybrid methods combine the advantages of filters and wrappers to select the optimal feature subset from the original feature set to build the stable and efficient classifiers. To get the stable, statistical and optimal classifiers, we conduct 10-fold cross validation experiments in the first stage; then we merge the 10 selected feature subsets of the 10-cross validation experiments, respectively, as the new full feature set to do feature selection in the second stage for each algorithm.

This study focused on prediction of Jamu efficacy based on its component metabolites and also identification of important metabolites related to each efficacy group. Initially, we compared the performance of Support Vector Machines and Random Forest to predict the Jamu efficacy with three different data pre-processing approaches, such as no filtering, Single Filtering algorithm, and a combination of Single Filtering algorithm and feature selection using Regularized Random Forest. Both classifiers performed very well and according to 5-fold cross-validation results, the mean accuracy of Support Vector Machine with linear kernel was slightly better than Random Forest.

The first stage of this research start with the development of mathematical model of the process. The sub-models for monomer concentration, polymerization rate, reactor temperature and jacket outlet/inlet temperature are developed and implemented in Matlab/Simulink. ::: Four conventional control methods were applied to the reactor: a Proportional \u2013Integral-Derivative (PID), Cascade control (CCs), Linear-Quadratic-Regulator (LQR), and Linear model predictive control (LMPC). The simulation results show that the PID controller is unable to perform satisfactorily due to the change of physical properties unless constant re-tuning takes place. Also, Cascade Control the most common control method used in such processes cannot guarantee a robust performance under varying disturbance and system uncertainty. In addition, LQR and linear MPC methods lead to better results compared with the previous two methods. But it is still under an assumption of the linearized plant. ::: Three advanced neural network based control schemes are also proposed in this thesis: radial basis function RBF neural network inverse model based feedforward-feedback control scheme, RBF based model predictive control and multi-layer perception (MLP) based model predictive control. The major objective of these control schemes is to maintain the reactor temperature within its tolerance range under disturbances and system uncertainty. Satisfactory control performance in terms of effective regulation and robustness to disturbance have been achieved. ::: In the feedforward-feedback control scheme, a neural network model is used to predict reactor temperature. Then, a neural network inverse model is used to estimate the valve position of the reactor, the manipulated variable. This method can identify the ::: controlled system with the RBF neural network identifier. A PID controller is used in the feedback control to regulate the actual temperature by compensating the neural network inverse model output. Simulation results show that the proposed control has strong adaptability, robustness and satisfactory control performance. These advanced methods achieved the much improved control performance compared with conventional control schemes. ::: The main contribution of this research lies in the following aspects. The MPC theory is realised to control Chylla-Haase polymerization reactor. Two adaptive reactor models including the RBF network model and MLP model are developed to predict the multiple-step-ahead values of the reactor output. Their modelling ability is compared with that of the models with fixed parameters and proven to be better. The RBF neural network and the MLP is trained by the recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm and is used to model parameter uncertainty in nonlinear dynamics of the Chylla-Haase reactor. The predictive control strategy based on the RBF neural network is applied to achieve set-point tracking of the reactor output against disturbances. The result shows that the RBF based model predictive control gives reliable result in the presence of some disturbances and keeps the reactor temperature within a tight tolerance range around the specified reaction temperature. ::: Moreover, RBF neural network based model predictive control strategy has also been used to reduce the batch time in order to shorten the reaction period.

However, the selection of a region of interest can be arbitrary and operator dependent. We hypothesize that segmenting the entire adrenal gland automatically without any human intervention and then performing a histogram analysis can accurately detect adrenal abnormality. We use the random forest classification framework to automatically perform a pixel-wise classification of an entire CT volume (abdomen and pelvis) into three classes namely right adrenal, left adrenal, and background.

It is a feedforward network typified by the use of beta function as a hidden activation function. Beta is a flexible transfer function representing richer forms than the common existing functions. As in every network, the architecture setting as well as the learning method are two main gauntlets faced by BBFNN. In this paper, new architecture and training algorithm are proposed for the BBFNN. An Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used as a training approach of BBFNN with the aim of quickening the training process. The peculiarity of ELM is permitting a certain decrement of the computing time and complexity regarding the already used BBFNN learning algorithms such as backpropagation, OLS, etc. For the architectural design, a recurrent structure is added to the common BBFNN architecture in order to make it more able to deal with complex, non linear and time varying problems. Throughout this paper, the conceived recurrent ELM-trained BBFNN is tested on a number of tasks related to time series prediction, classification and regression. Experimental results show noticeable achievements of the proposed network compared to common feedforward and recurrent networks trained by ELM and using hyperbolic tangent as activation function. These achievements are in terms of accuracy and robustness against data breakdowns such as noise signals.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1810.13135", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2898665415", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["8495923", "5916602", "1355449", "4553097", "61728732", "8106850", "23471456", "13153986", "7363014", "10793681", "2585025", "14800382", "18902646", "10083530", "118945415", "923721", "17185869", "14800382", "14670662", "3570420", "25890860", "33268876", "44659280", "46213642", "56677554", "664307", "52175280", "12997513", "53046647", "5784600", "5516512", "16495655", "26262247", "8740155", "38112998", "27951717", "67172378", "16742971", "1301524", "33267763", "21727099", "17517700", "8715388", "14865930", "5039396", "12956797", "8796963", "45325140", "45325140", "14413332", "14345934", "8796963", "10306709", "10081660", "29841402", "205459585", "42673093", "15361478"], "inbound_citations": ["210943087", "209324226"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53109729"}

We then develop the first graph-to-sequence neural network system for program equivalence, trained to produce such rewrite sequences from a carefully crafted automatic example generation algorithm. We extensively evaluate our system on a rich multi-type linear algebra expression language, using arbitrary combinations of 100+ graph-rewriting axioms of equivalence. Our system outputs via inference a correct rewrite sequence for 96% of the 10,000 program pairs isolated for testing, using 30-term programs.

The proposed method is based on variables concerning: 1) the s.c. glucose profile; 2) the plasma insulin concentration; 3) the appearance of meal-derived glucose in the systemic circulation; and 4) the energy expenditure during physical activities. Six cases corresponding to different combinations of the aforementioned variables are used to investigate the influence of the input on the daily glucose prediction.

However, existing learning algorithms are slow, particularly in problems with large numbers of potential input features and feature combinations. This paper describes a new algorithm for training CRFs via gradient tree boosting. In tree boosting, the CRF potential functions are represented as weighted sums of regression trees, which provide compact representations of feature interactions. So the algorithm does not explicitly consider the potentially large parameter space. As a result, gradient tree boosting scales linearly in the order of the Markov model and in the order of the feature interactions, rather than exponentially as in previous algorithms based on iterative scaling and gradient descent. Gradient tree boosting also makes it possible to use instance weighting (as in C4.5) and surrogate splitting (as in CART) to handle missing values. Experimental studies of the effectiveness of these two methods (as well as standard imputation and indicator feature methods) show that instance weighting is the best method in most cases when feature values are missing at random.", "year": 1985, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ICGA", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2119259314", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["91176244", "9699301", "42087677", "9677111", "1836349", "7955044", "14723701", "120489597", "118635048", "277918", "1713791", "9966171", "775373", "59921147", "15403132", "5262555", "13618539", "5914287", "12926318", "13936575", "7052609", "201720", "564746", "1978101"], "inbound_citations": ["13848337", "7276930", "209459160", "210334894", "8627261", "4886726", "1943162", "16721936", "197641019", "16969557", "17770291", "17046933", "5707067", "728742", "26069779", "54441529"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6248266"}

Classification models are useful tools that can help for such prediction. Classification models can classify program modules into quality-based classes, e.g. fault-prone (fp) or not-fault-prone (nfp). This facilitates the allocation of limited project resources. For example, more resources are assigned to program modules that are of poor quality or likely to have a high number of faults based on the classification. However, two main problems, high dimensionality and class imbalance, affect the quality of training datasets and therefore classification models. Feature selection and data sampling are often used to overcome these problems. Feature selection is a process of choosing the most important attributes from the original dataset. Data sampling alters the dataset to change its balance level. Another technique, called boosting (building multiple models, with each model tuned to work better on instances misclassified by previous models), is found to also be effective for resolving the class imbalance problem. In this study, we investigate an approach for combining feature selection with this ensemble learning (boosting) process. We focus on two different scenarios: feature selection performed prior to the boosting process and feature selection performed inside the boosting process. Ten individual base feature ranking techniques, as well as an ensemble ranker based on the ten, are examined and compared over the two scenarios. We also employ the boosting algorithm to construct classification models without performing feature selection and use the results as the baseline for further comparison. The experimental results demonstrate that feature selection is important and needed prior to the learning process. In addition, the ensemble feature ranking method generally has better or similar performance than the average of the base ranking techniques, and more importantly, the ensemble method exhibits better robustness than most base ranking techniques. As for the two scenarios, the results show that applying feature selection inside boosting performs better than using feature selection prior to boosting.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1142/S0218194015400069", "venue": "International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering", "journal": "International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering", "mag_id": "2252970823", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:29539335"}

The state space of these problems consists of regions that lie near class separation boundaries and require the construction of complex discriminants while for the rest regions the classification task is significantly simpler. The motivation for developing the Supervised Network Self-Organizing Map (SNet-SOM) model is to exploit this fact for designing computationally effective solutions. Specifically, the SNet-SOM utilizes unsupervised learning for classifying at the simple regions and supervised learning for the difficult ones in a two stage learning process. The unsupervised learning approach is based on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) of Kohonen. The basic SOM is modified with a dynamic node insertion/deletion process controlled with an entropy based criterion that allows an adaptive extension of the SOM. This extension proceeds until the total number of training patterns that are mapped to neurons with high entropy (and therefore with ambiguous classification) reduces to a size manageable numerically with a capable supervised model. The second learning phase (the supervised training) has the objective of constructing better decision boundaries at the ambiguous regions. At this phase, a special supervised network is trained for the computationally reduced task of performing the classification at the ambiguous regions only.

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods can utilize both labeled and unlabeled data to improve performance over supervised approaches. However, it has been reported that the unlabeled data may undermine the performance of SSL in some cases. To improve the safety of SSL, we proposed a new safety-control mechanism by analyzing the differences between unlabeled data analysis in supervised and semi-supervised learning. We then develop and implement a safe classification method based on the semi-supervised extreme learning machine (SS-ELM). Following this approach, the Wasserstein distance is used to measure the similarities between the predictions obtained from ELM and SS-ELM algorithms, and a different risk degree is thereby calculated for each unlabeled data instance. A risk-based regularization term is then constructed and embedded into the objective function of the SS-ELM. Extensive experiments were conducted using benchmark and EEG datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the performance of the new algorithm is comparable to SS-ELM and superior to ELM on average.

These feature functions are defined as dissimilarity measures between the audio observations and template vectors corresponding to the score. By expressing the template construction as a linear mapping from the symbolic to the audio representation, one can learn the feature functions by optimizing the linear transformation. In this paper, we explore two different learning strategies. The first one uses a best-fit criterion (minimum divergence), while the second one exploits a discriminative framework based on a Conditional Random Fields model (maximum likelihood criterion). We evaluate the influence of the feature functions in an audio-to-score alignment task, on a large database of popular and classical polyphonic music. The results show that with several types of models, using different temporal constraints, the learned mappings have the potential to outperform the classic heuristic mappings. Several representations of the audio observations, along with several distance functions are compared in this alignment task. Our experiments elect the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence.

During the 1999-2013 period, time series of spruce beetle activity were highly spatially correlated (r > 0.5) at distances <5 km, but remained weakly correlated (r = 0.08) at distances >400 km. Furthermore, cluster analysis on time series of outbreak activity revealed the outbreak developed at multiple incipient locations and spread to unaffected forest, highlighting the importance of both local-scale dispersal and regional-scale drivers in synchronizing spruce beetle outbreak. Spatial overlay analysis and Random Forest modeling of outbreak development show that outbreaks initiate in areas characterized by summer, winter, and multi-year drought and that outbreak spread is strongly linked to the proximity and extent of nearby outbreak, but remains associated with drought. Notably, we find that spruce beetle outbreak is associated with low peak snow water equivalent, not just summer drought.

Their flexibility and versatility has enabled researchers to propose many different designs to process remote sensing data in all spectral, spatial, and temporal dimensions. In most of the reported cases they surpass their non-deep rivals in overall classification accuracy. However, there is considerable diversity in implementation details in each case and a systematic quantitative comparison to non-deep classifiers does not exist. In this paper, we look at the major research papers that have studied deep learning image classifiers in recent years and undertake a meta-analysis on their performance compared to the most used non-deep rival, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. We focus on mono-temporal classification as the time-series image classification did not offer sufficient samples. Our work covered 103 manuscripts and included 92 cases that supported direct accuracy comparisons between deep learners and SVMs. Our general findings are the following: (i) Deep networks have better performance than non-deep spectral SVM implementations, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) performing better than other deep learners. This advantage, however, diminishes when feeding SVM with richer features extracted from data (e.g. spatial filters). (ii) Transfer learning and fine-tuning on pre-trained CNNs are offering promising results over spectral or enhanced SVM, however these pre-trained networks are currently limited to RGB input data, therefore currently lack applicability in multi/hyperspectral data. (iii) There is no strong relationship between network complexity and accuracy gains over SVM; small to medium networks perform similarly to more complex networks. (iv) Contrary to the popular belief, there are numerous cases of high deep networks performance with training proportions of 10% or less. Our study also indicates that the new generation of classifiers is often overperforming existing benchmark datasets, with accuracies surpassing 99%. There is a clear need for new benchmark dataset collections with diverse spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions and coverage that will enable us to study the design generalizations, challenge these new classifiers, and further advance remote sensing science.

Understanding the mysteries of this phenomena is a very fascinating fundamental theoretical problem. Many studies are devoted to explaining it from statistical view and margin theory. In this paper, we illustrate it from feature learning viewpoint, and propose the AdaBoost+SVM algorithm, which can explain the resistant to overfitting of AdaBoost directly and easily to understand. Firstly, we adopt the AdaBoost algorithm to learn the base classifiers.

With this, the new coefficient and bias can be obtained, which can be used to construct the final classifier.

FSVM's ability to absorb outliers strongly depends on how well the training samples are assigned fuzzy membership values (MVs). Traditionally, the membership functions (MFs) used for the FSVM were custom made for applications, and MFs used for one could, in general, not be used for others. To overcome this, general purpose membership functions (GPMFs) are defined in this paper as those MFs that can universally be used for multiple applications and statistically perform better than $C$ -SVM. This paper contributes to the GPMF literature in two stages. This paper first with the help of convex hulls presents limitations that the FSVM faces while treating all samples of a class with a single MF, and recommends differential treatment to data by dividing them into two fuzzy sets: one containing possible nonoutliers and the other containing possible outliers. While possible outliers are modeled with a normal MF, possible nonoutliers are recommended to have a constant MV of \u201c1.\u201d Subsequently, this paper introduces novel GPMFs that use clustering techniques to recognize possible outliers, and use set measures like the Hausdorff distance and pt-set distance for defining new MF heuristics. To establish conclusions, the introduced GPMFs are thoroughly evaluated and statistically compared with earlier GPMFs on 15 real-world benchmark datasets.

Finally, we propose a novel Multiple Kernel Support Vector Machine (MKSVM) classifier based on Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to integrate five kernels for identifying membrane proteins. For the performance evaluation, our method is tested on four benchmark datasets of membrane proteins. The comparative results demonstrate that our prediction model achieves the best performance among all existing outstanding approaches.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2019.11.103", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2996404781", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211158387"}

This allows the adjustment of process variables if process disturbances or set point tendencies arise that differ from desired values. Analytical methods based on near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric methods have been used as a tool for process analytical chemistry (PAC). This approach can provide useful information about sample composition at petroleum refineries because the various petroleum fractions and their physico-chemical characteristics are associated with different proportions of n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, cycloalkanes and aromatic compounds present in the fractions. Near infrared spectroscopy is able to distinguish between different contents of C\u2013H bonds of methyl and methylene groups present in these compounds together with N\u2013H, S\u2013H and O\u2013H bonds present in minor quantities. The partial least squares (PLS) algorithm is the one most commonly used in multivariate calibration model development. PLS is a linear method that can model some degree of non-linearity using an appropriate number of latent variables. However, certain applications of the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm have been shown to produce results better than those obtained by PLS. Feedstocks for petroleum refineries are often from different geographic regions and possess quite different characteristics. Likewise, petroleum fractions used in the production of derivatives may vary their characteristic properties over a wide range. It is difficult to include in a calibration model all the variability which may occur in practice in the refining process by means of experimental design and, moreover, complex mixtures such as petroleum fractions may not have a linear relationship with the parameter under study. For these reasons, it becomes necessary to use analytical methods that can provide non-linear calibration models with low prediction errors even for samples which have not been included in the calibration analytical range. One such method uses the SVM algorithm; it is based on statistical learning theory and can provide non-linear calibration models with high generalisation performance. These features make SVM an attractive option for the development of calibration models more effective for on-line analysis of petroleum, petroleum fractions and petroleum derivatives at petroleum refineries. The SVM algorithm was originally developed to solve pattern recognition problems and was subsequently extended to handle regression problems. Support vector machines for classification or support vector classification (SVC) simultaneously minimises the empirical error of classification and maximises the separation margin between classes using an optimal separation hyperplane, leading to a unique solution. One of the major features of SVC models is that they can operate in a kernelinduced feature space allowing non-linear modeling while good generalisation performance can be obtained even with relatively small datasets. These characteristics mean that SVC can provide a better classification performance than linear classification algorithms such as soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA). To deal with regression problems, a modification of the classification algorithm was performed; in support vector regression (SVR), the use of the e-insensitive loss function that limits regression errors and penalises deviations beyond the adjusted limit during model development, helps ensure good performance. Key steps in SVC and SVR model development are the parametric optimisation and appropriate choice of the kernel function. This work reports the performance of SVM applied to NIR spectroscopy data for (1) development of regression and classification models for on-line analysis of petroleum fraction streams and diesel oil at a refinery and (2) compares the SVM predicted results with corresponding data produced by SIMCA and PLS methods.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1255/nirn.1338", "venue": null, "journal": "NIR News", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2316735974", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": ["99497947", "206787478", "95719113", "95946375", "62233193", "15480929"], "inbound_citations": ["93957704"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:101098464"}

The optic disc region has been localized from the enhanced image. Structural deformation of the optic disc region, one of the primary indicators of the glaucoma demands more accuracy in segmentation process. As a solution to this problem, non-morphological features are extracted from the enhanced optic disc region. The non-morphological features from spatial domain include Local Binary Pattern, Histogram of Oriented Gradient and Fractal features. The significant feature extracted from the spatial domain are selected using Sequential Floating Forward Selection method and are then fed into the Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers. Performance of the classifier is analyzed by computing the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and positive prediction value. The performance of the classifier is also validated using the receiver operating characteristics plot. The hybrid feature from the spatial domain contributes to increase the efficiency of classification.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11042-019-08249-x", "venue": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "journal": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2980431239", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206522799", "60175", "3878400", "7399363", "12549719", "5984881", "8997413", "63496843", "14779650", "17944708", "1695342", "209144834", "17265568", "33968795", "16157847", "17435763", "7202330", "37813983", "8192507", "15062925", "18557488", "9148814", "17295552", "17889090", "9766683", "46942940", "9134575", "8430297", "209274431", "32198195", "27724560", "64123028", "40782152", "29553360", "121294527", "2580033", "37947659", "25586294"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204799807"}

These studies were not able to answer the question why a particular city favors LEED. However, in this paper, three commonly used machine learning algorithms \u2013 Linear Regression, Locally Weighted Regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR) \u2013 are compared and SVR is used to investigate, discover and evaluate the variables that could influence LEED building markets in U.S. East Coast cities. Machine learning models are first created and optimized with the features of city geography, demography, economy, higher education and policy. Then SVR model identifies the key factors by dynamic self-training and model-tuning using the dataset. Via optimization, the correlation coefficient between the model's prediction and actual value is 0.79. The result suggests that population and policy can be important factors for developing LEED buildings.

The original formulations of LDA and KDA involve the inversion of the within-class scatter matrix, which may have singularity problem. A simple way to prevent singularity is adding a regularization term to the within-class scatter matrix. The resulting LDA and KDA are called Regularized LDA (RLDA) and Regularized KDA (RKDA). In this paper, we experimentally investigate how this regularization term will influence the performance of LDA and KDA. In addition, we introduce an extra regularization term to the between-class scatter matrix, and the resulting LDA and KDA are then called Doubly Regularized LDA (D-RLDA) and Doubly Regularized KDA (D-RKDA).

Using the LiDAR point cloud data, elevation models (such as the Digital Surface Model and Digital Terrain Model raster) and intensity features were extracted directly.

When learning the similarity of positive and negative examples, the current methods aim to pull positive pairs as close as possible and separate negative pairs into equal distances in the embedding space. Consequently, the data distribution might be omitted. In this work, we focus on the distribution structure learning loss (DSLL) algorithm that aims to preserve the geometric information of images. To achieve this, we firstly propose a metric distance learning for highly matching figures to preserve the similarity structure inside it. Second, we introduce an entropy weight-based structural distribution to set the weight of the representative negative samples.

It improves soil fertility and helps to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Soil spectroscopy with either vis\u2013NIR (350\u20132500 nm) or mid-IR (4000\u2013400 cm\u22121) spectra have been used successfully to predict organic C concentrations in soil. However, research to improve predictions of soil organic C by simply combining vis\u2013NIR and mid-IR spectra to model them together has been unsuccessful. Here we use the Outer Product Analysis (OPA) to fuse vis\u2013NIR and mid-IR spectra by bringing them into a common spectral domain. Using the fused data, we derived models to predict soil organic C and compared its predictions to those derived with vis\u2013NIR and mid-IR models separately. We analyzed 1259 tropical soil samples from surface and subsurface layers across agricultural areas in Central Brazil. Soil organic C contents were determined by a modified Walkley-Black method, and vis\u2013NIR and mid-IR reflectance spectra were obtained with a FieldSpec Pro and a Nicolet 6700 Fourier Transformed Infrared (FT-IR), respectively. Reflectances were log-transformed into absorbances. The mean content of soil organic C was 9.14 g kg\u22121 (SD = 5.64 g kg\u22121). The OPA algorithm was used to emphasize co-evolutions of each spectral domain into the same one by multiplying the absorbances from both sets of spectra to produce a matrix with all possible products between them. Support Vector Machine with linear kernel function was used for the spectroscopic modeling. Predictions of soil organic C using vis\u2013NIR, mid-IR, and fused spectra were statistically compared by the Tukey's test using the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ). Absorbances in vis\u2013NIR and mid-IR were emphasized in the common spectral domain presenting stronger correlations with soil organic C than individual ranges. Soil organic C predictions with the OPA fused spectra were significantly better (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 2.42 g kg\u22121, and RPIQ = 2.87) than those with vis\u2013NIR (R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 3.38 g kg\u22121, and RPIQ = 2.08) or mid-IR spectra (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 2.90 g kg\u22121, and RPIQ = 2.43).

The multi-view SVMs tracking method is constructed based on multiple views of features and a novel combination strategy. To realize a comprehensive representation, we select three different types of features, i.e., gray scale value, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and local binary pattern (LBP), to train the corresponding SVMs. These features represent the object from the perspectives of description, detection, and recognition, respectively . In order to realize the combination of the SVMs under the multi-view learning framework, we present a novel collaborative strategy with entropy criterion, which is acquired by the confidence distribution of the candidate samples.

However, there are many problems that are inherently not pixel-wise classification problems but are nevertheless frequently formulated as semantic segmentation. This ill-posed formulation consequently necessitates hand-crafted scenario-specific and computationally expensive post-processing methods to convert the per pixel probability maps to final desired outputs. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be used to make the semantic segmentation network output to be more realistic or better structure-preserving, decreasing the dependency on potentially complex post-processing. In this work, we propose EL-GAN: a GAN framework to mitigate the discussed problem using an embedding loss. With EL-GAN, we discriminate based on learned embeddings of both the labels and the prediction at the same time. This results in more stable training due to having better discriminative information, benefiting from seeing both `fake' and `real' predictions at the same time. This substantially stabilizes the adversarial training process. We use the TuSimple lane marking challenge to demonstrate that with our proposed framework it is viable to overcome the inherent anomalies of posing it as a semantic segmentation problem.

To address this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose three novel deep multilevel multimodal fusion frameworks to capitalize on different fusion strategies at various stages and to leverage the superiority of multilevel fusion. At input, we transform the depth data into depth images called sequential front view images (SFIs) and inertial sensor data into signal images. Each input modality, depth and inertial, is further made multimodal by taking convolution with the Prewitt filter. Creating \"modality within modality\" enables further complementary and discriminative feature extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are trained on input images of each modality to learn low-level, high-level and complex features. Learned features are extracted and fused at different stages of the proposed frameworks to combine discriminative and complementary information. These highly informative features are served as input to a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Biometric technology is based on physiological or behavioral characteristics of a human body. Iris recognition system consists of image acquisition, localization, normalization, features extraction and encoding, and classification. Iris images are downloaded from CASIA Iris V1.0 database for study. To separate the iris region from the eye image, Hough transform is used. Circular Hough transform is used to localize circular iris and pupil region while parabolic Hough transform is used to enhance the occluding eyelids and eyelashes. Daugman\"s rubber sheet model is used to normalize the extracted iris region into a rectangular block with constant polar dimensions. After normalization, 2D Gabor filter is employed to extract the important features from iris. Iris provides texture information which is unique, universal and contains high randomness. Feature extraction is performed by convolving the normalized iris region with 2D Gabor filter which gives the phase information. The phase data represented by a data set is utilized as input for classifiers. The classifiers used in this study are Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

A novel vibration-force based multisensory approach with LS-SVM classifier for runout monitoring of a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) drilling process is presented in this paper.

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis extracts features of vibration magnitude at 1x RPM and magnitude of axial force at 100 Hz that indicates the unbalance which is proportional to the severity of runout. An increase in amplitude of vibration signal accompanied by decrease in amplitude of force signal indicates the existence of runout.

The unique characteristics and the complexity of the Arabic language make the extraction of named entities a challenging task. Most state-of-the-art systems use a combination of various Machine Learning algorithms or rely on handcrafted engineering features and the output of other NLP tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, text chunking, prefixes and suffixes as well as a large gazetteer. In this paper, we present an Arabic NER system based on DNNs that automatically learns features from data. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the model based on Conditional Random Fields by 12.36 points in F-measure. Moreover, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by 5.18 points in Precision and gets very close results in F-measure.

A deformable mouth template model is employed to parameterize the mouth shape corresponding to different transient speech signals followed by a radial basis function (RBF) interpolation technique to synthesize the mouth image according to a new set of predicted mouth shape parameters. The support vector regression (SVR) machine is used to learn the mapping from speech features to visemes, which are parameterized now by a set of mouth shape parameters.

Symbolic learning requires two regions of processing, the language region and the signal region, both of them being coupled with associative links. Symbolic rules are processed sequentially in several cycles, and affect mainly the language region by also influencing the signal region, whereas subsymbolic rules are local to each of the regions and their consequences can be concluded in parallel.

We examine a population of US federally threatened Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) in northcentral Washington, near the southwestern range limit, where lynx habitat is fragmented by topography, wildfires, and human impacts. We used Global Positioning System radio-collar data from 17 lynx in the North Cascade Mountains during 2007\u20132013 to explore lynx habitat use. We used Random Forest models to analyze core hunting, resting, and denning habitat, and the habitats lynx select while between patches of core habitat. While selecting core habitat, lynx used spruce (Picea engelmannii)-fir (Abies lasiocarpa), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and mixed sub-boreal-Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests, and avoided dry forests and forest openings including new burns. When not in core habitat, lynx used a wider range of habitats, including new burns where fire skips and residual trees offered cover. Our results show clearly that Canada lynx tolerate a wider range of habitats where they occupy fragmented landscapes.

Support vector regression, widely used in wind speed or wind power forecasting, aims at discovering natural structures of wind variation hidden in historical data. Most current regression algorithms, including least squares support vector regression (SVR), assume that the noise of the data is Gaussian with zero mean and the same variance. However, it is discovered that the uncertainty of short-term wind speed satisfies Gaussian distribution with zero mean and heteroscedasticity in this work. This kind of task is called heteroscedastic regression. In order to deal with this problem, we derive an optimal loss function for heteroscedastic regression and develop a new framework of $\\nu$ -SVR for learning tasks of Gaussian noise (GN) with heteroscedasticity. In addition, we introduce the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method to solve the proposed model, which leads the models to be trained online.

However, it is unknown which bands are the most suitable to distinguish tree species. This study aimed at obtaining sensitive bands that can be used for tree species classification based on correlation analysis between the hyperspectral data and pigment contents of trees. In this study, a total of 264 spectral data sets were collected with a band range of 400 nm to 925 nm at fixed points and times form March 2010 to February 2011, including 171 and 93 pieces of branches and leaves for Cunninghamia Lanceolata and Pinus massoniana Lamb, respectively. The in situ hyperspectral reflectance data of these two tree species were collected at canopy using ASD (Analytical Spectral Devices) FieldSpec HandHeld spectrradiometer, a new product of ASD America Inc. At the same time, chlorophyll a&b, chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-b, carotenoids and xanthophyll of branches and leaves for these species were measured in lab. First, the correlation between the hyperspectral data and the pigment contents was analyzed, and the spectral intervals of these two conifers with higher coefficients of correlation were obtained. The data of spectral intervals selected were used for classification of these tree species using five classification algorithms including Support Vector Machine-Radial Basis Function (SVM-RBF), BP neural network, Mahalanobis Distance, Bayes, and Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM). The results showed that the use of chlorophyll led to better performance of classification than other pigments. The sensitive spectral intervals for these two conifers based on chlorophyll ranged from 401 nm to 504 nm and from 659 nm to 686 nm. Among these five methods, it was found that SVM-RBF and BP neural network classifications resulted in better performance. Second, in order to test the dependence and adaptability for imaging spectral data, the obtained spectral intervals were combined using Gaussian curve instead of spectral response function (SRF) and the combined data was classified using the above five methods. The accuracy of classification obviously reduced around 15% to 20%. But, the performance of chlorophyll a&b could be still better than other pigments. Third, In order to test the applicability of the spectral intervals, we added 46 spectral data sets of Cinnamomum camphora, collected from 2004 to 2006, to do the classification. The performance of chlorophyll was also better than other pigments. This implied that the obtained spectral intervals 401 nm to 504 nm and 659 nm to 686 nm based on chlorophyll were consistent and could be applied to classification of other tree species. But, the spectral intervals were not narrow enough and there is a need of further study and examination.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/EORSA.2014.6927878", "venue": "2014 Third International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications (EORSA)", "journal": "2014 Third International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications (EORSA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1998029943", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["12499990", "84256349", "93164188", "129754848", "140687941", "101953916"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14246899"}

Even though there are many elementary techniques for parsing the structured documents, they are not suitable for parsing unstructured documents like resumes. The ongoing approaches for resume parsing mainly use regular expressions, chunking, keyword based models and entity recognition models.

For example, when observing the world through eyes, we not only understand the high level semantic meaning of each region/pixel, more importantly, we also understand the 3D properties like how far away each object is and how the 3D shape of each object is in order to do interaction with the world. In the field of computer vision, however, visual understanding are separated into multiple tasks, e.g. segmentation, 3D reconstruction or object detection etc., due to its high complexity. However, this induces the problem that the results from different strategies are lack of compatibility among different tasks. For example, semantic object detection can not take care of the 3D occlusion regions, while 3D reconstruction does not consider overall semantic context. Thus, in order to have good visual understanding, it is critical to joint understand different tasks while maintaining their compatibility. Luckily, thanks to the raising technique of deep learning, (a.k.a. convolutional neural network (CNN)), which dramatically beats the other traditional strategies in many visual tasks based on hierarchical learned features with a nearly single framework, we are able to unify different understandings in a more compact and efficient way by designing reasonable output and interaction terms.However, CNN is not a magic key of solving all problems, and one obvious limitation of CNN is that it contains arbitrarily selected convolutional kernel size and layers, yielding non-adaptive receptive fields to match the variance of object scales. In addition, it is not strait-forward to add arbitrary connections inside each layer based on intuition. Thus, we further embed the conditional random field (CRF) into the system in order to compensate the deficiency in order to unify different cues and perform multiple tasks simultaneously.In this thesis, we prove the concept through estimating multiple tasks jointly including joint part and object segmentation, joint segmentation and geometry estimation etc. We first show that we can fit deep convolutional network into many different tasks to acquire superior performance compare to traditional shallow features. Secondly, by unifying different tasks with our designed compatibility constrains, we make different tasks mutually regularized and beneficial. Finally, to evaluate the results, we perform our experiments over the standard evaluating benchmarks like PASCAL for segmentation and the NYU v2 dataset for depth estimation.

Critical to the effective use of this technology is the development of reliable algorithms to predict the potency and selectivity of siRNAs under study. Existing algorithms are mostly built upon sequence information of siRNAs and then employ statistical pattern recognition or machine learning techniques to derive rules or models. However, sequence-based features have limited ability to characterize siRNAs, especially chemically modified ones. In this study, we proposed a cheminformatics approach to describe siRNAs. Principal component scores (z1, z2, z3, z4) have been derived for each of the 5 nucleotides (A, U, G, C, T) from the descriptor matrix computed by the MOE program. Descriptors of a given siRNA sequence are simply the concatenation of the z values of its composing nucleotides. Thus, for each of the 2431 siRNA sequences in the Huesken dataset, 76 descriptors were generated for the 19-NT representation, and 84 descriptors were generated for the 21-NT representation of siRNAs. Support Vector Machine regression (SVMR) was employed to develop predictive models. In all cases, the models achieved Pearson correlation coefficient r and R about 0.84 and 0.65 for the training sets and test sets, respectively. A minimum of 25 % of the whole dataset was needed to obtain predictive models that could accurately predict 75 % of the remaining siRNAs.

This skew introduces a data imbalance problem wherein a dataset can have as much as a 1000-to-1 ratio of seafloor background to object-of-interest SAS image chips.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.06436", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.23919/OCEANS40490.2019.8962733", "venue": "OCEANS 2019 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE", "journal": "OCEANS 2019 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3002131197,2973068210", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["62205983", "16138195", "10661115", "13409525", "116190659", "110349192", "111167683", "206477905", "130964039", "126732202", "1033682", "3568073", "52890982", "71717159", "1687220", "211022860", "10894094", "5002792", "53729760", "12803511", "206770979", "6200260", "980236", "20731914", "53012614", "189824198", "195774912", "130964039", "109908796", "6596507", "59832792", "22564550", "16935249", "38822273", "9226468", "49404392", "128372762", "35008152", "57763617", "11758569", "12342360", "326772", "52889459", "206592484", "206597351"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202577514"}

The major challenge is how to properly manage the \"atypical\" patients in order to diagnose OSCC early and prevent OSCC. In this study, we collected exfoliative cytology data, histopathology data, and clinical data of normal subjects (n=102), oral leukoplakia (OLK) patients (n=82), and OSCC patients (n=93), and developed a data analysis procedure for quantitative risk stratification of OLK patients. This procedure involving a step called expert-guided data transformation and reconstruction (EdTAR) which allows automatic data processing and reconstruction and reveals informative signals for subsequent risk stratification. Modern machine learning techniques were utilized to build statistical prediction models on the reconstructed data. Among the several models tested using resampling methods for parameter pruning and performance evaluation, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was found to be optimal with a high sensitivity (median>0.98) and specificity (median>0.99). With the SVM model, we constructed an oral cancer risk index (OCRI) which may potentially guide clinical follow-up of OLK patients. One OLK patient with an initial OCRI of 0.88 developed OSCC after 40 months of follow-up. In conclusion, we have developed a statistical method for qualitative risk stratification of OLK patients.

Without the need of annotating bounding boxes, the existing methods usually follow a two/multi-stage pipeline with an online compulsive stage to extract object proposals, which is an order of magnitude slower than fast fully supervised object detectors such as SSD [31] and YOLO [34]. In this paper, we speedup online weakly supervised object detectors by orders of magnitude by proposing a novel generative adversarial learning paradigm. In the proposed paradigm, the generator is a one-stage object detector to generate bounding boxes from images. To guide the learning of object-level generator, a surrogator is introduced to mine high-quality bounding boxes for training. We further adapt a structural similarity loss in combination with an adversarial loss into the training objective, which solves the challenge that the bounding boxes produced by the surrogator may not well capture their ground truth. Our one-stage detector outperforms all existing schemes in terms of detection accuracy, running at 118 frames per second, which is up to 438A\u2014 faster than the state-of-the-art weakly supervised detectors [8, 30, 15, 27, 45].

The 1 m resolution HySpex images with spectral range of 0.4\u20132.5 \u03bcm were corrected atmospherically, radiometrically and geometrically. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data acquired at 7 points/m2 were used to generate several products, e.g. Canopy Height Model (CHM), rasters representing morphometric features of the area (Multiresolution Index of the Ridge Top Flatness or Valley Bottom Flatness\u2014MRRTF, MRVBF), wetness relations (Topographic Wetness Index\u2014TWI) and the availability of light (Total Insolation\u2014TI), intensity of laser pulse reflection and geometric relations of vegetation points (i.a. Vegetation Cover, Vegetation Mean Intensity). The Random Forest (RF) classification and different raster datasets were used to identify the target species. As a result, the highest accuracy was obtained for the scenario based on HySpex images acquired in September. The accuracy (f1 score) for the target species achieved 83%. The developed method for the identification of Spiraea tomentosa has a great potential for application and can be used for monitoring peat bogs threatened by invasion of alien plants.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11273-020-09719-y", "venue": "Wetlands Ecology and Management", "journal": "Wetlands Ecology and Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3013185492", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["140707210", "53371805", "86310423", "108286084", "127544391", "8760749", "89141", "214857835", "42791560", "3626971", "84905463", "84086060", "16495360", "129749977", "10283864", "311801", "1356333", "123435916", "6915308", "195771550", "128699213", "13262019", "83925277", "37096272", "32036624", "89430087", "60780680", "54514833", "129807999", "27415729", "84256349", "41876215", "21785729", "176785550", "144207587", "54973730", "91158458", "6345759", "115205884", "85512624", "45833123", "18247448"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214672638"}

Older patients that need to be readmitted within 30 days have a higher risk of negative health outcomes, thus it is important to identify those people at risk of readmission to be able to apply specific procedures. Our objective is to develop a method to stratify the risk of readmission in an older, frailty and high comorbid population. Methods: We collected demographic, clinical, functional and social data from consecutive patients admitted into the Subacute Care Unit (SCU) of an intermediate care hospital from January 2015 to April 2016. The 30 days readmission for each case was assessed according to shared electronical medical records. This dataset was used to train different Machine Learning models, including Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to predict whether a patient will require readmission from the information available at discharge time. A second dataset contained information of acute hospitalization episodes for these patients. Variables derived from this dataset were added to the previous one, and models retrained, to investigate whether this additional information allowed for better prediction. More precisely, three variables were added: number of hospitalizations in the past, total number of days in acute hospitals, and number of distinct ICD9 diagnostics recorded in those hospitalizations. Predictor error in all experiments was assessed using cross-validation. A toy economic model was built on top of the predictor to assess its usefulness. It can be tuned by parameters such as cost of a readmission, cost of a preventive action on a high-risk patient, risk threshold, and success probability of the action. Many others could be added in the future. Results: The Random Forest classifier gave best results among those tested. The C-statistic (or Area-under-the-curve measure) was 0.63. This is consistent with results in the literature for readmission prediction problems with data of similar detail. When the additional information was added, the measure raised up to around 0.8. In both cases, with realistic figures for the parameters of the economic model, the predictors appeared to be accurate enough to support cost-effective action plans. Conclusions: The data available at the SCU contains enough information to predict non-trivially 30-day readmission, well enough to support focused preventive measures on high-risk patients. Given that we work with highly vulnerable patients, which in most programs would be at risk of readmission, being able to increase the accuracy in assessing this risk is a major breakthrough. Since predictive power is largely increased by adding information on past acute hospitalizations of the patient, we encourage to move forward in the integration of different sources of information.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5334/ijic.s3224", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Integrated Care", "mag_id": "2967335091", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201975266"}

Nevertheless, most existing algorithms are limited to combining only a finite number of hypotheses, and the generated ensemble is usually sparse. Thus, it is not clear whether we should construct an ensemble classifier with a larger or even an infinite number of hypotheses. In addition, constructing an infinite ensemble itself is a challenging task. In this paper, we formulate an infinite ensemble learning framework based on the support vector machine (SVM). The framework can output an infinite and nonsparse ensemble through embedding infinitely many hypotheses into an SVM kernel. We use the framework to derive two novel kernels, the stump kernel and the perceptron kernel. The stump kernel embodies infinitely many decision stumps, and the perceptron kernel embodies infinitely many perceptrons. We also show that the Laplacian radial basis function kernel embodies infinitely many decision trees, and can thus be explained through infinite ensemble learning. Experimental results show that SVM with these kernels is superior to boosting with the same base hypothesis set. In addition, SVM with the stump kernel or the perceptron kernel performs similarly to SVM with the Gaussian radial basis function kernel, but enjoys the benefit of faster parameter selection. These properties make the novel kernels favorable choices in practice.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1390681.1390690", "venue": "J.

An algorithm is proposed for updating the SVM decision function by carefully selecting the training samples. This results in the construction of an accurate limit state function with a reduced number of function evaluations. Speciflcally, the SVM-based approach aims at handling the di\u2010culties associated with the reliability assessment of problems exhibiting discontinuous responses and disjoint failure domains. The explicit construction of limit state functions allows for an easy calculation of a probability of failure and enables the association of a speciflc system behavior with a region of the design space. Three problems are presented to demonstrate the explicit construction of a limit state function. The proposed update scheme is validated by comparing the obtained explicit function to actual analytical limit state functions. Non-linear problems are often characterized by various and sudden behavioral changes which, in structural mechanics, are associated with the presence of critical points. A typical example is a geometrically nonlinear structure which globally buckles for a load larger than the limit load. Because these abrupt changes can be triggered by inflnitesimally small modiflcations of design parameters or loading conditions, the responses of the system are discontinuous in a mathematical sense. In the context of reliability, these slight variations often fall in the range of uncertainties. In simulation-based design, discontinuities present a serious problem for optimization or probabilistic techniques because it is usually assumed that the system\u2019s responses are continuous. In optimization, this limits any traditional gradient-based methods or response surface techniques.

The circuit is to be used in neural networks trained in accordance with Neural Gas (NG) learning algorithm implemented in the CMOS technology. The role of the circuit is to determine, for a given learning pattern, the winning neuron as well as its neighbors. The proposed circuit is versatile. It can be also used, for example, in nonlinear filtering of analog signals. It is capable of performing simultaneously several typical nonlinear operations that include Min, Max and median filtering. The circuit offers high accuracy, which means that it is able to distinguish signals which differ by a relatively small value. However, the accuracy depends on the calculation time. For example, to be able to distinguish the signals that differ by 10 nA (for maximum range of 10 \u00b5 A), the assumed calculation time has to be set to at least 1 \u00b5 s. To improve the accuracy to 5 nA, the calculation time has to be doubled. The circuit provides us the sorted list of signals, in accordance with their values.

Additionally, significant amounts of nutrients are lost every year due to unsustainable soil management practices. This is partially the result of insufficient use of soil management knowledge. To help bridge the soil information gap in Africa, the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project was established in 2008. Over the period 2008\u20132014, the AfSIS project compiled two point data sets: the Africa Soil Profiles (legacy) database and the AfSIS Sentinel Site database. These data sets contain over 28 thousand sampling locations and represent the most comprehensive soil sample data sets of the African continent to date.

Fitting and running random forests models takes an order of magnitude more time and the modelling success is sensitive to artifacts in the input data, but as long as quality-controlled point data are provided, an increase in soil mapping accuracy can be expected.

Many acquiring diseases from that list are then determined by medical doctors experience expressed through specific combinations of features in the clinical dataset. The major issue of the expert system is increasing the accuracy of the medical diagnosis attributes that involves the cooperation of decision making systems and recommender systems in the sense that predict the behaviors of disease symptoms and the doctors experience are represented by rules whilst the prediction of the possible diseases is identified by the prediction capability of medical expert systems. From the past observation, the accuracy of features similarity could be improved by the integration with the information of possibility of patients belonging to clusters specified by a weighted K-means clustering method. For improving the performance of medical expert system, a new hybrid intrusion detection framework is introduced to improve the classification accuracy. This hybrid system is combining the proposed genetic based data adaptation decision tree (GDADT) and the existing weighted K-Means clustering.

Using adversarial multi-agent reinforcement learning, in which an adversary perturbed both the inputs and outputs of the autonomous vehicle during training, we train an autonomous vehicle to manage a roundabout merge in the presence of an adversary in simulation. At test time, the adversarial policy successfully reproduces the simulated ramp metering behavior and outperforms both a human driving baseline and adversary-free trained policies. Finally, we demonstrate that the addition of adversarial training considerably improves the stability and robustness of policies being transferred to the real world.

Most of the representation-based domain adaptation methods attempt to find a total transformation matrix for all the samples from the source domain; however, they ignore the individual changes in each class, which often leads to the misalignment of the samples in each class between the two domains. This paper attempts to find new representations for the samples in different classes from the source domain by multiple linear transformations, which corresponds to the practical changes in each class to a higher degree. Furthermore, to avoid the influence of outliers and noise in the source domain samples, low-rank reconstruction is further applied to make the domain adaptation method more robust. In addition, in the stage of predicting the unlabeled samples by label propagation (LP), the proposed LP with instance weighting can effectively further reduce the negative effect of misleading samples from the source domain.

The main problems for the identification of this kind of weed are its similar spectral signature with respect the crops and also its irregular distribution in the field. It has been designed a new strategy involving two processes: image segmentation and decision making. The image segmentation combines basic suitable image processing techniques in order to extract cells from the image as the low level units. Each cell is described by two area-based attributes measuring the relations among the crops and weeds. The decision making is based on the Support Vector Machines and determines if a cell must be sprayed.

The missing values can be handled using various techniques like deletion or imputation. Of late, R has become one of the most preferred platform for carrying out data analysis, and its popularity is growing further. R provides various packages for handling missing values through imputation. The presence of multiple packages however, calls for an analysis of their comparative performance and examine their suitability for handling a given set of data. The performance of different R packages may differ for different datasets and may depend on the size of the dataset and richness of the missing values in the datasets. In this paper, the authors perform comparative study of the performance of the common R packages, namely VIM, MICE, MissForest, and HMISC, used for missing value imputation. The authors measured the performances of the said packages in terms of their imputation time, imputation efficiency and the effect on the variance. The imputation efficiency was measured in terms of the difference in predictive performance of a model built using original dataset vis-a-vis a dataset with imputed values. Similarly, the variance of the variables in the original dataset was compared that of corresponding variables in the imputed dataset. A missing value imputation package can be considered to be better if it consumes less imputation time and provides high imputation accuracy. Also in terms of variance, one would like to have the imputation package maintain the original variance of the variables. On analysing the four imputation packages on two datasets over three predictive algorithms\u2013Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks\u2013it was observed that the performances varies depending on the size of the dataset, and the missing values present in them. The study highlights that certain missing value package used in conjunction with a given predictive algorithm provides better performance, which is again a function of the dataset characteristics.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.knosys.2018.06.012", "venue": "Knowl.

However, current techniques have shown little improvements in visual tracking as they mostly rely on piece wise orthogonal hyperplanes to create decision nodes and lack a robust incremental learning mechanism that is much needed for online tracking. In this paper, we propose a discriminative tracker based on a novel incremental oblique random forest. Unlike conventional orthogonal decision trees that use a single feature and heuristic measures to obtain a split at each node, we propose to use a more powerful proximal SVM to obtain oblique hyperplanes to capture the geometric structure of the data better. The resulting decision surface is not restricted to be axis aligned and hence has the ability to represent and classify the input data better. Furthermore, in order to generalize to online tracking scenarios, we derive incremental update steps that enable the hyperplanes in each node to be updated recursively, efficiently and in a closed-form fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using two large scale benchmark datasets (OTB-51 and OTB-100) and show that our method gives competitive results on several challenging cases by relying on simple HOG features as well as in combination with more sophisticated deep neural network based models.

The recently-emerging data-driven authentication process may encounter undesired biases, i.e., the models are often trained in one domain (e.g., for people wearing spring outfits) while required to apply in other domains (e.g., they change the clothes to summer outfits). To address this issue, we propose a novel two-stage method that disentangles the class/identity from domain-differences, and we consider multiple types of domain-difference. In the first stage, we learn disentangled representations by a one-versus-rest disentangle learning (OVRDL) mechanism.

Fifty-six T1-weighted whole brain MR images were included in the study, together with the related manually segmented bilateral hippocampi (mask). Firstly, the relationship between manual and automated segmentations of hippocampus was explored using a number of standard metrics. For left (right) hemisphere the Dice's coefficient obtained by RF was 70.6% (68.4%). The structural complexity of 3D MR images is twofold.

In order to overcome these two limitations, we propose two simple strategies: one consists of filtering the input data using the logical OR of the masks of training images, followed by the RF classification task, the other is constituted by learning the RF classifier plane by plane.

Future potential species distribution, richness, local colonization, local extinction and species turnover were modelled according to two scenarios (A2 and B1) for 2050 and 2080. ::: ::: Results: Robust Random Forest proved to be the best statistical model to predict the potential distribution of tree species abundance.

Robust variants of the LS-SVR model, such as the WLS-SVR and IRLS-SVR models, have been developed aiming at adding robustness to the parameter estimation process, but they still rely on OLS solutions. In this paper we propose a totally different approach to robustify the LS-SVR. Unlike previous models, we maintain the original LS-SVR loss function, while the solution of the resulting linear system for parameter estimation is obtained by means of the Recursive Least M-estimate (RLM) algorithm. We evaluate the proposed approach in nonlinear system identification tasks, using artificial and real-world datasets contaminated with outliers. The obtained results for infinite-steps-ahead prediction shows that proposed model consistently outperforms the WLS-SVR and IRLS-SVR models for all studied scenarios.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-24834-9_23", "venue": "IDEAL", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2407374579", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22204171"}

Seabed hardness is often inferred from multibeam backscatter data with unknown accuracy and can be inferred from underwater video footage at limited locations. In this study, we classified the seabed into four classes based on two new seabed hardness classification schemes (i.e., hard90 and hard70). We developed optimal predictive models to predict seabed hardness using random forest (RF) based on the point data of hardness classes and spatially continuous multibeam data. Five feature selection (FS) methods that are variable importance (VI), averaged variable importance (AVI), knowledge informed AVI (KIAVI), Boruta and regularized RF (RRF) were tested based on predictive accuracy. Effects of highly correlated, important and unimportant predictors on the accuracy of RF predictive models were examined. Finally, spatial predictions generated using the most accurate models were visually examined and analysed. This study confirmed that: 1) hard90 and hard70 are effective seabed hardness classification schemes; 2) seabed hardness of four classes can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy; 3) the typical approach used to pre-select predictive variables by excluding highly correlated variables needs to be re-examined; 4) the identification of the important and unimportant predictors provides useful guidelines for further improving predictive models; 5) FS methods select the most accurate predictive model(s) instead of the most parsimonious ones, and AVI and Boruta are recommended for future studies; and 6) RF is an effective modelling method with high predictive accuracy for multi-level categorical data and can be applied to 'small p and large n' problems in environmental sciences. Additionally, automated computational programs for AVI need to be developed to increase its computational efficiency and caution should be taken when applying filter FS methods in selecting predictive models.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4758710", "pubmed_id": "26890307", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0149089", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2282831896", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["85843571", "85736870", "83626481", "128597531", "140672042", "128725549", "133552928", "129680039", "85937011", "128877880", "129311896", "133713798", "140710358", "135451273", "206420153", "89141", "3626971", "15245447", "53629746", "14327012", "15331965", "129693413", "13969706", "14954599", "49344782", "14864905", "16510361", "7733583", "84755222", "128682870", "19020464", "54004282", "8529157", "202721438", "54735661", "144565557", "5553697", "123462990", "128496817", "129181806", "129172698"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17320359"}

We measured prediction accuracy as the correlation between actual and predicted phenotypes in a five-fold cross-validation setting. Phenotypic traits measured included live weight measures and carcass composition obtained during the trial as well as at slaughter. We employed a null model excluding microbiome information as a baseline to assess the increase in prediction accuracy stemming from the inclusion of operational taxonomic units (OTU) as predictors. We further contrasted performance of models from the Bayesian alphabet (Bayesian Lasso) as well machine learning approaches (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) and semi-parametric kernel models (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert space). In most cases, prediction accuracy increased significantly with the inclusion of microbiome data. Accuracy was more substantial with the inclusion of microbiome information taken at weeks 15 and 22, with values ranging from approximately 0.30 for loin traits to more than 0.50 for back fat. Conversely, microbiome composition at weaning resulted in most cases in marginal gains of prediction accuracy, suggesting that later measures might be more useful to include in predictive models. Model choice affected predictions marginally with no clear winner for any model/trait/time point. We, therefore, suggest average prediction across models as a robust strategy in fitting microbiome information. In conclusion, microbiome composition can effectively be used as a predictor of growth and composition traits, particularly for fatness traits. The inclusion of OTU predictors could potentially be used to promote fast growth of individuals while limiting fat accumulation. Early microbiome measures might not be good predictors of growth and OTU information might be best collected at later life stages. Future research should focus on the inclusion of both microbiome as well as host genome information in predictions, as well as the interaction between the two. Furthermore, the influence of the microbiome on feed efficiency as well as carcass and meat quality should be investigated.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6484031", "pubmed_id": "31024050", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-43031-x", "venue": "Scientific Reports", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2949630416", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["54028239", "83768553", "24610941", "21085231", "25739677", "25356784", "12400742", "2058853", "11083969", "215633708", "215120945", "21742629", "37908522", "4716840", "11795020", "195726359", "11254209", "3093707", "7955044", "12670400", "215099639", "3712676", "206718137", "24180720", "22768219", "7791714", "46860547", "7325288", "13944169", "19136066", "8395957", "89141", "206970176", "986234", "278772", "83818159", "3606581", "1348478", "54907382", "23918289", "90932031", "11906282", "604", "32942576", "1084804", "205034045", "2743932", "18889921", "3732380", "10391475", "120384557", "12781809", "14437777", "88513115"], "inbound_citations": ["211069159"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131775948"}

Despite the availability of myriads anti-phishing systems, phishing continues unabated due to inadequate detection of a zero-day attack, superfluous computational overhead and high false rates. Although Machine Learning approaches have achieved promising accuracy rate, the choice and the performance of the feature vector limit their effective detection. In this work, an enhanced machine learning-based predictive model is proposed to improve the efficiency of anti-phishing schemes. The predictive model consists of Feature Selection Module which is used for the construction of an effective feature vector. These features are extracted from the URL, webpage properties and webpage behaviour using the incremental component-based system to present the resultant feature vector to the predictive model. The proposed system uses Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes which have been trained on a 15-dimensional feature set. The experiments were based on datasets consisting of 2541 phishing instances and 2500 benign instances.

More specifically, a wireless communication system, which consists of K legal users, one access point (AP) and one active eavesdropper, is considered. To cope with the eavesdropper who breaks into the system during the uplink phase, we first build structured datasets based on several different features. We then apply support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and one-class SVM classifiers to those structured datasets for detecting the presence of eavesdropper. Regarding the data, we first process received signals at the AP and then define three different features (i.e., MEAN, RATIO and SUM) based on the post-processing signals. Noticeably, our three defined features are formulated such that they have relevant statistical properties. Enabling the AP to simulate the entire process of transmission, we form the so-called artificial training data (ATD) that is used for training SVM (or one-class SVM) models. While SVM is preferred in the case of having perfect channel state information (CSI) of all channels, one-class SVM is preferred in the case of having only the CSI of legal users. We also evaluate the accuracy of the trained models in relation to the choice of kernel functions, the choice of features, and the change of eavesdropper's power. Numerical results show that the accuracy is relatively sensitive to adjusting parameters. Under some settings, SVM classifiers (or even one-class SVM) can bring about the accuracy of over 90%.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.01048", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Signal Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3007212251", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["23645707", "3453202", "36730393", "38904", "21660160", "6779551", "18791672", "13833977", "24127993", "69365451", "3995858", "7569649", "61839874", "19146768", "37673210", "60626986", "7138354", "194951", "175960", "64543020", "52874011", "15112547", "17151387", "2110475", "7473781", "12601634", "961425", "13094943", "29873752", "207159665", "14272714"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211677548"}

Although reservoir computing has been mainly applied to time series prediction and recognition, it can be applied to image recognition as well by considering an image data as a sequence of pixel values. However, to achieve a high performance in image recognition with raw image data, a large-scale reservoir including a large number of neurons is required.

Grid pixel data of Lung Fibrosis and Honeycomb was extracted from computed tomography (CT) images of 71 patients from 13 clinical centers around the United States to produce a training set of 348 HC and 3009 LF instances and a test set of 291 HC and 2665 LF. From our research, SVM with AL using balanced sampling compared to random sampling increased the sensitivity of HC by 0.56 (0.175 vs. 0.735) and 0.47 (0.23 vs. 0.70) for the original and de-noised dataset respectively. These results show that by implementing SVM with Active Learning paired with balanced sampling, we can improve the prediction performances of unbalanced data classification.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/02664763.2014.978270", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Applied Statistics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2080586915", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["206742563", "16818283", "44817599", "30235428", "20993687", "16968878", "23544307", "38821133", "7138354", "41680909", "91176244"], "inbound_citations": ["210814006", "14321540", "7926903", "49526340", "215096406"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54753579"}

Twenty-five patients scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled. For clinical reference of NoL, the combined index of stimulus and analgesia was defined as a composite of the surgical stimulus level and a scaled effect-site concentration of opioid. The physiological parameters heart rate, heart rate variability (0.15\u20130.4 Hz band power), plethysmograph wave amplitude, skin conductance level, number of skin conductance fluctuations, and their time derivatives, were extracted. Two techniques to incorporate these parameters into a single index representing the NoL have been proposed: NoLlinear, based on an ordinary linear regression, and NoLnon-linear, based on a non-linear Random Forest regression. NoLlinear and NoLnon-linear significantly increased after moderate to severe noxious stimuli (Wilcoxon rank test, p < 0.01), while the individual parameters only partially responded. Receiver operating curve analysis showed that NoL index based on both techniques better discriminated noxious and non-noxious surgical events [area under curve (AUC) = 0.97] compared with individual parameters (AUC = 0.56\u20130.74). NoLnon-linear better ranked the level of nociception compared with NoLlinear (R = 0.88 vs. 0.77, p < 0.01). These results demonstrate the superiority of multi-parametric approach over any individual parameter in the evaluation of nociceptive response.

In this work, we introduced a new two-step support vector machines target-binding and selectivity screening method for searching DR subtype-selective ligands, which was tested together with three previously-used machine learning methods for searching D1, D2, D3 and D4 selective ligands.

Near infrared spectroscopy are highly sensitive to C-H, O-H and N-H bonds of soil components such as total nitrogen (TN) making their use in the agricultural and environmental sciences particularly appropriate. The analytical abilities of near infrared spectroscopy depend on the repetitive and broad absorption of light by C-H, O-H and N-H bonds. A total of 243 soil samples were collected from wencheng, Zhejiang province. Raw spectra and wavelength-reduced spectra with 3 different pretreatment methods (Savitzky-Golay smoothing (SG), Reduce (RD), and Wavelet Transform (WT)) were compared to determine the optimal wavelength range and pretreatment method for analysis. Spectral variable selection is an important strategy in spectrum modeling analysis, because it tends to parsimonious data representation and can lead to multivariate models with better performance. In order to simply calibration models, the preprocessed spectra were then used to select sensitive wavelengths by competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), Random frog and Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA) methods. Different numbers of sensitive wavelengths were selected by different variable selection methods with Wavelet Transform (WT) preprocessing method. Partial least squares (PLS) was used to build models with the full spectra, and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and LS-SVM were applied to build models with the selected wavelength variables. The overall results showed that PLS and LS-SVM models performed better than ELM models, and the LS-SVM models with the selected wavelengths based on SPA obtained the best results with the determination coefficient (R2), RMSEP and RPD were 0.63, 0.007 9 and 1.58 for prediction set.

This paper presents a novel network alignment framework, RANA, that combines dual generative adversarial network (GAN) techniques to match the distributions of two networks based on two dimensions of distance and shape. First, we propose an adversarial network distribution matching model to perform the bidirectional cross-network alignment translations between two networks, such that the cross-network transformed distributions of two networks move closer to each other and finally meet with each other halfway. In addition, a homophily consistency loss is introduced to maintain the vertex homophily consistency between pairwise vertices on two networks in both the embedding space. Second, in order to address the feature inconsistency issue, we integrate a dual adversarial autoencoder module with an adversarial two-class classification model together to twist the cross-network transformed distributions of two networks, such that two distributions could have the same shape. This facilitates the translations of the distributions of two networks in the adversarial network distribution matching model. Moreover, a semantic preservation loss is introduced to preserve the original embedding semantics of one network when this network is translated to another network and returned to itself. Third but last, the competition game by integrating the above two adversarial models together can help project two copies of the same vertices with high-dimensional inconsistent features into the same low-dimensional embedding space, and thus guarantee the distribution consistency between two networks in terms of both distance and shape.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2019.00162", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "journal": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3003961212", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211298368", "211227238", "211297276"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210992766"}

The named entity information is helpful for reducing the complexity of monolingual and multilingual processing tasks, such as information extraction, parsing and machine translation. We investigate the Arabic NER problem from the Arabic Wikipedia text. We employ statistical sequence labeling methods for solving the NER task. Previous studies suggest that sequence labeling methods, such as Conditional Random Fields, are the state of the art NER frameworks. The sequence labeling methods require human labeled training data. Most ofthe Arabic human labeled data for NER belong to the political news domain and the consequent trained models are biased towards the news domain. In contrast, our target test data (Arabic Wikipedia articles) has a very diverse set of topics. The domain mismatch between the train and test data results in poor NER performance. In order to reduce the coverage problem, we present three techniques: (1) we use the Wikipedia network structure to collect additional information about the text. Information such as monolingual and cross-lingual hyperlinks and text formatting lead us to use new features of the Wikipedia text in NER models. Moreover, we use cross-lingual projection to collect named entity information from English Wikipedia. (2) We use a domain adaptation technique to shift the model from the baseline political domain to domains relevant to our test data. Our model adaptation uses a small set of in-house-labeled Arabic Wikipedia articles. (3) We use self-training to port from a fully supervised to a semi-supervised learning framework: we collect a large volume of unlabeled Arabic Wikipedia articles to expand the underlying NER domain to new text domains. Our model expansion is gradual and iterative. In each iteration we add a new set of unlabeled articles to the training and use the current model to label and construct a larger model. Our NER evaluations are based on the standard precision and recall metrics.We evaluate our proposed framework in four different text domains ofArabic Wikipedia.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5339/qfarf.2010.cso9", "venue": "Qatar Foundation Annual Research Forum Proceedings", "journal": "Qatar Foundation Annual Research Forum Proceedings", "mag_id": "2164033606", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["2205515"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61576098"}

Compounding these challenges is the ongoing debate over the efficacy of nutrient management strategies (phosphorus-only versus nitrogen and phosphorus), which increases decision-making uncertainty. To improve our understanding of how different cyanobacteria respond to nutrient levels and other biophysical factors, we analyzed a unique 17 year data set comprising monthly observations of cyanobacteria genera and zooplankton abundances, water quality, and flow in a bloom-impacted, subtropical, flow-through lake in Florida (United States). Using the Random Forests machine learning algorithm, an ensemble modeling approach, we characterized and quantified relationships among environmental conditions and five dominant cyanobacteria genera. Results highlighted nonlinear relationships and critical thresholds between cyanobacteria genera and environmental covariates, the potential for hydrology and temperature to limit the efficacy of cyanobacteria bloom management actions, and the importance of a dual nutrient management strategy for reducing bloom risk in the long term.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29478313", "doi": "10.1021/acs.est.7b05884", "venue": "Environmental science & technology", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2793155954", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["206552086", "44701815", "41470", "23503487", "142881074", "17797374", "84610413", "85954288", "86802585", "86132965", "84584949", "86722916", "10895511", "206560160", "54600496", "21395122", "84916804", "10528364", "89385462", "134930509", "86507859", "89141", "3626971", "35078977", "5718333", "83680236", "85167444", "122553510", "16420368", "37777896", "85229775", "13213918", "62793851", "109120734", "31008498", "53142142", "84720776", "126882557", "33862410", "31474654", "206940458", "86774001", "36449793", "54888470", "86139828", "84867320", "85204197", "34084576", "3637372", "86306903"], "inbound_citations": ["195805931", "202899688", "134732436"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3503042"}

In particular, identifying and linking trajectories to users who generate them \u2013 a problem called Trajectory-User Linking (TUL) \u2013 has become a focus of many recent works. TUL is usually studied as a multi-class classification problem and has gained recent attention because: (1) the number of labels/classes (i.e., users) is way larger than the number of motion patterns among various trajectories; and (2) the location-based trajectory data, especially the check-ins \u2013 i.e., events of reporting a location at particular Point of Interest (POI) with known semantics \u2013 are often extremely sparse. Towards addressing these challenges, we introduce a Trajectory Generative Adversarial Network (TGAN) as an approach to enable learning users motion patterns and location distribution, and to eventually identify human mobility. TGAN consists of two jointly trained neural networks, playing a Minimax game to (iteratively) optimize both components. The first one is the generator, learning trajectory representation by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based model, aiming at fitting the underlying trajectory distribution of a particular individual and generate synthetic trajectories with intrinsic invariance and global coherence. The second one is the discriminator \u2013 a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model that discriminates the generated trajectory from the real ones and provides guidance to train the generator model.

Usually hard example mining comes with a price of necessity to use large mini-batches or substantial extra computation and memory cost, particularly for datasets with large numbers of identities. Our method needs only a negligible extra computation and memory.

Second, the shape, optical flow and spatial frequencies of the lip features are extracted from the lip detected by ASM.

In particular, we investigate the impact of batch effects and differences in sample composition between batches on the accuracy of the classification performance estimate obtained via cross-validation. The focus on estimation bias is a main difference compared to previous studies, which have mostly focused on the predictive performance and how it relates to the presence of batch effects. ::: ::: ::: Data ::: We work on simulated data sets. To have realistic intensity distributions, we use real gene expression data as the basis for our simulation. Random samples from this expression matrix are selected and assigned to group 1 (e.g., \u2018control\u2019) or group 2 (e.g., \u2018treated\u2019).

We consider several scenarios for our study, most importantly different levels of confounding between groups and batch effects. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: We focus on well-known classifiers: logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and Random Forests (RF). Feature selection is performed with the Wilcoxon test or the lasso.

This paper compares a well-established technique, linear spectral mixture models (LSMM), with a much newer idea based on data selection, support vector machines (SVM). It is shown that the constrained least squares LSMM is equivalent to the linear SVM, which relies on proving that the LSMM algorithm possesses the \"maximum margin\" property. This in turn shows that the LSMM algorithm can be derived from the same optimality conditions as the linear SVM, which provides important insights about the role of the bias term and rank deficiency in the pure pixel matrix within the LSMM algorithm. It also highlights one of the main advantages for using the linear SVM algorithm in that it performs automatic \"pure pixel\" selection from a much larger database. In addition, extensions to the basic SVM algorithm allow the technique to be applied to data sets that exhibit spectral confusion (overlapping sets of pure pixels) and to data sets that have nonlinear mixture regions.

Compared with the traditional attribute-value learning methods, it has some advantages (the stronger expressive power and the ease of using background knowledge), but also some weak points. One particular issue is that the theory, techniques and experiences are much less mature for ILP to deal with imperfect data than in the traditional attribute-value learning methods. This paper applies the Rough Set theory to ILP to deal with imperfect data which occur in large real-world applications. We investigate various kinds of imperfect data in ILP and identify a subset of them to tackle. Namely, we concentrate on incomplete background knowledge (where essential predicates/clauses are missing) and on indiscernible data (where some examples belong to both sets of positive and negative training examples), proposing rough problem settings for these cases. The rough settings relax the strict requirements in the standard normal problem setting for ILP, so that rough but useful hypotheses can be induced from imperfect data.", "year": 1999, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-48061-7_21", "venue": "RSFDGrC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1553801261", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["30897505", "22335608", "10520045"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33643540"}

Learning can be viewed as a search problem in the space of all possible hypotheses. Given a background knowledge, a set of positive examples and a set of negative examples, expressed in First Order Logic, one has to find a hypothesis which covers all positive examples and none of the negative ones. This problem is NP-hard even if the language to represent hypotheses is propositional logic. When FOL hypotheses are used, this complexity is combined with the complexity of evaluating hypotheses. This book describes an evolutionary algorithm for ILP. The algorithm, called ECL (for Evolutionary Concept Learner), evolves a population of Horn clauses by repeated selection, mutation and optimization of more fit clauses. ECL relies on four greedy mutation operators for searching the hypothesis space, and employs an optimization phase that follows each mutation.

In this work we propose the guided random forest (GRF) for feature selection. Similar to a feature selection method called guided regularized random forest (GRRF), GRF is built using the importance scores from an ordinary RF. However, the trees in GRRF are built sequentially, are highly correlated and do not allow for parallel computing, while the trees in GRF are built independently and can be implemented in parallel. Experiments on 10 high-dimensional gene data sets show that, with a fixed parameter value (without tuning the parameter), RF applied to features selected by GRF outperforms RF applied to all features on 9 data sets and 7 of them have significant differences at the 0.05 level. Therefore, both accuracy and interpretability are significantly improved. GRF selects more features than GRRF, however, leads to better classification accuracy. Note in this work the guided random forest is guided by the importance scores from an ordinary random forest, however, it can also be guided by other methods such as human insights (by specifying i). GRF can be used in \u201cRRF\u201d v1.4 (and later versions), a package that also includes the regularized random forest methods.

Moreover, independently of how well an imaging system is, the performance of the imaging equipment usually comes to a certain limit through different physical devices. Additional interferences arise (particularly for medical imaging systems), for example, limited acquisition times, sophisticated and costly equipment and patients with severe medical conditions, which also cause image degradation. The acquisitions can be considered as the degraded version of the original high-quality images. ::: ::: In this dissertation, we explore the problems of image super-resolution and cross-modality synthesis for one Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modality from an image of another MRI modality of the same subject using an image synthesis framework for reconstructing the missing/complex modality data. We develop models and techniques that allow us to connect the domain of source modality data and the domain of target modality data, enabling transformation between elements of ::: the two domains. In particular, we first introduce the models that project both source modality data and target modality data into a common multi-modality feature space in a supervised setting. This common space then allows us to connect cross-modality features that depict a relationship between each other, and we can impose the learned association function that synthesizes any target modality image. Moreover, we develop a weakly-supervised method that takes a few registered multi-modality image pairs as training data and generates the desired modality data without being constrained a large number of multi-modality images collection of well-processed (\\textit{e.g.}, skull-stripped and strictly registered) brain data. Finally, we propose an approach that provides a generic way of learning a dual mapping between source and target domains while considering both visually high-fidelity synthesis and task-practicability. We demonstrate that this model can be used to take any arbitrary modality and efficiently synthesize the desirable modality data in an unsupervised manner. ::: ::: We show that these proposed models advance the state-of-the-art on image super-resolution and cross-modality synthesis tasks that need jointly processing of multi-modality images and that we can design the algorithms in ways to generate the practically beneficial data to medical image analysis.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2887301360", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57862666"}

However, there is still challenging for detecting early cancer and cancer invasiveness simultaneously. In the paper, we presented a method to discover breast cancer dual-function biomarkers from LC/MS/MS plasma proteome which can discriminate not only cancer from normal breast but also invasive cancer from noninvasive cancer. The training set (Study A) and testing set (Study B) are each from plasma samples of 40 healthy women and 40 women diagnosed with breast cancer. Study A contains 30 invasive cancer samples and 10 non-invasive cancer samples, and Study B contains 23 invasive cancer samples, 8 non-invasive cancer samples, and 9 cancer samples with unknown type. First, we identified from Study A 21 differentially express biomarkers between normal and cancer. Then, we trained a Support Vector Machine with five-fold cross-validation for each combination of 5 out of the 21 biomarkers in the training set. Lastly, we found the optimal combination as best dual-function five biomarker panel. Further pathway analysis showed that the five biomarkers have strong connection with the complement and coagulation cascades pathway.

Nowadays, researchers have been approaching concept drift using unsupervised learning strategies, due to data streams are open-ended sequences of data which are extremely hard to label. Those approaches usually compute divergences of consecutive models obtained over time. However, those strategies tend to be imprecise as models are obtained by clustering algorithms that do not hold any stability property. By holding a stability property, clustering algorithms would guarantee that a change in clustering models correspond to actual changes in input data. This drawback motivated this work which proposes a new approach to model data streams by using a stable hierarchical clustering algorithm. Our approach also considers a data stream composed of a mixture of time-dependent and independent observations. Experiments were conducted using synthetic data streams under different behaviors.

Such functions are often associated with floodplain vegetation. Frequent monitoring of floodplain land cover is necessary to capture the dynamics of this vegetation. However, low classification accuracies are found with existing methods, especially for relatively similar vegetation types, such as grassland and herbaceous vegetation. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery has great potential to improve the classification of these vegetation types owing to its high spatial resolution and flexibility in image acquisition timing. This study aimed to evaluate the increase in classification accuracy obtained using multitemporal UAV images versus single time step data on floodplain land cover classification and to assess the effect of varying the number and timing of imagery acquisition moments. We obtained a dataset of multitemporal UAV imagery and field reference observations and applied object-based Random Forest classification (RF) to data of different time step combinations. High overall accuracies (OA) exceeding 90% were found for the RF of floodplain land cover, with six vegetation classes and four non-vegetation classes. Using two or more time steps compared with a single time step increased the OA from 96.9% to 99.3%. The user's accuracies of the classes with large similarity, such as natural grassland and herbaceous vegetation, also exceeded 90%. The combination of imagery from June and September resulted in the highest OA (98%) for two time steps.

Hence, these anomaly datasets are small and imbalanced, and a robust framework is required for such datasets. This paper proposes a Salient Textural Anomaly Proposal (STAP) framework to generate and classify salient textural proposals of regions of anomalies on metal surfaces. These anomalies have both salient and texture characteristics that are dependent on the properties of the metal surface. Furthermore, when observed across different lighting conditions, the anomalies in this AVI anomaly dataset have a small inter-class variance and large intraclass variance. The proposed STAP framework uses a Fourier transformation based technique to generate proposals of salient and textural anomaly regions. Transfer learning of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) learned from a large dataset is used to train a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the generated proposals.

However, collaborative filtering usually suffers from limited performance due to the sparsity of user-item interaction. To address this issue, auxiliary information is usually used to improve the performance. Transfer learning provides the key idea of using knowledge from auxiliary domains. An assumption of transfer learning in collaborative filtering is that the source domain is a full rating matrix, which may not hold in many real-world applications. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage rating patterns from multiple incomplete source domains to improve the quality of recommender systems. First, by exploiting the transferred learning, we compress the knowledge from the source domain into a cluster-level rating matrix. The rating patterns in the low-level matrix can be transferred to the target domain. Specifically, we design a knowledge extraction method to enrich rating patterns by relaxing the full rating restriction on the source domain. Finally, we propose a robust multiple-rating-pattern transfer learning model for cross-domain collaborative filtering, which is called MINDTL, to accurately predict missing values in the target domain.

This paper aims to develop an efficient lung nodule detection scheme by performing nodule segmentation through multiscale wavelet based edge detection and morphological operations; classification by using a machine learning technique called Support Vector Machine (SVM).

With the first version of Mood Cloud [1], we could visualize in realtime the mood prediction of different Support Vector Machine models (one for each \u2019basic\u2019 mood). This helped to understand how well we can predict the mood evolution in time. Version 2.0 enables a new 2D visualization based social network data (see [2] for more details) and adds retrieval features. In this representation, we can visualize one\u2019s collection, observe the mood evolution of a song in time, and draw a path to make a playlist or retrieve a song based its time evolution. This 2D space is flexible, one can choose between different templates. the most innovative one being the representation extracted from social networks called semantic mood space [2]. The 2D semantic mood space was obtained using Self-Organizing Maps on tag data from last.fm. Each song of one\u2019s collection is mapped into the semantic mood space using its tags. Other modes and representations are proposed. If the tags are not available, we can use the autotagger function, which automatically adds tag to the piece and so place it in the semantic space. This technique is also used to evaluate the mood evolution of one song dividing it in segments of a few seconds. Additionally, pre-computed audio mood models are available (the updated models from Mood Cloud 1.0), which are state-of-the-art mood classification algorithms. For these models, the 2D representation can be changed using different axis. We allow the user to change the two dimensions, selecting between the existing audio models in Mood Cloud 1.0 (happy, sad, aggressive, relax and party). One can visualize his collection in the agressive/sad or relaxed/happy spaces for instance. With both the autotagger and the mood models, any collection can be mapped and browsed into a 2D space. By analyzing the songs in windows of a few seconds, we can visualize, in the same space, the instantaneous mood and its evolution during the song. Finally drawing a path into that space can be used to make a playlist or to search for a song with this particular mood evolution in time.

The establishment of an accurate and reliable forecasting soft computing model for this process is highly vital for water resource planning and management. The influence of the climatological environment on streamflow is central and studying its influence is very significant from the hydrology perspective. It has been noticed that the application of machine learning models considerably become predominant in solving and capturing the complexity of hydrological applications. This research presents the implementation of a novel hybrid model called Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline integrated with Differential Evolution (MARS-DE) to forecast streamflow pattern in semi-arid region. To achieve this, monthly time series streamflow data at Baghdad station, coordinated at Tigris River, Iraq, is inspected. For the model validation, Least Square Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) and standalone MARS models are conducted. To demonstrate the analysis of the undertaken models, several statistical indicators are computed to verify the modeling accuracies. Based on the achieved results, the MARS-DE model exhibited an excellent hybrid predictive modeling capability for monthly time scale streamflow in semi-arid region. Quantitatively; MARS-DE, LSSVR and MARS models achieved the minimum root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 46.64\u201335.25 m3/s, 57.50\u201349.20 m3/s and 78.01\u201362.65 m3/s, respectively.

In this work, we present an end-to-end synthetic neural network, containing a symmetric equilibrium generative adversarial network (SEGAN), multi-scale features refine blocks (MSFRB), and attention mechanism (AM) to enhance the performance on vessel segmentation. Method: The proposed network is granted powerful multi-scale representation capability to extract detail information. First, SEGAN constructs a symmetric adversarial architecture, which forces generator to produce more realistic images with local details. Second, MSFRB are devised to prevent high-resolution features from being obscured, thereby merging multi-scale features better. Finally, the AM is employed to encourage the network to concentrate on discriminative features. Results: On public dataset DRIVE, STARE, CHASEDB1, and HRF, we evaluate our network quantitatively and compare it with state-of-the-art works. The ablation experiment shows that SEGAN, MSFRB, and AM both contribute to the desirable performance.

Learning structural SVM classifier leads to a special instance of quadratic programming (QP) optimization with a huge number of constraints. The number of constraints is proportional to the cardinality of the output space which makes the QP task intractable by classical optimization methods. We propose a novel QP solver based on sequential minimal optimization (SMO). Unlike the original SMO, we propose a novel strategy for selecting variables to be optimized. The strategy aims at selecting such variables which yield the maximal improvement of optimization.

With cricket being a very dynamic game, bettors and bookies are incentivised to bet on the match results because it is a game that changes ball-by-ball. This paper investigates machine learning technology to deal with the problem of predicting cricket match results based on historical match data of the IPL. Influential features of the dataset have been identified using filter-based methods including Correlation-based Feature Selection, Information Gain (IG), ReliefF and Wrapper. More importantly, machine learning techniques including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Model Trees (classification via regression) have been adopted to generate predictive models from distinctive feature sets derived by the filter-based methods. Two featured subsets were formulated, one based on home team advantage and other based on Toss decision. Selected machine learning techniques were applied on both feature sets to determine a predictive model. Experimental tests show that tree-based models particularly Random Forest performed better in terms of accuracy, precision and recall metrics when compared to probabilistic and statistical models. However, on the Toss featured subset, none of the considered machine learning algorithms performed well in producing accurate predictive models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.aci.2019.11.006", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Computing and Informatics", "mag_id": "2991307550", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214300805"}

However, when using conventional incremental learning methods, its resources are often increased with learning, and continuing the execution of the incremental learning becomes difficult on small embedded systems. Moreover, for real applications, the response time should be reduced. This paper proposes a technique for implementing incremental learning methods on a budget. Normally, they proceed online learning by alternating recognition and learning, so that they cannot respond to the next new instance until the previous learning is finished. Unfortunately, their computational learining complexities are extremely high to realize a quick response to new input. Therefore, this paper introduces a multithreading technique for such learning schemes. The recognition and learning threads are executed in parallel so that the system can respond to a new instance even when it is in the progress of learning. Moreover, this paper shows that such multithreading learning schemes sometime need a \"sleep-period\" to complete the learning similar to a biological brain. During the \"sleep-period,\" the leaning system prohibits the receival of any sensory inputs and yielding outputs.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-46672-9_24", "venue": "ICONIP", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2527546101", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:34085501"}

The DILSVM classifier benefits from interpretability and it has visual appeal, since it can be represented as a collection of Likert scales, one for each feature, where we rate the level of agreement with the positive class. To construct the DILSVM classifier, we propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming approach, as well as a collection of strategies to reduce computational cost.

Clinical OEM procedures generate large datasets making their post procedural analysis a subjective and laborious task. There has been effort to automatically classify OEM frame sequences into relevant classes in aid of a fast and reliable diagnosis. Most existing classification approaches adopt established texture metrics, such as Local Binary Patterns (LBPs) derived from the regularly sampled grid images. However, due to the nature of image transmission through coherent fibre bundles, raw OEM data are sparsely and irregularly sampled, post-processed to a regularly sampled grid image format. This paper adapts Local Binary Patterns, a commonly used image texture descriptor, taking into consideration the sparse, irregular sampling imposed by the imaging fibre bundle on OEM images. The performance of Sparse Irregular Local Binary Patterns (SILBP) is assessed in conjunction with widely used classifiers, including Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and Linear Discriminant Analysis, for the detection of uninformative frames (i.e. noise and motion-artefacts) within pulmonary OEM frame sequences. Uninformative frames can comprise a considerable proportion of a dataset, increasing the resources required to analyse the data and impacting on any automated quantification analysis.
