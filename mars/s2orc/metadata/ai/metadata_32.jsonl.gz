In still images and video sequences, humans appear in different poses and views, fully visible and partly occluded, with varying distances to the camera, at different places, under different illumination conditions, etc. This diversity in appearance makes the task of human detection and identification to a particularly challenging problem. A possible solution of this problem is interesting for a wide range of applications such as video surveillance and content-based image and video processing. In order to detect humans in views ranging from full to close-up view and in the presence of clutter and occlusion, they are modeled by an assembly of several upper body parts. For each body part, a detector is trained based on a Support Vector Machine and on densely sampled, SIFT-like feature points in a detection window. For a more robust human detection, localized body parts are assembled using a learned model for geometric relations based on Gaussians. For a flexible human identification, the outward appearance of humans is captured and learned using the Bag-of-Features approach and non-linear Support Vector Machines. Probabilistic votes for each body part are combined to improve classification results. The combined votes yield an identification accuracy of about 80% in our experiments on episodes of the TV series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". The Bag-of-Features approach has been used in previous work mainly for object classification tasks. Our results show that this approach can also be applied to the identification of humans in video sequences.

This paper presents a new method for tumor classification using gene expression data. In the proposed method, we first select genes using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). In order to improve the performance of classification, Symmetry NMF (SymNMF) is used in this approach. Then, features are extracted from the selected genes by virtue SymNMF. As a last step, an efficient machine learning approach is used to classify the tumor samples using the extracted features. In order for a better classification, Support Vector Machine with Weighted Kernel Width (WSVM) is used in this classification approach. The performance of the proposed approach is tested using colon cancer data set and the acute leukemia data set. It is observed from the experimental results that the proposed approach provides better performance when compared with the traditional approaches.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508193", "venue": "2013 International Conference on Information Communication and Embedded Systems (ICICES)", "journal": "2013 International Conference on Information Communication and Embedded Systems (ICICES)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2072831163", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["25893527", "2914506", "24138663", "5944210", "15983607", "15321525", "2311891", "2914506", "14791297", "2914506", "16051477", "17627549", "16538498", "16051477", "33197934", "14290622", "18340548", "16051477", "10652342", "13799231", "9595142", "4428232", "2064887", "16051477", "28637672", "9061359", "10652342"], "inbound_citations": ["706827", "210973635", "22658663", "210717770", "10677655", "7078248", "21623419", "42855419"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18939547"}

The new framework is devised based on the one-versus-all (OVA) binarization technique. Unlike most previous work, BBO employs boosting for solving the hard-to-learn instances and oversampling for handling the class-imbalance problem arising due to OVA binarization. These two features make BBO different from other existing works.

The classifier agent employs in its training concepts of Self-Organized Maps and Multiple Instance Learning. The motivation for this proposal was the need of a classifier for the processing of signals from partial discharges (PD) in electrical power systems. The monitoring of these signals allows building a database that can be a reference for the detection of failures in equipment and thus support predictive maintenance routines. The simplicity of calculations, which are based on the Manhattan distance (City Block metric), makes it very suitable for use in embedded systems, field-programmable-logic based systems (e. g. FPGAs) and application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Further improvements can be achieved with pipelining and parallelism techniques, leading to significant maximization of sample rates. The classifier can operate with multiple classes without requiring complex configurations. Other advantages include automatic fitting to the complexity of the problem, the ability to deal with input vectors with different characteristics (inheritance of multiple instance learning) and, depending on implementation, it may be easily upgraded to allow operation with new input patterns (other than those used in the initial training). To evaluate the proposal, we used a set of PD databases obtained by simulations and laboratory measurements. We performed comparisons with standard form classifiers based on Multilayer Perceptrons and Support Vector Machines.

Hence in this study an algorithm has been developed to select GCM predictors in a subseasonal to seasonal time scale. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was used to find statistically independent signals of CGCM3 variables in the 4 x 7 grid cells covering the Willamette river basin in Oregon, USA. Using the multi-linear regression cross validation (MLR-CV) the GCM predictors were selected for each period. The selected predictors were then applied to train the ANFIS (Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System) and the SVM (Support Vector Machine) models, and their performances were assessed on the test data. To design more robust networks that are less dependent on training data set, the cross validation was performed. Predictors with the best performance for each season in the test set (using both ANFIS and SVM models) were selected for that specific season. Employing the ICA allowed reducing the size of many dependent GCM variables in 28 grid cells considerably resulting in higher accuracy in downscaling and more effectiveness in the procedure. The uncertainties are then analyzed from the combination of 5 downscaling techniques including SVM, MLR and 3 different ANFIS models.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1061/41114(371)467", "venue": "World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2010", "journal": "World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2010", "mag_id": "2328469502", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129974592"}

The objective of this work is to develop a Computer-Aided Diagnosis system (CAD) for an automated classification of EndoVascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) progression from Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) images. The CAD system is based on the extraction of texture features from segmented thrombus aneurysm samples and a posterior classification. Image segmentation is produced by an interactive Active Learning procedure based on Random Forest (RF) classification.. An initial set of labeled points are required to start training an RF. The human operator is presented with the most uncertain unlabeled voxels to select some of them for inclusion in the training set, retraining the RF classifier. Three texture-analysis methods such as the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), the gray level run length matrix (GLRLM), and the gray level difference method (GLDM), were applied to each ROI to obtain texture features. Classification of the ROI is carried out by an ensemble of SVM classifiers (ECs). The final decision is based on the application of a voting scheme across the outputs of the individual SVMs. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation and the average of accuracy (93.84% \u00b1 0.29), sensitivity (94.72 \u00b1 0.23), and specificity (91.48 \u00b1 0.35) results.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-00846-2_46", "venue": "XIII Mediterranean Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing 2013", "journal": "XIII Mediterranean Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing 2013", "mag_id": "2181732960", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62004834"}

However, these models cannot be directly applied on image/video sequences because of an intrinsic drawback- the reconstructions might be independently realistic, but, when visualized as a sequence, often lacks fidelity to the original uncorrupted sequence. The fundamental reason is that these methods try to find the best matching latent space representation near to natural image manifold without any explicit distance based loss. In this paper, we present a semantically conditioned Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for sequence inpainting. The conditional information constrains the GAN to map a latent representation to a point in image manifold respecting the underlying pose and semantics of the scene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which simultaneously addresses consistency and correctness of generative model based inpainting. We show that our generative model learns to disentangle pose and appearance information; this independence is exploited by our model to generate highly consistent reconstructions. The conditional information also aids the generator network in GAN to produce sharper images compared to the original GAN formulation. This helps in achieving more appealing inpainting performance. Though generic, our algorithm was targeted for inpainting on faces.

Bartlett\u2019s experiments suggested that, in understanding and remembering stories, humans relate the (new) material they hear or read to familiar schemata of related past experiences they have already developed. Thus, there is no need for the memorization of detail, neither of the exact form and structure of the story. An important aspect of the original formulation of his schema theory is the fact that schemas are not static and deterministic, but rather \"active\" and \"developing\" structures (Bartlett 1932). Recently, a number of experimental psychological findings have replicated and augmented Bartlett\u2019s original theories, e.g. (Alba & Hasher 1983). These studies have been devoted to distortions of memory due to memory-based perception and understanding (Schacter et al. 1995) but most relevantly to \"natural summarization\" processes in human memory. For instance, experiments on the recall of baseball stories have indicated that the omission of a summarizing sentence from the text leads subjects familiar with the subject matter to add a similar sentence in recall, up to the point of a false positive memory (Arkes & Freedman 1984). Of related interest is a phenomenon of lexical memory which may be dubbed \"natural keyword abstraction\": when given a list of words such as \"chocolate, bitter, cake, honey, sour\", subjects recall the semantically related word \"sweet\" together with the actually presented words, or even with a higher probability (Roediger & McDermott 1995). There have been a number of ways whereby psychologists and neuropsychologists have attempted to deal with the general human faculty of memorization. Again, recent accounts have found evidence for a distinction between general, \"source-free\" information encoding and the creation of full, episodic memories that include source encoding, personal memory, and emotive experience (Eichenbaum 1997). In fact, source encoding, i.e. the verbatim retention of linguistic material, is an additional process which is rarely used in the context of story understanding; the activation of schematic memory leading to natural summarization of a text is the norm. Along the same lines, neurobiological research has indicated the complementary role of the hippocampus and the neocortex in registering new experiences and integrating them into old ones (McClelland et al. 1995). The hippocampus encodes a new experience in some encapsulated form, also providing guidance to the neocortex as regards the formation of an enlarged representation for it in the context of the existing schemata of categories of experiences. These schemata are not static: a recurrence of the same or similar experiences has to be effected in order for a category to emerge. Thus learning takes place very slowly in the neocortex, involving gradual changes in the connections of specific of its neuron assemblies. The hippocampus, in contrast, encodes each new experience by way of a very fast process of synaptic change, possibly as a collection of \"addresses\" in the neocortex where the full details regarding the experience are to be found. These details, however, do not refer to individual experiences in the neocortex, but rather to classes of them; in other words, a type of generalization takes place in the neocortex. Consequently, the hippocampus can be considered to be the register of semantic and \"episodic\" or short-term memory, whereas the neocortex is the locus of conceptual, source-free and long-term memory. These constitute the bottomup and the top-down aspects, respectively, in memory. The issue that is contentious is the way these two processes integrate for any specific case, leading to natural", "year": 1998, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "173096343", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["140375419", "60993130", "2832081"], "inbound_citations": ["56137043"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14721970"}

Despite the vast literature, there is still a lack of methods able to tackle the hierarchical multilabel classification (HMC) task exploiting entirely ANNs. Here we propose AWX, a novel approach that aims to fill this gap. AWX is a versatile component that can be used as output layer of any ANN, whenever a fixed structured output is required, as in the case of HMC. AWX exploits the prior knowledge on the output domain embedding the hierarchical structure directly in the network topology. The information flows from the leaf terms to the inner ones allowing a jointly optimization of the predictions. Different options to combine the signals received from the leaves are proposed and discussed.

In this paper, we propose a new incremental learning approach for the travel time prediction problem for taxi GPS data streams in different scenarios and compare the same with four other existing methods. An extensive performance evaluation using four real life datasets indicate that when the drop-off location is known and the training data sizes are small to moderate the Support Vector Regression method is the best choice considering both prediction accuracy and total computation time. However when the training data size becomes large the Randomized K-Nearest Neighbor Regression with Spherical Distance becomes the method of choice. Even when the drop-off location is unknown then the Support Vector Regression method is the best choice when the training data size is small to moderate while for large training data size the Linear Regression method is a good choice. Finally, when continuous prediction of remaining travel time and continuous updating of total travel time along the trajectory of a trip are considered we find that the Support Vector Regression method has the best predictive accuracy.

To bridge this gap, we propose Flow-GANs, a generative adversarial network for which we can perform exact likelihood evaluation, thus supporting both adversarial and maximum likelihood training. When trained adversarially, Flow-GANs generate high-quality samples but attain extremely poor log-likelihood scores, inferior even to a mixture model memorizing the training data; the opposite is true when trained by maximum likelihood.

For example, GauGAN consumes 281G MACs per image, compared to 0.44G MACs for MobileNet-v3, making it difficult for interactive deployment. In this work, we propose a general-purpose compression framework for reducing the inference time and model size of the generator in cGANs. Directly applying existing CNNs compression methods yields poor performance due to the difficulty of GAN training and the differences in generator architectures. We address these challenges in two ways. First, to stabilize the GAN training, we transfer knowledge of multiple intermediate representations of the original model to its compressed model, and unify unpaired and paired learning. Second, instead of reusing existing CNN designs, our method automatically finds efficient architectures via neural architecture search (NAS). To accelerate the search process, we decouple the model training and architecture search via weight sharing. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across different supervision settings (paired and unpaired), model architectures, and learning methods (e.g., pix2pix, GauGAN, CycleGAN).

However, Learn++ suffers from an inherent ldquooutvotingrdquo problem when asked to learn a new class omeganew introduced by a subsequent data set, as earlier classifiers not trained on this class are guaranteed to misclassify omeganew instances. The collective votes of earlier classifiers, for an inevitably incorrect decision, then outweigh the votes of the new classifiers' correct decision on omeganew instances-until there are enough new classifiers to counteract the unfair outvoting. This forces Learn++ to generate an unnecessarily large number of classifiers. This paper describes Learn++ .NC, specifically designed for efficient incremental learning of multiple new classes using significantly fewer classifiers. To do so, Learn ++.NC introduces dynamically weighted consult and vote (DW-CAV) , a novel voting mechanism for combining classifiers: individual classifiers consult with each other to determine which ones are most qualified to classify a given instance, and decide how much weight, if any, each classifier's decision should carry. Experiments on real-world problems indicate that the new algorithm performs remarkably well with substantially fewer classifiers, not only as compared to its predecessor Learn++, but also as compared to several other algorithms recently proposed for similar problems.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "19109088", "doi": "10.1109/TNN.2008.2008326", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2161208102", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12438987", "15831159", "14190699", "15520573", "18921506", "9348769", "9744011", "45831778", "1415475", "17883456", "3223695", "15662659", "106617047", "6334230", "7929038", "12981714", "35424500", "8799873", "17290193", "14522914", "12141636", "25972504", "751312", "11506391", "28809202", "2743403", "33776987", "2598817", "26717833", "206089636", "36041553", "16821651", "63751177", "572361", "5895004", "8412354", "1991617", "61437731", "45176259", "8304000", "15455464", "207738357", "6644398", "14669208", "14696807", "7781709", "11251131", "7800844", "828651", "6442322", "2811715", "11868540", "13177510", "61488153", "6678794", "9540505", "14552466", "93063500", "209099422", "1559729"], "inbound_citations": ["2341372", "9520676", "7663509", "21604391", "9136731", "212999", "13777182", "23072045", "17213304", "58672980", "57757478", "13246549", "214692159", "46823068", "23869788", "36576366", "22171346", "20071784", "206596260", "203655262", "26659475", "14419395", "14867461", "20514241", "5556391", "18501879", "7727407", "554327", "14066081", "54218444", "7873133", "18891926", "18825755", "34985197", "6150096", "14602202", "16713896", "195784129", "21996331", "2507445", "15307923", "201050810", "563756", "202727184", "57380045", "37671460", "38316387", "15112519", "20522266", "18235360", "32327745", "14195420", "62442372", "211572588", "36303447", "6606186", "51614694", "35261570", "27601506", "16879732", "67856156", "204801077", "11095784", "12995652", "13914027", "205712624", "206553523", "6215120", "12590342", "6649459", "5063261", "14322423", "16514880", "3632175", "15425655", "1041168", "203605472", "19714686", "17930389", "85498914", "160020575", "15460812", "15703962", "54496609", "44202256", "18439968", "208607941", "15582885", "14969151", "9975560", "16924145", "1161030", "7634271", "36842511", "36842511", "17858716", "15178026", "1832305", "13243415", "18508087", "5555490", "49303229", "2490863", "51738004", "15757649", "14328631", "18985613", "5244557", "129072830"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10725353"}

In this paper, we address the problem by visually removing raindrops, and thus transforming a raindrop degraded image into a clean one. The problem is intractable, since first the regions occluded by raindrops are not given. Second, the information about the background scene of the occluded regions is completely lost for most part. To resolve the problem, we apply an attentive generative network using adversarial training. Our main idea is to inject visual attention into both the generative and discriminative networks. During the training, our visual attention learns about raindrop regions and their surroundings. Hence, by injecting this information, the generative network will pay more attention to the raindrop regions and the surrounding structures, and the discriminative network will be able to assess the local consistency of the restored regions. This injection of visual attention to both generative and discriminative networks is the main contribution of this paper.

Simultaneous consideration of these objectives makes online distributed scheduling a very challenging problem. Prior distributed scheduling approaches are limited to shared memory or primarily use work-stealing across distributed memory nodes for load-balancing or depend on the programmer specified affinity. However, the performance of affinity driven scheduling and work stealing based algorithms degrades when the input is irregular(UTS) and/or sparse. In this paper we present a novel adaptive distributed scheduling algorithm (ALDS) for multi-place parallel computations, that uses a unique combination of remote (inter-place) spawns and remote work steals to reduce the overheads in the scheduler, which helps to dynamically maintain load balance across the compute nodes of the system, while ensuring affinity maximally. Using parallel machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Regression running concurrently with program execution on the target architecture, ALDS can automatically and adaptively tune the parameters for scalable performance.

This disease is clinically silent to a very advanced stage. Thus, only a screening procedure can diagnose its pathology early enough to slow its progression. Due to the known fact that pathology of this disease is characterized by an increase of ammonia concentration in breath, its monitoring with a portable system can be a simple way for a noninvasive and early diagnostic on site. To realize such a system a new specific conductometric array of 11 different polyaniline nanocomposite sensors is used, based on the electronic nose principles. This approach allows bypass sensor weaknesses (sensor drift and sensitivity to humidity) and to determine ammonia in the typical concentration range of human breath (500 ppb\u20132100 ppb). In particular, polyaniline based nanocomposites with either titanium dioxide, chitosan or carbon nanotubes are used to provide different sensitivities and response times. This allows associating a single pattern of sensor responses to a concentration range. Maximum variation of resistance, derivative and integral values are extracted from the response curves of each sensor. Common classifiers are then tested and a selection feature algorithm is used.

It is indeed challenging to categorize fine-grained image classes merely in terms of a single level classifier given the subtle inter-class visual differences. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a two stage framework where i) the image categories are represented hierarchically in terms of a binary tree structure where different subset of classes are present in the non-leaf nodes of the tree. This is accomplished in an automatic fashion considering the available training data in the visual domain, and ii) a (non-leaf) node specific metric learning is further deployed for the categories constituting a given node, thus enforcing better separation between both of its children. Subsequently, we construct (non-leaf) node specific binary classifiers in the learned metric spaces on which testing is henceforth carried out by following the outcomes of the classifiers sequence from root to leaf nodes of the tree. By separately focusing on the semantically similar classes at different levels of the hierarchy, it is expected that the classifiers in the learned metric spaces possess better discriminative capabilities than considering all the classes at a single go.

Each water body can contain dramatically different levels of pollution. Water quality issues influence human and environmental health, so the more we monitor our water the better we will be able to recognize and prevent contamination problems. This paper presents the performance evaluation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification techniques using Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DSTE) combination data fusion in monitoring of water quality. Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DSTE) was applied to increase the classification accuracy. This study involved the evaluation and interpretation of surface water quality data in Tilesdit dam (Algeria). It also allowed us to obtain more advanced information about water quality, and to design a monitoring network for this study area. The ANN and SVM which are two techniques for pattern classification have been widely used in many application areas such as water quality monitoring. These methods are binary classification techniques, but in some cases, such as pattern recognition, we need more than two classes. One of the suggested solutions for this difficulty is to split the problem into a set of binary classification before combining them. A multi-class problem using ANN and SVM is a typical example for solving the mentioned problem. The MLP network and the algorithm of SVM, one-against-all, are the most popular strategies for multi-class problems. In order to manage the conflict that results from using both approaches, the final decision is performed using DSTE's rule combination based on probabilistic output from both the two classifiers. In this work, four physicochemical parameters in 4 seasons during the period 2009\u20132011, located at Tilesdit dam in Bouira (Algeria), were selected for the purpose of this study, such as temperature, pH, conductivity and turbidity to supervise water quality. In order to evaluate their performances, a simulation using real dataset, corresponding to the recognition rate (training and test), is carried out. The results are compared to get the best performance evaluation of classification process which depends strongly on the choice of the excellent characteristics in training phase. The data fusion method improved significantly the performance of the intelligent approach in water quality classification.

The main attention in the present study is paid to the quantification of monitoring network clustering, modelling of spatial correlations, conditional stochastic simulations and risk mapping and application of statistical learning theory for regional classification. Regularised variography helps to improve the visibility of spatial structures on variograms of both raw and transformed data. Once modelled, the spatial correlation structures of data (variograms) are used to produce traditional maps with ordinary kriging. Due to the spatial variability of data, kriging induce a strong smoothing effect that make this approach only suitable for", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "EnviroInfo", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2501043287", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131920970"}

This paper proposed an objective performance evaluation approach from annual field-survey data through Random Forests and IN-PROMETHEE II methods together. Random Forests method is employed to predict performance values under selected criteria as the single-valued performance scores.

Our basic tools for soft computing are fuzzy relational calculus (FRC) and floating point genetic algorithm (GA). We introduce a new interpretation of multidimensional fuzzy implication (MFI) (see Eq. (A.4) of Appendix-A) to represent our knowledge about the training data set. The said new interpretation and the notion of an induced fuzzy pattern vector to handle the fuzzy information granules of the quantized pattern space, were considered for the classifier design of Chap. 3. We have already experienced that the construction of the pattern classifier is essentially based on the estimate of a fuzzy relation \\( \\Re_{i} \\) between the antecedent clause and consequent clause of each one dimensional fuzzy implication. But the only difference between the design study of Chaps. 3 and 4 is that for the estimation of \\( \\Re_{i} \\) in this chapter we use floating point representation of genetic algorithm (GA) (Michalewicz in Genetic algorithm + data structures = evolution programs, Springer, New York, 1994). Thus, a set of fuzzy relations is formed from the new interpretation of MFI. This set of fuzzy relations is termed as the core of the pattern classifier. Once the classifier is constructed the non-fuzzy features of a test pattern can be classified. The performance of the proposed scheme is tested on synthetic data. Subsequently, we use the proposed scheme for the vowel classification problem of an Indian language. Finally, a benchmark of performance is established by considering MLP (Multilayer Perceptron), SVM (Support Vector Machine) and the present method.

Carbon dioxide produced as a by-product in ethylene oxide reactor is removed by the Benfield process. In this process, the carbonate and bicarbonate ratio in lean carbonate solution is considered as an important quality control (QC) variable as the efficiency of carbon dioxide removal largely depends on it. In the event of a process malfunction or operating under suboptimal condition, the CO2 content in the cycle gas loop will continue to rise until corrective action is taken after obtaining lab results for carbonate and bicarbonate ratio. This time consuming sampling process can be overcome by implementing a technological solution in form of an accurate and robust mathematical model capable of real time QC variable prediction. For well understood processes, the structure of the correlation for QC variables as well as the choice of the inputs may be well known in advance. However, the Benfield process is too complex and the appropriate form of the correlation and choice of input variables are not obvious. Here, knowledge of the processes, operating experience and statistical methods were applied in developing the soft sensor. This paper describes a systematic approach to the development of inferential measurements of carbonate and bicarbonate ratio using Support Vector Regression (SVR) analysis. Given historical process data, a simple SVR-based soft sensor model is found capable of identifying and capturing the cause and effect relationship between operating variables (model inputs) and QC variables (model outputs). Special care was taken to choose input variables, so that the final correlation and regression coefficient make senses from process engineering point of view.

These forest types have not sufficiently been mapped and changes in the extent or quality of these habitats can therefore not be effectively monitored. Compared to traditional surveying methods, remote sensing can be used to map these inaccessible areas over regional extents. This study investigated which season would provide the best discrimination of six evergreen tree species, associated with swamp (Ficus Trichopoda), mangrove (Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Hibiscus tiliaceus), wetlands in adjacent woodlands (Syzygium cordatum) and coastal floodplain systems (Ficus sycomorus), using leaf-level hyperspectral data.

The classification accuracy for each season was evaluated in the WEKA software using the Random Forest classification algorithm. When the data was upscaled to canopylevel, the results showed that all four seasons produced overall accuracies of > 90%. Spring, summer and autumn produced the highest overall accuracy of 94.7%, whereas the overall accuracy for winter was 89.5%. The results of the leaf-level analysis showed a decrease in accuracy of between 4 \u2013 11% for the four seasons. Similar to other studies, our results showed that the simulated object-oriented approach showed a higher level in accuracy compared to the pixel-level approach.

Patients suffering from panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG) often exhibit an increased perception of bodily sensations. The purpose of this investigation was to assess whether multivariate classification applied to an fMRI interoception paradigm can predict individual responses to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in PD/AG. Methods: This analysis is based on pretreatment fMRI data during an interoceptive challenge from a multi-center trial of the German PANIC-NET. Patients with DSM-IV PD/AG were dichotomized as responders (n = 30) or non-responders (n = 29) based on the primary outcome (Hamilton Anxiety scale reduction \u2265 50%) after 6 weeks of CBT (2 h/week). fMRI parametric maps were used as features for response classification with linear support vector machines (SVM) with or without automated feature selection. Predictive accuracies were assessed using cross validation and permutation testing. The influence of methodological parameters and the predictive ability for specific interoception-related symptom-reduction were further evaluated. Results: SVM did not reach sufficient overall predictive accuracies (38.0 to 54.2%) for anxiety reduction in the primary outcome. In the exploratory analyses better accuracies (66.7%) were achieved for predicting interoception-specific symptom relief as an alternative outcome domain. Subtle information regarding this alternative response criterion but not the primary outcome was revealed by post-hoc univariate comparisons. Conclusions: In contrast to reports on other neurofunctional probes, SVM based on an interoception paradigm was not able to reliably predict individual response to CBT.

The generator produces an image with multiple category-specific instance providers, a layout module and a composition module. Firstly, each provider independently outputs a category-specific instance image with a soft mask. Then the provided instances\u2019 poses are corrected by the layout module. Lastly, the composition module combines these instances into a final image. Training with adversarial loss and penalty for mask area, each provider learns a mask that is as small as possible but enough to cover a complete category-specific instance. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods widely use grouping cues modeling the association between image parts, which are either artificially designed or learned with costly segmentation labels or only modeled on local pairs. Unlike them, our method automatically models the dependence between any parts and learns instance segmentation. We apply our framework in two cases: (1) Foreground segmentation on category-specific images with box-level annotation. (2) Unsupervised learning of instance appearances and masks with only one image of homogeneous object cluster (HOC).

Previous methods for shadow detection focus on learning the local appearance of shadow regions, while using limited local context reasoning in the form of pairwise potentials in a Conditional Random Field. In contrast, the proposed adversarial approach is able to model higher level relationships and global scene characteristics. We train a shadow detector that corresponds to the generator of a conditional GAN, and augment its shadow accuracy by combining the typical GAN loss with a data loss term. Due to the unbalanced distribution of the shadow labels, we use weighted cross entropy. With the standard GAN architecture, properly setting the weight for the cross entropy would require training multiple GANs, a computationally expensive grid procedure.

However, the bar of developing high-quality TTS systems remains high since a sizable set of studio-quality pairs is usually required. Compared to commercial data used to develop state-of-the-art systems, publicly available data are usually worse in terms of both quality and size. Audio generated by TTS systems trained on publicly available data tends to not only sound less natural, but also exhibits more background noise. In this work, we aim to lower TTS systems' reliance on high-quality data by providing them the textual knowledge extracted by deep pre-trained language models during training. In particular, we investigate the use of BERT to assist the training of Tacotron-2, a state of the art TTS consisting of an encoder and an attention-based decoder. BERT representations learned from large amounts of unlabeled text data are shown to contain very rich semantic and syntactic information about the input text, and have potential to be leveraged by a TTS system to compensate the lack of high-quality data. We incorporate BERT as a parallel branch to the Tacotron-2 encoder with its own attention head. For an input text, it is simultaneously passed into BERT and the Tacotron-2 encoder. The representations extracted by the two branches are concatenated and then fed to the decoder. As a preliminary study, although we have not found incorporating BERT into Tacotron-2 generates more natural or cleaner speech at a human-perceivable level, we observe improvements in other aspects such as the model is being significantly better at knowing when to stop decoding such that there is much less babbling at the end of the synthesized audio and faster convergence during training.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1906.07307", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952127920", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["4689304", "5580515", "30919574", "206742911", "49882757", "3232238", "29231459", "59413863", "3626819", "40100965", "49313245", "52967399", "7961699", "1921173", "52130789", "57375789", "53145796", "3603249", "1114678", "1607434", "62230377", "24315469", "5637941", "53585388", "102352749"], "inbound_citations": ["209444942"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:190000985"}

A wide range of neural models, including classical as well as evolutive algorithms, has been considered. As the experimental results provided show, the use of artificial neural models for implementing the proposed classifier proves to overcome some of the limitations inherent to the traditional techniques considered when solving this task.", "year": 1997, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/BFb0032552", "venue": "IWANN", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1492173609", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["17747847", "26959754"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206848759"}

On the other hand, Support Vector Data Description is suitable for unbalanced datasets, but it is limited for only two class classification. To address the aforementioned issues, Support Vector Data Description based machine learning model is formulated with Binary Tree for multi-classification problems (e.g. multi fault classification or fault severity recognition, etc.) in machinery fault diagnosis. The binary tree structure of multiple clusters is firstly drawn based on the order of cluster-to-cluster distances calculated by Mahalanobis distance. Support Vector Data Description model is then applied to Binary Tree structure from top to bottom for classification.

Adding the Laplacian penalty constrain for the multiview feature learning, the proposed MSDA is first proposed to extract the cross-modality 2D-3D face features. The MSDA aims at finding a multiview learning based common discriminative feature space and it can then fully utilize the underlying relationship of features from different views. To speed up the learning phase of the classifier, the recent popular algorithm named Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is adopted to train the single hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs).

However, most of the current deep-learning-based synthesis methods require large scales of paired data, which greatly limits their usage. Efforts have been made to relax such a restriction, and the cycle-consistent adversarial networks (Cycle-GAN) is an example to synthesize medical images with unpaired data. In Cycle-GAN, the cycle consistency loss is employed as an indirect structural similarity metric between the input and the synthesized images and often leads to mismatch of anatomical structures in the synthesized results. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose to (1) use the mutual information loss to directly enforce the structural similarity between the input MR and the synthesized CT image and (2) to incorporate the shape consistency information to improve the synthesis result.

Unlike the conventional methods, which generally are the statistical models with the observed crash counts as the dependent variables and the factors affecting the likelihood of a traffic crash as the independent variables, a dynamic state-space model with deep learning is proposed to analyze the traffic crashes. The proposed model includes three modules, an unsupervised feature learning module to identify functional network between the explanatory variables and the feature representations, a supervised fine tuning module to perform crash occurrence likelihood estimations, and a dynamic state-space module to perform crash count predictions. A multivariate Tobit model is incorporated in the supervised fine tuning module as the regression layer to account for the heterogeneity issues in correlated crash data. The results of deep learning are fed to the dynamic state-space model that contains a dynamic equation governing the state dynamics to improve the performances of estimation and prediction. The proposed model was applied to the dataset that was obtained from Knox County in Tennessee to validate the model effectiveness and efficiency. The results show that the proposed model has superior performances in terms of estimation and prediction power compared to the SVM and Random Forest (RF) models. The overall performances of the proposed model for all crashes show an 50.559% RMSD improvement over the SVM models and an 57.867% RMSD improvement over the RF models.

Such challenge stemmed mainly because students are granted the freedom to formulate and evaluate hypotheses in computer-based scientific inquiry learning environments, not all interactions can be useful to infer the student's engagement level.

An inevitable problem with the traditional VC framework is that the acoustic feature vector output from the conversion model is over-smoothing, which leads to a drop in the quality of the converted speech. This is because in the training phase of acoustic model, a specific probability model is used to model the distribution of data, so that the output of a relatively average parameter of the model is considered to be optimal. Acoustic parameter over-smoothing occurs as long as the analytical form of the model distribution is artificially designed. In order to overcome this problem, the VC framework proposed in this paper uses GANs as the modeling network of the acoustic model, directly uses a generator model to learn the distribution of data, and guides the generator through a discriminator model. The training of the model makes the sample distribution of the model close to the distribution of the target speaker data samples, thus alleviating the problem of over-smoothing of the converted speech spectrum. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to VC based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the sound quality and similarity of the converted speech.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ITAIC.2019.8785447", "venue": "2019 IEEE 8th Joint International Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence Conference (ITAIC)", "journal": "2019 IEEE 8th Joint International Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence Conference (ITAIC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2966660424", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4572119", "16280779", "6061550", "14206014", "19888176", "13526005", "10768395", "3777658", "12209503", "110233322", "62738959", "857142", "11022726"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199490494"}

Representing these maps in terms of meaningful entities is a step towards building semantic maps for autonomous robots. One approach is to segment the 3D maps into semantic objects using Conditional Random Fields (CRF), which requires large 3D ground truth datasets to train the classification model. Additionally, the CRF inference is often computationally expensive. In this paper, we present an unsupervised geometric-based approach for the segmentation of 3D point clouds into objects and meaningful scene structures. We approximate an input point cloud by an adjacency graph over surface patches, whose edges are then classified as being either on or off. We devise an effective classifier which utilises both global planar surfaces and local surface convexities for edge classification. More importantly, we propose a novel global plane extraction algorithm for robustly discovering the underlying planes in the scene. Our algorithm is able to enforce the extracted planes to be mutually orthogonal or parallel which conforms usually with human-made indoor environments.

The aim of this thesis is to enhance aspect level opinion extraction and representation. This study uses SentiWordNet lexical resource which is specifically built for opinion mining and widely used in sentiment analysis. This research introduces an approach using adjectives, verbs, adverbs and nouns (AVAN) which analyses all opinion word types for sentiment analysis and not only limited to adjectives and adverbs as have been conventionally done. SentiWordNet is used in this thesis to identify and analyze all word types for opinion extraction and representation. Opinion representation is enhanced by capturing key elements of opinions into predicates that consists of opinion word, strength, score and category in order to improve the opinion representation and classification. Then it further enhances the mining by introducing opinion accounting which summarizes opinion scores at various group levels. In addition, this thesis introduces a new concept called opinion strength which classifies opinions into degrees. An enhanced score is assigned to opinion based on the strength at which these opinions are expressed. Furthermore, as opinions are fuzzy in nature, this study shows that fuzzy logic is an effective technique to address opinion vagueness since human-like logic is fuzzy. This is important as opinions should not only be categorized in classical Boolean sentiments. This study identifies SentiWordNet, AVAN, Opinion Strength and fuzzy logic as classification features to classify customer reviews into a 5-class prediction model (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor and Very Poor ).

It has significance in civilian situations like excavation of trenches without damage to pipelines to military manoeuvres in mine-laden areas. Often information on buried pipes or mines are unavailable after passage of some time and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is fast emerging as an effective technique for these applications. The results, however, are not always encouraging and success depends on the combination of ground conditions, object geometry and material, antenna characteristics and, above all, on understanding of GPR response dependence on object and host medium parameters. This is an area where there is a need for further research. This study deals with detection of buried pipes. It is primarily intended to develop a satisfactory method to locate the pipes and to evolve guidelines for choice of appropriate antenna for a given location. Eight sites were carefully selected for evaluating GPR performance. These sites were selected because the buried pipes could be accessed for verification of their characteristics. These sites encompassed a range of cover materials above the pipes, pipe material types and dimensions. The cover types were paver blocks, stone slabs, concrete and bitumen. An important characteristic which helps in interpretation is the appearance of the hyperbolic frown. The approach for the pipe studies involves data collection using 200MHz and 400MHz frequency GPR antennae, extraction of the hyperbolic frown through Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classification and skeletonization. Relationships between depth to diameter ratio and hyperbola formation has been examined. Computation of the radius and depth of pipes was done by fitting a theoretical hyperbola over the observed one. Computed radius and depth are compared with ground truth values. The study shows that GPR response depends on frequency, cover material type and pipe material. As far as the hyperbola is concerned, it was seen to be good in case of paver block-concrete pipe and paver block-steel pipe combinations. Under concrete cover the results varied in quality. Under bitumen cover the results were unsatisfactory. In general, 400 MHz performed better.

GANs have achieved great results in realistic image generation, among other fields. Recently, stunning images have been produced. The theory and application of GANs has received much attention. However, the evaluation of these models has not been studied nearly as extensively. GANs are often evaluated by visual inspection. This is a time consuming process, that inherently suffers from being subjective. There has been research into quantitative metrics, which can be automated. There has even been some research into the relative merits of such metrics. [1][9][4]. However, the question which metric is the most suitable for evaluating GANs in the field of realistic image generation remains open. It is important that consensus is reached. If there is no agreed upon method of objectively measuring progress, it is hard to say which techniques are effective. This impedes the entire field of study. This paper hopes to contribute to answering this question by applying a variety of proposed metrics to a variety of different GANs. This way, it is possible to tell which metrics agree with each other, and which rate GANs differently. If all, or many, of the likely metrics proposed in earlier work agree with each other, this is a good sign that they are rating GANs objectively. The results of this experiment are combined with a very brief survey of earlier work, in order to recommend some quantitative metrics for rating GANs.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2955743295", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198331262"}

Accordingly, it is very relevant predicting air quality. Although the application of the machine learning (ML) models for predicting air quality parameters, such as PM concentrations, has been evaluated in previous studies, those on the spatial hazard modeling of them are very limited. Due to the high potential of the ML models, the spatial modeling of PM can help managers to identify the pollution hotspots. Accordingly, this study aims at developing new ML models, such as Random Forest (RF), Bagged Classification and Regression Trees (Bagged CART), and Mixture Discriminate Analysis (MDA) for the hazard prediction of PM10 (particles with a diameter less than 10 \u00b5m) in the Barcelona Province, Spain. According to the annual PM10 concentration in 75 stations, the healthy and unhealthy locations are determined, and a ratio 70/30 (53/22 stations) is applied for calibrating and validating the ML models to predict the most hazardous areas for PM10. In order to identify the influential variables of PM modeling, the simulated annealing (SA) feature selection method is used. Seven features, among the thirteen features, are selected as critical features. According to the results, all the three-machine learning (ML) models achieve an excellent performance (Accuracy > 87% and precision > 86%).

It is posted on arXiv.org in its original form in June 2016). Many recent object recognition systems have proposed using a two phase training procedure to learn sparse convolutional feature hierarchies: unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. Recent results suggest that these methods provide little improvement over purely supervised systems when the appropriate nonlinearities are included. This paper presents an empirical exploration of the space of learning procedures for sparse convolutional networks to assess which method produces the best performance. In our study, we introduce an augmentation of the Predictive Sparse Decomposition method that includes a discriminative term (DPSD). We also introduce a new single phase supervised learning procedure that places an L1 penalty on the output state of each layer of the network.

The density reconstruction is compromised by a variety of noise originating from observational conditions, galaxy number density fluctuations, and intrinsic galaxy properties.

We perform image-to-image translation using conditional GANs in order to produce noiseless lensing maps using the first-year data of the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. We train the conditional GANs by using 30000 sets of mock HSC catalogs that directly incorporate observational effects.

To deal with the above problems, based on the single-layer competitive learning of the incremental learning vector quantization(ILVQ) network, we propose a new incremental learning vector quantization method that merges together pattern density and classification error rate. By adopting a series of new competitive learning strategies, the proposed method can obtain an incremental prototype set from the original training set quickly by learning, inserting, merging, splitting and deleting these representative points adaptively. The proposed method can achieve a higher reduction efficiency while guaranteeing a higher classification accuracy synchronously for large-scale dataset. In addition, we improve the classical nearest neighbor classification algorithm by absorbing pattern density and classification error ratio of the final prototype neighborhood set into the classification decision criteria. The proposed method can generate an effective representative prototype set after learning the training dataset by a single pass scan, and hence has a strong generality.

The number of Android applications (apps) has seen a massive surge. Unsurprisingly, Android platform has also become the primary target of attackers. The management of the explosively expansive app markets has thus become an important issue. On the one hand, it requires effectively detecting malicious applications (malapps) in order to keep the malapps out of the app market. On the other hand, it needs to automatically categorize a big number of benign apps so as to ease the management, such as correcting an apps category falsely designated by the app developer. In this work, we propose a framework to effectively and efficiently manage a big app market in terms of detecting malapps and categorizing benign apps. We extract 11 types of static features from each app to characterize the behaviors of the app, and employ the ensemble of multiple classifiers, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest (RF), to detect malapps and to categorize benign apps. An alarm will be triggered if an app is identified as malicious. Otherwise, the benign app will be identified as a specific category. We evaluate the framework on a large app set consisting of 107,327 benign apps as well as 8,701 malapps.

Nowadays, it is becoming crucial to interpret the data of varying dimensionality correctly. Dimensionality reduction methods process the data in order to help visualize the data, reduce its complexity, or find latent representation of the original problem. The algorithms of nonlinear dimensionality reduction (also known as manifold learning) are used to decrease the dimensionality of the problem while preserving the general structure of the data. Both spectral methods (such as Laplacian Eigenmaps or ISOMAP) and nonlinear embedding algorithms (NLE, such as t-SNE or Elastic Embedding) have shown to provide very good nonlinear embedding of high-dimensional data sets. However, those methods are notorious for very slow optimization, practically preventing them from being used when a data set is bigger than few thousand points. In my thesis we investigate several techniques to improve different stages of nonlinear dimensionally algorithms. First, we analyze the entropic affinities as a better way to build a similarity matrix. We explore its properties and propose a nearly-optimal algorithm to construct them. Second, we present a novel faster method to optimize NLE by using second-order information during the optimization. Third, for spectral methods, we investigate landmark-based optimization that cleverly substitutes original large-scale problem with a much smaller easy-to-solve subproblem. Finally, we apply Fast Multipole Methods approximation that allows fast computation of the gradient and the objective function of NLE and reduces their computational complexity from O(N^2) to O(N).

By the virtue of Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), satisfied by many random ensembles, we propose a novel procedure for multilabel learning known as RIPML.

In our approach, we construct a piecewise planar model of the environment and determine curbs at plane segment boundaries. Initially, we sense the environment with a nodding laser range-finder and project the 3D measurements into an efficient Digital Elevation Map (DEM). Each cell of the DEM maintains an error model that is propagated throughout the entire algorithm. Plane segments are further estimated with a mixture of linear regression models on the DEM.

Specifically, we introduce Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) to perform event identification, classification, and their estimated uncertainty on data gathered at two active volcanoes, Mount St. Helens, Washington, USA, and Bezymianny, Kamchatka, Russia.

Hence, in addition to the concept drift, classification problems in streaming data environments are inherently imbalanced. However, streaming imbalanced and concept drifting problems in the power system and smart grid have rarely been studied. Incremental learning aims to learn the correct classification for the future unseen samples from the given streaming data. In this paper, we propose a new incremental ensemble learning method to handle both concept drift and class imbalance issues. The class imbalance issue is tackled by an imbalance-reversed bagging method that improves the true positive rate while maintains a low false positive rate. The adaptation to concept drift is achieved by a dynamic cost-sensitive weighting scheme for component classifiers according to their classification performances and stochastic sensitivities. The proposed method is applied to a case study for the electricity pricing in Australia to predict whether the price of New South Wales will be higher or lower than that of Victorias in a 24-h period.

Both of pixel-based and an object-based classification algorithms were assessed; the pixel-based approach employs Maximum Likelihood (ML), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and, the object-based classification uses the Nearest Neighbour (NN) classifier. Stratified Masking Process (SMP) that integrates a ranking process within the classes based on spectral fluctuation of the sum of the training and testing sites was implemented. An analysis of the overall and individual accuracy of the classification results of all four methods reveals that the SVM classifier was the most efficient overall by distinguishing most of the classes with the highest accuracy.

A computational machine is built to derive optimal parsimonious hybrid model of classifiers in intrusion detection based on the following classification methods, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbor, and Neural networks. The weighted voting fusion strategy for intrusion detection is assessed by experiments and its performances compared. The potentialities of classifiers fusion for the development of effective intrusion detection systems are evaluated and discussed.

The proposed technique assumes that the labeling cost of samples during ground survey depends on both the samples accessibility and the traveling time to the considered locations. Thus, it is not equal for the samples on the ground. Accordingly, the proposed method aims at selecting the most informative (the most uncertain and diverse) as well as cost-efficient samples at each iteration of the active learning process. This is accomplished according to three steps. In the first step the most uncertain unlabeled samples are selected by using the multiclass-level uncertainty technique. In the second step, the small (and important) portion of the image, in which the highest density of the most informative samples exists, is selected to effectively limit the study area. The objective of restricting the study area to a small portion of the image is to reduce the traveling time for labeling the samples. This is achieved on the basis of a novel clustering based approach. In the third step, uncertain samples that are diverse and cost-efficient are selected from the small portion of the image chosen at the second step. The selection of cost-efficient diverse samples is achieved on the basis of a genetic algorithm. Thanks to the second and third steps of the proposed CSAL technique, the cost of sample labeling is significantly reduced, while obtaining accurate classification maps. Experimental results show the success of the proposed CSAL method compared to the most promising literature active learning methods.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TyWRRS.2012.6381121", "venue": "2012 Tyrrhenian Workshop on Advances in Radar and Remote Sensing (TyWRRS)", "journal": "2012 Tyrrhenian Workshop on Advances in Radar and Remote Sensing (TyWRRS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2076724214", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["22733", "9612466", "17234861", "13053338", "531946", "40062872", "15122611", "6841707", "9961773", "14495716", "210076", "1479461", "118324434"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3722778"}

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies aims at improving transportation safety and mobility, reduce environmental impacts, and enhance productivity by utilizing the current available infrastructure.

Existing studies attempted to predict the clearance time of highway incidents through statistical modeling by fitting the incident features to their models. Unfortunately, the incident features are not available at the beginning of the incident. In this study, we develop efficient prediction models by training millions of real-time traffic and weather data from Florida Department of Transportation - District 4 (FDOT-D4), in conjunction with the crash data reported for the same period. Our models can predict the incident clearance time in real-time once the accident happens by using the real-time traffic data.

However, intricate details about the vehicle and the surrounding background provided by VHR images require sophisticated analysis based on massive data samples, though the number of reliable labeled training data is limited. In practice, data augmentation is often leveraged to solve this conflict. The traditional data augmentation strategy uses a combination of rotation, scaling, and flipping transformations, etc., and has limited capabilities in capturing the essence of feature distribution and proving data diversity. In this study, we propose a learning method named Vehicle Synthesis Generative Adversarial Networks (VS-GANs) to generate annotated vehicles from remote sensing images. The proposed framework has one generator and two discriminators, which try to synthesize realistic vehicles and learn the background context simultaneously. The method can quickly generate high-quality annotated vehicle data samples and greatly helps in the training of vehicle detectors. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can synthesize vehicles and their background images with variations and different levels of details. Compared with traditional data augmentation methods, the proposed method significantly improves the generalization capability of vehicle detectors.

In this dissertation, we focus on the evolutionary optimization of ART neural network architectures with the intent of optimizing the size and the generalization performance of the ART neural network.

This dissertation extends in many ways and expands in different directions the evolution of ART architectures, such as: (a) uses a multi-objective optimization of ART structures, thus providing to the user multiple solutions (ART networks) with varying degrees of merit, instead of a single solution (b) uses GA parameters that are adaptively determined throughout the ART evolution, (c) identifies a proper size of the validation set used to calculate the fitness function needed for ART's evolution, thus speeding up the evolutionary process, (d) produces experimental results that demonstrate the evolved ART's effectiveness (good accuracy and small size) and efficiency (speed) compared with other competitive ART structures, as well as other classifiers (CART (Classification and Regression Trees) and SVM (Support Vector Machines)). The overall methodology to evolve ART using a multi-objective approach, the chromosome representation of an ART neural network, the genetic operators used in ART's evolution, and the automatic adaptation of some of the GA parameters in ART's evolution could also be applied in the evolution of other exemplar based neural network classifiers such as the probabilistic neural network and the radial basis function neural network.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2250095235", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["14900053"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:112288637"}

Integrating energy generation in urban environments is interesting because that is where the most energy is consumed and avoids wasting energy in transport infrastructure. Renewable energies are often the easiest to integrate into these environments because they require less infrastructure and cause fewer problems related to noise, dirt, pollution, etc. The overall objective of this thesis is to develop data mining models to forecast solar global radiation 24 hours ahead and to use these predictions to evaluate the performance of photovoltaic systems. The specific objectives are: 1. Propose an index that allows us to remove the seasonal and daily trends observed in global hourly radiation data. 2. Analyze the different sources of meteorological variables that can be used to predict solar radiation and use API's to access external sources of meteorological data. 3. Develop data mining models that allow including the different relationships observed between the radiation values of the next day depending on the values of the current day radiation and other meteorological parameters. 4. Development of a web system that include the proposed models for short-term radiation forescasting and integrate the developed models in the evaluation models of photovoltaic systems. Chapter 3 introduces the methods and models used in this work (Cumulative Probability Distribution Function, Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines). Also classification methods are presented (Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines for Classification). Performance metrics are presented to measure the accuracy of the proposed models. The data sets and data sources used in this work to test the proposed models are presented, including data from the meteorological station installed at University of Malaga, data from OpenWeatherMap website and data from AEMET (Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia). Chapter 4 is dedicated to the solar radiation fundamentals, including astronomical concepts related to Earth-Sun position, characterization of solar radiation hourly series, clearnes index, used to remove seasonal trends, persistence model, used to compare with proposed models and the forecast skill, based on persistence model and used as reference model as well. Chapter 5 introduces a model to model and characterize hourly solar global radiation using statistical methods like CPDF, K-means, and also using the clearness index. This models aims to predict the hourly solar radiation using the daily clearness index as input. Chapter 6 details the proposed model to forecast the hourly global solar radiation using data mining methods and daily profiles of clearness index. K-means is again used to cluster daily solar radiation profiles, then a new variable is defined from the clearness index daily profiles. Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks are used to predict the desired hourly solar radiation values.

Around 50% of all people suffering from diabetes are undiagnosed because of its long-term asymptomatic phase. The early diagnosis of diabetes is only possible by proper assessment of both common and less common sign symptoms, which could be found in different phases from disease initiation up to diagnosis.

We have analyzed the dataset with Naive Bayes Algorithm, Logistic Regression Algorithm, and Random Forest Algorithm and after applying tenfold Cross- Validation and Percentage Split evaluation techniques, Random forest has been found having best accuracy on this dataset.

However, these networks have very high computational costs because they need to be trained by repeatedly using a large volume of past playing data. In this study, we propose a novel practical approach called reinforcement learning with convolutional reservoir computing (RCRC) model. The RCRC model has several desirable features: 1. it can extract visual and time-series features very fast because it uses random fixed-weight CNN and the reservoir computing model; 2. it does not require the training data to be stored because it extracts features without training and decides action with evolution strategy. Furthermore, the model achieves state of the art score in the popular reinforcement learning task.

Recent studies has further divided the minority class into four sub-concepts: Safe, Borderline, Rare and Outlier using the majority-minority proportion at the neighborhood of every minority sample. Among the sub-concepts safe are easy to identify and classifiers are increasing inaccurate while classifying other subsequent sub-categories (Boarderline, Rare, Outlier). In some recent studies, heterogeneous value difference metric is used as the distance calculation mechanism for categorizing data. However, there are numerous other distance metrics whose effects on determining the sub-concepts are not explored yet. This research aimed at evaluating the effects of different distance metrics in the calculation of different sub-concepts within the minority class data. We have considered ten datasets and five distance metrics for the calculation. The datasets are divided into three categories: all categorical, mixed and fully numeric data.

Hydro-climatic drivers causing the changes in drained wetlands were identified and used to develop a generic model to predict wetland ET. Eddy covariance (EC)-based ET measurements were made for two years at two differently drained but close by wetlands, a heavily drained wetland (SW) (97% reduced surface storage) and a more functional wetland (DW) (42% reduced storage). Annual ET for more intensively drained SW was 836 mm, 34% less than DW (1271 mm) and the difference was significant ( p = 0.001). This difference was mainly due to drainage driven differences in inundation and associated effects on net radiation ( R n ) and local relative humidity. Two generic daily ET models, a regression model (MSE = 0.44 mm 2 , R 2 = 0.80) and a machine learning-based Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) model (MSE = 0.36 mm 2 , R 2 = 0.84), were developed with the latter being more robust. The RVM model can predict changes in ET for different restoration scenarios; a 1.1 m rise in drainage level showed 7% increase ET (18 mm) at SW while the increase at DW was negligible. The additional ET, 28% of surface flow, can enhance water storage, flood protection, and climate mitigation services at SW compared to DW. More intensely drained wetlands at higher elevation should be targeted for restoration for enhanced storage through increased ET. The models developed can predict changes in ET for improved evaluation of basin-scale effects of restoration programs and climate change scenarios.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.04.027", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "2343560018", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["134211366", "133839495", "210306206", "182807145", "123748753", "189927746"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:130419291"}

Since 2014, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have facilitated a new direction to tackle this problem by introducing the generator and the discriminator networks in its architecture. Many recent works, like Pix2Pix, CycleGAN, DualGAN, PS2MAN and CSGAN handled this problem with the required generator and discriminator networks and choice of the different losses that are used in the objective functions. In spite of these works, still there is a gap to fill in terms of both the quality of the images generated that should look more realistic and as much as close to the ground truth images. In this work, we introduce a new Image-to-Image Transformation network named Cyclic Discriminative Generative Adversarial Networks (CDGAN) that fills the above mentioned gaps. The proposed CDGAN generates high quality and more realistic images by incorporating the additional discriminator networks for cycled images in addition to the original architecture of the CycleGAN. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed CDGAN, it is tested over three different baseline image-to-image transformation datasets. The quantitative metrics such as pixel-wise similarity, structural level similarity and perceptual level similarity are used to judge the performance. Moreover, the qualitative results are also analyzed and compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Firstly, inspired by human's selective attention mechanism, an attention-based saliency localization network (ASLN) is constructed to quickly predict the semantic saliency objects of video frames. Afterwards, in order to complementarily represent salient objects and the surroundings, two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) features, i.e., local saliency feature and global feature are respectively extracted from the salient objects and the whole feature map. Thirdly, after binding two features together, Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) is applied to encode them into the video representation.

Moreover, the small number of samples increases the overfitting problem of Classification, as a result leading to lower accuracy classification performance. Another major challenge is that of the uncertainty of Microarray ::: data quality. Microarray data contains various levels of noise and quite often high levels of noise, and these data lead to unreliable and low accuracy analysis as well as the high dimensionality problem.

Related studies in this area have mostly been relying on statistical techniques for downscaling variables to finer resolution. This demands a careful selection of a suitable downscaling model, to alleviate the downscaling uncertainty. In this study, it is proposed to develop a dynamic framework for downscaling purpose by integrating the frequently used techniques, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In order to give flexibility in future predictors\u2013predictand relationships and to account the sensitivity in model parameters, it is also proposed to generate an ensemble of outputs by identifying various plausible model parameter combinations. The performance of this framework for downscaling daily precipitation values at different locations is compared with simple KNN and SVM models. The proposed hybrid model is found to be better in capturing various characteristics of daily precipitation than individual models, especially in simulating the extremes, both in magnitude and duration. The mean ensemble is found to be efficient than single best simulation with optimum parameter combinations. The efficacy of hybrid SVM\u2013KNN ensemble downscaling model is established through detailed investigations. The future downscaled projection for mid-century and late century employing this hybrid model indicates an increased variability in future precipitation, though the intensity varies for various locations.

Land cover change is a dynamic phenomenon addressing environmental issues including natural calamities.

Tropical cyclones being an extreme weather event are more powerful and hazardous to southern parts of the Indian subcontinent. Aftermath of the cyclone is extreme causing land cover changes like defoliation, water logging, destruction of cultivable lands, plantations shrub vegetation, dissolving salt pans etc. The tropical cyclones are fierce to devastate the coastal districts of Tamil Nadu and make it a prey to these cyclones. In this paper, an attempt has been made to assess the pre and post cyclonic land cover change by utilizing potential microwave Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) dataset. The study portrays the occurrence of a severe cyclonic storm named Gaja that was formed over Bay of Bengal which hit Tamil Nadu on 15th of November 2018 causing high death toll and demolition. The study focuses on the pre and post damage assessment provoked by Gaja cyclone. For analysis, a methodical procedure was followed by utilizing the Sentinel 1 SAR dataset.

Accurate identification of antioxidant proteins could contribute to revealing physiological processes of oxidation/antioxidation balance and developing novel antioxidation-based drugs. In this study, an ensemble method is presented to predict antioxidant proteins with hybrid features, incorporating SSI (Secondary Structure Information), PSSM (Position Specific Scoring Matrix), RSA (Relative Solvent Accessibility), and CTD (Composition, Transition, Distribution). The prediction results of the ensemble predictor are determined by an average of prediction results of multiple base classifiers. Based on a classifier selection strategy, we obtain an optimal ensemble classifier composed of RF (Random Forest), SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization), NNA (Nearest Neighbor Algorithm), and J48 with an accuracy of 0.925. A Relief combined with IFS (Incremental Feature Selection) method is adopted to obtain optimal features from hybrid features. With the optimal features, the ensemble method achieves improved performance with a sensitivity of 0.95, a specificity of 0.93, an accuracy of 0.94, and an MCC (Matthew\u2019s Correlation Coefficient) of 0.880, far better than the existing method. To evaluate the prediction performance objectively, the proposed method is compared with existing methods on the same independent testing dataset.

More recently, PJ ecosystems in select areas have experienced dramatic reductions in area and biomass due to extreme drought, wildfire, and management. Due to the vast area of PJ ecosystems, tracking these changes in woodland tree cover is essential for understanding their consequences for carbon accounting efforts, as well as ecosystem structure and functioning. Here we present a carbon monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) system for characterizing total aboveground biomass stocks and flux of PJ ecosystems across the Great Basin. This is achieved through a two-stage remote sensing approach by first using Spatial Wavelet Analysis to rapidly sample tree cover from very high-resolution imagery (1 m), and then training a Random Forest model which maps tree cover across the region from 2000 to 2016 using temporally-segmented Landsat spectral indices obtained from the LandTrendr algorithm in Google Earth Engine. Estimates of cover were validated against field data from the SageSTEP project (R2=0.67, RMSE=10% cover). Biomass estimated from cover-based allometry was higher than estimates from the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) at the plot-level (bias=5 Mg ha-1 and RMSE=15.5 Mg ha-1) due in part to differences in tree-level biomass allometrics. County-level aggregation of biomass closely matched estimates from the FIA (R2=0.97) after correcting for bias at the plot level. Even after many previous decades of encroachment, we find forest area (i.e. areas with \u226510% cover) increasing at a steady rate of 0.46% per year, but 80% of the 9.86 Tg increase in biomass is attributable to infilling of existing forest.

Deep-learning-based semantic segmentation realizes segmentation and categorization at the same time, and thus can obtain smooth and fine-grained classification maps. However, this kind of methods require large data sets with pixel-wise categorical annotations, which are time consuming and tedious to retrieve. Compared with photographs and optical remote sensing images, manually annotating SAR data is even harder, which results in a delay of using relevant techniques in this field. In this letter, a new data set is proposed to support semantic segmentation for high-resolution PolSAR images. Limited by the aforementioned problems, the data set is only a small one with 50 image patches. Therefore, two transfer learning strategies are proposed, which adopt the fully convolutional network (FCN) and U-net architecture, respectively, and use distinct pretraining data sets to adapt to different situations. The experiments demonstrate the good performance of both methods and a promising applicability of using small training sets.

It is worth noting that label information is valuable for learning the discriminative network representations. However, labels of all training nodes are always difficult or expensive to obtain and manually labeling all nodes for training is inapplicable. Different sets of labeled nodes for model learning lead to different network representation results. In this paper, we propose a novel method, termed as ANRMAB, to learn the active discriminative network representations with a multi-armed bandit mechanism in active learning setting. Specifically, based on the networking data and the learned network representations, we design three active learning query strategies.

Motivated by the fast training and straightforward solutions exhibited by extreme learning machines (ELMs), in this paper, we propose a recognition framework that is based on multiple sources of features and ELM neural networks. In this framework, three types of features are first extracted, including CNN features with pre-trained networks, histograms of oriented gradients and color histograms. Second, those low-level features are concatenated and taken as the inputs to an autoencoder version of the ELM for deep feature-level fusion.

Then, the CEEMD method is combined with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to forecast Chinese stock index futures prices. The empirical results show that the residue term determines the long-term trend of stock index futures prices.

The graph kernel is computed using the conjugate gradient method to solve a generalized Laplacian of the tensor product between a pair of graphs. To cope with the large gap between the instruction throughput and the memory bandwidth of the GPUs, our solver forms the graph tensor product on-the-fly without storing it in memory. This is achieved by using threads in a warp cooperatively to stream the adjacency and edge label matrices of individual graphs by small square matrix blocks called tiles, which are then staged in registers and the shared memory for later reuse. Warps across a thread block can further share tiles via the shared memory to increase data reuse. We exploit the sparsity of the graphs hierarchically by storing only non-empty tiles using a coordinate format and nonzero elements within each tile using bitmaps. We propose a new partition-based reordering algorithm for aggregating nonzero elements of the graphs into fewer but denser tiles to further exploit sparsity. We carry out extensive theoretical analyses on the graph tensor product primitives for tiles of various density and evaluate their performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our solver delivers three to four orders of magnitude speedup over existing CPU-based solvers such as GraKeL and GraphKernels.

This is a challenging problem in bioinformatics. By introduction of machine learning for protein structure prediction, a solution has brought to this challenge to some extent. In the literature of Machine learning or data mining, regression and classification problems are typically viewed as two distinct problems differentiated by continuous or categorical dependent variable. There are endeavors to use regression methods to solve the classification problem and vice versa. To regard a classification problem as a regression one, we proposed a method which is based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) classification model as one of the powerful methods in the field of machine intelligence. We applied non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) to find mapping points (MPs) for rounding a real-value to an integer one. Also NSGAII is used for finding out and tuning SVR kernel parameters optimally to enhance the performance of our model and achieve better results. At the other hand, using a suitable SVR kernel function for a particular problem can improve the prediction results remarkably but there is not a kernel which can predict all protein secondary structure classes with acceptable accuracy. Therefore we use a Dynamic Weighted Kernel Fusion (DWKF) method for fusing of three SVR kernels to achieve a supreme performance. Also to improve our method, Position Scoring Matrix (PSSM) profiles are used as the input information to it. The goals of this research are to regulate SVR parameters and fuse different SVR kernel outputs in order to determine protein secondary structure classes accurately. The obtained classification accuracies of our method are 85.79% and 84.94% on RS126 and CB513 datasets respectively and they are promising with regard to other classification methods in the literature.

In this regard, the support vector machine (SVM) has been playing an important role to provide potential solutions for the IDS problem. However, the practicability of introducing SVM is affected by the difficulties in selecting appropriate kernel and its parameters. From this viewpoint, this paper presents the work to apply different kernels for SVM in ID Son the KDD\u201999 Dataset and NSL-KDD dataset as well as to find out which kernel is the best for SVM. The important deficiency in the KDD\u201999 data set is the huge number of redundant records as observed earlier.

The PPIs play an important role in the complex process of cell death which mainly occurs via apoptosis and necrosis in eukaryotic cells. Apoptosis is an orderly cellular suicide program critical for the development and homeostasis of multicellular organism. Failure to control apoptosis can have catastrophic consequences. The cascades of amazing reactions carried out by proteins such as Caspase, CARD, NLRP, NOD, FADD, DEDD, POP, Myd88 etc. play important role in the process of cell death. The high throughput experimental methods for determining PPIs are time consuming, expensive and are generating huge amount of PPIs data. Therefore, there is need to develop computational methods to efficiently and accurately predict PPIs. In this work, an attempt has been made to develop a fuzzy support vector machine (F-SVM) model for predicting death domain (DD) PPIs based on sixteen physicochemical, biochemical and structural features of amino acids which are monomers of proteins. First, the protein primary sequences are encoded into sequential features represented by descriptors. Then, the Support Vector Machine and Sequential Minimal Optimization of WEKA software are employed to classify interacting and non-interacting protein pairs. The performance of SVM and F-SVM with various kernel functions has been evaluated and it was observed that libSVM with Polynomial kernel was found to be best with accuracy of 77.94 % via F-SVM which is optimum model in predicting human DD-PPIs. Validation is performed by tenfold cross-validation technique. The F-SVM performance measure is 2.94 % higher than SVM in terms of accuracy with the use of custom designed fuzzy membership function. The results obtained are in agreement with available experimental data.

Neurofuzzy Adaptive Control contains rigorous proofs of its statements which result in concrete conclusions for the selection of the design parameters of the algorithms presented. The neurofuzzy model combines concepts from fuzzy systems and recurrent high-order neural networks to produce powerful system approximations that are used for adaptive control. The FCN modelstems from fuzzy cognitive maps and uses the notion of concepts and their causal relationships to capture the behavior of complex systems. The book shows how, with the benefit of proper training algorithms, these models are potent system emulators suitable for use in engineering systems. All chapters are supported by illustrative simulation experiments, while separate chapters are devoted to the potential industrial applications of each model including projects in: contemporary power generation; process control and conventional benchmarking problems. Researchers and graduate students working in adaptive estimation and intelligent control will find Neurofuzzy Adaptive Control of interest both for the currency of its models and because it demonstrates their relevance for real systems.

Drought prediction is definitely needed as a mitigation action to minimize the risk of drought. However, a sparse dataset has led to difficulties in accurately predicting future droughts in areas without meteorological stations, and hence a dataset with a finer resolution is required. This research investigates the performance of a 3-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) to predict drought. CART and Random Forest are applied as the classification methods. Using several predictors, the analysis finds that CART has lower predictability than Random Forest. The average accuracy of the prediction using Random Forest reaches 100% with an average Area Under Curve (AUC) of about 0.8. The analysis also shows that predictions using the MERRA-2 dataset lead to higher accuracy and AUC than those using the TRMM. Therefore, using the MERRA-2 dataset predicted by Random Forest can be an optimal way to predict drought in East Nusa Tenggara. The methods confirmed that average soil surface temperature (day and night), Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are strong predictors of drought. The performance of CART and Random Forest is improved with the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE).

A major challenge when applying KE to such applications is that the data is often unstructured and in the form of text exchanges between the customer and the enterprise. While the importance of modelling domain knowledge in order to produce meaningful results from mining unstructured data has been recognized, most approaches are based primarily on the linguistic structure of the text and keyword taxonomies. These approaches share the common issue that the knowledge extraction results are often not properly structured for solving the engineering problem of interest and, therefore, require manual post-processing before they can be applied. Our hypothesis is that the a priori modelling of the engineering problem of interest is crucial for both (1) efficient (rapid) collection, representation, and structuring of domain knowledge, and (2) the proper integration of domain knowledge with analytical KE methods in order facilitate the extraction of useful knowledge. In order to validate our hypothesis, we apply this approach to the important real-world engineering problem of monitoring the occurrence of product failure modes, and thereby product quality, using customer support cases. In order to translate the free-form text provided by the customer into engineering failure modes we use two methods from engineering design, the Function Analysis System Technique (FAST) and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), to provide the necessary domain knowledge model. This model then drives the collection, representation, and structuring of the failure modes for the product of interest. These failure modes are used as the class labels when applying data mining classification techniques (e.g., Support Vector Machine) to the support case data. The labelled support case data then can be aggregated by failure mode in order to compute a number of failure mode metrics that can be used to monitor product quality.

They are found in contrasted conditions in terms of management and climate in Europe. These conditions induce a wide variety of grassland types that differ in their vegetation and are expected to differ with respect to the provision of ecosystem services. Because ecosystem functioning in grassland has been shown to be linked to plant functional diversity criteria, we put forward that these functional diversity criteria can be used to evaluate the provision of ecosystem services. These criteria are influenced by the management and the climate. The overall objective of this PhD program is to assess the effects of management and climate on the plant functional diversity related to ecosystem services of permanent grasslands. The first step of the PhD program was to select 29 functional diversity criteria related to 8 ecosystem services (quantity of forage, forage quality, stability of the forage production, biodiversity conservation, pollination carbon sequestration, dryness resistance and nitrogen fertility). This selection was made using experts' interview and literature survey. The second step was to evaluate inaccuracies in the calculation of the 29 functional diversity criteria from functional trait databases and different sets of botanical surveys. The third step was to estimate the functional diversity criteria from management and climate data using \"Random Forests\" methodology. The results show that the climatic variables had generally more effect on the functional diversity than the management ones.

The robot used during the experiments is a Comau Smart5 SiX and a novel virtual model of this manipulator has also been developed to simulate an industrial scenario which allows valid experimentation while avoiding damages to the real robot.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ARSO.2013.6705538", "venue": "2013 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts", "journal": "2013 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2022045088", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8024583", "1045325", "5768504", "5679082", "9927320", "207149804", "60981168", "10992646", "61494934", "17827779", "1661931", "206663593", "15033028", "16290821", "206941306", "37437102", "11392980", "23742060", "61868807", "18053132", "11832479", "61962167", "247128", "8008494", "18426088"], "inbound_citations": ["6135560", "15873965", "202559610", "18959820", "7160426", "17578426"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17982676"}

Early detection of these molecular changes is a key aspect for the success of interventions aimed at slowing down rates of cognitive decline. Recent evidence indicates that of the two established methods for measuring amyloid, a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid \u03b21\u221242 (A\u03b21\u221242) may be an earlier indicator of Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk than measures of amyloid obtained from Positron Emission Tomography (PET). However, CSF collection is highly invasive and expensive. In contrast, blood collection is routinely performed, minimally invasive and cheap. In this work, we develop a blood-based signature that can provide a cheap and minimally invasive estimation of an individual\u2019s CSF amyloid status using a machine learning approach. We show that a Random Forest model derived from plasma analytes can accurately predict subjects as having abnormal (low) CSF A\u03b21\u221242 levels indicative of AD risk (0.84 AUC, 0.78 sensitivity, and 0.73 specificity). Refinement of the modeling indicates that only APOEe4 carrier status and four plasma analytes (CGA, A\u03b21\u221242, Eotaxin 3, APOE) are required to achieve a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, we show across an independent validation cohort that individuals with predicted abnormal CSF A\u03b21\u221242 levels transitioned to an AD diagnosis over 120 months significantly faster than those with predicted normal CSF A\u03b21\u221242 levels and that the resulting model also validates reasonably across PET A\u03b21\u221242 status (0.78 AUC).

When there is a need to translate images across n domains, if the training is performed between every two domains, the complexity of the training will increase quadratically. Moreover, training with data from two domains only at a time cannot benefit from data of other domains, which prevents the extraction of more useful features and hinders the progress of this research area. In this work, we propose a general framework for unsupervised image-to-image translation across multiple domains, which can translate images from domain X to any a domain without requiring direct training between the two domains involved in image translation. A byproduct of the framework is the reduction of computing time and computing resources since it needs less time than training the domains in pairs as is done in state-of-the-art works.

A careful investigation of contributory causes from the reports provide opportunity to improve safety in future. Two methods have been employed in this study to extract the causal relations.

The latter simply searches for the words connecting cause and effect in sentences. The causal patterns extracted using these two methods are compared to the manual (human expert) extraction. The pattern classification method showed a fair and sensible performance with F-measure(average) = 65% when compared to connectives method with F-measure(average) = 58%. This study is an evidence, that text mining methods could be employed in extracting causal relations from marine accident investigation reports.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1507.02447", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "770273161", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["128249405", "6923178", "13365040", "62714075", "116422297", "114379", "11266788", "3059113", "61116939", "14521571", "44739519", "108577901", "17770824", "2443126", "25422475", "151947029", "2702042", "57961414", "1003746", "67297813", "211169294", "111997873", "1438450", "11381110", "122759122", "11563855", "13232120", "207927251", "6865146", "2077507", "5978040", "27139853", "60004445", "6366052", "67250306", "8864928", "6473756", "40988859", "35730151", "5757284", "9149298", "54599246", "61480332", "11593793", "16785006", "124621908", "14464373", "28637672", "7138354", "120595263", "198489576", "198489576", "3170394", "198836739", "140771138", "122858936", "5083193", "244069", "112655576", "141120597"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11714853"}

In current Smart Grid, there are various types of customers with different energy consumption patterns. Customer\u2019s energy consumption patterns are referred to as customer behaviors. It would significantly benefit load forecasting in a grid if customer behaviors could be taken into account. This paper proposes an innovative method that aggregates different types of customers by their identified behaviors, and then predicts the load of each customer cluster, so as to improve load forecasting accuracy of the whole grid. Sparse Continuous Conditional Random Fields (sCCRF) is proposed to effectively identify different customer behaviors through learning. A hierarchical clustering process is then introduced to aggregate customers according to the identified behaviors. Within each customer cluster, a representative sCCRF is fine-tuned to predict the load of its cluster. The final load of the whole grid is obtained by summing the loads of each cluster. The proposed method for load forecasting in Smart Grid has two major advantages. 1) Learning customer behaviors not only improves the prediction accuracy but also has a low computational cost. 2) sCCRF can effectively model the load forecasting problem of one customer, and simultaneously select key features to identify its energy consumption pattern. Experiments conducted from different perspectives demonstrate the advantages of the proposed load forecasting method. Further discussion is provided, indicating that the approach of learning customer behaviors can be extended as a general framework to facilitate decision making in other market domains.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TKDE.2018.2850798", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2810434351", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["25289770", "15460758", "115341748", "10263033", "121771899", "6118036", "15076268", "2403203", "9286730", "5439439", "31840219", "7983584", "111014961", "14008149", "93693900", "10650468", "8969296", "20955835", "22649504", "28057107", "37568367", "14026669", "24173881", "2183998", "10370551", "121771899", "277918", "10181055", "10245542", "13251604", "743542", "169686263", "10854856", "53992225", "17333695", "121570279", "7880266"], "inbound_citations": ["202307098", "202101719", "195856989"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67428067"}

Although deep learning has a good effect on feature extraction, the current deep learning methods usually need to set a large number of parameters manually, which is time consuming. Hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) needs only less manual intervention and can extract features by a multi-layer feature representation framework, which is much faster than the traditional deep learning methods. A CADx framework based on H-ELM, named DCADx, is proposed. As common spatial pattern (CSP) and brain functional network (BFN) have been proven to have better de-redundancy effects on brain data, the DCADx contains two different data redundancy reduction methods: (1) CSP-based DCADx (i.e., DCADx-CSP model) and (2) BFN-based DCADx (i.e., DCADx-BFN model).

In this paper we study this trade-off in private Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning. We present two efficient mechanisms, one for the case of finite-dimensional feature mappings and one for potentially infinite-dimensional feature mappings with translation-invariant kernels. For the case of translation-invariant kernels, the proposed mechanism minimizes regularized empirical risk in a random Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space whose kernel uniformly approximates the desired kernel with high probability. This technique, borrowed from large-scale learning, allows the mechanism to respond with a finite encoding of the classifier, even when the function class is of infinite VC dimension. Differential privacy is established using a proof technique from algorithmic stability. Utility--the mechanism's response function is pointwise epsilon-close to non-private SVM with probability 1-delta--is proven by appealing to the smoothness of regularized empirical risk minimization with respect to small perturbations to the feature mapping. We conclude with a lower bound on the optimal differential privacy of the SVM.

We propose a unified pipeline that: a) generates a set of initial synthetic histopathology images with paired information about the nuclei such as segmentation masks; b) refines the initial synthetic images through a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to reference styles; c) trains a task-specific CNN and boosts the performance of the task-specific CNN with on-the-fly generated adversarial examples. Our main contribution is that the synthetic images are not only realistic, but also representative (in reference styles) and relatively challenging for training task-specific CNNs. We test our method for nucleus segmentation using images from four cancer types.

A situation based probability resting on inter-vehicle relations is derived, which enables very early reasoning about the current traffic situation and gives prior knowledge about possible lane change maneuvers. Then observations of the vehicles lateral movement inside the lane are used to perform a probabilistic multi-class classification with a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Both probabilities are combined to enhance the movement based result using the situation related probability as prior knowledge from the current driving situation. The approach is tested on a dataset recorded on a fixed-base driving simulator. Considering only the situation based information early prediction of a feasible lane change is possible.

Mammography is currently the benchmark for screening, but mammography may not; a) detect all early stage breast cancers especially in young women with dense breast, b) unequivocally distinguish between benign disease and cancer and c) be beneficial to people in remote and underserved areas without mammograms. Biomarkers could complement mammography because of the potential to enable earlier detection, accurate differentiation between non-cancerous and cancerous breast lesions, and allow screening of a specimen like blood collected from a remote site. As a step towards developing a biomarker-based blood test for early detection of breast disease, we have used the branched-DNA multiplex technology to measure the levels of 24 candidate biomarkers in blood of fully informed and consented female donors classified into three broad categories; normal, with breast cancer (BC), and with benign breast disease (BD). To determine if the groups can be identified using the levels of the 24 candidate biomarkers we trained prediction models based on the data without background subtraction and applied the same training process on background subtracted data. Next we used an in-house developed software, to identify the optimal transformation and normalization methods. Due to the small sample size available for the current study, we generated 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls by simulating the original data via a distributional sampling model, and used the simulated data as the test validation set (TVS). Three prediction models were then applied to the original data and simulated TVS, namely: in-house GA optimized k of m, Random Forest (Salford System), Logistic Regression (SAS). Random Forest proved to be the best model for group prediction displaying sensitivities and specificities above 90%. This presentation will discuss the extent to which the levels of the biomarkers in blood allowed the identification of donors classified as \u201cnormal\u201d and with \u201cbreast disease\u201d. ::: ::: Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

The proposed Nearest Neighbor-Support Vector Machine hybrid classification approach is coined as SVM-NN. The KNN has been reported as one of the widely used text classification approaches due to its simplicity and efficiency in handling various types of text classification tasks. However, there exists a major problem of the KNN in determining the appropriate value for parameter K in order to guarantee high classification effectiveness. This is due to the fact that the selection of the value of parameter K has high impact on the accuracy of the KNN classifier. Other than determining the optimal value of parameter K, the KNN is also a lazy learning method which keeps the entire training samples until classification time. Hence, the computational process of the KNN has become intensive when the value of parameter K increases. In this paper, we propose the SVM-NN hybrid classification approach with the objective that to minimize the impact of parameter on classification accuracy. In the training stage, the SVM is utilized to reduce the training samples for each of the available categories to their support vectors (SVs). The SVs from different categories are used as the training data of nearest neighbor classification algorithm in which the Euclidean distance function is used to calculate the average distance between the testing data point to each set of SVs of different categories. The classification decision is made based on the category which has the shortest average distance between its SVs and the testing data point.

Disease diagnosis with computer-aided methods has been extensively studied.

In this paper, we propose a flexible mixed-kernel framework for training a contemporaneous disease risk detector to predict the onset of disease and monitor the disease progression.

Authors propose a three-stage algorithm based on the signal processing and machine learning to detect the occurrence of rotor fault, determine its scale and type.

The acceleration signal is stored in a cyclic buffer and then processed by simple feature extraction algorithms in order to obtain a characteristic signature of the faulty state. Three different methods of feature extraction are considered in this article, along with the analysis of variable buffer length.

Raw OCT images already display structural variations for different tissue types, especially meningioma. But, in order to achieve neurosurgical guidance directly during resection, an automated differentiation approach is desired.

The models have two hidden layers and are given as input vowels and consonants represented in terms of their phonological distinctive features.

At first a size-changeable and edge-fuzzy window was designed to get many samples of the earth's surface through sliding around the image, all these samples served for the learning of a Support Vector Machine model, which was designed to make pattern's classifications. This process was repeated in different area, with different sampling size, to different pattern and lasting different times. Once some distinct local patterns were found and mastered, a self-organizing of comparability assembling will happen based on the similarity of some types of local patterns to form a holistic description or understanding of the remote sensing image.

Also, the random forest classifier only casts votes from individual tree classifiers without considering their compositions which would be more accurate. In this paper, we propose to tackle the two points by discovering weighted decision rules from the tree classifiers' output sets on training data. By treating the outputs of the tree classifiers on each data as a digital itemset, we want to find discriminative patterns (either containing the output of a single tree classifier or a set of tree classifiers) from the itemsets of training data. We employ an efficient data mining algorithm, the Emerging Pattern (EP) Mining, to search such discriminative patterns and weight them according to their discriminative powers.

However, NN is polluted by hubs in the high-dimensional feature space. Many proposed approaches remove hubs in the list of translation candidates to relieve this problem. But those approaches to eliminating hubs are flawed because they also have corresponding translations. To address this issue, we propose a novel Reconstructed Similarity (RS) retrieval for the neural machine word translation model to mitigate the hubness problem regardless of whether it is a hub. Different from previous work, RS reduces the impact of hubness pollution in dense and high-dimensional space and allows the hubs to have the same probability as the target candidates without being inappropriately excluded. In addition, RS improves the quality of bilingual dictionaries by measuring the bilateral similarity of the bilingual and monolingual distance of each of the source query embeddings. Additionally, to model the unsupervised machine word translation, we introduce Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) to map the source and target word distribution into a shared semantic space. We also construct a tiny GAN topology for neural machine word translation, which is at least 52 \u00d7 faster than previous GAN-based models. To further align cross-lingual embedding distributions, we provide orthogonal Procrustes mapping, global-awareness of the transformation matrix and rescaling of the target embeddings as flexible and optional multirefinements. The results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by nearly 4% in distant languages such as English to Finnish. Compared with a precision@1 of 47.00% from English to Finnish, our model obtains a precision@1 of 47.53% and achieves state-of-the-art results in a fully unsupervised form.

In this paper, we present two algorithms for drift detection and adaptation. Drift is measured by continuously tracking a difference metric between probability distributions estimated from two sample windows preceding a time point. High values for the difference metric indicates that concept drift has occurred, and the model must be adapted. Adaptation is done by training a new model for the drifted process, and adding it to an ensemble of models. Previously trained models are retained, and their weights in the ensemble are adjusted to reflect similarity with the current probability distribution of the process.

Variety of causative factors such as glaciers melting, excessive raining, mining, volcanic activities, active faults, earthquake, logging, erosion, urbanization, construction, and other human activities can trigger landslide occurrence. Then, identification of factors that directly influences the slide events is highly in demand. Some topographical, geological, and hydrological datasets (e.g., slope, aspect, geology, terrain roughness, vegetation index, distance to stream, distance to road, distance to fault, land use, precipitation, profile curvature, plan curvature) are considered to be effective conditioning factors. However, the importance of each factor differs from one study to another. This study investigates the effectiveness of four sets of landslide conditioning variable(s). Fourteen landslide conditioning variables were considered in this study where they were duly divided into four groups G1, G2, G3, and G4. Three machine learning algorithms namely, Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), and Boosted Logistic Regression (LogitBoost) were constructed based on each dataset in order to determine which set would be more suitable for landslide susceptibility prediction. In total, 227 landslide inventory datasets of the study area were used where 70% was used for training and 30% for testing. To this end, in the present research, the two main objectives were: 1) Investigation on effectiveness of 14 landslides conditioning factors (altitude, slope, aspect, total curvature, profile curvature, plan curvature, Stream Power Index (SPI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Terrain Roughness Index (TRI), distance to fault, distance to road, distance to stream, land use, and geology) by analyzing and determining the most important factors using variance-inflated factor (VIF), Pearson\u2019s correlation and Chi-square techniques. Consequently, 4 categories of datasets were defined; first dataset included all 14 conditioning factors, second dataset included Digital Elevation Models (DEM) derivatives (morphometrice factors), third dataset was only based on 5 factors namely lithology, land use, distance to stream, distance to road, and distance to fault, and last dataset was included 8 factors selected using factor analysis and optimization. 2) Evaluate the sensitivity of each modeling technique (NB, RF and LogitBoost) to different conditioning factors using the area under curve (AUC). Eventually, RF technique using optimized variables (G4) performed well with AUC of 0.940 followed by LogitBoost (0.898) and NB (0.864).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2532687", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2978522609", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["192476121", "133764870", "150185259", "51894946", "3624080", "134253164", "16250778", "135401402", "131497031", "102338717", "134498196", "89610503", "135360387", "114270839", "198414027", "131577221", "140564727", "52278339", "134293357", "3421338", "89141", "19501784", "53711164", "12431759", "135441161", "15563273", "133156370", "9620774", "27211659", "28778523"], "inbound_citations": ["210705260"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208014394"}

LSVM typically has higher classification accuracy for linearly separable data than nonlinearly separable data. For this type of data, Support Vector Selection and Adaptation (SVSA) method was developed that uses the support vectors obtained by LSVM and adapts them with respect to training dataset. However, the SVSA's classification performance may not be very satisfactory for linearly separable data in comparison to LSVM depending on the dataset used. In this paper, a hybrid model was presented that combines the results of LSVM and the SVSA efficiently. The main idea of the hybrid model is to utilize the performance of LSVM with the SVSA as LSVM model is already available during implementation of the SVSA. The method which uses the proposed hybrid model is called the Hybrid Support Vector Selection and Adaptation method (HSVSA). In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed model, one real multispectal and two hyperspectral dataset were experimented with the SVSA, LSVM, nonlinear SVM and the HSVSA in the classification.

Since interpreting MRI data can be complex and ambiguous, there is a need for robust computational methods able to quantify placental anatomy (including its vasculature) and function. In this work, we propose a novel fully-automated method to segment the placenta and its peripheral blood vessels from fetal MRI. First, a super-resolution reconstruction of the uterus is generated by combining axial, sagittal and coronal views. The placenta is then segmented using 3D Gabor filters, texture features and Support Vector Machines. A uterus edge-based instance selection is proposed to identify the support vectors defining the placenta boundary. Subsequently, peripheral blood vessels are extracted through a curvature-based corner detector. Our approach is validated on a rich set of 44 control and pathological cases: singleton and (normal / monochorionic) twin pregnancies between 25\u201337 weeks of gestation. Dice coefficients of 0.82 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.81 \u00b1 0.08 are achieved for placenta and its vasculature segmentation, respectively. A comparative analysis with state of the art convolutional neural networks (CNN), namely, 3D U-Net, V-Net, DeepMedic, Holistic3D Net, HighRes3D Net and Dense V-Net is also conducted for placenta localization, with our method outperforming all CNN approaches.

The need for massive mining of data sequences is increasingly observed in a wide range of user applications including social network platforms, banking sector, genomics, telecom sector, e-commerce and other sectors. To analyse multiple streams of data that is, for understanding rapid sequences of data flowing at continuous intervals, researchers are focusing on continuous improvements in data stream mining. Application of data mining models (like classifiers) in data streaming scenario mandates accurate detection of data distribution. Further, the model should adapt quickly to any variations in the distribution patterns to ensure the sustained performance of model predictability. Referred to as drift detection, the process can be gradual or abrupt. Extensive research has been made, designing several algorithms to accurately detect the type of drift and to adapt to shifts drift approaches. However, even the most reputed concept drift models have limited ability to adapt to both types of drift. The relationship between the adaptability and predictor variables is based on data distribution features and its sensitivity to in-built parameters. In this context, concept drift detection using attribute pattern weight (APW) is proposed here in this manuscript. Unlike the many of existing models, the proposed model is not dependent of any of the process targeted to apply on streaming data.

One of the reasons for the pervasive use of text captchas is that many of the prior attacks are scheme-specific and require a labor-intensive and time-consuming process to construct. This means that a change in the captcha security features like a noisier background can simply invalid an earlier attack. This paper presents a generic, yet effective text captcha solver based on the generative adversarial network. Unlike prior machine-learning-based approaches that need a large volume of manually-labeled real captchas to learn an effective solver, our approach requires significantly fewer real captchas but yields much better performance. This is achieved by first learning a captcha synthesizer to automatically generate synthetic captchas to learn a base solver, and then fine-tuning the base solver on a small set of real captchas using transfer learning. We evaluate our approach by applying it to 33 captcha schemes, including 11 schemes that are currently being used by 32 of the top-50 popular websites including Microsoft, Wikipedia, eBay and Google. Our approach is the most capable attack on text captchas seen to date. It outperforms four state-of-the-art text-captcha solvers by not only delivering a significant higher accuracy on all testing schemes, but also successfully attacking schemes where others have zero chance. We show that our approach is highly efficient as it can solve a captcha within 0.05 second using a desktop GPU. We demonstrate that our attack is generally applicable because it can bypass the advanced security features employed by most modern text captcha schemes.

Large-scale datasets previously made publicly available were relatively simple, and rarely include such real-world challenges in data collection.

This brief proposes a new learning algorithm, called bidirectional extreme learning machine (B-ELM), in which some hidden nodes are not randomly selected. In theory, this algorithm tends to reduce network output error to 0 at an extremely early learning stage.

Accurate travel time prediction can help these companies make better planning and task scheduling. For several reasons, most companies are not able to obtain traffic flow data from traffic management authorities, but a large amount of trajectory data were collected everyday which has not been fully utilised. In this study, we aim to fill this gap and performed travel time predictions for freight vehicles at individual level using Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) models. All the features were extracted or composed from vehicles' temporally sparse trajectory data. Three routes were selected for the prediction experiments. Bayesian optimisation was adopted for model fitting while the results show that both pre-start (before trip starts) and post-start (after trip starts) predictions accuracies reach above 80%. The results also show that the prediction performance can be gradually improved by adding more mean speed estimates of traveled distance from the first 5 minutes as the real-time information. And the prediction performance can be further improved by about 2% by adding more mean speed estimates even if an unusual and non-recurring events occurred at a location of a route segment.

It is easy to apply ensemble learning for classification tasks, for example, based on averaging, voting, or other methods. However, for other tasks (like object detection) where the outputs are varying in quantity and unable to be simply compared, the ensemble of multiple models become difficult. In this paper, we propose a new method called Predictive Ensemble Learning (PEL), based on powerful predictive ability of deep neural networks, to directly predict the best performing model among a pool of base models for each test example, thus transforming ensemble learning to a traditional classification task. Taking scene text detection as the application, where no suitable ensemble learning strategy exists, PEL can significantly improve the performance, compared to either individual state-of-the-art models, or the fusion of multiple models by non-maximum suppression.

The three well-known supervised machine learning methods, such as SVM, Na\u00efve Bayes and Random Forest, which are commonly used in the prediction of PPIs, were employed to evaluate the performance measure based on five-fold cross validation techniques. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Out of 44 descriptors, best features were found to be domain-domain association and methionine, serine and valine amino acid composition of viral proteins. In this study, SVM-based method achieved better sensitivity of 67% over Na\u00efve Bayes (37.49%) and Random Forest (55.66%). However the specificity of Na\u00efve Bayes was the highest (99.52%) as compared with SVM (74%) and Random Forest (89.08%). Overall, the SVM and Random Forest achieved accuracy of 71% and 72.41%, respectively.

In this paper, we propose an approach based on regression and classification models we have introduced in the past [1, 2]. These models consider monitoring data (time-series) as inputs and RUL estimation as output. Significant difference of this model is using suspended time-series to estimate optimal RUL for each suspended time-series, so they can be used for initial model training. This article describes the procedures that have been developed and applied successfully for Suspended Time-Series using. Several models based on modification of the SVR and SVC methods (Support Vector Regression and Support Vector Classification) are proposed for consideration. Number of uncompleted time-series used for training and cross-validation is proposed as additional control parameter. Suggested methodology and algorithms were verified on the NASA Aircraft Engine database. Numerical examples based on this database have been also considered. Experimental result shows that the proposed model performs significantly better estimations than pure supervised learning based model.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICPHM.2015.7245013", "venue": "2015 IEEE Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)", "journal": "2015 IEEE Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1602223404", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["39659536", "22751839", "20929205", "10128059", "64543020", "1732330"], "inbound_citations": ["115895929"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5337631"}

We applied Classification Trees and Random Forests in order to determine the factors that most closely explain the observed patterns of distribution and abundance loss, and to develop hypotheses that may guide measures for the protection of the OT. Among the most important predictors of change were variables corresponding to aspects of forest cover and variables on human population and small settlements. OT abundance in 1980, however, was by far the most important predictor for OT abundance change. This is an indication that the OT dynamics are governed by internal rather than by external factors. Medium and low abundances in 1980 inevitably led to a further decrease during the following years, which gives rise to the conclusion that the OT might find itself in an extinction vortex. We suggest the following hypothetical scenario for OT decline: migrant people from other Mexican states colonise forested regions in Yucatan; they establish small settlements; bushmeat hunting is important for their survival; the naive OT is easy prey; hunting\u2014together with beginning deforestation\u2014reaches a certain level, and local OT abundance falls below a critical threshold; OT continues declining regardless of current social and environmental changes except where there is total protection of both the species and its habitat.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.actao.2010.08.004", "venue": null, "journal": "Acta Oecologica-international Journal of Ecology", "mag_id": "1965185557", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["45847093", "1410185", "84522218"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:83622596"}

A lot of classification methods have been proposed in literature, such as Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Bayesian Networks, most of which assume that the input data is in a feature vector representation. However, in some classification problems, the predefined feature space is not discriminative enough to distinguish between different classes. More seriously, in many other applications, the input data has very complex structures, but with no initial feature vector representation, such as transaction data (e.g., customer shopping transactions), sequences (e.g., protein sequences and software execution traces), graphs (e.g., chemical compounds and molecules, social and biological networks), semi-structured data (e.g., XML documents), and text data. For both scenarios, a primary question is how to construct a discriminative and compact feature set, on the basis of which, classification could be performed to achieve good classification performance. Although a lot of kernel-based approaches have been proposed to transform the feature space and, as a way to measure the similarity between two data objects, the implicit definition of feature space makes the kernel-based approach hard to interpret, and the high computational complexity makes it hard to scale to large problem sizes. A concrete example of complex structural data classification is classifying chemical compounds to various classes ( e.g., toxic vs. nontoxic, active vs. inactive), where a key challenge is how to construct discriminative graph features. While simple features such as atoms and links are too simple to preserve the structural information, graph kernel methods make it hard to interpret the classifiers. ::: In this dissertation, I proposed to use frequent patterns as higher-order and discriminative features to characterize data, especially complex structural data, and thus enhance the classification power. Towards this goal, I designed a framework of discriminative frequent pattern-based classification which has been shown to improve the classification performance significantly. Theoretical analysis is provided to reveal the association between a feature's frequency and its discriminative power, thus demonstrate that frequent pattern is a good candidate as discriminative feature. ::: Due to the explosive nature of frequent pattern mining, the frequent pattern-based feature construction could be a computational bottleneck, if the whole set of frequent patterns w.r.t. a minimum support threshold are generated. To overcome this computational bottleneck, I proposed two solutions: DDPMine and LEAP which directly mine the most discriminative features without generating the complete set. Both methods have been shown to improve efficiency while maintaining the classification accuracy. ::: I further applied the discriminative frequent pattern-based classification to classifying chemical compounds with very skewed class distribution, which poses challenges for both feature construction and model learning. An ensemble framework which includes the ensembles in both the data space and the feature space is proposed to handle the challenges and shown to achieve good classification performance. ::: In conclusion, the framework of discriminative frequent pattern-based classification could lead to a highly accurate, efficient and interpretable classifier on complex data.

In this paper, we propose a facial feature extraction approach by manifold learning.

The LPP can preserve local structure of appearance data, and remain most of the important characteristics of the appearance data.

For instance a sentence may be uttered quite differently according to the speaker emotion, a gesture may have more amplitude depending on the height of the performer etc... Such a variability cannot always be removed through preprocessing.We first propose the generative framework of Contextual Hidden Markov Models (CHMM) to model directly the influence of contextual information on observation sequences by parameterizing the probability distributions of HMMs with static or dynamic contextual variables. We test various instances of this framework on classification of handwritten characters, speech recognition and synthesis of eyebrow motion from speech for a virtual avatar.For each of these tasks, we investigate in what extent such modeling can translate into performance gains. We then introduce a natural and efficient way to exploit contextual information into Contextual Hidden Conditional Random Fields (CHCRF), the discriminative counter part of CHMMs.CHCRF may be viewed as an efficient way to learn a HCRF that exploit contextual information.Finally, we propose a Transfer Learning approach to learn Contextual HMMs from fewer examples.

In doing so, we employ alternative decomposition procedures and introduce the Support Vector Regression (SVR) methodology from the field of Machine Learning, coupled with linear and non-linear kernels as a novel forecasting method in the field. Using rolling windows in producing point and conditional probability distribution forecasts we find that neither the term spread, nor its decomposition components possess the ability to accurately forecast output growth or inflation.

The performance was evaluated using internal random-split cross-validation. On the training set within each iteration, feature selection and hyperparameter optimization were performed. To this end, another cross validation was performed by splitting the training sets in training and validation parts. The optimal settings were evaluated on the independent test sets.

TL is proposed as a solution to the problem of insufficient calibration data due to short training times for both classification and regression-based control schemes. This approach was validated for electrode shift of roughly 2.5cm with 13 able-bodied subjects to estimate individual and combined wrist motions.

The proposed methods are based on univariate time series prediction. That is, instead of using external data such as the weather forecast as the input of prediction algorithms, they solely rely on past values of solar power data, hence lowering the volume and acquisition time of input data. In addition, the selected algorithms are able to generate the forecast output in less than a second.

I NTRODUCTION Recently, the Neural Gas network (NG) (1) has attracted attention as an image-recognition technology. In the learning, NG uses one type of neurons.

Indeed, this contrasts with the more common situation in which we have only few labeled documents and abundance of unlabeled ones. In addition, labeling layout documents introduces further complexity aspects due to multi-modal nature of the components (textual and spatial information may coexist). In this work, we investigate the application of a relational classifier that works in the transductive setting. The relational setting is justified by the multi-modal nature of the data we are dealing with, while transduction is justified by the possibility of exploiting the large amount of information conveyed in the unlabeled layout components.

This paper proposes a superpixel-enhanced pairwise CRF framework that consists of the conventional pairwise as well as our proposed superpixel-enhanced pairwise (SP-Pairwise) potentials. SP-Pairwise potentials incorporate the superpixel-based higher-order cues by conditioning on a segment filtered image and share the same set of parameters as the conventional pairwise potentials. Therefore, the proposed superpixel-enhanced pairwise CRF has a lower time complexity in parameter learning and at the same time it outperforms higher-order CRF in terms of inference accuracy. Moreover, the new scheme takes advantage of the pre-trained pairwise models by reusing their parameters and/or weights, which provides a significant accuracy boost on the basis of CRF-RNN even without training.

This is a consequence of the absence of a specific measure capable of quantifying the nociception level of the patients. Unlike existing proposals, this paper aims to evaluate the suitability of the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) as a guidance variable to replicate the decisions made by the experts when a modification of the opioid infusion rate is required. To this end, different machine learning classifiers were trained with several sets of clinical features. Data for training were captured from 17 patients undergoing cholecystectomy surgery. Satisfactory results were obtained when including information about minimum values of ANI for predicting a change of dose. Specifically, a higher efficiency of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was observed compared with the situation in which the ANI index was not included: accuracy: 86.21% (83.62%\u201387.93%), precision: 86.11% (83.78%\u201388.57%), recall: 91.18% (88.24%\u201391.18%), specificity: 79.17% (75%\u201383.33%), AUC: 0.89 (0.87\u20130.90) and kappa index: 0.71 (0.66\u20130.75). The results of this research evidenced that including information about the minimum values of ANI together with the hemodynamic information outperformed the decisions made regarding only non-specific traditional signs such as heart rate and blood pressure. In addition, the analysis of the results showed that including the ANI monitor in the decision making process may anticipate a dose change to prevent hemodynamic events.

In tracking, we propose a two-step approach: (i) The first step uses baseline matching for a good initialization. The matching strategy between the current frame and a set of adaptive keyframes is also involved to be recoverable in terms of failed tracking. (ii) The second step estimates the model parameters using a heuristic method via pose-wise SVMs. The combination makes our approach work robustly with wide rotation, up to \\(90^{\\circ }\\) of vertical axis. In addition, our method appears to be robust even in the presence of fast movements thanks to baseline matching. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our method shows a good compromise of rigid and non-rigid parameter accuracies.

Force sensitive resistors can be used to measure the force/pressure between the shoe and the patient's foot, providing information about the gait dynamics when the patient walks.

Here we propose to train generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn a generative model of images that is conditioned on measurements of brain activity. We consider two challenges of this approach: First, given that GANs require far more data to train than is typically collected in an fMRI experiment, how do we obtain enough samples to train a GAN that is conditioned on brain activity? Secondly, how do we ensure that our generated samples are robust against noise present in fMRI data? Our strategy to surmount both of these problems centers around the creation of surrogate brain activity samples that are generated by an encoding model.

To automate the process of postal services, it is necessary to integrate contributions from a wide range of image processing domains, from image acquisition and preprocessing to interpretation through symbol, character and word recognition. Lately, machine learning approaches are deployed for postal address processing. Parsing problem has been explored using different techniques, like regular expressions, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). These traditional techniques are designed on the assumption that the data is free from OCR errors which decreases the adaptability of the architecture in the real-world scenarios. Furthermore, their performance is affected in the presence of non-standardized addresses resulting in intermixing of similar classes. In this paper, we present the first trainable neural network based robust architecture DeepParse for postal address parsing that tackles these issues and can be applied to any Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem.

Moreover, where information about the physicochemical properties of amino acids has been used, the methods employed to exploit that information are less than optimal and could use the information more effectively.ResultsIn this paper, we propose a new algorithm called pSLIP which uses Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in conjunction with multiple physicochemical properties of amino acids to predict protein subcellular localization in eukaryotes across six different locations, namely, chloroplast, cytoplasmic, extracellular, mitochondrial, nuclear and plasma membrane.

Our algorithm is called Active Vote, and it works by actively selecting instances that force several perturbed copies of an on-line algorithm to make mistakes. The main intuition for our result is based on the fact that the number of mistakes made by the optimal on-line algorithm is a lower bound on the number of labels needed for active learning. We provide performance bounds for Active Vote in both a batch and on-line model of active learning. These performance bounds depend on the algorithm having a set of unlabeled instances in which the various perturbed on-line algorithms disagree.

A BMI enables a direct interface between the brain and machines and is capable of translating neuronal information into meaningful actions (e.g., Electromyography based control of a prosthetic hand). One of the biggest challenges in developing a surface Electromyography (sEMG) based interface is the selection of the right muscles for the execution of a desired task. In this work, we investigate optimal muscle selections for sEMG based decoding of dexterous in-hand manipulation motions. To do that, we use EMG signals derived from 14 muscle sites of interest (7 on the hand and 7 on the forearm) and an optical motion capture system that records the object motion. The regression problem is formulated using the Random Forests methodology that is based on decision trees. Regarding features selection, we use the following time-domain features: root mean square, waveform length and zero crossings. A 5-fold cross validation procedure is used for model assessment purposes and the importance values are calculated for each feature. This pilot study shows that the muscles of the hand contribute more than the muscles of the forearm to the execution of inhand manipulation tasks and that the myoelectric activations of the hand muscles provide better estimation accuracies for the decoding of manipulation motions. These outcomes suggest that the loss of the hand muscles in certain amputations limits the amputees' ability to perform a dexterous, EMG based control of a prosthesis in manipulation tasks. The results discussed can also be used for improving the efficiency and intuitiveness of EMG based interfaces for healthy subjects.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30440716", "doi": "10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512624", "venue": "2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)", "journal": "2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2898994347", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14593631", "18560493", "44247135", "207392340", "8029784", "23710010", "15353244", "44388479", "5906361", "1470269", "24098643", "106718230", "32104730", "20719385", "2260501"], "inbound_citations": ["215542121", "198147169", "201630849"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53095324"}

We construct a set of 393 non-redundant AP-NP ortholog pairs and calculate a total of 889 sequence based features for these proteins. The pairwise alignments of these ortholog pairs are used to build a residue substitution propensity matrix between APs and NPs. We use Gini importance provided by the Random Forest algorithm to rank the relative importance of these features. A scoring function using the 10 most significant features is developed and optimized using a hill climbing algorithm. The accuracy of the score function is 86.01% in predicting AP-NP ortholog pairs and is 76.65% in predicting non-ortholog AP-NP pairs, suggesting that there are significant differences between APs and NPs which can be used to predict relative acidostability of proteins.

These architectures seem to have common features with the human short-term memory regarding recall. Both show a strong recency effect; however, the human memory also exhibits a primacy effect due to rehearsal. The problem is that the connectionist models do not have the primacy aspect, which complicates the learning of long-term dependencies. A long-term dependency is when items presented early should affect the behaviour of the model. Learning long-term dependencies is a problem that is hard to address within these architectures. Delay-lines might be used as a mechanism for implementing rehearsal within connectionist models. However, it has not been clarified how the use of delay-lines affects the recency and the primacy aspect. In this thesis, delay-lines are introduced in B-RAAM. This study investigates how the primacy and the recency aspect are affected by the use of delay-lines, aiming to improve the ability to identify long-term dependencies.

The goal of this research was to map vegetation physiognomies in a mountainous area by using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data and morphometrical covariates through data mining techniques. The research was based on red-edge (RE) bands, and indices, to classify phytophysiognomies at two taxonomic levels. The input data was pixel sampled based on field sample sites. Data mining procedures comprised covariate selection and supervised classification through the Random Forest model. Results showed the potential of bands 3, 5, and 6 to map phytophysiognomies for both seasons, as well as Green Chlorophyll (CLg) and SAVI indices. NDVI indices were important, particularly those calculated with bands 6, 7, 8, and 8A, which were placed at the RE position. The model performance showed reasonable success to Kappa index 0.72 and 0.56 for the first and fifth taxonomic level, respectively. The model presented confusion between Broadleaved dwarf-forest, Parkland Savanna, and Bushy grassland. Savanna formations occurred variably in the area while Bushy grasslands strictly occur in certain landscape positions. Broadleaved forests presented the best performance (first taxonomic level), and among its variation (fifth level) the model could precisely capture the pattern for those on deep soils from gneiss parent material.

Fault diagnosis has been accomplished using a Hilbert transform for denoising the signal. The dimensionality of the extracted features was reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and thereafter the selected features were ranked in order of relevance using the Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) method for reducing the number of input features and finding the most optimal feature set. Finally, these selected features have been passed to Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for identifying and further classifying the various bearing defects. A comparative analysis of the effectiveness of SVM and ANN has been carried out. The results reveal that the vibration signatures obtained from developed non-contact sensor (NCS) compare well with the accelerometer data obtained under the same conditions.

Identifying the entity information in government documents is the core foundation of intelligent document processing tasks, such as word segmentation, semantic analysis and knowledge graph construction. To recognize entity, traditional Machine Learning algorithm has the advantage of relatively small tagging corpus requirement. However, this feature also means that this algorithm can hardly capture the implicit semantic information in sentences, which leads to the low accuracy of document entity recognition. Also, this method requires tremendous manual work of feature designing. In contrast, Deep Learning algorithm needs a large tagging corpus. But it gives the algorithm ability to automatically acquire semantic feature information between context. So, the accuracy performance of entity recognition is greatly improved. Combining respective advantages of these above methods, this paper proposes a semi-supervised Deep Learning algorithm framework, which first implement the Conditional Random Field (CRF) and pseudo-labeling to expand the corpus, and then utilize the Dilated Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) plus CRF for extracting entities in official documents. The experimental results show that, compared with other methods, the accuracy, recall rate and F1 value of entity recognition are improved by 5.02%, 5.85% and 5.44% respectively.

The Sentinel-2 satellites are providing an unparalleled wealth of high-resolution remotely sensed information with a short revisit cycle, which is ideal for mapping burned areas both accurately and timely. However, the high detail and volume of the information provided actually encumbers the automation of the mapping process, at least for the level of automation required to map systematically wildfires on a national level. This paper presents a preliminary methodology for mapping burned areas using Sentinel-2 data, which aims to eliminate user interaction and achieve mapping accuracy that is acceptable for operational use. It follows an objectbased image analysis (OBIA) approach, whereby the initial image is segmented into a set of adjacent and non-overlapping small regions (objects). The most unambiguous of them are labeled automatically through a set of empirical rules that combine information extracted from both a pre-fire Sentinel-2 image and a post-fire one. The burned area is finally delineated following a supervised learning approach, whereby a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained using the labeled objects and subsequently applied to the whole image considering a set of optimally selected object-level features. Preliminary results on a set of recent large wildfires in Greece indicate that the proposed methodology constitutes a solid basis for fully automating the burned area mapping process.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2535816", "venue": "International Conference on Remote Sensing and Geoinformation of Environment", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2956032650", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["55522491", "84718873", "134556463", "52279950", "54570654", "128957608", "581461", "134236419", "14426796", "126531894", "15597277", "7287309", "134708469", "133677694", "132286159", "129494315", "30964646", "23702320", "8489515", "14842224", "133358670", "56098160", "54800464", "16183812", "55700035", "13041988"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197660444"}

The ground model is a novel extension of elevation maps using Conditional Random Fields. It allows estimation of ground type (grass vs. asphalt) in addition to modelling the geometry of the scene. The object model involves two segmentation procedures. The first is a novel extension of elevation maps to a hierarchical clustering algorithm. The second is a new algorithm for defining regions of interest in images, which reasons jointly in the 3D Cartesian frame and the image plane. These two procedures provide a segmentation of the objects in the 3D laser data and in the images. Based on the resulting segmentation, object classification is implemented using a rule based system to combine binary deterministic and probabilistic features. The overall 3D classifier is tested on logs acquired by the MIT Urban Grand Challenge 2007 vehicle. The classifier achieves an accuracy of 89% on a set of 500 scenes involving 16 classes.

However, they actively continue to explore effective classifiers for developing efficient change prediction models. Recent developments have ascertained that ensemble methodology can be used to improve the prediction performance of individual classifiers. Objective This study proposes four strategies of ensemble learning to predict change prone classes by combining seven individual Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based classifiers as constituents of ensembles and aggregating them using weighted voting. Method The weights allocated to individual classifiers are based on their accuracy and their ability to correctly predict \u201chard instances\u201d i.e. classes which are frequently misclassified by a majority of classifiers. Each individual PSO based classifier uses a different fitness function. The ensembles are constructed on the premises that change in fitness functions leads to variation in the results of a search-based algorithm such as PSO. Therefore, it is important to combine them to obtain a better classifier with improved accuracy using the ensemble methodology. Results The proposed strategies of ensemble learning were found effective in predicting software change. The statistical analysis of the results indicates improved performance of the proposed ensemble classifiers as compared to individual classifiers. Furthermore, the results of the proposed voting ensemble classifiers were found competent with those of machine-learning ensemble classifiers for determination of change prone classes. Conclusion The accuracy and diversity of the individual classifiers were instrumental in the superior performance of the proposed voting ensemble classifiers.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.infsof.2018.05.007", "venue": "Inf.

However, most RL algorithms struggle to learn in this setting since the learning signal is mostly zeros. In contrast, humans are good at assessing and predicting the future consequences of actions and can serve as good reward/policy shapers to accelerate the robot learning process. Previous works have shown that the human brain generates an error-related signal, measurable using electroencephelography (EEG), when the human perceives the task being done erroneously. In this work, we propose a method that uses evaluative feedback obtained from human brain signals measured via scalp EEG to accelerate RL for robotic agents in sparse reward settings. As the robot learns the task, the EEG of a human observer watching the robot attempts is recorded and decoded into noisy error feedback signal. From this feedback, we use supervised learning to obtain a policy that subsequently augments the behavior policy and guides exploration in the early stages of RL. This bootstraps the RL learning process to enable learning from sparse reward. Using a robotic navigation task as a test bed, we show that our method achieves a stable obstacle-avoidance policy with high success rate, outperforming learning from sparse rewards only that struggles to achieve obstacle avoidance behavior or fails to advance to the goal.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1910.00682", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2978957027", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["7304077", "5730166", "23192910", "3543784", "2994241", "14678361", "4787508", "4130751", "215705455", "25466345", "2987770", "17766190", "215554061", "4001028", "19711303", "131774149", "25728159", "1698611", "206760867", "10740580", "6958386", "16832558", "52282797", "3849381", "7696712", "28695052", "49358881", "49865049", "10192371", "13178416", "14925373"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203626932"}

This requires the camera objective to be vertically positioned with a precision of 0.4 \u00b5m in order for the objects in the images to be considered properly focused. Because of the small distances, the system is sensitive to vibrations and errors due to mechanical imperfections are hard to avoid. In order to replace the mechanical auto focus in the system, it would be desirable to digitally transform unfocused images to appear focused after they were captured. ::: ::: In this thesis we investigate if it is possible to transform an unfocused cell image to a sharp one using generative adversarial networks (GANs). A data set of 10 786 sharp images were collected together with blurry images captured at different distances from the optimal focus, using CellaVision\u2019s systems. From implementing and comparing three already defined GANs - pix2pix, PAN and deblurGAN - we saw that pix2pix performed best for our problem. Moving on with pix2pix, we added losses and changed the network structure to improve the result. To make the network faster, we also changed the architecture of the generator network. We ended up with three different GANs, whereof one met the time requirement of transforming a 360\u00d7360 image in 70 ms on a CPU. ::: ::: Generally, all of the three final networks managed to sharpen all of the blurry images to some extent, but not always to the desired focus.

Recently, intelligent techniques have been found useful in drug design. It is possible to gather information from known interactions and to predict specific properties of the unknown interactions with the help of bioinformatics and machine learning. The aim of this study is to propose a novel computational methodology, which is called Compressed Images for Affinity Prediction, CIFAP, to predict binding affinities of structurally related protein-ligand complexes. The CIFAP method is based on a protein-ligand model from which computational affinity information is obtained by utilizing 2D electrostatic potential images determined for the binding site of protein-ligand complexes. The study has two phases, namely, data modeling and prediction. After each ligand is docked to the protein, the binding site is isolated from the complex as the binding pocket of the protein with its ligand. The isolated 3D structure is located into an electrostatic potential grid box which is then compressed through three orthogonal directions into three 2D images for each protein-ligand complex. Sequential forward selection technique is applied in order to obtain patterns from the images and to avoid redundant features in prediction. The quality of the CIFAP method is tested using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) which are highly promising prediction methods in drug design. The computational algorithm presented here is proposed to have a great potential in pharmacophore-based drug design.

Illuminant Estimation is typically used as a pre-processing step in many computer vision tasks. In this thesis, we tackle this problem for both RGB and multispectral images. First, for RGB images we extend a moments based method in several ways: firstly by replacing the standard expectation value, the mean, considering moments that are based on a Minkowski p-norm; and then secondly by going over to a float value for the parameter p and carrying out a nonlinear optimization on this parameter; and finally by considering a different expectation value, generated by using the geometric mean. We show that these strategies can drive down the median and maximum error of illuminant estimates. And then for multispectral images, we formulate a multiple-illuminants estimation problem as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) optimization task over local estimations.

In past decade, one such decent and novel algorithm, extreme learning machine (ELM) has received attention due to its fast learning rate and better generalization ability in contrast to orthodox gradient descent learning algorithms for single-hidden-layer feed forward neural network. Despite it\u2019s advantages, the single-hidden-layer feed forward neural network trained using ELM require more number of hidden neurons and faces poor condition problem as the input weights and hidden biases are randomly created. One way to overcome this problem is to use an optimization technique for finding an optimum set of input weights. In this work, we have proposed a hybrid learning scheme which uses one such optimisation technique called cat swarm optimization (CSO) to find an optimum set of input-hidden node weights and then this set of optimal input weights is used to analytically determine the output weights by using Moore-Penrose generalized inverse. Some optimisation techniques have been previously proposed like particle swarm optimisation but not CSO. In this work, modifications have been made to the existing CSO technique with the specific goal of further improving the generalization performance as well as the reducing the poor condition of networks trained using ELM. The proposed modifications 1) help in improving the search diversity of CSO, which allows better exploration of the solution search space and 2) improves the condition of the SLFN trained using ELM by including the norm of output weights in the evolutionary operator. Three standard benchmark datasets have been collected from the UCI machine learning repository to validate the performance of the proposed scheme and comparative analysis has been made with other state of the art optimisation techniques. The proposed scheme, along with other evolutionary algorithms, requires a smaller number of hidden neuron compared to traditional the ELM for attaining almost similar classification accuracy. The experimental results also show that the proposed hybrid approach is able to produce well condition SLFNs with much better generalization performance.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2788355949", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67460553"}

These two limitations, high accuracy and abundance, are often taken together; however, insight into the dataset accuracy limitation of contemporary machine learning algorithms may yield insight into whether non-bench experimental sources of data may be used to generate useful machine learning models where there is a paucity of experimental data. We took highly accurate data across six kinase types, one GPCR, one polymerase, a human protease, and HIV protease, and intentionally introduced error at varying population proportions in the datasets for each target. With the generated error in the data, we explored how the retrospective accuracy of a Naive Bayes Network, a Random Forest Model, and a Probabilistic Neural Network model decayed as a function of error. Additionally, we explored the ability of a training dataset with an error profile resembling that produced by the Free Energy Perturbation method (FEP+) to generate machine learning models with useful retrospective capabilities. The categorical error tolerance was quite high for a Naive Bayes Network algorithm averaging 39% error in the training set required to lose predictivity on the test set. Additionally, a Random Forest tolerated a significant degree of categorical error introduced into the training set with an average error of 29% required to lose predictivity. However, we found the Probabilistic Neural Network algorithm did not tolerate as much categorical error requiring an average of 20% error to lose predictivity.

We introduce a method for learning image features with locally connected layers in SNNs using a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule. In our approach, sub-networks compete via inhibitory interactions to learn features from different locations of the input space. These locally-connected SNNs (LC-SNNs) manifest key topological features of the spatial interaction of biological neurons. We explore a biologically inspired n -gram classification approach allowing parallel processing over various patches of the image space. We report the classification accuracy of simple two-layer LC-SNNs on two image datasets, which respectively match state-of-art performance and are the first results to date. LC-SNNs have the advantage of fast convergence to a dataset representation, and they require fewer learnable parameters than other SNN approaches with unsupervised learning. Robustness tests demonstrate that LC-SNNs exhibit graceful degradation of performance despite the random deletion of large numbers of synapses and neurons.

A common practice on this topic is the so-called Info-Kmeans, which performs K-means clustering with KL-divergence as the proximity function. While research efforts devoted to Info-Kmeans have shown promising results, a remaining challenge is to deal with high-dimensional sparse data such as text corpora. Indeed, it is possible that the centroids contain many zero-value features for high-dimensional text vectors, which lead to infinite KL-divergence values and create a dilemma in assigning objects to centroids during the iteration process of Info-Kmeans. To meet this challenge, we propose a Summation-based Incremental Learning (SAIL) algorithm for Info-Kmeans clustering in this chapter. Specifically, by using an equivalent objective function, SAIL replaces the computation of KL-divergence by the incremental computation of the Shannon entropy, which successfully avoids the zero-value dilemma. To improve the clustering quality, we further introduce the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) meta-heuristic and propose the V-SAIL algorithm, which is then accelerated by a multithreading scheme in PV-SAIL.

During dynamic analysis it is common practice to capture the system calls that are made to better understand the behaviour of malware. There are several techniques to capture system calls, the most popular of which is a user-level hook. To study the effects of collecting system calls at different privilege levels and viewpoints, we collected data at a process-specific user-level using a virtualised sandbox environment and a system-wide kernel-level using a custom-built kernel driver. We then tested the performance of several state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers on the data. Random Forest was the best performing classifier with an accuracy of 95.2% for the kernel driver and 94.0% at a user-level. The combination of user and kernel level data gave the best classification results with an accuracy of 96.0% for Random Forest. This may seem intuitive but was hitherto not empirically demonstrated. Additionally, we observed that machine learning algorithms trained on data from the user-level tended to use the anti-debug/anti-vm features in malware to distinguish it from benignware. Whereas, when trained on data from our kernel driver, machine learning algorithms seemed to use the differences in the general behaviour of the system to make their prediction, which explains why they complement each other so well. Our results show that capturing data at different privilege levels will affect the classifier\u2019s ability to detect malware, with kernel-level providing more utility than user-level for malware classification. Despite this, there exist more established user-level tools than kernel-level tools, suggesting more research effort should be directed at kernel-level. In short, this paper provides the first objective, evidence-based comparison of user and kernel level data for the purposes of malware classification.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jisa.2019.102365", "venue": "J.

Extending learning techniques such as neural networks to process such non-euclidean data is therefore an important direction for machine learning research.

There is no straight forward application of machine learning to network data as machine learning tools are designed for $i.i.d$ data, simple euclidean data or grids. To address this challenge the technical focus of this dissertation is on use of graph neural networks for Network Representation Learning (NRL) i.e. learning vector representations of nodes in networks. Learning vector embeddings of graph-structured data is similar to embedding complex data into low-dimensional geometries. After the embedding process is completed, drawbacks associated with graph structured data are overcome. The current inquiry proposes two deep learning auto-encoder based approaches for generating node embeddings. The drawbacks in existing auto-encoder approaches such as shallow architectures and excessive parameters are tackled in the proposed architectures using fully convolutional layers.

We aim to provide some guidance in this decision making process. Specifically, given a classification problem with real valued attributes, we consider which classifier or family of classifiers should one use.

All three families of model could claim to be state-of-the-art, and yet it is not clear when one is preferable to the others. Our extensive experiments with over 200 data sets from two distinct archives demonstrate that, rather than choose a single family and expend computing resources on optimising that model, it is significantly better to build simpler versions of classifiers from each family and ensemble. We show that the Heterogeneous Ensembles of Standard Classification Algorithms (HESCA), which ensembles based on error estimates formed on the train data, is significantly better (in terms of error, balanced error, negative log likelihood and area under the ROC curve) than its individual components, picking the component that is best on train data, and a support vector machine tuned over 1089 different parameter configurations. We demonstrate HESCA+, which contains a deep neural network, a support vector machine and two decision tree forests, is significantly better than its components, picking the best component, and HESCA. We analyse the results further and find that HESCA and HESCA+ are of particular value when the train set size is relatively small and the problem has multiple classes.

The vast majority of existing approaches simply ignore such auxiliary (privileged) knowledge. Recently a new paradigm-learning using privileged information-was introduced in the framework of SVM+. This approach is formulated for binary classification and, as typical for many kernel-based methods, can scale unfavorably with the number of training examples. While speeding up training methods and extensions of SVM+ to multiclass problems are possible, in this paper we present a more direct novel methodology for incorporating valuable privileged knowledge in the model construction phase, primarily formulated in the framework of generalized matrix learning vector quantization. This is done by changing the global metric in the input space, based on distance relations revealed by the privileged information.

In the training process, classifiers are trained with different kernel parameters, and only one of the classifiers is required for the testing process. This makes the training process time-consuming. In this paper we propose using separation indexes to estimate the generalization ability of the classifiers. These indexes are derived from the inter-cluster distances in the feature spaces.

Traditional defect prediction features often fail to capture the semantic differences between different programs. This degrades the performance of the prediction models built on these traditional features. Thus, the capability to capture the semantics in programs is required to build accurate prediction models. To bridge the gap between semantics and defect prediction features, we propose leveraging a powerful representation-learning algorithm, deep learning, to learn the semantic representations of programs automatically from source code files and code changes. Specifically, we leverage a deep belief network (DBN) to automatically learn semantic features using token vectors extracted from the programs' abstract syntax trees (AST) (for file-level defect prediction models) and source code changes (for change-level defect prediction models). We examine the effectiveness of our approach on two file-level defect prediction tasks (i.e., file-level within-project defect prediction and file-level cross-project defect prediction) and two change-level defect prediction tasks (i.e., change-level within-project defect prediction and change-level cross-project defect prediction). Our experimental results indicate that the DBN-based semantic features can significantly improve the examined defect prediction tasks. Specifically, the improvements of semantic features against existing traditional features (in F1) range from 2.1 to 41.9 percentage points for file-level within-project defect prediction, from 1.5 to 13.4 percentage points for file-level cross-project defect prediction, from 1.0 to 8.6 percentage points for change-level within-project defect prediction, and from 0.6 to 9.9 percentage points for change-level cross-project defect prediction.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSE.2018.2877612", "venue": null, "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2898435572", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["23478018", "14350991", "40814979", "1554582", "10546301", "9493847", "2161592", "120306333", "17625754", "14691851", "62157473", "9429668", "7375309", "47021242", "11540100", "59785678", "2739029", "6992832", "206742563", "15980354", "713631", "2309950", "1658773", "743679", "6494803", "4708148", "5210955", "23263142", "207182854", "13978413", "18077633", "988348", "25683616", "14525572", "2065665", "14788283", "47388286", "7410492", "195908774", "206511804", "16539333", "1474148", "207927251", "9116234", "21675120", "14503179", "10712872", "36601646", "10097073", "10267782", "16074379", "1914494", "1770555", "14743733", "6492248", "11067362", "291524", "11067362", "5740922", "207551224", "15283541", "58499351", "12909011", "44925943", "788838", "6780262", "17550406", "10662655", "6370564", "14838925", "6720884", "823423", "12421193", "17904304", "13040187", "6488286", "398770", "5832984", "13308089", "9438267", "9439971", "9963", "15972006", "10482384", "10482384", "12199504", "10769502", "18257062", "14784402", "367166", "140109802", "1288542", "31801173", "17483596", "17547160", "17864628", "207214257", "207212687", "5893370", "14638984", "2394257"], "inbound_citations": ["211226953", "209093408", "201527097", "212733953", "195298550", "211297689", "202750179", "199002922", "214692826", "201070624", "202548549"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69422210"}

Dissatisfied with the Symbolic tradition, and in search of the new, many cognitive theorists began to infiltrate connectionism in search of a new theory of mind. Like the Classicists, these theorists required that a constructed, analytic theory of mind postulate complex structured representations; it is only by having structural similarities among representations that we can account for the systematic nature of human thought. The Classical view is that the systematic relations between representations are necessarily based on the composition of similar syntactic elements. Likewise, some of the representational types found in the connectionist literature satisfy this requirement, only by virtue of the fact that they are similar to Classically conceived symbolic representations. For example, the structure of complex expression may be maintained in vector frames consisting of explicit tokens or complex expressions that are essentially passed around a net [18]. Only distributed representations offered the promise of a novel representational scheme that could underpin a connectionist theory of cognition; a scheme that relied upon the assumption that structural similarity relations can be captured in a connectionist net by systematic vectorial distances between the distributed representations created.", "year": 1995, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-0-585-29599-2_7", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "5511432", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["14443531", "10389786", "18327868", "14079587", "3032037", "13910679", "14832902", "17622772", "6448160", "27318211", "16360263", "12085519", "1418870", "5181881", "18486551"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116428413"}

Monitoring traffic situations becomes an important challenge for the Traffic Control and Surveillance Systems (TCSS). In advanced TCSS, it is helpful to automatically detect and classify different traffic incidents such as severity of congestion, abnormal driving pattern, abrupt or illegal stop on road, etc. Although most TCSS are equipped with basic incident detection algorithms, they are however crude to be really useful as an automated tool for further classification. In literature, there is a lack of research for Automated Incident Classification (AIC). Therefore, a novel AIC method is proposed in this paper to tackle such challenges. In the proposed method, traffic signals are firstly extracted from captured videos and converted as spatial-temporal (ST) signals. Based on the characteristics of the ST signals, a set of realistic simulation data are generated to construct an extended large-scale traffic database to cover a variety of traffic situations. Next, a local mean filter is introduced to suppress the effect of noise and extract significant features from the ST signals. The extracted features are then associated with various types of traffic data: one normal type (inliers) and multiple abnormal types (outliers). For the classification, an adaptive boosting classifier is trained to detect outliers in traffic data automatically. Further, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method is adopted to train the model for identifying the categories of outliers. In short, this hybrid approach is called an Adaptive Boosting Support Vector Machines (AB-SVM) method. Experimental results show that the proposed AB-SVM method achieves a satisfied result with more than 92% classification accuracy on average.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2018.07.044", "venue": "Inf.

Channel State Information (CSI), containing more fine-grained information than Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), is a natural candidate for localization application and has been studied in many works. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a fast and robust algorithm, but it has only one hidden layer, which limits its capacity. One of the most popular ways of improving accuracy is to use multiple different models to obtain better predictive performance. In this paper, we propose a device-free localization approach using an ensemble of ELMs in which each ELM has the same number of hidden nodes. The proposed approach models the localization task as a regression problem. First, we leverage a modified driver to collect CSI and extract phase information. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is then applied to reduce the dimensionality of the phase features. After that, the processed features are fed into an ensemble of ELMs to output their respective predictions. The final prediction is an average combination of them.

Most existing community detection algorithms only focus on network structures and ignore node attributes, which are also important. Although some algorithms using both node attributes and network structure information have been proposed in recent years, the complex hierarchical coupling relationships within and between attributes, nodes and network structure have not been considered. Such hierarchical couplings are driving factors in community formation. This paper introduces a novel coupled node similarity (CNS) to involve and learn attribute and structure couplings and compute the similarity within and between nodes with categorical attributes in a network. CNS learns and integrates the frequency-based intra-attribute coupled similarity within an attribute, the co-occurrence-based inter-attribute coupled similarity between attributes, and coupled attribute-to-structure similarity based on the homophily property. CNS is then used to generate the weights of edges and transfer a plain graph to a weighted graph. Clustering algorithms detect community structures that are topologically well-connected and semantically coherent on the weighted graphs. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of CNS-based community detection algorithms on several data sets by comparing with the state-of-the-art node similarity measures, whether they involve node attribute information and hierarchical interactions, and on various levels of network structure complexity.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/e20060471", "venue": "Entropy", "journal": "Entropy", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2807842333", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["33568117", "6496069", "2760873", "6702064", "16717512", "1061056", "6464234", "15437128", "1464162", "6818995", "63411378", "16349115", "6404200", "206751095", "125866813", "1187141", "10519440", "16650021", "6053503", "5652700", "11192392", "125151607", "2341021", "6759040", "334423", "39726565", "18741059", "21690881", "18481617", "157568232", "121846226", "38782128"], "inbound_citations": ["210693721", "59291997", "209439590", "67777015", "52950857"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49349991"}

To that extent, the sorption and retention of these metals were studied and the soil characterization was performed separately. Multiple stepwise regression was used to produce multivariate models with linear techniques and with support vector machines, all of which included 15 explanatory variables characterizing soils. When the R-squared values are represented, two different groups are noticed. Cr, Cu and Pb sorption and retention show a higher R-squared; the most explanatory variables being humified organic matter, Al oxides and, in some cases, cation-exchange capacity (CEC). The other group of metals (Cd, Ni and Zn) shows a lower R-squared, and clays are the most explanatory variables, including a percentage of vermiculite and slime. In some cases, quartz, plagioclase or hematite percentages also show some explanatory capacity. Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression shows that the different models are not as regular as in multiple regression in terms of number of variables, the regression for nickel adsorption being the one with the highest number of variables in its optimal model. On the other hand, there are cases where the most explanatory variables are the same for two metals, as it happens with Cd and Cr adsorption. A similar adsorption mechanism is thus postulated. These patterns of the introduction of variables in the model allow us to create explainability sequences. Those which are the most similar to the selectivity sequences obtained by Covelo (2005) are Mn oxides in multiple regression and change capacity in SVM. Among all the variables, the only one that is explanatory for all the metals after applying the maximum parsimony principle is the percentage of sand in the retention process. In the competitive model arising from the aforementioned sequences, the most intense competitiveness for the adsorption and retention of different metals appears between Cr and Cd, Cu and Zn in multiple regression; and between Cr and Cd in SVM regression.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28363173", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.195", "venue": "The Science of the total environment", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "mag_id": "2602628951", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202776082", "213753259", "21898652"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4183207"}

Two neural word embeddings were derived from the unlabeled Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) II corpus (403,871 notes). The results from both 2010 i2b2 and 2014 Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) data showed that the binarized word embedding features outperformed other strategies for deriving distributed word representations. The binarized embedding features improved the F1-score of the Conditional Random Fields based clinical NER system by 2.3% on i2b2 data and 2.4% on SemEval data. The combined feature from the binarized embeddings and the Brown clusters improved the F1-score of the clinical NER system by 2.9% on i2b2 data and 2.7% on SemEval data. Our study also showed that the distributed word embedding features derived from a large unlabeled corpus can be better than the widely used Brown clusters. Further analysis found that the neural word embeddings captured a wide range of semantic relations, which could be discretized into distributed word representations to benefit the clinical NER system.

The grading process is carried out by capturing the fruit image using digital camera and this image is interpreted using image various processing techniques.

In realistic scenarios, however, this assumption is often violated, and ensemble learners based on it can be severely sub-optimal. The key challenges we address in this paper are:\\ (i) how to detect, in an unsupervised manner, strong violations of conditional independence; and (ii) construct a suitable meta-learner. To this end we introduce a statistical model that allows for dependencies between classifiers. Our main contributions are the development of novel unsupervised methods to detect strongly dependent classifiers, better estimate their accuracies, and construct an improved meta-learner.

Filtering unwanted areas of a point cloud, such as vegetation and talus, is often a necessary step before rockfall change detection results can be further processed into actionable information. In addition, long-term monitoring through seasonal vegetation changes and snow presents unique challenges to the goal of accurate classification in an automated workflow. This study presents a Random Forest machine learning approach to improve the classification accuracy and efficiency of terrestrial LiDAR monitoring of complex natural slopes. The algorithm classifies points as vegetation, talus, snow, and bedrock using multi-scale neighborhood geometry, slope, change, and intensity features. The classifier was trained on two manually labeled scans from summer and winter, then tested on three other unseen times. We find that F Score generally remains above 0.9 for talus and vegetation, and above 0.95 for bedrock and snow, indicating very high accuracy and an ability to adapt to changing seasonal conditions. In comparing this approach to CANUPO, an existing classification tool, we find our approach to be generally more accurate and flexible, at the expense of increased complexity and computation time.

However changes induced by pathology may be subtle and affected regions of the brain can only be revealed by a group-based analysis of patients in comparison with healthy controls. This in turn requires voxel-based statistical analysis of spatially normalized brain DT images, as in the case of conventional MR images. However this process is rendered extremely challenging in DT-MRI due to the high dimensionality of the data and its inherent non-linearity that causes linear component analysis methods to be inapplicable. We therefore propose a novel framework for the statistical analysis of DT-MRI data using manifold-based techniques such as isomap and kernel PCA that determine the underlying manifold structure of the data, embed it to a manifold and help perform high dimensional statistics on the manifold to determine regions of difference between the groups of patients and controls.

To maintain the diversity of swarms, a few studies of multi-swarm strategy have been reported.

In this paper, we formulate four rules by introducing the mechanism for survival of the fittest, which simulates the competition among the swarms. Based on the mechanism, we design a modified Multi-Swarm PSO (MSPSO) to solve discrete problems, which consists of a number of sub-swarms and a multi-swarm scheduler that can monitor and control each sub-swarm using the rules. To further settle the feature selection problems, we propose an Improved Feature Selection (IFS) method by integrating MSPSO, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with F-score method. The IFS method aims to achieve higher generalization capability through performing kernel parameter optimization and feature selection simultaneously. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the standard PSO based, Genetic Algorithm (GA) based and the grid search based methods on 10 benchmark datasets, taken from UCI machine learning and StatLog databases.

These methods often complement each other. This paper addresses the problem of aggregating various saliency analysis methods such that the aggregation result outperforms each individual one. We have two major observations. First, different methods perform differently in saliency analysis. Second, the performance of a saliency analysis method varies with individual images. Our idea is to use data-driven approaches to saliency aggregation that appropriately consider the performance gaps among individual methods and the performance dependence of each method on individual images. This paper discusses various data-driven approaches and finds that the image-dependent aggregation method works best. Specifically, our method uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework for saliency aggregation that not only models the contribution from individual saliency map but also the interaction between neighboring pixels. To account for the dependence of aggregation on an individual image, our approach selects a subset of images similar to the input image from a training data set and trains the CRF aggregation model only using this subset instead of the whole training set. Our experiments on public saliency benchmarks show that our aggregation method outperforms each individual saliency method and is robust with the selection of aggregated methods.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2013.150", "venue": "2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "journal": "2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2127707449", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17925054", "1334960", "10784305", "63581535", "2329405", "17929353", "9457213", "14263463", "53304348", "123355102", "629401", "15611611", "192077", "2329233", "3108956", "16445820", "14018752", "277918", "13411369", "14585963", "36630067", "15283002", "15948355", "14196753", "11010048", "18654057", "16326559", "16639270", "11664336", "9146763", "16978751", "2372299", "11058570", "1981976", "353246", "2079305", "12831365", "12495838", "62424284", "5219826"], "inbound_citations": ["7724625", "682177", "17752027", "3862140", "208958093", "53875268", "7056668", "1123933", "5294334", "123593557", "196212389", "2568567", "4549992", "25797624", "7538826", "204738329", "16311237", "206444471", "15102704", "3743416", "3463278", "19036088", "10265579", "4354362", "207574757", "52273189", "1210992", "7581411", "13684920", "61156625", "53714602", "28543626", "8900002", "2280516", "9647606", "180261377", "17015012", "1689472", "11094593", "4368665", "55150008", "195811878", "6116678", "8909128", "5347085", "211074499", "1116509", "56598244", "39693323", "6298527", "30058718", "71147803", "16811103", "211227920", "14822494", "7471352", "13708117", "4890033", "798346", "67427643", "3086245", "85463851", "49538399", "8588276", "8744228", "46985707", "2822325", "2321266", "202570845", "14438263", "35702871", "23695284", "5036816", "23891555", "24912048", "25324526", "25324526", "51616198", "45017768", "41308102", "210041161", "201871211", "7277695", "15750375", "145819250"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6136598"}

Several models have been developed to predict the average Received Signal Strength (RSS) for specified distance ranges. However, the use of deterministic models requires high computational efficiency while the prediction results of empirical models may not be as accurate as required. On machine learning approach, the performances of multi-layered feed-forward network models are limited by slow convergence and local minimum, such that a global optimal solution is not guaranteed. In this paper, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm is considered in the development of an optimal path loss prediction model for outdoor propagation scenario. Single Hidden Layer Feed-forward Neural Networks (SHLFNNs) are trained and tested with the path loss data that were computed based on the RSS data of a commercial 1800 MHz base station located along Lagos-Badagry highway in Nigeria. The training speed, learning effectiveness, and the generalization ability of Artificial Neural Network Back-Propagation (ANN-BP) and ELM algorithms are analysed. Experimental results show that ELM models are 140 times faster to train than the ANN-BP models.

The main steps of SAR-to-optical image translation were as follows. First, the large SAR image was split to small patches. Then S-CycleGAN was used to translate the SAR patches to optical image patches. Finally, the optical image patches were stitched to generate the large optical image. A paired SAR-optical image dataset which covered 32 Chinese cities was published to evaluate the proposed method. The dataset was generated from Sentinel-1 (SEN-1) SAR images and Sentinel-2 (SEN-2) multi-spectral images. S-CycleGAN was applied to two experiments, which were SAR-to-optical image translation and cloud removal, and the results showed that S-CycleGAN could keep both the land cover and structure information well, and its performance was superior to some famous image-to-image translation models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2939649", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2971888276", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["128279998", "38814373", "11827645", "129610510", "62072358", "28270152", "20500950", "5048265", "118140010", "1733882", "18503788", "18558267", "1658773", "21476699", "52113814", "29626919", "56507745", "12803511", "6200260", "1563370", "206770979", "1082740", "3311284", "49904803", "3591883", "49573933", "53225242", "86494412", "53230513", "52264125", "49573266", "2202933", "53992027", "7935037", "129735301", "12795674", "28659025", "53226932", "70029316", "102496818", "980236", "207761262", "10649298", "27221196", "128579471", "25622458", "21867498", "18556235", "32109148", "35880014", "126272324", "111236879", "52086692"], "inbound_citations": ["211243300"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202700277"}

We explored the potential of Landsat data to derive seasonal phenological profiles for the main Cerrado physiognomies, in order to use this information for classification purposes. Therefore we gathered Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI data from the open Landsat data archive. To overcome data gaps in the time series, we applied a Gaussian kernel based convolution filter on Tasseled Cap transformed Landsat data. Thus, it was possible to derive comprehensible phenological profiles for distinct Cerrado physiognomies at Landsat spatial resolution. We used these derived seasonal profiles to train a Support Vector Machine classification model in order to map the main Cerrado physiognomies around Brasilia, DF.

However, since they use fixed-sized time windows, these models cannot capture long-term dependencies that are often present in stream flow time series.

We compared their accuracy with that of the SVR and VAR methods on the task of one day ahead prediction of the stream flow. In our experiments, the CW-RNNs outperformed the SVR and VAR methods across both datasets. In particular, when evaluated on the largest test set, which contained approximately 4 years of daily records, the normalised Root Mean Squared Error (nRMSE) and the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of the best CW-RNN architecture were equal to 0.166 and 0.956, respectively.

Until now, no or little attention was paid to site-specific developments such as abandonment of arable land in irrigation agriculture and abandonment of land that was reclaimed in arid and semi-arid regions. Analysis of time series from Landsat earth observation data are recognised as highly suitable to establish retrospective and current land use changes. We combined multi-annual Landsat data and Random Forest machine learning to classify arable land and to discriminate between used and unused fields for the observation period between 2000 and 2016. The fields classified as 'unused' were then subdivided according to their intensity of intra-annual NDVI signal that was used as further proxy to get information on the time at which the field became abandoned. A pixel-based classification was preferred instead an object-based classification to minimise prediction errors on field level. Furthermore, intensity information was used for validating retrospective data for years without field survey information. Overall, the classification of unused land was challenged by the complexity of the crop rotations, long fallow cycles, and the data scarcity.

The proposed methodology is multi-attribute towards considering several markers simultaneously to explain the phenotype and is based jointly on statistical tools, machine learning and computational intelligence.ResultsThe suggested method has shown potential in the simulated database 1, with additive effects only, and real database. In this simulated database, with a total of 1,000 markers, and 7 with major effect on the phenotype and the other 993 SNPs representing the noise, the method identified 21 markers. Of this total, 5 are relevant SNPs between the 7 but 16 are false positives. In real database, initially with 50,752 SNPs, we have reduced to 3,073 markers, increasing the accuracy of the model. In the simulated database 2, with additive effects and interactions (epistasis), the proposed method matched to the methodology most commonly used in GWAS.ConclusionsThe method suggested in this paper demonstrates the effectiveness in explaining the real phenotype (PTA for milk), because with the application of the wrapper based on genetic algorithm and Support Vector Regression with Pearson Universal, many redundant markers were eliminated, increasing the prediction and accuracy of the model on the real database without quality control filters.

Most previous brain imaging studies in ASD, however, are based on children older than 6 years \u2013 well after the average age of ASD diagnosis (~46 months). In this study, we use brain magnetic resonance images that were collected as part of clinical routine from patients who were later diagnosed with ASD. Using 15 ASD subjects of age three to four years and 18 age-matched non-ASD subjects as controls, we perform comprehensive comparison of different brain morphometric features and ASD vs. non-ASD classification by Random Forest machine learning method. We find that, although total intracranial volume (TIV) of ASD was 5.5 % larger than in non-ASD, brain volumes of many other brain areas (as a percentage of TIV) were smaller in ASD and can be partly attributed to larger (>10 %) ventricles in ASD. The larger TIV in ASD was correlated to larger surface area and increased amount of cortical folding but not to cortical thickness. The white matter regions in ASD had less image intensity (predominantly in the frontal and temporal regions) suggesting myelination deficit. We achieved 95 % area under the ROC curve (AUC) for ASD vs. non-ASD classification using all brain features. When classification was performed separately for each feature type, image intensity yielded the highest predictive power (95 % AUC), followed by cortical folding index (69 %), cortical and subcortical volume (69 %), and surface area (68 %). The most important feature for classification was white matter intensity surrounding the rostral middle frontal gyrus and was lower in ASD (d = 0.77, p = 0.04). The high degree of classification success indicates that the application of machine learning methods on brain features holds promise for earlier identification of ASD.

Traditional automated image processing methods learn to map images to an existing food database with known caloric composition.

In this paper, we show that hyperspectral imaging provides useful information and promise in distinguishing caloric composition within the same food type. We collect data using a hyperspectral camera from Nigerian foods cooked with varying degrees of fat content, and capture images under different intensities of light. We apply Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality, and train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using a Radial Basis Function kernel and show that applying this technique on hyperspectral images can more readily distinguish calorie composition. Furthermore, compared with methods that only use true-color based features, our method shows that a classifier trained using features from hyperspectral images is significantly more predictive of within-food caloric content, and by fusing results from two classifiers trained separately using hyperspectral and RGB imagery we obtain the greatest predictive power.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-70742-6_45", "venue": "ICIAP Workshops", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2779096050", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9425773"}

First, we will describe a Cyclic GAN based one-to-one conversion method that can generate speech from given speaker to a target voice bi-directionally. Cyclic GANs have much more strong mapping capabilities than ordinary GANs due to the property of Cyclic consistency loss. This framework ensures that given sufficient training data, generated output is very similar to the input. Furthermore, adversarial examples generated by the model are used for spoofed voice detection. We will use a Gradient Boosting method to learn to distinguish the voice utterances of various speakers that are stored in a database from the adversarial examples. For the testing of English language, we used the VCTK dataset and for the Urdu language, we used Urdu speech recordings containing a single word utterance from each speaker.

CR-F tells not only the scopes of the factors, but also the exact probability functions of these factors; (3) CR connects probability factorization and graph operations perfectly. The factorization process of CR-F can be visualized as applying a sequence of graph operations including partition, merge, duplicate and condition to a PGM graph. We further obtain an important result: by CR-F, on TCG graphs the scopes of factors can be exactly over maximal cliques without any default configuration. This improves the results of (R)MRF-F which need default configurations, and also indicates that (R)MRF-F, as special cases of CR-F, can not always achieve the optimal results of CR-F.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": "1008.1566", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2964316279,1502716318", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3192067", "18147432", "121157007", "60578841", "14995779", "277918", "13723620"], "inbound_citations": ["8211418", "5974948", "5974948"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10790700"}

The project focused on the transition between organisms with innate behaviors and organisms that have the most rudimentary capability of learning through their personal interaction with their environment. It was assumed that the innate behaviors gave basic survival competence but no learning ability. By observing the interaction between their innate behaviors and the organism's environment it was reasoned that the organism should be able to learn how to modify its actions in a way that improves its performance. If a learning system is given more information than it requires then, when it is successful, it is difficult to say which pieces of information contribute to the success. For this reason the information available to the learning system was kept to an absolute minimum. In order to provide a practical test of the learning scheme developed in this project, the robot environment EDEN was constructed. Within EDEN a robot's actions influence its internal \u2018energy\u2019 reserves. The environment incorporates sources of energy, and it also involves situations that use additional energy or reduce energy consumption. A successful learning scheme was developed purely based on the recorded history of the robot's interactions with its environment and the knowledge that the robot's innate behavior was reactive.

In this work, we integrate different machine learning approaches, including tree based methods, random forest and gradient boosted tree classifiers along with deep convolutional neural networks for prediction of cancer driver mutations in the genomic datasets. The feasibility of convolutional neural networks in using raw nucleotide sequences for classification of cancer driver mutations was initially explored by employing label encoding, one hot encoding, and embedding to preprocess the DNA information. These classifiers were benchmarked against their tree-based alternatives in order to evaluate the performance on a relative scale. We then integrated DNA-based scores generated by convolutional neural networks with various categories of conservational, evolutionary and functional features into a generalized random forest classifier. The results of this study have demonstrated that convolutional neural networks can learn high level features from genomic information that are complementary to the ensemble-based predictors often employed for classification of cancer mutations. By combining deep learning-generated score with only two main ensemble-based functional features, we can achieve a superior performance of various machine learning classifiers. Our findings have also suggested that synergy of nucleotide-based deep learning scores and integrated metrics derived from protein sequence conservation scores can allow for robust classification of cancer driver mutations with a limited number of highly informative features.

It is an equally important component of Skinner's functional explanation of the origin and extinction of behavior. Darwin's functional explanation was marginalized within biology on the basis that it was an incomplete explanation because it lacked any plausible proximal causal mechanism for how variation was instantiated and for how natural selection could operate on this variation. Population genetics completed Darwin's evolutionary explanation by providing the required proximal causal mechanism information. Skinner's functional explanation of behavior has been marginalized within psychology for the same general reason that Darwin's theory was marginalized within biology. No proximal causal mechanisms are available to explain behavioral variation and how contingent consequences can selectively reinforce or strengthen target behaviors. Arguments that the experimental analysis of behavior can proceed without this information are correct in the same way that Darwin could continue his research in the absence of population genetics. However, history demonstrates that marginalization will remain until proximal causal information is provided. Parallel Distributed Processing Connectionist Neural Networks provide the requisite proximal causal explanations. This article demonstrates how this explanatory approach is fully compatible with the experimental analysis of behavior. Expansion of the explanatory basis of behavior analysis could potentially promote it within psychology to the same degree that population genetics promoted evolution within biology. ********** This article notes that applied behavior analysis and its selectionist orientation have been marginalized but that selectionism is gaining acceptance at an exponential rate in the form of Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) connectionism (10) which is theoretically consistent with radical behaviorism because it is a superset of radical behaviorism. It therefore follows that applied behavior analysis may be able to expand its appeal by extending its explanatory base to include the new selectionist explanations used by PDP connectionism. The first section of this article summarizes the selectionist approach that underlies the experimental analysis of behavior and its behavior therapeutic applications. This is done to emphasize the importance and value of this explanatory approach and to demonstrate my commitment to this perspective so that there can be no doubt as to my sincerity in this matter. Another reason for beginning with this section is that PDP connectionism supports selectionism. The second section of this article notes that explanation based on selection outside of PDP connectionism has become severely marginalized within psychology. A future consequence of this trend, if left unchecked, is that fewer and fewer proponents of applied behavior analysis will have less and less impact on science, clinical practice, and education. Representation and influence in professional societies will continue to wane. It is time to act in new more effective ways before extinction fully occurs. The third portion of this article proposes a \"recovery plan\" based on PDP connectionism. The main reasons are: 1) this form of connectionism fully embraces selectionist explanation, 2) it constitutes a superset of behaviorism that is compatible with mainstream psychology, and 3) its growth is exponential. Empirical support for these three claims is provided by the work of John Donahoe, a \"card-carrying\" behaviorist. SELECTION OF BEHAVIOR The word operant means to operate on the physical and/or social environment. Operants refer to theoretical distributions that describe slight variations in how the same behavior recurs in the same situation. We shall refer to them as response variations to highlight explanation by selection. \u2026", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1037/h0099963", "venue": null, "journal": "The behavior analyst today", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2093256734", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["29555751", "151672483", "143612218", "145663540", "59906702", "30115856", "16936132", "143637046", "118065731", "197658174", "9708483", "62285311", "27281697", "142574297", "60496409", "143077358", "142789930", "37613188", "2255644", "148145227", "143869691", "144504991", "58198341", "142206443", "481884", "142692289", "143644299", "42435398"], "inbound_citations": ["3189264"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:145345397"}

Therefore, these differences can be used as the chemical markers for EO classification and determination of their quality. Herein, the Random Forests (RF) machine learning algorithm was applied to the classification of 20 different EOs. From three-way raw gas chromatography - mass spectra data, total chromatogram average mass spectra (TCAMS) and segment average mass spectra (SAMS) were created. TCAMS was generated by averaging response of each m/z over the whole chromatogram and SAMS by averaging the response of each fragment across a certain time segment within the chromatogram. The RF model was applied to the two data sets and optimised through the evaluation of preprocessed data, number of trees, and number of variables used in each node split. The performance of the model was evaluated through a cross-validation process, repeated 50 times by dividing the whole sample set into training and validation subsets. The calculated average out-of-bag error (OOBE), over 50 different training TCAMS data sets was 3.22 \u00b1 1.29%, while for SAMS it was found to be 2.28 \u00b1 1.33%. The minimal number of variables necessary for EO classification was determined by a nested cross-validation process. The amount of reduced variables in each step was 10%. It was shown that the TCAMS data set with 6 variables had similar prediction power as the SAMS with 30 variables. OOBE for classification of 20 EOs was 2.89 \u00b1 1.44% and 3.70 \u00b1 1.73%, for TCAMS and SAMS, respectively. Proximity between samples was used to evaluate their qualities. Samples with greater intra-class proximity had good similarity, while the lower ones indicated greater variations in the chemical profiles.

As a result, ADs has become one of the most active genetic and epidemiologic research areas, however, unraveling the etiological mechanisms of ADs has proven difficult. There is strong evidence suggesting a complex genetic component contributing to all ADs. For most ADs, the prominent genetic risk locus is within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21.3. Unfortunately, identifying non-MHC susceptibility loci has proven difficult in these complex ADs with multigenic patterns of inheritance. Recently, through concerted international efforts, several genome-wide association (GWA) studies and subsequent replication analyses have confirmed several other AD susceptibility loci of modest effects; much of the remaining genetic variants contributing to AD susceptibility are unknown. It is clear that current approaches will be limited to identify all the complex genetic component ADs, therefore this dissertation focuses using strong epidemiological approaches and robust analytical frameworks to identify additional non-MHC genetic risk factors in two complex ADs: multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).In Chapter 1, the relationship between variation in DNA repair pathways genes and risk for MS was investigated. Univariate association testing, epistatic tests of interactions, logistic regression modeling and non-parametric Random Forests analyses were performed using genotypes from 1,343 MS cases and 1,379 healthy controls of European ancestry. A total of 485 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 72 genes related to DNA repair pathways, including base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and double strand breaks repair, were investigated. A SNP variant within GTF2H4 on 6p21.33 was significantly associated with MS (odds ratio=0.7, p=3.5 x 10-5) after accounting for multiple testing, and was not due to linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DRB1*1501. Despite clear evidence for an association between GTF2H4and MS, collectively, these results, derived from a well-powered study, do not support a strong role for variation within DNA repair pathway genes in MS.In Chapter 2, the relationship between variation within 8 candidate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis genes and susceptibility to MS were comprehensively investigated. A total of 326 SNPs were investigated in 1,343 MS cases and 1,379 healthy controls of European ancestry using a multi-analytical strategy. Random Forests identified 8 SNPs within the corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 or CRHR1 locus on 17q21.31 as important predictors of MS. Based on univariate analyses: five CRHR1 variants were associated with decreased risk for disease following a conservative correction for multiple tests. Independent replication was observed in a large meta-analysis comprised of 2,624 MS cases and 7,220 healthy controls of European ancestry. The results provide strong evidence for the involvement of CRHR1 (rs242936: p=9.7 x 10-5) in MS.In Chapter 3, epistatic interactions with a well-established genetic factor (PTPN22 1858T) in a RA was investigated. The analysis consisted of four principal stages: Stage I (data reduction) - identifying candidate chromosomal regions in 292 affected sibling pairs, by predicting PTPN22 concordance using multipoint identity-by-descent probabilities and Random Forests; Stage II (extension analysis) - testing detailed genetic data within candidate chromosomal regions for epistasis with PTPN22 1858T in 677 cases and 750 controls using logistic regression; Stage III (replication analysis) - confirmation of epistatic interactions in 947 cases and 1,756 controls; Stage IV (combined analysis) - a pooled analysis including all 1,624 RA cases and 2,506 control subjects for final estimates of effect size. A total of 7 replicating epistatic interactions were identified. A SNP variant (rs7200573) within CDH13 demonstrated significant evidence for interaction (p=1.5 x 10-4) with PTPN22. There was also evidence for epistasis between PTPN22 and SNP variants within MYO3A, CEP72 and near WFDC1.The research conducted in Chapters 1 through 3 describe analytical approaches that were based on strong hypotheses, multi-stage analyses, and the use of robust non-parametric methods in tandem with conventional association testing. These chapters are scientifically important, as they contribute to our understanding of the underlying genetic architecture in two debilitating ADs (MS and RA) and provide strong methodological frameworks for investigating other chronic diseases with a complex genetic component.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "262265319", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55138914"}

Current study uses climatic conditions, grapevine yield, phenological dates, fertilizer information, soil analysis and maturation index data to construct the relational dataset.

Having a better understanding of what is a good salsa dancer from motion analysis perspective would bring interesting knowledge and can complement better learning. In this paper, we propose a set of music and interaction based motion features to classify salsa dancer couple performance in three learning states (beginner, intermediate and expert). These motion features are an interpretation of components given via interviews from teacher and professionals and other dance features found in systematic review of papers. For the presented study, a motion capture database (SALSA) has been recorded of 26 different couples with three skill levels dancing on 10 different tempos (260 clips). Each recorded clips con tains a basic steps sequence and an extended improvisation sequence during two minutes in total at 120 frame per second. Each of the 27 motion features have been computed on a sliding window that corresponds to the 8 beats reference for dance. Different multiclass classifier has been tested, mainly k-nearest neighbours, Random forest and Support Vector Machine, with an accuracy result of classification up to 81% for three levels and 92% for two levels. A later feature analysis validates 23 out of 27 proposed features.

M.S., Purdue University, May 2013. Enhanced diagnostic accuracy of mammograms on a mobile device. Major Professor: Rajeswari Sundararajan. With the death of a woman every 13 minutes in the US, and one every minute worldwide, due to breast cancer, the need for early detection cannot be overstated. Mammography is a boon for both early detection and screening of breast tumors. It is an imaging system that uses low dose (9mrem) x-rays for examining the breasts, by the electrons reflected from the tissues (thermoelectric effect). However, there are 20% false positives and 10% false negatives in current practice. Hence, there is a critical need for enhancing the accuracy of these mammograms. Towards this, this thesis was aimed at enhancing the current diagnostic accuracy of digital mammograms using the industry standard simulation software tool, MATLAB. For this purpose, the publicly available dataset MIAS was used. Image processing techniques, such as wavelet, statistical and feature analysis and pattern recognition algorithms, such as Bayes\u2019, Naive Bayes\u2019, knearest neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were utilized to enhance the diagnostic accuracy. The results indicated up to 95% accuracy, compared to 70% at present. The proposed solution has proven to be an effective way of detecting breast cancer early in different types of breast tissues. The entire solution is implemented as a smartphone application to serve as a second opinion for clinical use.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1516451955", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109106630"}

Immunotoxicity assessment is time consuming in humans or requires a high number of animals, making it expensive. Furthermore, reducing the use of animals in research is an important ethical and political issue. Immunotoxicogenomics represents a novel approach to investigate immunotoxicity able of overcoming these limitations. The current research, embedded in the European Union project NewGeneris, aimed to retrieve gene expression profiles that are indicative of exposure to immunotoxicants. To this end, whole-genome gene expression was investigated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to in vitro exposure to a range of immunotoxic chemicals (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, aflatoxin B1, benzo[a]pyrene, deoxynivalenol, ethanol, malondialdehyde, polychlorinated biphenyl 153, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) and nonimmunotoxic chemicals (acrylamide, dimethylnitrosamine, 2-amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-F]quinoline, and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine). Using Agilent oligonucleotide microarrays, whole-genome gene expression profiles were generated, which were analyzed using Genedata's Expressionist software. Using Recursive Feature Elimination and Support Vector Machine, a set of 48 genes was identified that distinguishes the immunotoxic from the nonimmunotoxic compounds. Analysis for enrichment of biological processes showed the gene set to be highly biologically and immunologically relevant.

The Euclidean distance is usually employed, but it may be more efficient to learn a parametric distance such as Mahalanobis metric. Learning such a metric is a hot topic since more than ten years now, and a number of methods have been proposed to efficiently learn it. However, the nature of the problem makes it quite difficult for large scale data, as well as data for which classes overlap. This paper presents a simple way of improving accuracy and scalability of any iterative metric learning algorithm, where constraints are obtained prior to the algorithm. The proposed approach relies on a loss-dependent weighted selection of constraints that are used for learning the metric. Using the corresponding dedicated loss function, the method clearly allows to obtain better results than state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of accuracy and time complexity.

A framework of short-term passenger flow based on the Empirical Mode Decomposition-Support Vector Regression (EMD-SVR) was proposed to predict passenger flow for different types of stations. Also, the relationship between the generation of passenger flow prediction error and passenger flow data was investigated. First, the metro network was classified into four categories by using eight clustering factors based on the characteristics of inbound passenger flow. Second, Pearson correlation coefficient was utilized to explore the time interval and time granularity for short-term passenger flow prediction. Third, the EMD-SVR was used to predict the passenger flow in the optimal time interval for each station. Results showed that the proposed approach has a significant improvement compared to the traditional passenger flow forecast approach. Lookback Volatility (LVB) was applied to reflect the fluctuation difference of passenger flow data, and the linear fitting of prediction error was conducted.

Methods: We used recently developed spline climatic models and modifi ed Random Forests statistical procedures to predict suitable habitats of three rare, endangered spruces of Mexico and a spruce of the southwestern USA. We used three general circulation models and two sets of carbon emission scenarios (optimistic and pessimistic) for future climates. Key results: Our procedures predicted present occurrence perfectly. For the decades 2030, 2060, and 2090, the ranges of all taxa progressively decreased, to the point of transient disappearance for one species in the decade 2060 but reappearance in 2090. Contrary to intuition, habitat did not develop to the north for any of the Mexican taxa; rather, climate niches for two taxa re-materialized several hundred kilometers southward in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The climate niche for a third Mexican taxon shrank drastically, and its two mitotypes responded differently, one of the first demonstrations of the importance of intraspecific genetic variation in climate niches. The climate niche of the U.S. species shrank northward and upward in elevation. Conclusion: The results are important for conservation of these species and are of general signifi cance for conservation by assisted colonization.

Over the last few decades, classification applied to numerous applications in science, engineering, business and industries have rapidly been increased, especially for big data. However, classifiers dealing with complicated high dimension problems with non-conforming patterns with high accuracy are rare, especially for bit-level features. It is a challenging research problem. This paper proposed a novel efficient classifier based on cellular automata model, called Cellular Automata-based Classifier (CAC). CAC possesses the promising capability to deal with non-conforming patterns in the bit-level features. It was developed on a new kind of the proposed elementary cellular automata, called Decision Support Elementary Cellular Automata (DS-ECA). The classification capability of DS-ECA is promising since it can describe very complicated decision rule in high dimension problems with less complexity. CAC comprises double rule vectors and a decision function, the structure of which has two layers; the first layer is employed to evolve an input pattern into feature space and the other interprets the patterns in feature space as binary answer through the decision function. It has a time complexity of learning at O(n2), while the classification for one instance is O(1), where n is a number of bit patterns. For classification performance, 12 datasets consisting of binary and non-binary features are empirically implemented in comparison with Support Vector Machines (SVM) using k-fold cross validation. In this respect, CAC outperforms SVM with the best kernel for binary features, and provides the promising results equivalent to SVM on average for non-binary features.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2015.12.003", "venue": "Expert Syst.

One of the most employed strategies is one-versus-one (OVO), in which there is one binary classifier for each pair of the classes of the original problem. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be used to combine the outputs of the OVO classifiers in a multiclass prediction. Although the use of these graphs presents some advantages, like reducing the number of classifiers consulted at each prediction, the number of possible graph structures for a given problem is factorial on its number of classes. This paper presents some data-driven strategies designed to find DAG structures suited for each multiclass classification problem. They are guided by the values of some data complexity measures, which evaluate the difficulty of the binary sub-problems. The idea is to place simpler binary sub-problems at the top of the DAG hierarchies. Experimentally, a small variation between the predictive results of distinct DAG structures was found, even for problems with a large number of classes. For this reason, simple greedy algorithms are in several cases able to obtain suitable DAG structures when compared to a more sophisticated genetic algorithm search strategy.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2018.01.013", "venue": "Appl.

Experiments on seven standard datasets show that parameters selected by proposed method can result in similar test error rate as that obtained by conventional GS method, while the computation cost can be reduced at most from o( n m ) to o(n), where m is the number of parameters, n is the number of levels of each parameter.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-28647-9_86", "venue": "ISNN", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1505010040", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["14078557"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:42471647"}

Additionally, while automated reconstruction of 3D building models is an active research area, the labelling of architectural features (objects) is comparatively less well researched, while distinguishing between different architectural styles is less well researched still. Meanwhile, the successful automatic identification of architectural objects, typified by a comparatively less symmetrical or less regular distribution of objects on facades, particularly on older buildings, has so far eluded researchers. ::: This research has addressed these issues by automating the semantic and geometric enrichment of existing 3D building models by using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)-based template matching. The methods are applied to the texture maps of 3D building models of 20th century styles, of Georgian-Regency (1715-1830) style and of the Norman (1066 to late 12th century) style, where the amalgam of styles present on buildings of the latter style necessitates detection of styles of the Gothic tradition (late 12th century to present day). ::: The most successful results were obtained when applying a set of heuristics including the use of real world dimensions, while a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based machine learning approach was found effective in obviating the need for thresholds on matchscores when making detection decisions.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2804905970", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67724345"}

We present a simulation that establishes the computational viability of these postulated neurobiological mechanisms for subserving control functions. The need for a control mechanism in cognition has been long noted within psychology. Virtually all theorists agree that some mechanism is needed to guide, coordinate, and update behavior in a flexible fashionparticularly in novel or complex tasks (Norman and Shallice 1986). In particular, control over processing requires that information related both to current context and to behavioral goals be actively represented, such that these representations can bias behavior in favor of goal-directed activities over extended periods. Indeed, most computationally explicit theories of human behavior have included such a mechanism as a fundamental component. For example, in production system models, goal states represented in declarative memory are used to coordinate the' sequence of production firings involved in complex behaviors (e.g., Anderson 1983); One critical feature of goal representations in production systems is that they must be actively represented and maintained throughout the course of a sequence of behaviors. Such formulations of a control (or \"executive\") mechanism closely parallel theorizmg about the nature of frontal lobe function (Bianchi 1922; Darnasio 1985; Luria 19691, and clinical observations of patients with frontal lesions who often exhibit impairments in tasks requiring control over behavior-the so-called dysexecutive syndrome. Shallice (Nonnan and Shallice 1986; Shallice, 1982,1988) explicitly noted this relationship, using the production system framework to describe his theory of a \"supervisory attentional system\" (SAS) as a mechanism by wmcn the frontal lobes coordinate complex cognitive processes and select nonroutine actions. While these efforts have provided insights into the types of processes that may be engaged by cognitive control, they d6 not map transparently onto underlyingneural mechanisms. They have also not fully addressed several critical issues, such as how a control system can develop through learning. A number of recently proposed connectionist models of prefrontal function incorporate some of the central features of control processes in production system models, such as the active maintenance of goal representations (Dehaene and Changeux 1992; Guigon et al. 1991; Levine and Prueitt 1989). Connectionist models have the advantage of both being mechanistically explicit and using a computational architecture that maps more naturally onto neural mechanisms than traditional production system models. In this chapter, we report on work that uses this framework to address a critical question about cognitive control: How can a system learn to choose and appropriately update representations in active memory that can be used to control behavior? This is an extension of our ongoing effort to specify the neural underpinnings of cognitive control (Braver et al. 1995a; Cohen, Braver, and WReilly 1996; Cohen and Servan-Schreiber 1992), reviewed briefly below as background. A central hypothesis in our work is that a cardinal function of prefrontal cortex (PFC) is to actively maintain context information. We use the general term context to include not.only goal representations, which have their influence on planning and overt behavior, but also representations that may have their effect earlier in the processing stream, on interpretive or attentional processes. We assume that a primary function of PFC is tomaintain task-relevant context represmtations in an active state. These active context representations .serve to mediate control by modulating the flow of information within task-specific pathways such that processing in the task-relevant pathway is favored, over a (possibly stronger) competing pathway. This function of PFC can also be thought of as a component of working memory 0, commonly defined as the collection of mechanisms respowible for the on-line maintenance and manipulation of information necessary to perform a cognitive task (Baddeley and Hitch 1994). From this perspective, context can be viewed as the subset of representations within WM that govern how other representations are used. As noted above, there is long-standing recognition that control involves representation and maintenance of context information (e.g., goals). However, a more complete account of cognitive control has additional requirements. Here we focus on four. Context information must be (1) appropriately selected for maintenance; (2) held for, arbitrary lengths of time; (3) protected against interference; and (4) updated at appropriate junctures. Inasmuch as we assume that context infopt ion is represented in PEC, our interest is in the mechanisms that regulate the selection and updating of representations in PFC.

In this letter, we characterize the effect of the number of trees (ntree) and class separability on the stability of variable importance rankings and develop a systematic approach to define the number of model runs and/or trees required to achieve stability in variable importance measures. Results demonstrate that both a large ntree for a single model run, or averaged values across multiple model runs with fewer trees, are sufficient for achieving stable mean importance values. While the latter is far more computationally efficient, both the methods tend to lead to the same ranking of variables. Moreover, the optimal number of model runs differs depending on the separability of classes.
