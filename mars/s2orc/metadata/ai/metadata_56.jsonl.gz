Parallelism should be used not only for simultaneous processing of several sub-parts of the output but even within single parts. If both types of parallelism are used with incremental generation it becomes unnecessary to build up and manipulate representations of sentence structure the syntactic form of the output can be emergent. FIG is a structured connectionist generator built in this way. Constructions and their constituents are represented in the same network which encodes world knowledge and lexical Knowledge. Grammatical output results from synergy among many constructions simultaneously active at ran-time. FIG incorporates new ways of handling constituency, word order and optional constituents; and simple ways to avoid the problems of instantiation and binding.

In this paper, we present an integrated strategy to comprehensively evaluate the feature relevance of point cloud and image data for classification of trees and vehicles in urban scenes. First of all, point cloud and image data are co-registered by backprojection with available orientation parameters if necessary. After that, all data points are grid-fitted into the raster format in order to facilitate acquiring spatial context information per pixel/point. Then, various spatial-statistical and radiometric features can be extracted using a cylindrical volume neighborhood. Classification results as labeled pixels can be acquired from the classifier, and after appropriate refinements we obtain the objects of trees and vehicles. Compared to other methods which have assessed the classification and relevance simultaneously using a single classifier, we first introduce AdaBoost classifier combined with contribution ratio to provide both classification results and measures of feature relevance, and then utilize Random Forest classifier to evaluate and compare the feature relevance from a more independent viewpoint. In order to confirm the accuracy and reliability of classification and feature relevance results, we consider not only characteristics of the classifiers itself, but also errors of data co-registration and alterable parameters. We apply the procedure to two different datasets. In the dataset requiring co-registration a-priori, the AdaBoost classifier even achieves a great accuracy of 96.99% for trees and 83.45% for vehicles. The quantitative results of feature relevance assessment highlight the most important features for classification of tree covers and vehicles, such as NDVI, LiDAR intensity, planarity and entropy. By comparative analysis of the two independent approaches, the reliable and consistent feature selection for classification of trees and vehicles from LiDAR and image data could be validated and achieved, being unrelated to the classifiers.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprsannals-I-7-323-2012", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2022105078", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5956609", "9621074", "18899962", "55600026", "379259", "31039418", "14503018", "7291029", "11640979", "11728626", "16041810", "17414802", "18325626", "120219023", "6201404"], "inbound_citations": ["55768218", "15128964", "31237173", "126099318", "62786847", "27355556", "6688863", "36433081", "3694086", "20164495", "16882975", "5352721", "124929241", "174801021"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55928117"}

There is substantial evidence that lifestyle modifications and drug intervention can prevent diabetes, therefore, an early identification of high risk individuals is important to design targeted prevention strategies.

Data generated from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was used to develop a predictive model based on the support vector machine (SVM). We trained and validated the models using the OGTT and demographic data of 1,492 healthy individuals collected during the San Antonio Heart Study. This study collected plasma glucose and insulin concentrations before glucose intake and at three time-points thereafter (30, 60 and 120 min). Furthermore, personal information such as age, ethnicity and body-mass index was also a part of the dataset. Using 11 oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measurements, we have deduced 61 features, which are then assigned a rank and the top ten features are shortlisted using Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance feature selection algorithm. All possible combinations of the 10 best ranked features were used to generate SVM based prediction models.

The classifiers predominantly reported in clothing perception (e.g. SVM, Random Forest) studies do not provide true classification probabilities, due to their inherent structure. In contrast, probabilistic classifiers (of which the Gaussian Process is a popular example) are able to provide predictive probabilities. In our approach, we employ a multi-class Gaussian Process classification using the Laplace approximation for posterior inference and optimising hyper-parameters via marginal likelihood maximisation.

First, a technique was examined to detect wet surfaces at nighttime. From the literature reviews, it was revealed that image processing using polarization is one of the preferred options. However, it is hard to use the polarization characteristics of road surface images at nighttime because of irregular or no light situations. In this study, we proposes a new discriminant for detecting wet and dry road surfaces using CCTV image data at night. To detect the road surface conditions with night vision, we applied the wavelet packet transform for analyzing road surface textures. Additionally, to apply the luminance feature of night CCTV images, we set the intensity histogram based on HSI(Hue Saturation Intensity) color model. With a set of 200 images taken from the field, we constructed a detection criteria hyperplane with SVM (Support Vector Machine).

Methods First, a Support Vector Regression-based age prediction model was trained and cross-validated on the neurocognitive data of 36 healthy controls (HC).

The non-invasive prosthetic hand works with several electrodes, placed on the stump of an amputee, that record this signal. In order to favour the control of prosthesis, the EMG signal is analyzed with algorithms based on machine learning theory to decide the movement that the subject is going to do. In order to obtain a significant control of the prosthesis and avoid mismatch between desired and performed movements, a long training period is needed when we use the traditional algorithm of machine learning (i.e. Support Vector Machines). An actual challenge in this field concerns the reduction of the time necessary for an amputee to learn how to use the prosthesis. Recently, several algorithms that exploit a form of prior knowledge have been proposed. In general, we refer to prior knowledge as a past experience available in the form of models. In our case an amputee, that attempts to perform some movements with the prosthesis, could use experience from different subjects that are already able to perform those movements. The aim of this work is to verify, with a computational investigation, if for an amputee this kind of previous experience is useful in order to reduce the training time and boost the prosthetic control. Furthermore, we want to understand if and how the final results change when the previous knowledge of intact or amputated subjects is used for a new amputee. Our experiments indicate that: (1) the use of experience, from other subjects already trained to perform a task, makes us able to reduce the training time of about an order of magnitude; (2) it seems that an amputee that tries to learn to use the prosthesis doesn't reach different results when he/she exploits previous experience of amputees or intact.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1605.07498", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "mag_id": "2394844317", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8062221"}

However, its application in discriminative hash codes learning remains challenging as it fails to efficiently capture preferable components from multiple representations. In this work, we propose a novel discriminative multi-view hashing framework, dubbed flexible discrete multi-view hashing, in conjunction with collective latent feature learning by combining multiple views of data and consistent hash codes learning by fusing visual features and flexible semantics. Specifically, an adaptive multi-view analysis dictionary learning model is developed to skillfully combine diverse representations into an established common latent feature space where the complementary properties of different views are well explored based on an automatic multi-view weighting strategy. Moreover, we introduce a collaborative learning scheme to jointly encode the visual and semantic embeddings into an aligned consistent Hamming space, which can effectively mitigate the visual-semantic gap.

Most approaches have trained computational models by using either full protein sequences or multiple sequence alignments (MSA), including all positions.

We introduce a novel logical representation that allows us to represent physico-chemical properties of sequences, conserved amino acid positions and conserved physico-chemical positions in the MSA. From this, Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) finds the most frequent patterns (motifs) and uses them to train propositional models, such as decision trees and support vector machines (SVM).ResultsWe use the SCOP database to perform our experiments by evaluating protein recognition within the same superfamily. Our results show that our methodology when using SVM performs significantly better than some of the state of the art methods, and comparable to other.

The use of herbicides is currently the most common approach to weed control. However, herbicide resistant plants have long been recognised as a major concern due to the excessive use of herbicides. Effective weed detection techniques can reduce the cost of weed management and improve crop quality and yield. A computationally efficient and robust plant classification algorithm is developed and applied to the classification of three crops: Brassica napus (canola), Zea mays (maize/corn), and radish. The developed algorithm is based on the combination of Local Binary Pattern (LBP) operators, for the extraction of crop leaf textural features and Support vector machine (SVM) method, for multiclass plant classification. This paper presents the first investigation of the accuracy of the combined LBP algorithms, trained using a large dataset of canola, radish and barley leaf images captured by a testing facility under simulated field conditions. The dataset has four subclasses, background, canola, corn, and radish, with 24,000 images used for training and 6000 images, for validation. The dataset is referred herein as \u201cbccr-segset\u201d and published online. In each subclass, plant images are collected at four crop growth stages.

A large amount of documents that contain critical information as payment slips, invoices or contracts, are constantly subject to fraudster manipulation because of the lack of security regarding this kind of document. Previously, a system to detect fraudulent documents based on its intrinsic features has been presented. It was especially designed to retrieve copy-move forgery and imperfection due to fraudster manipulation. However, when a set of characters is not present in the original document, copy-move forgery is not feasible. Hence, the fraudster will use a text toolbox to add or modify information in the document by imitating the font or he will cut and paste characters from another document where the font properties are similar. This often results in font type errors. Thus, a clue to detect document forgery consists of finding characters, words or sentences in a document with font properties different from their surroundings. To this end, we present in this paper an automatic forgery detection method based on document font features. Using the Conditional Random Field a measurement of probability that a character belongs to a specific font is made by comparing the character font features to a knowledge database. Then, the character is classified as a genuine or a fake one by comparing its probability to belong to a certain font type with those of the neighboring characters.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDAR.2015.7333827", "venue": "2015 13th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR)", "journal": "2015 13th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2098204428", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15646894", "71455702", "10014767", "12574248", "7729633", "342976"], "inbound_citations": ["208121473", "46782582", "211058304", "53016731", "54436193", "211553521", "6032876", "204800758", "155718366", "4764880"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22313406"}

We hypothesized that metastatic progression is driven by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) resulting in differences in tumor-shed protein biomarkers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the difference in expression of these biomarkers in patients with recurrent stage 1 NSCLC. Methods: We used the Luminex immunobead platform, including the MILLIPLEX map human angiogenesis/growth factor magnetic bead panel, to evaluate 80 biomarkers related to EMT against a total of 75 patients who underwent a complete anatomic resection. Patients were divided into the following cohorts: a) stage I NSCLC without recurrence in 2 years (n=50), and b) stage I NSCLC with recurrence within 2 years of follow up (n=25). Peripheral blood was collected and processed using standard phlebotomy techniques. Specimens were obtained in compliance with institutional IRB standards and consent. The Mann-Whitney test and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves were used to assess differences in biomarker concentrations between cohorts. Results: Univariate analysis revealed 19 biomarkers with significant (ROC >0.6) differences in expression between the patient cohorts including: angiopoietin 2, MCP-1, MIP-IB, TNF-R1, IGFBP-5, VEGF-D, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, follistatin, sICAM-1, sE-SELECTIN, CYFRA 21.1, RANTES, IL-Ira, M-CSF, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-6, HB-EGF, and PGF. The Mann-Whitney test revealed five biomarkers highly significant (p<0.05) for recurrence in stage 1 NSCLC, including MCP-1, VEGF-D, follistatin, sICAM-1, and placental growth factor (PGF). Evaluation of these biomarkers with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) suite identified several highly significant (p<1x10\u22125) biological themes, including ten IPA-defined processes associated with development (e.g. embryonic development and cardiovascular system development), seven processes associated with pathological processes (e.g. cancer, cell death, and respiratory disease), and seven processes associated with metastasis (e.g. cellular movement, immune cell trafficking, and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction). Random Forest analysis generated a 6-analyte panel consisting of MCP-1, IP-10, sICAM-1, IGFBP2, RANTES, and IGFBP3 that provided 71.1% classification accuracy with 66.1% sensitivity and 73.3% specificity. Conclusions: Here we report observations concerning the expression of EMT pathway members that may provide key insights into the role of circulating biomarkers related to recurrence in stage 1 NSCLC. Upon further validation, these biomarkers may serve as convenient surrogates to help guide molecular diagnostics and treatment strategies. ::: ::: Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

ACV98 postulates the existence of two successive reading procedures. According to it, any orthographical object (word or pseudo-word) is first submitted to a global processing which aims to find a \u201clexical familiarity\u201d computed from previously experienced words. If it is found, the corresponding phonological form of the stimulus is activated and reading is performed. If it is not found, a subsequent analytical processing is performed within the input stimulus using the same route, in order to extract familiar orthographic components (typically, syllables) as well as their corresponding phonological forms. The syllabic phonological forms are successively and temporarily maintained in a phonological buffer, before being assembled into a whole phonological form. Overall, this model predicts that words are read by using the global procedure, while the pseudo-words are read by using the analytical procedure. The present event-related fMRI study aimed to assess the effect of syllabic length on cerebral activity during reading, in order to obtain additional anatomo-functional information as support to this model as well as to behavioral results. Based on ACV98 predictions and in terms of cerebral network, we hypothesized (1) a lexicality effect: there should be no differences between words and pseudo-words, they are processed within a common network of cerebral regions, and (2) a syllable length effect: the length influences cerebral activity only during pseudo-words reading because only long pseudo-words are processed following an analytical procedure involving supplementary visual analysis, visuo-spatial attention and working memory processes. Eight right-handed volunteers performed a silent reading task on French printed words and pseudo-words. A pseudo-randomized event-related paradigm with 6 types (words=W and pseudo-words=PW composed of 1, 2 and 3 syllables) of stimuli was used. Data processing was performed using SPM'99. Our results have shown that (1) Words and pseudo-words involved common mechanisms such as visuo-orthographic, phonological, attentional and motor processes. No process was significantly more involved for one or the other of two types of stimuli (word or pseudo-word). This result is a priori more in agreement with \u201csingle way models\u201d and particularly with ACV'98 than with dual-route models. Nonetheless the dual-route model cannot be excluded; (2) A length effect on cerebral activity was obtained only during pseudo-word reading suggesting an analytical procedure involvement during reading of long pseudo-words, as ACV'98 predicts.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2402650883", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64334748"}

The multiple steps involved are local regression on each data point of the training data set and a small set of its closest neighbors, clustering on the feature vector space formed from the local regression, regression learning for each individual surface, and classification to determine the boundaries for each individual surface. An EM-based iteration process is introduced in the regression learning phase to improve the learning outcome. In this phase, ensemble learning plays an important role in the reassignment of the cluster index for each data point. The reassignment of cluster index is determined by the majority voting of predictive error of sub-models, the distance between the data point and regressed hyperplane, and the distance between the data point and centroid of each clustered surface. Classification is performed at the end to determine the boundaries for each individual surface. Clustering quality validity techniques are applied to the scenario in which the number of surfaces for the input domain is not known in advance.

The random subspace method only search for the selection of features. Meanwhile, the bagging approach only search for the selection of samples. To overcome these limitations, we propose the hybrid incremental ensemble learning (HIEL) approach which takes into consideration the feature space and the sample space simultaneously to handle noisy dataset. Specifically, HIEL first adopts the bagging technique and linear discriminant analysis to remove noisy attributes, and generates a set of bootstraps and the corresponding ensemble members in the subspaces. Then, the classifiers are selected incrementally based on a classifier-specific criterion function and an ensemble criterion function. The corresponding weights for the classifiers are assigned during the same process. Finally, the final label is summarized by a weighted voting scheme, which serves as the final result of the classification. We also explore various classifier-specific criterion functions based on different newly proposed similarity measures, which will alleviate the effect of noisy samples on the distance functions. In addition, the computational cost of HIEL is analyzed theoretically. A set of nonparametric tests are adopted to compare HIEL and other algorithms over several datasets.

Our method takes full advantage of 3D geometric information contained within the learned depth data, thus, can further improve action recognition performance. We treat action data as a fourth-order tensor (row, column, frame and sample), and apply latent low-rank transfer learning to learn shared subspaces of the source and target databases. Moreover, we introduce a novel cross-modality regularizer that plays an important role in finding the correlation between RGB and depth modalities, and then more depth information from the source database can be transferred to that of the target.

In this paper, we present a dierent insight into the principle of supervised competitive learning. An in- novative approach to the supervised self-organization is suggested. The method is based on dierent handling of input data labels which encode the classication. When the label has appropriate format then it is possible to use it within the competitive process in the same way as any input data element. Such approach is as eective as standard supervised methods and has some positive attributes such as the soft classication ability. or industry areas. This article is focused on competitive networks taught by supervision. An alternative to common supervised competitive learning is suggested and it is explained how labeled data may be processed within the standard metrics-based competitive learning. There are some learning methods (such as Learning Vector Quantization) which can utilize the competitive learn- ing principle but are applied to labeled data. They are called supervised competitive learning methods and might be mentioned also as semi-supervised learning. The main dierence between unsupervised competitive learning methods and supervised competitive learning methods is the structure of the input dataset. As usual, the supervision above the learning process must be based on some information added to the system and such information is a class label assigned to each input signal. The learning process is supervised through these labels and the common result of super- vised competitive learning is a classier trained on given patterns i.e. pairs of input signals and their labels. Later on this article, a new method of semi-supervised learning is presented. Our research has been inspired be some very interesting ideas about learning from context. The literature suggests that in some cases it is vital to focus on understanding the input dataset and leave the classication problem until later (7). This leads us to an idea that the pair of input data and its label should be taken as an indivisible object. The joined information may be passed to the network rather than using the label for the output correction, which is the common approach. If this idea is applied to competitive learning, useful results can be obtained. First, a brief description of the standard supervised competitive method (LVQ) will be given, therefore the dierence between the standard approach and our", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2158466245,2749300598", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16392261"}

Moreover, we show the failure of vanilla GAN in predicting the accurate mask and propose a regularized objective function with the use of Mean Square Error (MSE) between predicted and target spectrum to overcome it. The objective evaluation of the proposed method shows the improvement in the accurate mask prediction, as against the state-of-the-art ML-based optimization techniques. The proposed system significantly improves over a recent GAN-based speech enhancement system in improving speech quality, while maintaining a better trade-off between less speech distortion and more effective removal of background interferences present in the noisy mixture.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462068", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "journal": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2802304149", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60992701", "14349887", "8775053", "5615652", "8217078", "12431609", "4288794", "60064369", "671836", "1033682", "11758569", "6200260", "2202933", "11472563", "1346276", "11049683", "12054873", "1237347", "36559876", "24607800", "199661123", "119757139", "6628106", "607651", "6467803"], "inbound_citations": ["52187995", "208213586", "211572979", "152282808", "211126746", "210695338", "211126709", "209458646", "203144914", "208268286", "210971240", "53604241", "70129384", "59316572", "214795312", "96437090", "201320268", "71151540", "215722368", "57375707", "209500503", "202888562", "119314345"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52287199"}

Power demand information from smart meters is drawing attention among researchers, since it could be applied for power demand control. Providing attractive services with smart meters encourage electricity retailers to utilize demand side management, which could be a solution for energy-related problems in our society. In this paper, a novel service is proposed by classifying private information from the household electricity usage. The private information is estimated using feature vectors extracted from time series analysis of power demand information. In order to extract feature vectors effectively, two extraction methods were proposed: simple statistical method, and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) based extraction method.

Cancer is one such example where the phenomenon is very complex and also multiple features of cell types are involved. Breast cancer is a disease mostly affects female population and the number of affected people is highest among all cancer types in India. In the present investigation, various pattern recognition techniques were used for the classification of breast cancer using cell image processing. Under these pattern recognition techniques, cell image segmentation, texture based image feature extraction and subsequent classification of breast cancer cells was successfully performed. When four different machine learning techniques: Kth nearest neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Network ( ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) was used to classify 81 cell images, it was observed from the results that the LS-SVM with both Radial Basis Function (RBF) and linear kernel classifiers demonstrated the highest classification rate of 95.3488% among four other classifiers while SVM with linear kernel resulted a classification rate of 93.02% which was close to LSSVM classifier. Thus, it was demonstrated that the LS-SVM classifier showed accuracy higher than other classifiers reported so far. Moreover, our classifier can classify the disease in a short period of time using only cell images unlike other approaches reported so far.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "147040893", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37386111"}

Obtaining data samples and manual data labeling can be time-consuming and expensive. This is why it can be difficult to acquire the required amount of data in real conditions in many areas of application, so in the context of a limited dataset it is necessary to use other techniques, such as data augmentation and transfer learning. In this we paper we study the problem of fine-grained ship type classification with a dataset size which does not allow learning network from scratch.

The motivation behind this research has been raised from the Building Resilience into Risk Management (BRIM) project, looking at resilience in water systems.

Given a query face image, content-based face image retrieval tries to find similar face images from a large image database. Initially face of the image is detected from the query image. After the removal of noise present in the image, it is separated as patches. For each patch, the Local binary pattern (LBP) is extracted which improves the detection performance. LBP is a type of feature used for classification in computer vision. The LBP operator assigns a label to every pixel of a gray level image. The label mapping to a pixel is affected by the relationship between this pixel and its eight neighbors. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used then which will produce a model (based on the training data) that predicts the target values of the test data given only the test data attributes. When the feature values are provided to the SVM classifier, it will train about the feature. Finally it will classify about the result. SVM maps input vectors to a higher dimensional vector space where an optimal hyper plane is constructed. Among the available hyper planes, there is one hyper plane alone that maximizes the distance between itself and the nearest data vectors of each category.

Many researchers have utilized retinal fundus and OCT imaging for detecting ME. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work is found in the literature that fuses the findings from both retinal imaging modalities for the effective and more reliable diagnosis of ME. In this paper, we proposed an automated framework for the classification of ME and healthy eyes using retinal fundus and OCT scans.

Using this information, one learns the similarity measure for the data sequence space and the distance measures for the manifold. Moreover, we describe an approach to handle the similarity search problem given user-defined instance level constraints in the learned manifold using a consensus voting scheme.

Considering the complexities of occlusion, we focused our study on gathering the motion information at a higher scale, thus not associating it to single objects, but considering the crowd as a single entity. Firstly,we propose methods for flow segmentation based on correlation features, graph cut, Conditional Random Fields (CRF), enthalpy model, and particle mutual influence model. Secondly, methods based on deviant orientation information, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and MLP neural network combined with GoodFeaturesToTrack are proposed to detect two types of anomalies. The first one detects deviant motion of the pedestrians compared to what has been observed beforehand. The second one detects panic situation by adopting the GMM and MLP to learn the behavior of the motion features extracted from a grid of particles and GoodFeaturesToTrack, respectively. Finally, we propose particle-driven and hybrid appraoches to classify the behaviors of crowd in terms of lane, arch/ring, bottleneck, blocking and fountainhead within a region of interest (ROI). For this purpose, the particle-driven approach extracts and fuses spatio-temporal features together. The spatial features represent the density of neighboring particles in the predefined proximity, whereas the temporal features represent the rendering of trajectories traveled by the particles.

It has been successfully applied to many practical problems. However, it remains challenging to handle the large-scale problems. A nice property of SSVR is double sparsity in the sense that most irrelevant features and samples have no effect on the regressor. Inspired by it, we propose a simultaneous safe feature and sample screening rule based on the strong convexity of objective function (FSSR1) to accelerate SSVR, including the linear and nonlinear cases. Most inactive features and samples can be simultaneously discarded before training SSVR. Only one reduced SSVR (RSSVR) needs to be solved. Moreover, to further speed up RSSVR, the screening rule based on duality gap (FSSR2) is applied to continuously discard the remaining inactive variables during the reduced model training process. Combining the rule with the grid-search method, the framework of our final method (FSSR\u2013SSVR) is to alternatively conduct FSSR1 and FSSR2, which leads to substantial savings in both the memory usage and the computational cost. There are two appealing advantages of our FSSR-SSVR: first, it is safe, i.e., the features and samples discarded by FSSR are guaranteed to be inactive; second, it has synergy effect (in other words, the results of the previous feature screening can improve the performance of the next sample screening, and vice versa).

It was noted that Suricata could process a higher speed of network traffic than Snort with lower packet drop rate but it consumed higher computational resources. Snort had higher detection accuracy and was thus selected for further experiments. It was observed that the Snort triggered a high rate of false positive alarms.

A hybrid version of SVM and Fuzzy logic produced a better detection accuracy. But the best result was achieved using an optimised SVM with firefly algorithm with FPR (false positive rate) as 8.6% and FNR (false negative rate) as 2.2%, which is a good result.

Virtual machine consolidation can significantly reduce energy consumption by migrating virtual machines from one physical machine to another. However, excessive virtual machine consolidation can lead to dangerous Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. Therefore, how to balance between effective energy consumption and SLA violations avoidance effectively is a paradox to be mediated. The virtual machine consolidation problem is NP-hard. The traditional heuristic algorithm is easy to fall into the local optimal and some meta-heuristic algorithms can help to avoid it. However, the existing meta-heuristic algorithms are with high complexity. Therefore, we propose a lower complexity multi-population ant colony system algorithm with the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) prediction (ELM_MPACS). The algorithm firstly predicts the host state employing ELM and then the virtual machine on the overloaded host will be migrated to the normal host, while the virtual machine on the underloaded host will be consolidated to another underloaded host with higher utilization. Multiple populations concurrently construct migration plans and local search further optimizes the results obtained by each population to reduce SLA violations.

This research proposes a new three-dimensional hybrid color space termed SKN by employing the Genetic Algorithm heuristic and Principal Component Analysis to find the optimal representation of human skin color in over seventeen existing color spaces. Genetic Algorithm heuristic is used to find the optimal color component combination setup in terms of skin detection accuracy while the Principal Component Analysis projects the optimal Genetic Algorithm solution to a less complex dimension.

We have employed four classifiers including Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Multilayer Perceptron in order to generate the human skin color predictive model. The proposed color space was compared to some existing color spaces and shows superior results in terms of pixel-wise skin detection accuracy. Experimental results show that by using Random Forest classifier, the proposed SKN color space obtained an average F-score and True Positive Rate of 0.953 and False Positive Rate of 0.0482 which outperformed the existing color spaces in terms of pixel wise skin detection accuracy.

In this POD scenario, big data supervised classifiers managing imbalance between ortholog and non-ortholog pair classes allow for an effective scaling solution built from two genomes and extended to other genome pairs. ::: The supervised approach for POD was compared with Reciprocal Best Hits (RBH), Reciprocal Smallest Distance (RSD) and a Comprehensive, Automated Project for the Identification of Orthologs from Complete Genome Data (OMA) algorithms by using (i) Saccharomyces cerevisiae - Kluyveromcyes lactis, (ii) Saccharomyces cerevisiae - Candida glabrata and (iii) Saccharomyces cerevisiae - Schizosaccharomyces pombe yeast genome pairs as benchmark datasets. Four datasets derived from each genome pair comparison with different alignment settings were used.

The abnormalities due to papilledema such as opacification of Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL), dilated optic disc capillaries, blurred disc margins, absence of venous pulsations, elevation of optic disc, obscuration of optic disc vessels, dilation of optic disc veins, optic disc splinter hemorrhages, cotton wool spots and hard exudates may result in complete vision loss. The ophthalmologists detect papilledema by means of an ophthalmoscope, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and ultrasound. Rapid development of computer aided diagnostic systems has revolutionized the world. There is a need to develop such type of system that automatically detects the papilledema. In this paper, an automated system is presented that detects and grades the papilledema through analysis of fundus retinal images. The proposed system extracts 23 features from which six textural features are extracted from Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), eight features from optic disc margin obscuration, three color based features and seven vascular features are extracted. A feature vector consisting of these features is used for classification of normal and papilledema images using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The variations in retinal blood vessels, color properties, texture deviation of optic disc and its peripapillary region, and fluctuation of obscured disc margin are effectively identified and used by the proposed system for the detection and grading of papilledema. A dataset of 160 fundus retinal images is used which is taken from publicly available STARE database and local dataset collected from Armed Forces Institute of Ophthalmology (AFIO) Pakistan. The proposed system shows an average accuracy of 92.86% for classification of papilledema and normal images. It also shows an average accuracy of 97.85% for classification of already classified papilledema images into mild and severe papilledema.

However, the deep neural network currently faces many challenges: 1) its effectiveness is heavily dependent on large datasets, so the computational complexity is very high; 2) it is usually regarded as a black box model with poor interpretability. To meet the above challenges, a more interpretable and scalable feature learning method, i.e., deep image feature learning with fuzzy rules (DIFL-FR), is proposed in the paper, which combines the rule-based fuzzy modeling technique and the deep stacked learning strategy. The method progressively learns image features through a layer-by-layer manner based on fuzzy rules, so the feature learning process can be better explained by the generated rules. More importantly, the learning process of the method is only based on forward propagation without back propagation and iterative learning, which results in the high learning efficiency. In addition, the method is under the settings of unsupervised learning and can be easily extended to scenes of supervised and semi-supervised learning.

During the phenotyping process, optical sensors have proved their potential to determine and assess the function of the genotype of the breeding material. Thereby, biomarkers for specific disease resistance traits provide valuable information for calibrating optical sensor approaches during early plant-pathogen interactions. In this context, the combination of physiological, metabolic phenotyping and phenomic profiles could establish efficient identification and quantification of relevant genotypes within breeding processes. Experiments were conducted with near-isogenic lines of \\textit{H. vulgare} (susceptible, mildew locus o (mlo) and Mildew locus a (Mla) resistant). Multispectral imaging of barley plants was daily conducted 0-8 days after inoculation (dai) in a high-throughput facility with ten wavelength bands from 400 to 1000 nm. In parallel, the temporal dynamics of the activities of invertase isoenzymes, as key sink specific enzymes that irreversibly cleave the transport sugar sucrose into the hexose monomers, were profiled in a semi high-throughput approach. The activities of cell wall, cytosolic and vacuole invertase revealed specific dynamics of the activity signatures for susceptible genotypes and genotypes with mlo and Mla based resistances 0-120 hours after inoculation (hai). These patterns could be used to differentiate between interaction types and revealed an early influence of Bgh conidia on the specific invertase activity already 0.5 hai. During this early powdery mildew pathogenesis, the reflectance intensity increased in the blue bands and at 690 nm. The Mla resistant plants showed an increased reflectance at 680 nm and 710 nm and a decreased reflectance in the near infrared bands from 3 dai. Applying a Support Vector Machine classification as a supervised machine learning approach, the pixelwise identification and quantification of powdery mildew diseased barley tissue and hypersensitive response spots were established. This enables an automatic identification of the barley-powdery mildew interaction. The study established a proof-of-concept for plant resistance phenotyping with multispectral imaging in high-throughput. The combination of invertase analysis and multispectral imaging showed to be a complementing validation system.

Thus, if many learning problems with the same set of input vectors but different sets of labels have to be solved, it makes sense to compute the inverse of the matrix just once and then use it for computing all subsequent models. The computational complexity to train an regression SVM can be reduced to O(N2), just a matrix multiplication operation, and thus probably faster than known SVM training algorithms that have O(N2) work with loops.

Experiments are conducted on the first volume of the \u201cEnciclopedia Treccani\u201d, a large dataset containing 999 manually annotated pages from the historical Italian encyclopedia.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900272", "venue": "2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)", "journal": "2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2608505037", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9168951", "23399574", "3091", "2685887", "14455216", "2813627", "2483393", "7630958", "13748071", "21362674", "2606157", "16107554", "16204344", "2922591", "46138594", "964787", "45584563", "1613124", "3354231", "17060156", "31517603", "52855132"], "inbound_citations": ["58674287", "198166191", "52929022", "211026625"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4989897"}

We start from a 2^a-class problem, and extend it to any-class problem by applying a hierarchical decomposition procedure. Compared with the existing SVM-based multiclass methods, the VVD model has two advantages. First, it reduces the computational complexity by using a small number of classifiers. Second, the feature space partition induced by the hyperplanes effectively eliminates the Unclassifiable regions (URs) that may affect the classification performance of the algorithm.

Aim at such small sample modeling problem, a soft measuring method based on selective ensemble (SEN) least square support vector machine (LSSVM) for modeling DXN emission concentration is proposed.

The GLT rule distinguishes between a set of probability density function (pdf) families constructed using a custom pdf interpolation technique. The GLT is compared with the simple Likelihood Test (LT). We also adapt one prevalent supervised learning approach, Multiple Support Vector Machine (MSVM), to compare with our probabilistic methods. Due to the highly variant measurements from the WBAN, and these methods' different adaptability to multiple observations, our analysis and experimental results suggest that GLT is more accurate and suitable for posture/formation detection.

These new kernels belong to the class of R-Convolution kernels in the sense that the computation of the similarity between two complex objects is based on the similarities of objects' parts computed by means of sub-kernels. The complex objects (relational instances in our case) are tuples and sets and/or lists of relational instances for which elementary kernels and kernels on sets and lists are applied. The performance of this class of kernels together with the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm is evaluated on the problem of classification of protein fingerprints and by combining different data representations we were able to improve the best accuracy reported so far in the literature.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/11731139_64", "venue": "PAKDD", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2563299471,1558276509", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["28715329", "10239406", "16603659", "669209", "5118862", "396794", "195717148", "624219", "14157065", "64543020", "2306091"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13128776"}

The first step is modeling each category with two vectors of feature terms, which are called category core terms, and acquiring these terms by machine learning methods. Second, the semantic distance between feature terms and category core terms is calculated based on semantic database. Third, the global weight factor is replaced by the sematic distance to calculate the weight of every term.

It has been used in many recent research projects and real-world applications in diverse domains. However, the associated literature provides almost no directions about how many trees should be used to compose a Random Forest. The research reported here analyzes whether there is an optimal number of trees within a Random Forest, i.e., a threshold from which increasing the number of trees would bring no significant performance gain, and would only increase the computational cost. Our main conclusions are: as the number of trees grows, it does not always mean the performance of the forest is significantly better than previous forests (fewer trees), and doubling the number of trees is worthless. It is also possible to state there is a threshold beyond which there is no significant gain, unless a huge computational environment is available. In addition, it was found an experimental relationship for the AUC gain when doubling the number of trees in any forest. Furthermore, as the number of trees grows, the full set of attributes tend to be used within a Random Forest, which may not be interesting in the biomedical domain.

Methods: Clinical material includes 16 healthy (F0) and 15 with Chronic Liver Disease (F1,F2,F3,F4) patients according to the Metavir staging system. All exams were performed using the Aixplorer ultrasound system with a SuperCurved SC6-1 transducer. From the SWE-QBox the RGB displayed elasticity data of Young\u2019s modulus were transformed from RGB color space into an elasticity matrix of gray tones, whose values varied from zero to the maximum elasticity measurement. Every pixel with no RGB-values was set to \u2018\u22121\u2019 due to non-valid elasticity value for that pixel. From the elastogram map 185 textural features were computed (5 from the gray-tone histogram, 26 second order statistic features, extracted from the co-occurrence matrices and 10 features extracted from the run-length matrices over four directions (00,450,900,1350) and distances of (d=1,3,5,7,9) pixels). Stepwise multi-linear regression analysis was utilized to avoid feature redundancy leading to a feature subset feeding a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. SVM-model evaluation was performed by means of the leave-one-out method. Results: Maximum classification accuracy (93.5%) in distinguishing healthy from chronic liver disease patients was obtained employing three textural features (Standard Deviation, Sum-Variance, Contrast) that describe the elastogram\u2019s contrast, variability and complexity. Sensitivity and specificity values were 93.3% and 94.0% respectively. Conclusion: The proposed classification scheme can provide reproducibility and reliability of liver SWE application in clinical practice. It can also assist the interpretation of SWE measurements which is considered as a difficult task due to absence of guidelines in the literature and to decrease the time/cost of diagnosis and the need for patients to undergo invasive examination.

Ellefson ( ellefson@siu.edu ) Morten H. Christiansen ( morten@siu.edu ) Department of Psychology Southern Illinois University - Carbondale Carbondale, IL 62901-6502 USA Abstract The acquisition and processing of language is governed b y a number of universal constraints, many of which undoubt- edly derive from innate properties of the human brain. However, language researchers disagree about whether these constraints are linguistic or cognitive in nature. In this paper, we suggest that the constraints on complex question formation, traditionally explained in terms of the linguistic principle of subjacency, may instead derive from limitations on sequential learning. We present results from an artificial language learning experiment in which sub- jects were trained either on a \u201cnatural\u201d language involving no subjacency violations, or an \u201cunnatural\u201d language that incorporated a limited number of subjacency violations. Although two-thirds of the sentence types were the same across both languages, the natural language was acquired significantly better than its unnatural counterpart. The presence of the unnatural subjacency items negatively af- fected the learning of the unnatural language as a whole. Connectionist simulations using simple recurrent net- works, trained on the same stimuli, replicated these results. This suggests that sequential constraints on learning can explain why subjacency violations are avoided: they make language more difficult to learn. Thus, the constraints o n complex question formation may be better explained i n terms of innate cognitive constraints, rather than linguis- tic constraints deriving from an innate Universal Grammar. Introduction One aspect of language that any comprehensive theory of language must explain is the existence of linguistic univer- sals. The notion of language universals refers to the observa- tion that although the space of logically possible linguistic subpatterns is vast; the languages of the world only take up a small part of it. That is, there are certain universal tenden- cies in how languages are structured and used. Theories of language evolution seek to explain how these constraints may have evolved in the hominid lineage. Some theories suggest that the evolution of a Chomskyan Universal Grammar (UG) underlies these universal constraints (e.g., Pinker & Bloom, 1990). More recently, an alternative per- spective is gaining ground. This approach advocates a refo- cus in evolutionary thinking; stressing the adaptation of lin- guistic structures to the human brain rather than vice versa (e.g., Christiansen, 1994; Kirby, 1998). Accordingly, lan- guage has evolved to fit sequential learning and processing mechanisms existing prior to the appearance of language. These mechanisms presumably also underwent changes after the emergence of language, but the selective pressures are likely to have come not only from language but also from other kinds of complex hierarchical processing, such as the need for increasingly complex manual combinations follow- ing tool sophistication. Thus, many language universals may reflect non-linguistic, cognitive constraints on learning and processing of sequential structure rather than innate UG. This perspective on language evolution also has important implications for current theories of language acquisition and processing. It suggests that many of the cognitive con- straints that have shaped the evolution of language are still at play in our current language ability. If this is correct, it should be possible to uncover the source of some linguistic universal in human performance on sequential learning tasks. Christiansen (2000; Christiansen & Devlin, 1997) has previously explored this possibility in terms of a se- quential learning explanation of basic word order universals. He presented converging evidence from theoretical considera- tions regarding rule interactions, connectionist simulations, typological language analyses, and artificial language learn- ing in normal adults and aphasic patients, corroborating the idea of cognitive constraints on basic word order universals. In this paper, we take a similar evolutionary approach to one of the classic linguistic universals: subjacency. We first briefly discuss some of the linguistic data that have given rise to the subjacency principle. Next, we present an artifi- cial language learning experiment that investigates our hy- pothesis that limitations on sequential learning rather than an innate subjacency principle provide the appropriate con- straints on complex question formation. Finally, we report on a set of connectionist simulations in which networks are trained on the same material as the humans, and with very similar results. Taken together, the results from the artifi- cial language learning experiment and the connectionist simulations support our idea that subjacency violations are avoided, not because of an innate subjacency principle, but because of cognitive constraints on sequential learning. Why Subjacency? According to Pinker and Bloom (1990), subjacency is one of the classic examples of an arbitrary linguistic constraint that makes sense only from a linguistic perspective. Informally, the subjacency principle involves the assumption of certain", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "The Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2561321768,1216474553", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11929412", "60598298", "7069311", "7447597", "144277171", "6354414", "6167614", "49731878", "183684003"], "inbound_citations": ["11264510", "9251740", "55906600", "2643990", "62328811", "14451340", "15270119", "5759479", "52156878", "209440966", "2365648", "14563715", "17902507", "13438760", "118468976", "63355378", "9443047", "18214740", "7020811", "2200840", "976262", "18099287", "12476173"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10089159"}

However, they impose restrictions in the computational resources and bandwidth available to solve target problems. This thesis is concerned with the definition of new efficient algorithms to perform Human Action Recognition with Visual Sensor Networks. Human Action Recognition systems apply sequence modelling methods to integrate the temporal sensor measurements available. Among sequence modelling methods, the Hidden Conditional Random Field has shown a great performance in sequence classification tasks, outperforming many other methods. However, a parameter estimation procedure has not been proposed with feature and model selection properties. This thesis fills this lack proposing a new objective function to optimize during training. The L2 regularizer employed in the standard objective function is replaced by an overlapping group-L1 regularizer that produces feature and model selection effects in the optima. A gradient-based search strategy is proposed to find the optimal parameters of the objective function. Experimental evidence shows that Hidden Conditional Random Fields with their parameters estimated employing the proposed method have a higher predictive accuracy than those estimated with the standard method, with an smaller inference cost. This thesis also deals with the problem of human action recognition from multiple cameras, with the focus on reducing the amount of network bandwidth required. A multiple view dimensionality reduction framework is developed to obtain similar low dimensional representation for the motion descriptors extracted from multiple cameras. An alternative is proposed predicting the action class locally at each camera with the motion descriptors extracted from each view and integrating the different action decisions to make a global decision on the action performed. The reported experiments show that the proposed framework has a predictive performance similar to 3D state of the art methods, but with a lower computational complexity and lower bandwidth requirements. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1500706843", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["4770426"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54162066"}

Nevertheless, finding a global solution (i.e., a global minimum for the energy function) is not guaranteed and even a local solution may take an exponential number of steps. We propose an improvement to the standard local activation function used for such networks. The improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is found in linear time for tree-like subnetworks. The algorithm, called activate, is uniform and does not assume that the network is tree-like. It can identify tree-like subnetworks even in cyclic topologies (arbitrary networks) and avoid local minima along these trees. For acyclic networks, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a global minimum from any initial state of the system (self-stabilization) and remains correct under various types of schedulers. On the negative side, we show that in the presence of cycles, no uniform algorithm exists that guarantees optimality even under a sequential asynchronous scheduler. An asynchronous scheduler can activate only one unit at a time while a synchronous scheduler can activate any number of units in a single time step. In addition, no uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when the scheduler is synchronous. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be improved using the cycle-cutset scheme.

This paper discusses proposed methodology and algorithms that involved larger library of filters used to create more discrimination features among the images by processing the proposed 15 Haar rectangular features (an extension from 4 Haar wavelet filters of Viola Jones) and used them in multiple adaptive ensemble process of detecting face image.

Among the captured images, normal wear appeared as bright and the rest of the three defects appeared as dark. Therefore, the classification has been carried out in two stages. Various segmentation methods were tested and extended maxima transform gave the best result. The defective area was calculated in metric units. Multiple textural features based on histogram and gray level co-occurrence matrix were extracted from the segmented images and ranked them automatically using the sequential forward feature selection method in order to select the best minimal features for the classification purpose. Many classifiers based on Bayes, k -Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were tested and the results demonstrated the efficacy of SVM for this application.

Although the regression analysis has been used as a daily clinical means to estimate the fetal weight on the basis of ultrasound measurements, it still lacks enough accuracy for low-birth-weight fetuses. The ineffectiveness is mainly due to the large inter- or intraobserver variability in measurements and the inappropriateness of the regression analysis. A novel method based on the support vector regression (SVR) is proposed to improve the weight estimation accuracy for fetuses of less than 2500 g. Here, fuzzy logic is introduced into SVR (termed FSVR) to limit the contribution of inaccurate training data to the model establishment, and thus, to enhance the robustness of FSVR to noisy data. To guarantee the generalization performance of the FSVR model, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) is utilized to obtain the optimal parameters for the FSVR, which is referred to as the evolutionary fuzzy support vector regression (EFSVR) model. Compared with regression formulas, back-propagation neural network, and SVR, EFSVR achieves the lowest mean absolute percent error (6.6%) and the highest correlation coefficient (0.902) between the estimated fetal weight and the actual birth weight.

Whenever the On/Off signals in the optical sensors are generated discontinuously, the motion errors can be measured and updated. After sensing, the variation of motion errors can be estimated continuously by the dead reckoning method according to left/right wheel angular velocity. We define the estimated contour error as the sum of the measured contour in the sensing error and the estimated variation of contour error after sensing. The neurofuzzy system consists of incorporating fuzzy controller and neural network. The center and width of fuzzy membership functions are adaptively adjusted by back-propagation learning to minimize th estimated contour error.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has the potential to detect hypoglycemia in real time and thereby reduce time in hypoglycemia and avoid any further decline in blood glucose level. However, CGM is inaccurate and shows a substantial number of cases in which the hypoglycemic event is not detected by the CGM. The aim of this study was to develop a pattern classification model to optimize real-time hypoglycemia detection. ::: ::: ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS ::: Features such as time since last insulin injection and linear regression, kurtosis, and skewness of the CGM signal in different time intervals were extracted from data of 10 male subjects experiencing 17 insulin-induced hypoglycemic events in an experimental setting. Nondiscriminative features were eliminated with SEPCOR and forward selection. The feature combinations were used in a Support Vector Machine model and the performance assessed by sample-based sensitivity and specificity and event-based sensitivity and number of false-positives. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The best model was composed by using seven features and was able to detect 17 of 17 hypoglycemic events with one false-positive compared with 12 of 17 hypoglycemic events with zero false-positives for the CGM alone. Lead-time was 14 min and 0 min for the model and the CGM alone, respectively. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: This optimized real-time hypoglycemia detection provides a unique approach for the diabetes patient to reduce time in hypoglycemia and learn about patterns in glucose excursions. Although these results are promising, the model needs to be validated on CGM data from patients with spontaneous hypoglycemic events.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "23631608", "doi": "10.1089/dia.2013.0069", "venue": "Diabetes technology & therapeutics", "journal": "Diabetes technology & therapeutics", "mag_id": "2017294614", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["4955378", "206800906", "8266766", "26078211", "37143738", "4848195", "53108165", "17274044", "110433431", "10905615", "27851507", "4927995"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5169532"}

Recommendation techniques are indispensable to predict user ratings on items in terms of historical data and deal with the information overload. In many applications, the problem of data sparsity usually results in overfitting and fails to give desirable performance. Therefore, many works have started to investigate the techniques of cross-domain recommendation to overcome the challenge. However, it is not trivial. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning algorithm, named TLRec, for cross-domain recommendation, which exploits the overlapped users and items as a bridge to link different domains and implements knowledge transfer. We learn parameters based on the defined empirical prediction error, smoothness and regularization of user and item latent vectors.

Application and analysis of the experimental results in Shengli oilfield proved that SVM could achieve greater accuracy than the BP neural network do, which also proved that application of SVM to predict corrosion rate of injecting water pipeline, even to the other theme in petroleum engineering, is reliable, adaptable, precise and easy to operate.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/COGINF.2010.5599754", "venue": "9th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics (ICCI'10)", "journal": "9th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics (ICCI'10)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1984116069", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["155225487"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14862513"}

Traditionally, emergence of faults in systems was detected by algorithms based on specific sensory signals responding to the incipience of the fault. However, the fault itself is engendered by the fact that certain specific system state parameters acquire a specific combinatorial relationship preceding the fault, thus if the acquisition of this relationship can be detected immediately on formation, neutralization of the fault can be effected early \u2013 something particularly relevant to critical systems. The advent of the industrial IoT has made real time systemic data (state parameters) across a chain of processes available at computing platforms, and potentially enabled data-based algorithms \u2013 specifically Artificial Neural Networks \u2013 to predict such adverse digressions before actual initiation. However, most manmade systems are subject to drift, due to which ANNs trained on data acquired over a certain operational period lose accuracy going forward.

{"paper_id": "117596671", "title": "Ensemble Learning with Support Vector Machines for Bond Rating", "authors": [{"first": "Myoung-Jong", "middle": [], "last": "Kim", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Bond rating is regarded as an important event for measuring financial risk of companies and for determining the investment returns of investors. As a result, it has been a popular research topic for researchers to predict companies' credit ratings by applying statistical and machine learning techniques. The statistical techniques, including multiple regression, multiple discriminant analysis (MDA), logistic models (LOGIT), and probit analysis, have been traditionally used in bond rating. However, one major drawback is that it should be based on strict assumptions. Such strict assumptions include linearity, normality, independence among predictor variables and pre-existing functional forms relating the criterion variablesand the predictor variables. Those strict assumptions of traditional statistics have limited their application to the real world. Machine learning techniques also used in bond rating prediction models include decision trees (DT), neural networks (NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Especially, SVM is recognized as a new and promising classification and regression analysis method. SVM learns a separating hyperplane that can maximize the margin between two categories. SVM is simple enough to be analyzed mathematical, and leads to high performance in practical applications. SVM implements the structuralrisk minimization principle and searches to minimize an upper bound of the generalization error. In addition, the solution of SVM may be a global optimum and thus, overfitting is unlikely to occur with SVM. In addition, SVM does not require too many data sample for training since it builds prediction models by only using some representative sample near the boundaries called support vectors. A number of experimental researches have indicated that SVM has been successfully applied in a variety of pattern recognition fields. However, there are three major drawbacks that can be potential causes for degrading SVM's performance. First, SVM is originally proposed for solving binary-class classification problems. Methods for combining SVMs for multi-class classification such as One-Against-One, One-Against-All have been proposed, but they do not improve the performance in multi-class classification problem as much as SVM for binary-class classification. Second, approximation algorithms (e.g. decomposition methods, sequential minimal optimization algorithm) could be used for effective multi-class computation to reduce computation time, but it could deteriorate classification performance. Third, the difficulty in multi-class prediction problems is in data imbalance problem that can occur when the number of instances in one class greatly outnumbers the number of instances in the other class. Such data sets often cause a default classifier to be built due to skewed boundary and thus the reduction in the classification accuracy of such a classifier. SVM ensemble learning is one of machine learning methods to cope with the above drawbacks. Ensemble learning is a method for improving the performance of classification and prediction algorithms. AdaBoost is one of the widely used ensemble learning techniques. It constructs a composite classifier by sequentially training classifiers while increasing weight on the misclassified observations through iterations. The observations that are incorrectly predicted by previous classifiers are chosen more often than examples that are correctly predicted. Thus Boosting attempts to produce new classifiers that are better able to predict examples for which the current ensemble's performance is poor. In this way, it can reinforce the training of the misclassified observations of the minority class. This paper proposes a multiclass Geometric Mean-based Boosting (MGM-Boost) to resolve multiclass prediction problem. Since MGM-Boost introduces the notion of geometric mean into AdaBoost, it can perform learning process considering the geometric mean-based accuracy and errors of multiclass. This study applies MGM-Boost to the real-world bond rating case for Korean companies to examine the feasibility of MGM-Boost. 10-fold cross validations for threetimes with different random seeds are performed in order to ensure that the comparison among three different classifiers does not happen by chance. For each of 10-fold cross validation, the entire data set is first partitioned into tenequal-sized sets, and then each set is in turn used as the test set while the classifier trains on the other nine sets. That is, cross-validated folds have been tested independently of each algorithm. Through these steps, we have obtained the results for classifiers on each of the 30 experiments. In the comparison of arithmetic mean-based prediction accuracy between individual classifiers, MGM-Boost (52.95%) shows higher prediction accuracy than both AdaBoost (51.69%) and SVM (49.47%). MGM-Boost (28.12%) also shows the higher prediction accuracy than AdaBoost (24.65%) and SVM (15.42%)in terms of geometric mean-based prediction accuracy. T-test is used to examine whether the performance of each classifiers for 30 folds is significantly different.

Focused on a specific area, the zones to be detected are vegetation/mangrove, degradation/desertification, interface water-sediment and plain. These zones are very interesting from a geological point of view due to their spatial distribution and interrelation, which contribute to evaluate the natural anthropic impact level. The approach to unsupervisedly extract these zones from an input image has two steps. Firstly, the image is automatically segmented in homogeneous colored regions using the Bounded Irregular Pyramid BIP. The BIP is a hierarchy of successively reduced graphs which produces accurate segmentation results with a low computational cost. Secondly, each obtained region is classified using texture features to determine if it belongs to one of the geoenvironmental zones of interest. As texture features, we have evaluated two variations of the Local Binary Pattern LBP descriptor: the Extended-LBP ELBP and the LBP variance LBPV. Both methods include a local contrast measure. For classifying the obtained features, the Support Vector Machine SVM has been employed. At this stage, we have evaluated the use of linear and radial basis function RBF kernels. The whole framework was tested using images obtained from our specific area of interest: the location of Carenero, Miranda state Venezuela, in years 1936 and 1992. They allow to study the variation of the geoenvironmental zones of interest of this location in this period of time. These images are low quality images and present significant variations in illumination. This makes difficult the texture classification of their zones.

Probabilistic ILP (PILP) extends the ILP framework by making use of probabilistic variants of logic programs to capture background and hypothesised knowledge. ILP and PILP are differentiated from most other forms of Machine Learning (ML) both by their use of an expressive representation language and their ability to make use of logically encoded background knowledge. This has allowed successful applications in areas such as Systems Biology, computational chemistry and Natural Language Processing. The problem of learning a set of logical clauses from examples and background knowledge has been studied since Reynold's and Plotkin's work in the late 1960's. The research area of ILP has been studied intensively since the early 1990s, while PILP has received increasing amounts of interest over the last decade. This talk will provide an overview of results for learning logic programs within the paradigms of learning-in-the-limit, PAC-learning and Bayesian learning. These results will be related to various settings, implementations and applications used in ILP. It will be argued that the Bayes' setting has a number of distinct advantages for both ILP and PILP. Bayes' average case results are easier to compare with empirical machine learning performance than results from either PAC or learning-in-thelimit. Broad classes of logic programs are learnable in polynomial time in a Bayes' setting, while corresponding PAC results are largely negative. Bayes' can be used to derive and analyse algorithms for learning from positive only examples for classes of logic program which are unlearnable within both the PAC and learning-in-the-limit framework. It will be shown how a Bayesian approach can be used to analyse the relevance of background knowledge when learning.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs) record neural activity and can detect epilepsy. Visual inspection of an EEG signal for epileptic seizure detection is a time-consuming process and may lead to human error; therefore, recently, a number of automated seizure detection frameworks were proposed to replace these traditional methods. Feature extraction and classification are two important steps in these procedures. Feature extraction focuses on finding the informative features that could be used for classification and correct decision-making. Therefore, proposing effective feature extraction techniques for seizure detection is of great significance.Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used in different fields of pattern recognition including EEG signal classification. Global modular PCA (GModPCA) is a variation of PCA. In this paper, an effective framework with GModPCA and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is presented for epileptic seizure detection in EEG signals. The feature extraction is performed with GModPCA, whereas SVM trained with radial basis function kernel performed the classification between seizure and nonseizure EEG signals. Seven different experimental cases were conducted on the benchmark epilepsy EEG dataset. The system performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. In addition, we prove analytically that GModPCA has less time and space complexities as compared to PCA.The experimental results show that EEG signals have strong inter-sub-pattern correlations. GModPCA and SVM have been able to achieve 100% accuracy for the classification between normal and epileptic signals. Along with this, seven different experimental cases were tested. The classification results of the proposed approach were better than were compared the results of some of the existing methods proposed in literature.

Estimated parameters determine the location of the hyperplane which maximises the separation margin of both classes.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Computer Assisted Mechanics and Engineering Sciences", "mag_id": "222584382", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:118983139"}

The most successful architecture is StarGAN [4], that conditions GANs' generation process with images of a specific domain, namely a set of images of persons sharing the same expression. While effective, this approach can only generate a discrete number of expressions, determined by the content of the dataset. To address this limitation, in this paper, we introduce a novel GAN conditioning scheme based on Action Units (AU) annotations, which describes in a continuous manifold the anatomical facial movements defining a human expression. Our approach allows controlling the magnitude of activation of each AU and combine several of them. Additionally, we propose a fully unsupervised strategy to train the model, that only requires images annotated with their activated AUs, and exploit attention mechanisms that make our network robust to changing backgrounds and lighting conditions. Extensive evaluation show that our approach goes beyond competing conditional generators both in the capability to synthesize a much wider range of expressions ruled by anatomically feasible muscle movements, as in the capacity of dealing with images in the wild.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1807.09251", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6240441", "pubmed_id": "30465044", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-01249-6_50", "venue": "Computer vision - ECCV ... : ...

This paper focuses on the domain of in vitro fertilization (IVF), where estimating the outcome of a treatment is very crucial in the decision to proceed with treatment for both the clinicians and the infertile couples. IVF treatment is a stressful and costly process. It is very stressful for couples who want to have a baby. If an initial evaluation indicates a low pregnancy rate, decision of the couple may change not to start the IVF treatment. The aim of this study is twofold, firstly, to develop a technique that can be used to estimate the chance of success for a couple who wants to have a baby and secondly, to determine the attributes and their particular values affecting the outcome in IVF treatment. We propose a new technique, called success estimation using a ranking algorithm (SERA), for estimating the success of a treatment using a ranking-based algorithm. The particular ranking algorithm used here is RIMARC. The performance of the new algorithm is compared with two well-known algorithms that assign class probabilities to query instances. The algorithms used in the comparison are Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier and Random Forest.

Our experiment includes a baseline and relevant questioning technique in the context of deception with 220 participants (20 hours long). Baseline questioning includes participants being separately asked to remember and imagine an arbitrary experience. During the relevant questioning, participants were prompted to either lie or tell the truth about a certain task. We trained a neural network model on the baseline data and achieved an accuracy of 60% on classifying imagining vs. remembering, whereas human performance for this task is 51%. Relevant questioning included a set of questions, each of which became an independent response segment.

In recent years, segmentation methods based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have achieved great success in general images. FCN performance is primarily due to it leveraging large labeled datasets to hierarchically learn the features that correspond to the shallow appearance as well as the deep semantics of the images. However, such dependence on large dataset does not translate well into medical images where there is a scarcity of annotated medical training data, and FCN results in coarse ROI detections and poor boundary definitions. To overcome this limitation, medical image-specific FCN methods have been introduced with post-processing techniques to refine the segmentation results; however, the performance of these methods is reliant on the appropriate tuning of a large number of parameters and dependence on data-specific post-processing techniques. In this study, we leverage the state-of-the-art image feature learning method of generative adversarial network (GAN) for its inherent ability to produce consistent and realistic images features by using deep neural networks and adversarial learning concept. We improve upon GAN such that ROI features can be learned at different levels of complexities (simple and complex), in a controlled manner, via our proposed dual-path adversarial learning (DAL). The outputs from our DAL are then augmented to the learned ROI features into the existing FCN training data, which increases the overall feature diversity. We conducted experiments on three public datasets with a variety of visual characteristics. Our results demonstrate that our DAL can improve FCN-based segmentation methods and outperform or be competitive in performances to the state-of-the-art methods without using medical image-specific optimizations.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00371-018-1519-5", "venue": "The Visual Computer", "journal": "The Visual Computer", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2802594085", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17233601", "9772372", "206724543", "15620529", "56507745", "3429309", "10841677", "206616262", "23873598", "206750179", "18564860", "1218405", "2607360", "5621496", "12102342", "266763", "372467", "1033682", "12803511", "6200260", "3719281", "206594692", "207224096", "3333267", "17561511", "206597351", "24134802", "14124313", "6063320", "11551426", "3238570", "5767685", "5232411"], "inbound_citations": ["181755450", "211053537", "203182778", "56475948", "153315115", "199358964", "210966066", "204799898"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14009291"}

In order to build a stable wireless communication system, reactions like retransmission mechanisms are necessary. Since the way we must react to interference is different from the way we react to multipathfading and attenuation, the retransmission mechanism should be adjusted in different ways under those different cicumstances. Under this condition, channel diagnostics for discriminating the causes that corrupt the packets between multipath fading and attenuation (MFA) and WLAN interference are imperative. This paper presents a frame bit error rate (F-BER) regulated algorithm based on a joint RSSI-LQI classifier that may correctly diagnose the channel status.

The unary potentials of the CRF are often learnt independently by a classifier, thereby decoupling the inference in CRF from the training of classifier. Such a scheme works effectively, when pixel-level labelling is available for all the images. However, in absence of pixel-level labels, the classifier is faced with the uphill task of selectively assigning the image-level labels to the pixels of the image. Prior work often relied on localization cues, such as saliency maps, objectness priors, bounding boxes etc., to address this challenging problem. In contrast, we model the labels of the pixels as latent variables of a CRF. The pixels and the image-level labels are the observed variables of the latent CRF. We amortize the cost of inference in the latent CRF over the entire dataset, by training an inference network to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables given the observed variables. The inference network can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, and requires no localization cues for training. Moreover, unlike other approaches for weakly-supervised segmentation, the proposed model doesn't require further post-processing.

The main idea is to incorporate the regularization method to further improve its generalization performance, and a new update formula is used to eliminate the initialization phase. To enable the OS-RELM to adapt to new data in an effective and reliable manner, an efficient Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation method is implemented. Finally, a matrix reconstruction method is employed to address the unstable update issue.

Image classification is the process in which several images are categorized into several groups. Image segmentation techniques are normally used for volumetric analysis of abnormalities in medical images and classification techniques are used for identification of the nature of disease. In both cases, the accuracy and convergence rate of the methodologies used must be significantly positive. Hence, soft computing techniques are widely preferred for such applications. In this chapter, the application of few soft computing techniques such as Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), K-means and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for image segmentation and classification are explored.

These negative emotions occur naturally in everyday life, but frequent episodes can be detrimental to cardiovascular health in the long term. The development of monitoring systems to detect negative emotions often rely on labels derived from subjective self-report. However, this approach is burdensome, intrusive, low fidelity (i.e. scales are administered infrequently) and places huge reliance on the veracity of subjective self-report. This paper explores an alternative approach that provides greater fidelity by using psychophysiological data (e.g. heart rate) to dynamically label data derived from the driving task (e.g. speed, road type). A number of different techniques for generating labels for machine learning were compared: 1) deriving labels from subjective self-report and 2) labelling data via psychophysiological activity (e.g. heart rate (HR), pulse transit time (PTT), etc.) to create dynamic labels of high vs. low anxiety for each participant. The classification accuracy associated with both labelling techniques was evaluated using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Results indicated that classification of driving data using subjective labelled data (1) achieved a maximum AUC of 73%, whilst the labels derived from psychophysiological data (2) achieved equivalent performance of 74%.

Although the off-line training might require very intensive computing power, the extracted information does has a concise representation, which then enables to detect a signal using only simple and low-power operations.Frequency-hopping is an attractive alternative multiple access technique for direct sequence based code division multiple access (CDMA) schemes. Other than the communication channel statistic, the capacity of an FHMA system is determined by two major related design concerns: waveform design and receiver structure. Given the FH waveform, one still has difficulty in designing an FHMA ML receiver due to the facts that our knowledge about the channel statistics is often incomplete and even if it is complete the associated conditional probability density function (pdf) does not render a closed-form expression.Regarding the FHMA/MFSK waveform as a time-frequency pattern, we convert the multiuser detection problem into a pattern classification problem and then resolve to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach for solving the resulting multiple-class classification problem. By using an appropriate kernel function,t he SVM essentially transforms the received signal space into a higher dimension feature space.

However, extracting these features could be burdensome, due to the nonstationary nature of transient signals. This may then adversely affect the accuracy of the identification of devices. Recently, it has been shown that the use of variational mode decomposition (VMD) in extracting features from Bluetooth (BT) transient signals offers an efficient way to improve the classification accuracy. To do this, VMD has been used to decompose transient signals into a series of band-limited modes, and higher order statistical (HOS) features are extracted from reconstructed transient signals. In this study, the performance bounds of VMD in RFF implementation are scrutinized. Firstly, HOS features are extracted from the band-limited modes, and then from the reconstructed transient signals directly. Performance comparison due to both HOS feature sets is presented. Moreover, the lower SNR bound within which the VMD can achieve acceptable accuracy in the classification of BT devices is determined. The approach has been tested experimentally with BT devices by employing a Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) classifier. According to the classification results, a higher classification performance is achieved (~4% higher) at lower SNR levels (-5-5 dB) when HOS features are extracted from band-limited modes in the implementation of VMD in RFF of BT devices.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32204301", "doi": "10.3390/s20061704", "venue": "Sensors", "journal": "Sensors", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3010770867", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["15253323", "62245606", "10209063", "19478570", "33860563", "1800784", "67866385", "23207381", "133603803", "1262186", "16819328", "73634557", "52052413", "204701573", "213484255", "22670823", "53428069", "209082313", "14294002"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214630842"}

Moreover, Wickramaratna et al. [2001. Performance degradation in boosting. In: Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Multiple Classifier Systems, pp. 11-21] show that AdaBoost with strong component classifiers is not viable. In this paper, we shall show that AdaBoost incorporating properly designed RBFSVM (SVM with the RBF kernel) component classifiers, which we call AdaBoostSVM, can perform as well as SVM. Furthermore, the proposed AdaBoostSVM demonstrates better generalization performance than SVM on imbalanced classification problems. The key idea of AdaBoostSVM is that for the sequence of trained RBFSVM component classifiers, starting with large @s values (implying weak learning), the @s values are reduced progressively as the Boosting iteration proceeds. This effectively produces a set of RBFSVM component classifiers whose model parameters are adaptively different manifesting in better generalization as compared to AdaBoost approach with SVM component classifiers using a fixed (optimal) @s value. From benchmark data sets, we show that our AdaBoostSVM approach outperforms other AdaBoost approaches using component classifiers such as Decision Trees and Neural Networks. AdaBoostSVM can be seen as a proof of concept of the idea proposed in Valentini and Dietterich [2004. Bias-variance analysis of support vector machines for the development of SVM-based ensemble methods. Journal of Machine Learning Research 5, 725-775] that Adaboost with heterogeneous SVMs could work well. Moreover, we extend AdaBoostSVM to the Diverse AdaBoostSVM to address the reported accuracy/diversity dilemma of the original Adaboost. By designing parameter adjusting strategies, the distributions of accuracy and diversity over RBFSVM component classifiers are tuned to maintain a good balance between them and promising results have been obtained on benchmark data sets.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.engappai.2007.07.001", "venue": "Eng.

The correct identification of th ese zones is necessary for the subsequent extraction of IN from these zones. A hierarchical classification model is pr oposed using two Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The first classifier is used to identify an IN zone with high est confidence, and the other cla ssifier identifies the remaining IN zones. Eight sets of word lists are collected to train and test the classifiers, each set containing collections of words ranging from 100 to 1,200. Experiments based on a test set of 105 journal articles show a Precision of 0.88, 0.97 Recall, 0.92 F-Measure, and 0.99 Accuracy. Keywords: Investigator Names, MEDLINE, Support Vector Machine, labeling, text classification, bibliographic information. 1. INTRODUCTION The U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) maintains MEDLINE, a heavily used bibliographic database of 20 million citations to the biomedical journal literature. Each citation consists of bibliographic information such as article title, author names, affiliations, the abstract , grant numbers, databank accession number s, etc. While NLM receives most such citations in XML format directly from journal publishers, key bibliographic information is often missing, requiring manual entry. We have therefore developed a system called Publisher Data Review System (PDRS) to automatically extract missing bibliographic information such as grant numbers, grant support information, databank accession numbers, Investigator Names (IN), etc. [1, 2, 3, 4]. In a typical biomedical article, the author zone is located close to the article title, and contains names of the authors. However, due to the increasingly collaborative nature of biomedical research, many investigators from various groups/organizations may collaborate in conducting the res earch. These group/org anization names might also appear in the author or title zones, and the investigators affiliated with them would have their names listed somewhere else within the article, most likely toward the end, close to the references. In articles that list investigators, the number of investigator names average about 40, but may number several hundred. The manual process to enter this data is time-consuming and error-prone. We have therefore proposed a system for automatic extraction of IN consisting of three steps. The system first divides an article into zones, next identifies zones containing IN, and then extracts IN from th ese zones. In this paper, we will focus on the second step, that of identifying (labeling) IN zones. Algorithms commonly used for document labeling or named entity recognition include: Naive Bayes algorithm [5] used for spam emails [6] and Web document classification [7], and S upport Vector Machine (SVM) [8] used to categorize newswire documents, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) [9], Web documents [10], and Reuters-21578 collection [11]. Since there are various types of zones with IN, supervised learning algorithms are proper in this case. We, therefore, use SVM classifiers in t his work. This paper is organized as follows. The definitions are given in Section 2. The details of our method using SVM classifiers are presented in Section 3. Performance evaluation measures are shown in Section 4.

Incapability of present healthcare technology to detect oral cancer in budding stage manifests in high mortality rate. The paper contributes a step towards automation in non-invasive computer-aided oral cancer detection using an amalgamation of image processing and machine intelligence paradigms. Previous works have shown the discriminative difference of facial temperature distribution between a normal subject and a patient. The proposed work, for the first time, exploits this difference further by representing the facial Region of Interest(ROI) using multiscale rotation invariant Gabor filter bank responses followed by classification using Radial Basis Function(RBF) kernelized Support Vector Machine(SVM). The proposed study reveals an initial increase in classification accuracy with incrementing image scales followed by degradation of performance; an indication that addition of more and more finer scales tend to embed noisy information instead of discriminative texture patterns. Moreover, the performance is consistently better for filter responses from profile faces compared to frontal faces.This is primarily attributed to the ineptness of Gabor kernels to analyze low spatial frequency components over a small facial surface area. On our dataset comprising of 81 malignant, 59 pre-cancerous, and 63 normal subjects, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy of 85.16% for normal v/s precancerous and 84.72% for normal v/s malignant classification.

Packet classification plays an important role in the field of network security. Although several existing classification schemes have been proposed recently to improve classification performance, the performance of these schemes is unable to meet the high-speed packet classification requirement in ISGN. To tackle this problem, a hybrid packet classification algorithm based on hash table and geometric space partition (HGSP) is proposed in this paper. HGSP falls into two sections: geometric space partition and hash matching.

The molecular drivers of the drastic physiological changes that orchestrate and permit torpor are not well understood. Although transcription effectively ceases at the low body temperatures of torpor, previous work has demonstrated that some transcripts are protected from bulk degradation in brown adipose tissue (BAT), consistent with the importance of their protein products for metabolic heat generation during arousal from torpor. We examined the transcriptome of skeletal muscle, heart, and liver to determine the patterns of differentially expressed genes in these tissues, and whether, like BAT, a subset of these were relatively increased during torpor. EDGE-tags were quantified from five distinct physiological states representing the seasonal and torpor-arousal cycles of 13-lined ground squirrels. Supervised clustering on relative transcript abundances with Random Forest separated the two states bracketing prolonged torpor, entrance into and aroused from torpor, in all three tissues. Independent analyses identified 3347, 6784, and 2433 differentially expressed transcripts among all sampling points in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver, respectively. There were few differentially expressed genes in common across all three tissues; these were enriched in mitochondrial and apoptotic pathway components. Divisive clustering of these data revealed unique cohorts of transcripts that increased across the torpor bout in each tissue with patterns reflecting various combinations of cycling within and between seasons as well as between torpor and arousal. Transcripts that increased across the torpor bout were likewise tissue specific. These data shed new light on the biochemical pathways that alter in concert with hibernation phenotype and provide a rich resource for further hypothesis-based studies.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28332019", "doi": "10.1007/s00360-017-1073-x", "venue": "Journal of Comparative Physiology B", "journal": "Journal of Comparative Physiology B", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2601828575", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["9374154", "1691981", "9118390", "215092899", "27082831", "1597615", "6320999", "10418677", "19684075", "33565625", "209600816", "7020522", "15117845", "16505034", "7711058", "14691465", "23758717", "11363697", "25121502", "215185052", "5057", "9560680", "1481014", "196681123", "16726011", "9192047", "82470791", "23369575", "8913874", "28732004", "207659551", "16363666", "18167633", "6087462"], "inbound_citations": ["209420496", "51930148", "215474828", "89699608"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4581615"}

Unlike the traditional models synthesizing sketches based on a dictionary of exemplars, we develop a fully convolutional network to learn the end-to-end photo-sketch mapping. Our approach takes whole face photos as inputs and directly generates the corresponding sketch images with efficient inference and learning, in which the architecture is stacked by only convolutional kernels of very small sizes. To well capture the person identity during the photo-sketch transformation, we define our optimization objective in the form of joint generative discriminative minimization. In particular, a discriminative regularization term is incorporated into the photo-sketch generation, enhancing the discriminability of the generated person sketches against other individuals.

In this context, forest/non-forest classification and estimation of forest above ground biomass over tropical regions are very important and relevant in understanding the contribution of tropical forests in global biogeochemical cycles, especially in terms of carbon pools and fluxes. Information on the spatio-temporal biomass distribution acts as a key input to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation Plus (REDD+) action plans. This necessitates precise and reliable methods to estimate forest biomass and to reduce uncertainties in existing biomass quantification scenarios. The use of backscatter information from a host of allweather capable Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems during the recent past has demonstrated the potential of SAR data in forest above ground biomass estimation and forest / nonforest classification. In the present study, Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) / Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data along with field inventory data have been used in forest above ground biomass estimation and forest / non-forest classification over Odisha state, India. The ALOSPALSAR 50 m spatial resolution orthorectified and radiometrically corrected HH/HV dual polarization data (digital numbers) for the year 2010 were converted to backscattering coefficient images (Schimada et al., 2009). The tree level measurements collected during field inventory (2009\u2013'10) on Girth at Breast Height (GBH at 1.3 m above ground) and height of all individual trees at plot (plot size 0.1 ha) level were converted to biomass density using species specific allometric equations and wood densities. The field inventory based biomass estimations were empirically integrated with ALOS-PALSAR backscatter coefficients to derive spatial forest above ground biomass estimates for the study area. Further, The Support Vector Machines (SVM) based Radial Basis Function classification technique was employed to carry out binary (forest-non forest) classification using ALOSPALSAR HH and HV backscatter coefficient images and field inventory data. The textural Haralick\u2019s Grey Level Cooccurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture measures are determined on HV backscatter image for Odisha, for the year 2010. PALSAR HH, HV backscatter coefficient images, their difference (HHHV) and HV backscatter coefficient based eight textural parameters (Mean, Variance, Dissimilarity, Contrast, Angular second moment, Homogeneity, Correlation and Contrast) are used as input parameters for Support Vector Machines (SVM) tool. Ground based inputs for forest / non-forest were taken from field inventory data and high resolution Google maps. Results suggested significant relationship between HV backscatter coefficient and field based biomass (R2 = 0.508, p = 0.55) compared to HH with biomass values ranging from 5 to 365 t/ha. The spatial variability of biomass with reference to different forest types is in good agreement. The forest / nonforest classified map suggested a total forest cover of 50214 km2 with an overall accuracy of 92.54 %. The forest / non-forest information derived from the present study showed a good spatial agreement with the standard forest cover map of Forest Survey of India (FSI) and corresponding published area of 50575 km2.

Each problem can be expressed as a Linear Program (LP) and is computationally challenging when the number of features and/or samples is large -- the current state of algorithms for these problems is rather nascent when compared to the usual L2-regularized linear SVM. To this end, we propose new computational algorithms for these LPs by bringing together techniques from (a) classical column (and constraint) generation methods and (b) first order methods for non-smooth convex optimization - techniques that are rarely used together for solving large scale LPs. These components have their respective strengths; and while they are found to be useful as separate entities, they have not been used together in the context of solving large scale LPs such as the ones studied herein. Our approach complements the strengths of (a) and (b) --- leading to a scheme that seems to outperform commercial solvers as well as specialized implementations for these problems by orders of magnitude.

The method can be described as three steps: feature selection, training of Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifier and performance evaluation. Firstly, a feature vector to represent the discriminabilty of an object is described. From the profile of object, the ratio of width to height and trisection ratio of width to height are firstly adopted as the distinct feature. Moreover, we use external rectangle to approximate the object mask, which leads to a feature of rectangle degree standing for the ratio between the area of object to the area of external rectangle. To cope with the invariance to scale, rotation and so on, Hu moment invariants, Fourier descriptor and dispersedness were extracted as another kind of features. Secondly, a multi-class classifier were designed based on two-class SVM. The idea behind the classifier structure is that the multi-class classification can be converted to the combination of two-class classification. For our case, the final classification is the vote result of six two-class classifier. Thirdly, we determine the precise feature selection by experiments. According to the classification result, we select different features for each two-class classifier. The true positive rate, false positive rate and discriminative index are taken to evaluate the performance of the classifier.

The first classification method used for the classification of the internet traffic was the classification for the use of port numbers. This classification method has already lost its validity although it was an effective and quick method of classification for the first usage times of the internet. Another classification method used for the classification of network traffic is called as load-based classification or deep packet analysis. This approach is based on the principle of classification by identifying signatures on packets flowing on the network.

Transfer learning is an approach in which previously learned knowledge is utilised to model a new but related setting. For instance, it can reuse existing knowledge to recognise activities performed by different types of users, using different sensor technologies and in different environmental conditions.

Random forest classification offers several advantages over traditional land cover classification techniques, including a bootstrapping technique to generate robust estimations of outliers in the training data, as well as the capability of measuring classification confidence. Though the random forest classifier can generate complex decision trees with a multitude of input data and still not run a high risk of over fitting, there is a great need to reduce computational and operational costs by including only key input data sets without sacrificing a significant level of accuracy. Our main questions for this study site in Northern Minnesota were: (1) how does classification accuracy and confidence of mapping wetlands compare using different remote sensing platforms and sets of input data; (2) what are the key input variables for accurate differentiation of upland, water, and wetlands, including wetland type; and (3) which datasets and seasonal imagery yield the best accuracy for wetland classification. Our results show the key input variables include terrain (elevation and curvature) and soils descriptors (hydric), along with an assortment of remotely sensed data collected in the spring (satellite visible, near infrared, and thermal bands; satellite normalized vegetation index and Tasseled Cap greenness and wetness; and horizontal-horizontal (HH) and horizontal-vertical (HV) polarization using L-band satellite radar).

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can analyze meteorological information to support decision-making outdoor activities. And the algorithm is based on the data mining.

Materials and Methods: We propose a distant supervision paradigm empowered by deep representation for extracting information from clinical text. In this paradigm, the rule-based NLP algorithms are utilized to generate weak labels and create large training datasets automatically. Additionally, we use pre-trained word embeddings as deep representation to eliminate the need of task-specific feature engineering for machine learning. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm on two clinical information extraction tasks: smoking status extraction and proximal femur (hip) fracture extraction. We tested three prevalent machine learning models, namely, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forrest (RF). Results: The results indicate that CNN is the best fit to the proposed distant supervision paradigm. It outperforms the rule-based NLP algorithms given large datasets by capturing additional extraction patterns. We also verified the advantage of word embedding feature representation in the paradigm over term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and topic modeling representations. Discussion: In the clinical domain, the limited amount of labeled data is always a bottleneck for applying machine learning. Additionally, the performance of machine learning approaches highly depends on task-specific feature engineering. The proposed paradigm could alleviate those problems by leveraging rule-based NLP algorithms to automatically assign weak labels and eliminating the need of task-specific feature engineering using word embedding feature representation.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1804.07814", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2798387376", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18207257", "908193", "16806546", "15375922", "207044992", "38036651", "215222925", "215080184", "44154517", "2274059", "18666405", "1064865", "3589505", "17721300", "7307994", "3632923", "205712211", "12259145", "22731874", "28104656", "13081336", "3666085", "10910955", "16483125", "207226212", "3074096", "6527365", "17102024", "3772100", "4756413", "36878254", "24844912", "4046211", "78535356", "3327513", "7933962", "205615909", "17633683", "43637778", "1093327", "3928406", "25747381", "3557529", "14021373", "52874011", "89141", "14542261", "3610459", "214895855", "214892587", "8064974", "36303609", "13657721", "6340813", "62351595", "15112547", "3177797", "10888588", "784094", "4641273", "3511978", "4355788", "9829828", "14141965"], "inbound_citations": ["211003588"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5041023"}

The key challenge in CBIR systems for MR images is the semantic gap between the low-level visual information captured by the MRI machine and the high-level information perceived by the human evaluator. The traditional feature extraction methods focus only on low-level or high-level features and use some handcrafted features to reduce this gap. It is necessary to design a feature extraction framework to reduce this gap without using handcrafted features by encoding/combining low-level and high-level features. Deep learning is very powerful for feature representation that can depict low-level and high-level information completely and embed the phase of feature extraction in self-learning. Therefore, we propose a deep convolutional neural network VGG19-based novel feature extraction framework and apply closed-form metric learning to measure the similarity between the query image and database images. Furthermore, we adopt transfer learning and propose a block-wise fine-tuning strategy to enhance the retrieval performance.

This paper makes four critical contributions: (1) with nearly 80% fewer financial ratios by the PCA method, the prediction performance is still able to provide highly-accurate forecasts of financial bankruptcy; (2) we show that traditional statistical methods are better able to handle large datasets without sacrificing prediction performance, while intelligent techniques achieve better performance with smaller datasets and would be adversely affected by huge datasets; (3) empirical results show that C5.0 and CART provide the best prediction performance for imminent bankruptcies; and (4) Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with evolutionary computation provide a good balance of high-accuracy short- and long-term performance predictions for healthy and distressed firms.

One can see robot in industries, offices and even in homes. The more robots are in contact with people, the more requests of new capabilities and new features increase, in order to make robots able to act in case of need, help humans or be a companion. Therefore, it becomes essential to have a quick and easy way to teach new skills to robots. That is the aim of Robot Learning from Demonstration. This paradigm allows to directly program new tasks in a robot through demonstrations. ::: ::: This thesis proposes a novel approach to Robot Learning from Demonstration able to learn new skills from natural demonstrations carried out from naive users. To this aim, we introduce a novel Robot Learning from Demonstration framework by proposing novel approaches in all functional sub-units: from data acquisition to motion elaboration, from information modeling to robot control. ::: ::: A novel method is explained to extract 3D motion flow information from both RGB and depth data acquired by using recently introduced consumer RGB-D cameras. ::: The motion data are computed over the time to recognize and classify human actions. ::: ::: In this thesis, we describe new techniques to remap human motion to robotic joints. Our methods allow people to natural interact with robots by re-targeting the whole body movements in an intuitive way. We develop algorithm for both humanoids and manipulators motion and test them in different situations. ::: ::: Finally, we improve modeling techniques by using a probabilistic method: the Donut Mixture Model. This model is able to manage several interpretations that different people can produce performing a task. The estimated model can also be updated directly by using new attempts carried out by the robot. This feature is very important to rapidly obtain correct robot trajectories by means of few human demonstrations. ::: ::: A further contribution of this thesis is the creation of a number of new virtual models for the different robots we used to test our algorithms. All the developed models are compliant with ROS, so they can be used to foster research in the field from all the community of this very diffuse robotics framework. Moreover, a new 3D dataset is collected to compare different action recognition algorithms.

The experimental results show that the generalized logistic regression analysis (GLRA), support vector machine (SVM), and Bagging ensemble algorithm input with the ICPR features can provide better classification results than the same classifiers with the MKLD selected features. The SVM is much better at distinguishing normal vocal patterns with a specificity of 0.8542.

The traditional endpoint detection technique uses a few manually selected wavelengths, which are adequate for large open areas. As the integrated circuit devices continue to shrink in geometry and increase in device density, detecting the endpoint for small open areas presents a serious challenge to process engineers. In this work, a high-resolution optical emission spectroscopy (OES) sensor is used to provide the necessary sensitivity for detecting subtle endpoint signal. Partial Least Squares (PLS) method is used to analyze the OES data which reduces dimension of the data and increases gap between classes. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed to detect endpoint using the data after PLS. SVM classifies normal etching state and after endpoint state. Two data sets from OES are used in training PLS and SVM. The other data sets are used to test the performance of the model.

Monitoring and controlling this process would pose great impact on the implantation of automatic sugar production. It has been well known that the mother liquor purity in the cane sugar crystallization determines the forming speed of sugar crystals and the mother liquor supersaturation. The lower mother liquor purity can enhance the formation of crystals. Generally, it needs to go through chemical laboratory analysis of mother liquor sample to obtain its purity because there is no instrument that can directly measure the purity. Aimed to tackle this issue, in this paper, a novel soft sensor approach based on extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed to estimate the mother liquor purity parameter in sugar crystallization process. Also, the selection of the cost parameter and kernel parameter of ELM with Gaussian kernel is optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is feasible to predict the sugar mother liquor purity accurately in sugar crystallization process. Compared with other model building method like BP, RBF, SVM, LS-SVM and Primal ELM, the proposed model can perform higher prediction accuracy and faster building capacity.

Prediction of Rs has drawn increasing attention in the recent years. However, due to the dynamic nature of atmosphere, accurate estimation of Rs from routinely measured meteorological variables is a challenging task. Studies have demonstrated that machine-learning approaches outperformed traditional statistical methods. This paper presents an application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for monthly mean daily Rs estimates using measured maximum, minimum, and mean air temperatures (Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean, respectively). Twenty-four stations covering different climatic regions\u2014cold (C), severe cold (SC), mild (M), hot summer and cold winter within the Yangtze River Plain (HSCW-A), and hot summer and cold winter within the Sichuan Basin (HSCW-B)\u2014across China were gathered and analysed. Five SVM models with different input attributes were created. These models were also compared with two empirical temperature-based methods. Root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), and coefficient of residual mass (CRM) were employed to compare the performances of different methods. The newly developed model, SVM using Tmax-Tmin, and Tmean, outperformed other models with an averaged RMSE of 1.637 MJ m\u22122 and NSE of 0.813. On a regional scale, when Rs was estimated using the parameters developed at other sites, estimation of Rs within HSCW-B and SC regions were more reliable than in other zones. Especially in HSCW-B region, estimates of Rs using the parameters developed at Zunyi gave better performance (RMSE = 1.117 MJ m\u22122, NSE = 0.922) than that using the parameters obtained from their own data (RMSE = 1.309 MJ m\u22122, NSE = 0.894). The results showed that the SVM methodology may be a promising alternative to the traditional approach for predicting solar radiation at any locations where the records of air temperatures are available.

Among these devices, the radar is essential equipment in this process because it has a wide observation area and fine resolution in both the time and the space domains. However, the radar can also observe unwanted nonweather phenomena. Anomalous propagation echo is one of the representative nonprecipitation echoes generated by an abnormal refraction phenomenon of a radar beam. Abnormal refraction occurs when the temperature and the humidity change dramatically. In such a case, the radar recognizes either the ground or the sea surface as an atmospheric object. This false observation decreases the accuracy of both quantitative precipitation estimation and weather forecasting. Therefore, a system that can automatically recognize an anomalous propagation echo from the radar data needs to be developed. In this paper, we propose a classification method for separating anomalous propagation echoes from the rest of the weather data by using a combination of a support vector machine classifier and the synthetic minority oversampling technique, to solve the problem of imbalanced data.

The proposed approach considers the combined use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models and Bayesian restoration, in the problem of MR image mining from sparsely sampled k-space, following several different sampling schemes, including spiral and radial. Effective solutions to this problem are indispensable especially when dealing with MRI of dynamic phenomena since then, rapid sampling in k-space is required. The goal in such a case is to make measurement time smaller by reducing scanning trajectories as much as possible. In this way, however, underdetermined equations are introduced and poor image extraction follows. It is suggested here that significant improvements could be achieved, concerning quality of the extracted image, by judiciously applying SVM and Bayesian estimation methods to the k-space data. More specifically, it is demonstrated that SVM neural network techniques could construct efficient priors and introduce them in the procedure of Bayesian restoration. These Priors are independent of specific image properties and probability distributions. They are based on training SVM neural filters to estimate the missing samples of complex k-space and thus, to improve k-space information capacity. Such a neural filter based prior is integrated to the maximum likelihood procedure involved in the Bayesian reconstruction. It is found that the proposed methodology leads to enhanced image extraction results favorably compared to the ones obtained by the traditional Bayesian MRI reconstruction approach as well as by the pure Neural Network (NN) filter based reconstruction approach.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/11510888_32", "venue": "MLDM", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2123967915,2885851447", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["28999036", "1050994", "60577818"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18658556"}

Transportation analysis and prediction play an important part in mobility research and development. Recent years have seen many new types of transportation data emerging, such as social media and GPS data. This data contains hidden knowledge and it can be used in many applications to improve city operations. Road traffic prediction is one aspect of smart city operations. Researchers have traditionally used single statistical traffic flow prediction methods that work well only under specific conditions. Recently, machine learning methods have been used for prediction. Some works have emerged in recent years on combining these methods into various hybrid methods. However, these works are in their infancy and require further investigations. More importantly, these hybrid methods have mostly been developed on standalone machines, limiting the data and problem sizes that can be addressed, as well as the accuracy that can be achieved. The aim of this research is to improve GPS-data based road traffic analysis and prediction methods using big data technologies. Specifically, we propose and implement a hybrid model for road traffic prediction on Spark, a distributed big data computing platform. The hybrid model is based on ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) and SVR (Support Vector Regression) methods. The performance of our hybrid model is compared to the individual ARIMA and SVR models, and improvements in the prediction accuracies have been achieved. Furthermore, we give a review of the traffic flow prediction and modeling methods and discuss the limitations of each method. A review of the various types of transportation traffic data sources is provided. Notable big data analysis tools including the Apache Spark platform are described. A tutorial for hybrid prediction methods is provided.

In this study Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for crop classification in irrigated landscapes at the object-level. Input to the classifications is 71 multi-seasonal spectral and geostatistical features computed from RapidEye time series. The random forest (RF) feature importance score was used to select a subset of features that achieved optimal accuracies. The relationship between the hard result accuracy and the soft output from the SVM is investigated by employing two measures of uncertainty, the maximum a posteriori probability and the alpha quadratic entropy. Specifically the effect of feature selection on map uncertainty is investigated by looking at the soft outputs of the SVM, in addition to classical accuracy metrics. Overall the SVMs applied to the reduced feature subspaces that were composed of the most informative multi-seasonal features led to a clear increase in classification accuracy up to 4.3%, and to a significant decline in thematic uncertainty. SVM was shown to be affected by feature space size and could benefit from RF-based feature selection.

Before the education students took a questionnaire with different subscales to determine the level of readiness for learning. And after the education they took a test on operating the lathe machine to measure the success of the education. Then the students were asked to design a project. This education is a comprehensive one and it is not always possible to make all students use the lathe machine since there can be some issues on safety, time management and waste of products. So with this study it is intended to determine the effect of readiness for learning and academic success on the students and give this education accordingly. A dichotomous classification problem is constructed with the subscales of readiness for learning questionnaire and academic success as features and lathe test result as class labels. Consequently, a model that can determine whether a student would be successful in learning to operate the lathe machine with the subscales of the readiness for learning questionnaire (motivation, health \u2013 nutrition, learning, planned working, efficient reading, writing, listening, note taking, attending a course, preparation and attending an exam) and GPA is constructed with Support Vector Machines and leave-one-out cross validation.

As more data is produced there is an increasing need to integrate diverse datasets and better analyse underutilised data to gain biological insights. However, analysis of single cell RNA-seq data is challenging due to biological and technical noise which not only varies between laboratories but also between batches. Here for the first time, we apply a new generative deep learning approach called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to biological data. We apply GANs to epidermal, neural and hematopoietic scRNA-seq data spanning different labs and experimental protocols. We show that it is possible to integrate diverse scRNA-seq datasets and in doing so, our generative model is able to simulate realistic scRNA-seq data that covers the full diversity of cell types. In contrast to many machine-learning approaches, we are able to interpret internal parameters in a biologically meaningful manner. Using our generative model we are able to obtain a universal representation of epidermal differentiation and use this to predict the effect of cell state perturbations on gene expression at high time-resolution.

However, current studies have focused on elections within English-speaking regions, and hence the resultant election content classifiers are only applicable for elections in countries where the predominant language is English. On the other hand, as social media is becoming more prevalent worldwide, there is an increasing need for election classifiers that can be generalised across different languages, without building a training dataset for each election. In this paper, based upon transfer learning, we study the development of effective and reusable election classifiers for use on social media across multiple languages. We combine transfer learning with different classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which make use of word embedding representations for each social media post. We generalise the learned classifier models for cross-language classification by using a linear translation approach to map the word embedding vectors from one language into another.

Another extracts credibility features (henceforth, private features) from multiple types of credibility information and compares with the common features through two strategies, i.e., orthogonality constraints and KL-divergence for making the private features more differential.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibilities of using electroencephalography (EEG) signal to classify imaginary lower limb stepping movements and to design a robust motor imagery classifier based on support vector machine (SVM). A cue-based experimental paradigm is designed to record nine-channel EEG associated with imaginary left leg stepping (L-stepping) and right leg stepping (R-stepping) movements from eight healthy subjects. Features including band powers (BPs), common spatial pattern (CSP), and a filter-bank CSP (FB-CSP) were extracted from the recorded EEG. Fuzzy SVM (FSVM) is introduced to this study to classify L-stepping and R-stepping imageries. We propose a novel kernel-induced membership function to address the issue of data relative importance assignment. The FSVM with the membership function suggested in the original work of FSVM (Type-I FSVM) and the FSVM with the one we proposed (Type-II FSVM) is compared. Results indicated that the classification accuracies based on BP features are near the chance level (~50 %). Both alpha-band CSP (71.25 %) and FB-CSP (75.63 %) gave acceptable results as a simple k-NN classifier is performed. Results show that both types of FSVM performed better than the conventional SVM. Also, Type-II FSVM outperforms Type-I FSVM, especially when the alpha-CSP feature is employed, where the improvement in error reduction rate is over 15 %. The highest average L-stepping versus R-stepping classification accuracy over the eight subjects is achieved (86.25 % in single-trial analysis) by FB-CSP and FSVM-II.

Its underlying principle assumes that the more important a feature is, the more the weights, connected to the respective input neuron, will change during the training of the model. To capture this behavior, a running variance of every weight connected to the input layer is measured during training. For that, an adaptation of Welford\u2019s online algorithm for computing the online variance is proposed. When the training is finished, for each input, the variances of the weights are combined with the final weights to obtain the measure of relative importance for each feature. This method was tested with shallow and deep neural network architectures on several well-known classification and regression problems. The results obtained confirm that this approach is making meaningful measurements.

In our work, we aim to accurately classify unlabeled weblogs into commonly agreed upon newspaper categories using labeled data from the news domain. The labeled news and the unlabeled blog corpus are highly dynamic and hourly growing with a topic drift, so the classification needs to be efficient.

Conventional single incremental decremental SVM can update the trained model efficiently when single data point is added to or removed from the training set.

The proposed algorithm is computationally more efficient when multiple data points are added and/or removed simultaneously. The single incremental decremental algorithm is built on an optimization technique called parametric programming.

We hypothesize that the reduction of the noise level at each isolated PPT, using signal processing techniques, will allow us to estimate short-term HRT indexes. Accordingly, its application could be extended to patients with reduced number of available PPT. In this paper, several HRT denoising procedures are proposed and tested, with special attention to support vector machine (SVM) estimation, as this is a robust algorithm that allows us to deal with few available time samples in the PPT. Pacing-stimulated HRT during electrophysiological study are used as a low-noise gold standard.

However, gradient descent method usually leads to the slow learning even for simple problems. On the other hand, Resilient Back-propagation (R-prop) performs a direct adaptation for the step size of the weight update based on local gradient information. The principal idea of R-prop is that the signs of two consecutive partial derivatives are used to determine how connection weights are updated. When the signs of two consecutive partial derivatives coincide with each other, the update-value is increased in order to accelerate the learning in the shallow regions. In contrast, when the signs of two consecutive partial derivatives are changed, the update value is decreased by a decrease value. By conducting these procedures, the number of learning steps is significantly reduced compared to the original gradient descent method. Considering the advantages of R-prop, we propose a fast incremental learning algorithm for feed-forward neural network where the gradient descent method in RAN-LTM is accelerated based on R-prop. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated for several data sets and the results demonstrated that learning time of the extended version of RAN-LTM is greatly reduced compared to the original RAN-LTM.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5047/gseku.e.2014.002", "venue": "MEMOIRS OF THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS OF ENGINEERING AND SYSTEM INFORMATICS KOBE UNIVERSITY", "journal": "MEMOIRS OF THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS OF ENGINEERING AND SYSTEM INFORMATICS KOBE UNIVERSITY", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2161474904", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14522914", "60580751", "43783653", "14614192", "40661420", "492233", "9136731", "14257024", "60609513", "14892653", "16523475", "16848428", "16978482", "59784570", "59849738"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18405747"}

In such mobile sensing applications, the position/placement of the phone relative to the user body provides valuable context information. For example, in physical activity recognition using motion sensors, the position of the phone provides important information, since the sensors generate different signals when the phone is carried in different positions and this makes it difficult to successfully identify the activities with sensor data coming from different positions. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to successfully identify phone positions using only accelerometer data which is the most commonly used sensor on physical activity recognition studies, rather than using additional sensors. Additionally, we explore how much this position information increases the activity recognition accuracy compared with position independent activity recognition. For this purpose, we collected activity data from 15 participants carrying three phones in different positions, performing activities of walking, running, sitting, standing, climbing up/down stairs, transportation with a bus, making a phone call, interacting with an application on the smart phone, sending an SMS. The collected data is processed with the Random Forest classifier. According to the results of position recognition, using basic accelerometer features which are also used in the activity recognition, can achieve an accuracy of 77.34%, however, this ratio increases to 85% when basic features are combined with angular features calculated from the orientation of the phone. According to the results of the activity recognition experiments, on average the results are similar for position specific and position independent recognition.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based generative adversarial model, RefineGAN, for fast and accurate CS-MRI reconstruction. The proposed model is a variant of fully-residual convolutional autoencoder and generative adversarial networks (GANs), specifically designed for CS-MRI formulation; it employs deeper generator and discriminator networks with cyclic data consistency loss for faithful interpolation in the given under-sampled -space data. In addition, our solution leverages a chained network to further enhance the reconstruction quality. RefineGAN is fast and accurate-the reconstruction process is extremely rapid, as low as tens of milliseconds for reconstruction of a image, because it is one-way deployment on a feed-forward network, and the image quality is superior even for extremely low sampling rate (as low as 10%) due to the data-driven nature of the method.

Given heterogeneous geographic data with class ambiguity, the spatial ensemble learning (SEL) problem aims to find a decomposition of the geographic area into disjoint zones such that class ambiguity is minimized and a local classifier can be learned in each zone. SEL problem is important for applications such as land cover mapping from heterogeneous earth observation data with spectral confusion. However, the problem is challenging due to its high computational cost (finding an optimal zone partition is NP-hard). Related work in ensemble learning either assumes an identical sample distribution (e.g., bagging, boosting, random forest) or decomposes multi-modular input data in the feature vector space (e.g., mixture of experts, multimodal ensemble), and thus cannot effectively minimize class ambiguity. In contrast, our spatial ensemble framework explicitly partitions input data in geographic space. Our approach first preprocesses data into homogeneous spatial patches and uses a greedy heuristic to allocate pairs of patches with high class ambiguity into different zones.

Large pharmacogenomic data sets, such as those by Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) consortium, were introduced to discover more of these single-gene markers of drug sensitivity. Very recently, machine learning regression has been used to investigate how well cancer cell line sensitivity to drugs is predicted depending on the type of molecular profile. The latter has revealed that gene expression data is the most predictive profile in the pan-cancer setting. However, no study to date has exploited GDSC data to systematically compare the performance of machine learning models based on multi-gene expression data against that of widely-used single-gene markers based on genomics data. Methods: Here we present this systematic comparison using Random Forest (RF) classifiers exploiting the expression levels of 13,321 genes and an average of 501 tested cell lines per drug. To account for time-dependent batch effects in IC 50 measurements, we employ independent test sets generated with more recent GDSC data than that used to train the predictors and show that this is a more realistic validation than standard k-fold cross-validation. Results and Discussion: Across 127 GDSC drugs, our results show that the single-gene markers unveiled by the MANOVA analysis tend to achieve higher precision than these RF-based multi-gene models, at the cost of generally having a poor recall (i.e. correctly detecting only a small part of the cell lines sensitive to the drug). Regarding overall classification performance, about two thirds of the drugs are better predicted by the multi-gene RF classifiers. Among the drugs with the most predictive of these models, we found pyrimethamine, sunitinib and 17-AAG. Conclusions: Thanks to this unbiased validation, we now know that this type of models can predict in vitro tumour response to some of these drugs. These models can thus be further investigated on in vivo tumour models.

The architecture of the system is described and particular attention is paid to the interactions between the language understanding and plan reasoning components. We examine how these two tasks constrain and inform each other in an integrated nl-based system. 1 The TRAINS Project The TRAINS project is a long-term research project to develop an intelligent planning assistant that is conversationally proficient in natural language[Allen and Schubert, 1991]. The TRAINS system helps a user construct and monitor plans about a railroad freight system. The user is responsible for assigning cargo to trains and scheduling shipments, scheduling various simple manufacturing tasks, and for revising the original plans when unexpected situations arise during plan execution. Figure 1 shows a typical initial scenario. The system aids the user in all aspects of this task by interacting in natural language. In particular, the system typically will perform the following tasks: Evaluating courses of action, calculating expected completion times, detecting conflicts, and so on; Filling in details of the proposed plan that do not require the user\u2019s attention; Suggesting ways to solve particular subproblems as they arise; Presenting and describing the current state of the world and how the proposed plan may affect it; This material is based upon work supported by ONR/DARPA under grant number N00014-92-J-1512, the US Air Force under Rome Laboratory researchcontract number F30602-91-C-0010, and ONR under research grant number N00014-90-J-1811 yftraum, james, ferguson, heeman, hwang, martin, schubertg@cs.rochester.edu University of Rochester; Rochester, NY, 14627-0226. zkato@nttnly.ntt.jp NTT Network Information Systems Labs; 1-2356 Take, yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa 238-03 JAPAN. xpoesio@cogsci.ed.ac.uk University of Edinburgh, Centre for Cognitive Science, Edinburgh, EH8 9LW, Scotland, UK.

While we aim to produce a functioning system, the system itself is not really the goal of the effort. Rather, the domain is a tool for forcing our research to address the problems that arise in building a complete dialogue system. For instance, the dialogue module must be able to handle a wide range of everyday discourse phenomena rather than handling a few selected problems of theoretical interest. While this approach focuses our research directions, the solutions that we seek are general solutions to the phenomena rather than specific solutions that happen to work in the TRAINS domain. The TRAINS project currently has several main foci of research: Parsing and semantically interpreting utterances as they arise in spoken language, including sentence fragments, repairs and corrections; Accounting for the discourse behavior present in natural dialogue; Representing the reasoning and control of the discourse agent, including reasoning about plans in the TRAINS domain as well as the plans that drive the system\u2019s behavior in the dialogue itself; and Providing the knowledge representation and reasoning tools that are needed for planning and scheduling in realistic size domains, including reasoning about time, events, actions and plans. Four prototypes of the TRAINS system have been developed, one per year starting in 1990. We feel that most of the issues to be discussed at this symposium were raised at one point or the other during our work of developing and refining the TRAINS system. In the final analysis, we can say the system \u201cunderstands\u201d NL input from the user if it executes the plan as the user expects.1 More locally, the system can Actually, this condition is too strong, as a user might fail to convey expectations properly, so a more realistic objective might be to execute a plan according to expectations of an observer of the", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1552208414", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["2806625", "10601464"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60891250"}

This hyper-parameter estimation with respect to the aforementioned performance measures is often called the model selection problem in the SVM research community. In this paper we propose a strategy to select optimal SVM models in a dynamic fashion in order to attend that when knowledge about the environment is updated with new observations and previously parameterized models need to be re-evaluated, and in some cases discarded in favour of revised models. This strategy combines the power of the swarm intelligence theory with the conventional grid-search method in order to progressively identify and sort out potential solutions using dynamically updated training datasets.

Current frameworks for training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), learn to disentangle the representations of the data in an unsupervised fashion and capture the most significant factors of the data variations. However, these approaches ignore the principle of content and style disentanglement in image generation, which means their learned latent code may alter the content and style of the generated images at the same time. This paper describes the Style and Content Disentangled GAN (SC-GAN), a new unsupervised algorithm for training GANs that learns disentangled style and content representations of the data. We assume that the representation of an image can be decomposed into a content code that represents the geometrical information of the data, and a style code that captures textural properties. Consequently, by fixing the style portion of the latent representation, we can generate diverse images in a particular style. Reversely, we can set the content code and generate a specific scene in a variety of styles. The proposed SC-GAN has two components: a content code which is the input to the generator, and a style code which modifies the scene style through modification of the Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) layers' parameters.

Next, for each pair of character, we encode their relative spatial organization using their distance and angular position with respect to the centre of the seal, and enter this code into a hash table. Given an input seal, we recognize the individual text characters and compute the code for pair-wise character based on the relative spatial organization. The code obtained from the input seal helps to retrieve model hypothesis from the hash table. The seal model to which we get maximum hypothesis is selected for the recognition of the input seal.

Particle filters or sequential Monte Carlo methods use a set of weighted state samples, called particles, to approximate the posterior probability distribution in a Bayesian setup. During the past few years, Particle Filters have become very popular because of their ability to process observations represented by nonlinear state-space models where the noise of the model can be non-Gaussian. There are many Particle Filter methods, and almost all of them are based on three operations: particle propagation, weight computation, and resampling. One of the main limitations of the previously proposed schemes is that their implementation in a wireless sensor network demands prohibitive communication capability since they assume that all the sensor observations are available to every processing node in the weight update step. In this paper, we use a machine learning technique called support vector machine to overcome this drawback and improve the energy consumption of sensors. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a classifier which attempts to find a hyperplane that divides two classes with the largest margin. Given labeled training data, SVM outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples. The training examples that are closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors.

Biomarker discovery can be modelled as a feature selection problem that aims to find the most discriminating features (genes) for accurate disease classification e.g. healthy vs. diseased samples. Typical feature selection algorithms identify individual genes, and the disease discrimination power of each gene is considered separately. In this paper, we propose a gene selection method incorporating prior biological knowledge about gene pathways to find a group(s) of strongly correlated genes to accurately discriminate complex as well as simple diseases. The proposed method involves a ranking process to identify the most relevant biological pathways in a microarray dataset. A specified number of differentially- expressed genes from relevant pathways is then selected for accurate disease classification. The advantage of this method is that it searches for a group of strongly correlated genes rather than individual genes. We argue that selecting a group of informative and correlated genes from disease-associated pathways is particularly relevant to the disease type or grade. To evaluate the performance of our method, we compare it to five well-known feature selection and ranking methods using two classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Using publicly-available microarray datasets, we found that our algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of disease classification accuracy.

One-to-one methods take as input a single source contrast, and they learn a latent representation sensitive to unique features of the source. Meanwhile, many-to-one methods receive multiple distinct sources, and they learn a shared latent representation more sensitive to common features across sources.

This machine learning algorithm, called the Tensor Basis Random Forest (TBRF), is used to predict the Reynolds-stress anisotropy tensor, while guaranteeing Galilean invariance by making use of a tensor basis. By modifying a random forest algorithm to accept such a tensor basis, a robust, easy to implement, and easy to train algorithm is created. The individual decision trees within the random forest are based on randomized partitions of the training data, and are used as a robust outlier filter to prevent over-fitting, and to provide uncertainty estimates on the predictions. The algorithm is trained on several flow cases using DNS/LES data, and used to predict the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor for new, unseen flows. The resulting predictions of turbulence anisotropy are used as a turbulence model within a custom RANS solver. Stabilization of this solver is necessary, and is achieved by a continuation method and a modified k-equation.

Breath-print analysis was performed by using the Cyranose 320 electronic nose. Group data were evaluated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the test's diagnostic power by means of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The results indicated that the breath-print of patients with COPD is different from the one of healthy subjects explaining a variability of 93.8% with a correct prediction of 97.8% and correct classification of 100%,also positive and negative predictive value of 96.5 and 100% respectively. Furthermore, the breath-print of exhaled breath from patients with COPD-S and COPD-HAP does not present any difference. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The breath-print of exhaled breath from patients with COPD-S and COPD-HAP does not present any difference, which demonstrates that the breath-print is related to the disease and not to causality.

The detector is based on current blockade measurements through a single, nanometer-scale, D -hemolysin ion channel. The biologically based D -hemolysin channel self-assembles in lipid bilayers, permitting highly reproducible experiments with Angstrom resolution. In previous work 1-3 the spectrum of dsDNA blockade states could be explained in terms of the dsDNA-protein binding kinetics, and dsDNA terminus fraying (bond dissociation) kinetics. Results presented here strengthen the hypothesis that conforma tional dynamics can be observed as well, when the channel-captured dsDNA end is in an unbound state. Feature discovery methods: include a time-domain finite state automaton (FSA), a wavel et domain FSA, and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Classifier feature extraction methods: includes a time-domain FSA for signal acquis ition and a generalized HMM with EM for features extraction. Classification method: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used with novel kernel designs. Kinetic feature extraction tool : a time-domain FSA projects current observations to a (small) set of blockade states. Those states are provided by the generalized HMM analysis. Noise sources limit the resolution of the nanopore device, and its multiclass scaling capabilities, and this is discussed in the context of ongoing refinements to the device.

The main idea is to obtain a SVR based NARMA-L2 model of a nonlinear single input single output system (SISO) by decomposing a single SVR which estimates the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) model of the system.

The performance of the proposed SVR based NARMA-L2 controller has been evaluated by simulations carried out on a bioreactor system, and the results show that the SVR based NARMA-L2 model and controller attain good modelling and control performances.

The trackers based on tracking-by-detection framework rely on manual feature detectors for robust tracking, which is particularly useful for specific objects like humans but cannot handle generic tracking problems. Therefore, a sparse feature learning method beyond manual design is proposed to learn features from the samples sampled during tracking. The basic idea is to learn a dictionary from the samples in the previous frames and construct feature representations to represent the object for detection of the location in the current frame. The samples are patches centered at the keypoints based on an adaptive features from accelerated segment test (FAST) detector with local threshold. The dictionary is learned with sparse coding for sparse representations and atoms of the dictionary are grouped to describe the local orientation of these samples. The integrated features are built after rectification of the sparse representations. The correlation filter is used to infer the object location from the sparse features.

The output power of photovoltaic (PV) arrays will vary with external conditions, such as irradiance and temperature fluctuations.

The existing MPPT technology cannot either balance the tracking speed and tracking accuracy, or the implementation cost is too high due to the complexity of the calculation. In this paper, a new maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method was proposed. It improves the traditional perturb and observation (P&O) method by introducing the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm. In this method, the current maximum power point voltage is predicted by the trained model and compared with the current operating voltage to predict a reasonable step size. The boost DC/ DC (Direct current-Direct current converter) convert system applying the improved method and the traditional P&O was simulated in MATLAB-Simulink, respectively.

Because of the high error rate in spontaneous speech recognition, a combined acoustic model considering both syllable and subsyllable recognition units, is firstly used to determine the inter-syllable boundaries and output the recognition confidence of the input speech. Based on the finding that IPs always occur at inter-syllable boundaries, a probability distribution of the prosodic features at the current potential IP is estimated. The Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, which employs the clustered prosodic features of the current potential IP and its preceding and succeeding inter-syllable boundaries, is employed to output the IP likelihood measure. Finally, the confidence of the recognized speech, the probability distribution of the prosodic features and the CRF-based IP likelihood measure are integrated to determine the optimal IP sequence of the input spontaneous speech. In addition, pitch reset and lengthening are also applied to improve the IP detection performance. The Mandarin Conversional Dialogue Corpus is adopted for evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed IP detection approach obtains 10.56p and 6.5p more effective results than the hidden Markov model and the Maximum Entropy model respectively under the same experimental conditions.

A joint training of user-preference and visual encoding allows the network to efficiently integrate the visual preference with tagging behavior for a better user recommendation. In addition, we propose the use of adversarial learning, which enforces the network to predict tags resembling user-generated tags. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on two different large-scale and publicly available datasets, YFCC100M and NUS-WIDE. The proposed method achieves significantly better performance on both the datasets when compared to the baselines and other state-of-the-art methods.

The Hidden Markov Model has been introduced as a probabilistic or statistical framework for time-varying processes, whereas the Support Vector Machine algorithm is probably the most widely used kernel learning algorithm. Human activities are classified by using only one Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) worn on the chest. A feature set extracted from the raw sensor data is used in the classification process. Feature transformation, in respect of dimensional reduction is implemented with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) . A performance comparison of the classification models is provided in terms of their correct differentiation rates and confusion matrices, as well as their preprocessing and training requirements. 5-fold cross validation is employed to validate the classifiers. The results indicate that the HMM results in a higher classification accuracy of 91.4% compared to the SVM with an accuracy of 83.4%. The algorithm is capable of classifying time-varying motions from input data of an IMU worn during a surfing session.

This is a difficult problem, because of very small inter-class and large intra-class differences between fish motion patterns. Our approach consists of three steps. First, we apply our new fish detector to identify and localize fish occurrences in each frame, under partial occlusion, and amidst dynamic texture patterns formed by whirls of sand on the sea bed. Then, we conduct tracking-by-detection. Given the similarity between fish detections, defined in terms of fish appearance and motion properties, we formulate fish tracking as transitively linking similar detections between every two consecutive frames, so as to maintain their unique track IDs. Finally, we extract histograms of fish displacements along the estimated tracks. The histograms are classified by the Random Forest technique to recognize distinct classes of fish motion patterns.

Streamflow forecasting is a crucial component in the management and control of water resources. Decomposition-based approaches have particularly demonstrated improved streamflow forecasting performance. However, it is not practical to firstly decompose the entire streamflow into several signal components and then divide the data samples of each component into training and validation sets for signal component prediction. This impracticality is due to the fact that some validation information, that is not available in practical streamflow forecasting, is used in that training process. Unfortunately, firstly dividing the entire streamflow into training and validation sets and then decomposing each set separately lead to undesirable boundary effects and complicated forecasting. Moreover, establishing a model for each signal component is quite laborious and summing the component predictions may lead to error accumulation. In addition, summing the decomposition results may sometimes lead to inaccurate reconstruction of the original streamflow. In order to address these shortcomings of decomposition-based models and improve the forecasting performance in basins lacking meteorological observations (e.g., precipitation and temperature), we propose a two-stage decomposition prediction (TSDP) framework, realize this framework using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and support vector machines (SVR), and refer to this realization as VMD-SVR. In the first stage of the TSDP framework, the entire streamflow data was divided into training and validation sets, each of which was then separately decomposed to avoid the influence of validation information on training. In the second stage, a single model for streamflow prediction was established using a set of mixed shuffled samples. This scheme saves the modelling time and reduces the influence of the boundary effects. We demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness, efficiency and reliability of the TSDP framework and its VMD-SVR realization in terms of the boundary effect reduction, decomposition performance, prediction outcomes, time consumption, overfitting, and forecasting capability for long leading times. Specifically, five comparative experiments were conducted based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), singular spectrum analysis (SSA), discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and SVR. The experimental results on monthly runoff collected from three stations at the Wei River show the superiority of the TSDP framework compared to benchmark models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/hess-2019-565", "venue": null, "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2996516590", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["129607262", "132807308", "131121039", "129045299", "129725600", "129218538", "129007961", "16819328", "135380042", "128622471", "134297574", "73452950", "118121492", "123378298", "111254755", "153061232", "159125159", "129454904", "6662524", "129180882", "11688126", "125471377", "2089939", "129391869", "52485858", "128906704", "135459178", "140544628", "13156234", "134810387", "8966205", "62882372", "140164618", "52573976", "154146958", "134285941", "10659969", "134640631", "19006400", "146076738", "140709110", "44143995", "60510826", "129581657", "131864893", "133814196", "140613633", "129436009", "16907816", "19196574", "7138354", "67821165", "2435240", "207152935", "198425163", "135143899", "140601576", "85842165", "128524240", "154543361"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210145557"}

Finding efficient measurements for detecting fraudulent electricity consumption has been an active research area in recent years. This paper presents a new approach towards nontechnical loss (NTL) detection in power utilities using an artificial intelligence based technique, support vector machine (SVM). The main motivation of this study is to assist Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) Sdn. Bhd. in peninsular Malaysia to reduce its NTLs in the distribution sector due to abnormalities and fraud activities, i.e., electricity theft. The fraud detection model (FDM) developed in this research study preselects suspected customers to be inspected onsite fraud based on irregularities in consumption behavior. This approach provides a method of data mining, which involves feature extraction from historical customer consumption data. This SVM based approach uses customer load profile information and additional attributes to expose abnormal behavior that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities. The result yields customer classes which are used to shortlist potential suspects for onsite inspection based on significant behavior that emerges due to fraud activities. Model testing is performed using historical kWh consumption data for three towns within peninsular Malaysia. Feedback from TNB Distribution (TNBD) Sdn.

However, due to the lack of fixed reference areas of the inventory plots, these ACS-based field data are seldom used as training data for wall-to-wall mapping applications at forest enterprise level. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to overcome this shortcoming. For a study area in northern Bavaria, Germany, we used ACS-based NFI data for model training to generate wall-to-wall maps of growing stock for broadleaf, conifer and mixed forest stands. Both spectral and height information from the very high resolution WorldView-2 (WV2) satellite were used as auxiliary information and the non-parametric Random Forests (RF) algorithm was chosen as modeling approach. The growing stock predictions were validated using out-of-bag (OOB) samples and further verified at the plot and stand level using additional data. For validation, field plots from a Management Forest Inventory (MFI) and delineated forest stands were used. Compared to stand-level aggregations based on field plots from the MFI, our approach explained 56% of the variability in the growing stock ( R 2 ) with a relative RMSE of 15% at the stand level ( n = 252). As expected, the scatter was higher at the plot-level ( n = 3973).

It differs from Hastie's approach in that the tracked path is not assumed to be 1-D. Instead, a multidimensional feasible space for the optimality condition is used to solve the tracking problem. Such a treatment allows the algorithm to properly handle data sets which Hastie's approach fails. These data sets are characterized by the presence of linearly dependent points (in the kernel space), duplicate points, or nearly duplicate points. Such data sets are quite common among many real-world data, especially those with nominal features.

This paper proposes a new method to design a balanced classifier on imbalanced training data based on margin distribution theory. Recently, Large margin Distribution Machine (LDM) is put forward and it obtains superior classification performance compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and many state-of-the-art methods. However, one of the deficiencies of LDM is that it easily leads to the lower detection rate of the minority class than that of the majority class on imbalanced data which contradicts to the needs of high detection rate of the minority class in the real application. In this paper, Cost-Sensitive Large margin Distribution Machine (CS-LDM) is brought forward to improve the detection rate of the minority class by introducing cost-sensitive margin mean and cost-sensitive penalty. Theoretical and experimental results show that CS-LDM can gradually improve the detection rate of the minority class with the increasing of the cost parameter and obtain a balanced classifier when the cost parameter increases to a certain value. CS-LDM is superior to some popular cost-sensitive methods and can be used in many applications.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patrec.2016.06.009", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.

Since these contain multiple activities in unscripted sequence, temporal segmentation of multimodal datasets is an important precursor to recognition and analysis. Manual segmentation is prohibitively time consuming and unsupervised approaches for segmentation are unreliable since they fail to exploit the semantic context of the data. Gathering labels for supervised learning places a large workload on the human user since it is relatively easy to gather a mass of unlabeled data but expensive to annotate. This paper proposes an active learning approach for segmenting large motion capture datasets with both small training sets and working sets. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are learned using an active learning paradigm; after the classifiers are initialized with a small set of labeled data, the users are iteratively queried for labels as needed. We propose a novel method for initializing the classifiers, based on unsupervised segmentation and clustering of the dataset. By identifying and training the SVM with points from pure clusters, we can improve upon a random sampling strategy for creating the query set.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, joint graph learning and video segmentation (JGLVS)}, which learns the similarity graph and video segmentation simultaneously. JGLVS learns the similarity graph by assigning adaptive neighbors for each vertex based on multiple cues (appearance, motion, boundary and spatial information). Meanwhile, the new rank constraint is imposed to the Laplacian matrix of the similarity graph, such that the connected components in the resulted similarity graph are exactly equal to the number of segmentations. Furthermore, JGLVS can automatically weigh multiple cues and calibrate the pairwise distance of superpixels based on their topology structures.

The Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in land use regimes. In order to further characterize these shifts, we classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier, trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these systems since they largely affect the capacity of the forest to regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the 1984\u20132015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of cultivation cycles predicted by the method against in-situ information collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0.25. Overall the method performed well, producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the 90s and sub-object mixture of land uses.

The metapath2vec model formalizes meta-path-based random walks to construct the heterogeneous neighborhood of a node and then leverages a heterogeneous skip-gram model to perform node embeddings. The metapath2vec++ model further enables the simultaneous modeling of structural and semantic correlations in heterogeneous networks. Extensive experiments show that metapath2vec and metapath2vec++ are able to not only outperform state-of-the-art embedding models in various heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as node classification, clustering, and similarity search, but also discern the structural and semantic correlations between diverse network objects.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null,

Remote sensing applications that have profited from those techniques include translating images of different sensors, improving the image resolution and completing missing temporal or spatial data such as in cloudy optical images. In this context, this letter proposes a new deep-learning-based framework to synthesize missing or corrupted multispectral optical images using multimodal/multitemporal data. Specifically, we use conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to generate the missing optical image by exploiting the correspondent synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with a SAR-optical data from the same area at a different acquisition date. The proposed framework was evaluated in two land-cover applications over tropical regions, where cloud coverage is a major problem: crop recognition and wildfire detection. In both applications, our proposal was superior to alternative approaches tested in our experiments.

And then, the obtained feature subsets are fed into designed kernelized ELM (KELM) classifier to train an optimal predictor model whose parameters are adaptively specified by improving artificial bee colony (IABC) approach. Here, the proposed IABC method introduces an improved solution search equation to enhance the exploitation of searching for solutions, and provides a new framework to make the global converge rapidly. Finally, the enhanced-KELM (EKELM) model is applied to perform the thyroid disease diagnosis tasks using the most discriminative feature subset and the optimal parameters.

It is an undoubted fact that some years ago, textual information was spreading in manageable rates; however, nowadays, such information has overcome even the most ambiguous expectations and constantly grows within seconds. It is therefore quite complex to cope with the vast amount of textual data particularly if we also take the incremental production speed into account. Social media, e-commerce, news articles, comments and opinions are broadcasted on a daily basis. A rational solution, in order to handle the abundance of data, would be to build automated information processing systems, for analyzing and extracting meaningful patterns from text. The present paper focuses on sentiment analysis applied in Greek texts. Thus far, there is no wide availability of natural language processing tools for Modern Greek. Hence, a thorough analysis of Greek, from the lexical to the syntactical level, is difficult to perform. This paper attempts a different approach, based on the proven capabilities of gradient boosting, a well-known technique for dealing with high-dimensional data. The main rationale is that since English has dominated the area of preprocessing tools and there are also quite reliable translation services, we could exploit them to transform Greek tokens into English, thus assuring the precision of the translation, since the translation of large texts is not always reliable and meaningful. The new feature set of English tokens is augmented with the original set of Greek, consequently producing a high dimensional dataset that poses certain difficulties for any traditional classifier. Accordingly, we apply gradient boosting machines, an ensemble algorithm that can learn with different loss functions providing the ability to work efficiently with high dimensional data. Moreover, for the task at hand, we deal with a class imbalance issues since the distribution of sentiments in real-world applications often displays issues of inequality. For example, in political forums or electronic discussions about immigration or religion, negative comments overwhelm the positive ones. The class imbalance problem was confronted using a hybrid technique that performs a variation of under-sampling the majority class and over-sampling the minority class, respectively. Experimental results, considering different settings, such as translation of tokens against translation of sentences, consideration of limited Greek text preprocessing and omission of the translation phase, demonstrated that the proposed gradient boosting framework can effectively cope with both high-dimensional and imbalanced datasets and performs significantly better than a plethora of traditional machine learning classification approaches in terms of precision and recall measures.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/a10010034", "venue": "Algorithms", "journal": "Algorithms", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2594108779", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["107597730", "16810455", "6122295", "17812207", "14715709", "2577850", "2779302", "8004356", "207178694", "3058582", "5556711", "8133224", "14654754", "3181362", "15287173", "8906295", "7583548", "9423000", "16436384", "6931165", "16228540", "15253141", "417913", "17888304", "13097267", "9099325", "37638908", "32056052", "15928408", "11114676", "14935137", "5492940", "5789456", "15694110", "1487915", "16938537", "6787236", "36504974", "14354369"], "inbound_citations": ["201814274", "164373426", "67865992", "199421218", "198904171", "70212979", "208034920", "86668832"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7263511"}

These features are used in machine learning algorithms to provide a prediction of a patient's likelihood to develop sepsis during ICU stay, hours before it is diagnosed. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: Five machine learning algorithms were implemented using R software packages. The algorithms were trained and tested with a set of 4 features which represent the variability in vital signs. These algorithms aimed to calculate a patient's probability to become septic within the next 4 hours, based on recordings from the last 8 hours.

Background and objectiveTo safely select the proper therapy for Ventricullar Fibrillation (VF) is essential to distinct it correctly from Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) and other rhythms. Provided that the required therapy would not be the same, an erroneous detection might lead to serious injuries to the patient or even cause Ventricular Fibrillation (VF). The main novelty of this paper is the use of time-frequency (t-f) representation images as the direct input to the classifier. We hypothesize that this method allow to improve classification results as it allows to eliminate the typical feature selection and extraction stage, and its corresponding loss of information. MethodsThe standard AHA and MIT-BIH databases were used for evaluation and comparison with other authors. Previous to t-f Pseudo Wigner-Ville (PWV) calculation, only a basic preprocessing for denoising and signal alignment is necessary.

The method turns the convex quadratic programming into variational inequality in the process of training approximately linear support vector machine. The method can find the optimal separating hyperplane by solving variational inequality, and can not produce a great deal of data that occupy the computer memory. So the method can improve the training and test speed of SVM in classification greatly. We apply VIALSVM into the multidimensional iris training samples.

An experimental setup has been developed in the laboratory to emulate the partial discharge occurring at various locations within insulation where optical sensors are mounted at particular positions to detect it. Analysis of experimental results shows that the signals captured by the sensors carry significant information relating to the location of partial discharge source. For identifying the location of partial discharge source, S-transform has been applied on captured signals and several features have been extracted. However, employing all the features extracted from the captured signals to detect the location makes the methodology complex and time consuming. Considering this fact, features are ranked according to their importance, which facilitates to select most effective feature extracted from signal captured by each of the sensors. Based on ranking, most important feature corresponding to each sensor has been chosen and used for identification of location through the random forest algorithm. In this case, the accuracy obtained for identifying the location is nearly 95.6%.

For example, we can occasionally ask a selected user to annotate whether a randomly selected message destined for their inbox is spam or not spam. Unfortunately, it is also possible that the user being solicited is an internal threat and has malicious intent. Similar to an adversary, such a user may want to introduce noise: to confuse the spam classifier into believing a spam message is not spam (to ensure delivery of similar messages), or to confuse the spam classifier into believing a non-spam message is spam (to prevent delivery of similar messages). Inspired by the Randomized Hough Transform (RHT), a set of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is trained from randomly chosen data subsets to vote to identify training examples that have been mislabeled. The labels for messages which on the average appear on the wrong side of the decision boundary are flipped and a final SVM model is trained using the modified labels. Two data sets are used for evaluating the proposed RHT-SVM method: the TREC 2007 Spam Track data and the CEAS 2008 Spam data. To preserve the time ordered nature of the data stream, for each of the data sets, the first 10% of the messages are used for training, and the remaining 90% of the messages are used for evaluation. Separate adversarial experiments are conducted for flipping spam labels and non-spam labels. For 10 iterations, labels are flipped for a randomly selected subset of 5% of the training data and the final RHT-SVM is evaluated on the test set. Performance of the RHT-SVM is compared to the performance of the state of the art Reject On Negative Impact (RONI) algorithm. RHT-SVM shows an average 9.3% increase in the F measure compared to RONI (99.0% versus 90.6%), as well as significant improvements in other evaluation metrics. The flip sensitivity for RHT-SVM is 95.9% and the flip specificity is 99.0%.

Screening a vast majority of 4 to 7+ years old necessitate the use of automated systems to collect data, keep tracks, and increase the speed of analysis and accuracy. Based on Handwriting Proficiency Screening Questionnaire (HSPQ) evaluated by their teachers, 120 pupils were individually tested on their use of graphic production rules. Then, the samples were divided into two group of writers; below average writers (test group) and above average writers (control group) based on the score of HSPQ. Each participant was required to copy four basic lines in two opposite directions and trace a sequence of rotated semi circles. This research examines the dynamic features such as ratio of time taken and standard deviation of pen pressure.

The number of variables from the gene expression data coupled with comparably much less number of samples creates new challenges to scientists and statisticians. In particular, the problems include enormous degree of collinearity among genes expressions, likely violation of model assumptions as well as high level of noise with potential outliers. To deal with these problems, we propose a block wavelet shrinkage principal component (BWSPCA) analysis method to optimize the information during the noise reduction process. This paper firstly uses the National Cancer Institute database (NC160) as an illustration and shows a significant improvement in dimension reduction. Secondly we combine BWSPCA with an artificial neural network-based gene minimization strategy to establish a Block Wavelet-based Neural Network model in a robust and accurate cancer classification process (BWNN). Our extensive experiments on six public cancer datasets have shown that the method of BWNN for tumor classification performed well, especially on some difficult instances with large-class (more than two) expression data.

This projection is carried out in order to enhance the linear separability of the input data. Another part is a memory-less structure designed to be robust and fast in the learning process. RC models are an alternative of Turing Machines and Recurrent Neural Networks to model cognitive processing in the neural system. Additionally, they are interesting Machine Learning tools to Time Series Modeling and Forecasting. Recently a new RC model was introduced under the name of Echo State Queueing Networks (ESQN). In this model the reservoir is a dynamical system which arises from the Queueing Theory. The initialization of the reservoir parameters may influence the model performance. Recently, some unsupervised techniques were used to improve the performance of one specific RC method. In this paper, we apply these techniques to set the reservoir parameters of the ESQN model.

We extract several different acoustic features and exploit these features in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to classify acoustic information. For discourse feature extraction, we propose a novel parts-of-speech (POS) tagging technique that effectively reduces the dimensionality of discourse features manyfold. To classify discourse information, we exploit two classifiers such as a HMM and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) respectively. We further obtain classifier fusion between HMM and SVM to improve discourse classification. Finally, we perform an efficient decision-level classifier fusion for both acoustic and discourse information to classify twelve different DAs in HCRC MapTask data. We obtain accuracy of rate 65.2% (58.06% with cross validation) and 55.4% (51.08% with cross validation) DA classification using acoustic and discourse information respectively. Furthermore, we obtain combined accuracy of 68.6% (61.02% with cross validation) for DA classification. These accuracy rates of DA classification are comparable to previously reported results for the same HCRC MapTask dataset.

Machine learning seems to be one of the most promising solutions for spotting illicit transactions, by distinguishing fraudulent and non-fraudulent instances through the use of supervised binary classification systems properly trained from pre-screened sample datasets. However, in such a specific application domain, datasets available for training are strongly imbalanced, with the class of interest considerably less represented than the other. This significantly reduces the effectiveness of binary classifiers, undesirably biasing the results toward the prevailing class, while we are interested in the minority class. Oversampling the minority class has been adopted to alleviate this problem, but this method still has some drawbacks. Generative Adversarial Networks are general, flexible, and powerful generative deep learning models that have achieved success in producing convincingly real-looking images. We trained a GAN to output mimicked minority class examples, which were then merged with training data into an augmented training set so that the effectiveness of a classifier can be improved. Experiments show that a classifier trained on the augmented set outperforms the same classifier trained on the original data, especially as far the sensitivity is concerned, resulting in an effective fraud detection mechanism.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2017.12.030", "venue": "Inf.

The proposed classifier consists of two major parts for improving classification accuracy: the implicit modeling of both the face and the near-face classes resulting in an extended discriminative feature set, and the subsequent composite Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for speeding up the classification. For the extended discriminative feature set, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is performed for the face and near-face classes separately. The projections and distances to the two different subspaces are complementary, which significantly enhances classification accuracy of SVM. Multiple nonlinear SVMs are trained for the local facial feature spaces considering the general multi-modal characteristic of the face space.

Existing network embedding works primarily focus on preserving the microscopic structure, such as the first- and second-order proximity of vertexes, while the macroscopic scale-free property is largely ignored. Scale-free property depicts the fact that vertex degrees follow a heavy-tailed distribution (i.e., only a few vertexes have high degrees) and is a critical property of real-world networks, such as social networks. In this paper, we study the problem of learning representations for scale-free networks. We first theoretically analyze the difficulty of embedding and reconstructing a scale-free network in the Euclidean space, by converting our problem to the sphere packing problem. Then, we propose the \"degree penalty\" principle for designing scale-free property preserving network embedding algorithm: punishing the proximity between high-degree vertexes. We introduce two implementations of our principle by utilizing the spectral techniques and a skip-gram model respectively.

When the classification is binary, ROOT9 achieves the following results against the baseline: hypernyms-co-hyponyms 95.7% vs. 69.8%, hypernyms-random 91.8% vs. 64.1% and co-hyponyms-random 97.8% vs. 79.4%. In order to compare the performance with the state-of-the-art, we have also evaluated ROOT9 in subsets of the Weeds et al. (2014) datasets, proving that it is in fact competitive. Finally, we investigated whether the system learns the semantic relation or it simply learns the prototypical hypernyms, as claimed by Levy et al. (2015). The second possibility seems to be the most likely, even though ROOT9 can be trained on negative examples (i.e., switched hypernyms) to drastically reduce this bias.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1603.08702", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2319915091,2963768750,2950458195", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13364281", "1526915", "89141", "123582503", "145326535", "7634844", "60033325", "2784831", "15763200", "1432668", "1536643", "7187022", "16041630", "747342", "145167098", "64214454", "3191339", "5845139", "14176162", "17792779", "15040286", "16675348", "5522668", "1500900", "11730392", "16852889"], "inbound_citations": ["22103840", "15158138", "211505821", "196172347", "5695554", "211296545", "207760101", "5410083", "17422156", "207754", "51725395", "44077201", "1477515", "68121167", "14919832", "14532027", "56177522", "52157487", "209383184", "54595585", "44158390", "19937157", "6321433", "204700790", "13741562", "13745308", "11141335"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12230893"}

However, many uncertainties and errors can directly or indirectly affect the quality of derived maps. This work focuses on one key aspect of the supervised classification process of remotely sensed imagery: the quality of the reference dataset used to develop a classifier. More specifically, the representative power of the reference dataset is assessed by contrasting it with the full dataset (e.g. entire image) needing classification. Our method is applicable in several ways: training or testing datasets (extracted from the reference dataset) can be compared with the full dataset. The proposed method moves beyond spatial sampling schemes (e.g. grid, cluster) and operates in the multidimensional feature space (e.g. spectral bands) and uses spatial statistics to compare information density of data to be classified with data used in the reference process. The working hypothesis is that higher information density, not in general but with respect to the entire classified image, expresses higher confidence in obtained results. Presented experiments establish a close link between confidence metrics and classification accuracy for a variety of image classifiers namely maximum likelihood, decision tree, Backpropagation Neural Network and Support Vector Machine. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that spatially-continuous reference datasets (e.g. a square window) have the potential to provide similar classification confidence as typically-used spatially-random datasets. This is an important finding considering the higher acquisition costs for randomly distributed datasets. Furthermore, the method produces confidence maps that allow spatially-explicit comparison of confidence metrics within a given image for identification of over- and under-represented image portions. The current method is presented for individual image classification but, with sufficient evaluation from the remote sensing community it has the potential to become a standard for reference dataset reporting and thus allowing users to assess representativeness of reference datasets in a consistent manner across different classification tasks.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.01.011", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1998505287", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5955678", "6893359", "47880643", "6747148", "128277847", "130602792", "17883484", "60985554", "128394971", "41987329", "52997034", "16203715", "54076434", "129914394", "140674768", "131219371", "192934", "35471517", "29399685", "2534324", "130045791", "16258162", "60501333", "31336469", "2357415", "140665886", "62883674", "13252401", "37044463", "25856014", "58793006", "128848964", "122010991", "62245742", "9329077", "11081015", "62241362", "129118923", "128814357", "126733084", "17238163", "15381126", "13377230"], "inbound_citations": ["130851907", "15037776", "14917167", "126023675", "125889592"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16230236"}

It has been included in many applications such as: video surveillance, human computer interaction and multimedia retrieval systems. Various approaches have been proposed to solve human action recognition problem. Among others, moment-based methods considered as one of the most simple and successful approach. However, moment-based methods take into consideration only global features while neglect the discriminative properties of local features. In this paper, we propose a new efficient method which combine both Global and Local Zernike Moment (GLZM) features based on Bag-of-Features (BoF) technique. Since using only global features are not sufficient to discriminate similar actions like running, walking and jogging, augmenting these features with localized features helps to improve the recognition accuracy. The proposed method first calculate local temporal Motion Energy Images (MEI) by accumulating frame differences of short time consecutive frames. Then, global and local features are calculated using Zernike moments with different polynomial orders to represent global and local motion patterns respectively. Global features are calculated from the whole region of the human performing action while local features focused on localized regions of the human in order to represent local motion information. Both local and global features are preprocessed using whitening transformation, then bag-of-features algorithm is employed to combine those pool of features and represent each action using new GLZM feature descriptor. Finally, we use multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to recognize human actions. In order to validate the proposed method, we perform a set of experiments using three publicly available datasets: Weizmann, KTH and UCF sports action.

A comprehensive list of threats and possible mitigations is presented by reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.

Additionally and in contrast to former reviews, the whole AI supply chain is analysed with respect to vulnerabilities, including the planning, data acquisition, training, evaluation and operation phases.

First, by analyzing the impact of different conditions on an accident with the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process)-Ridge regression and bisecting K-means clustering model, the safety inter-vehicle distance is derived by learning from an actual traffic dataset. Besides, ELM(Extreme Learning Machines) is adopted as a verification scheme for safety distance calculation. Subsequently, we design a three-level active safety control scheme using the LQG (Linear Quadratic Gaussian) optimal-control model based on the obtained safety inter-vehicle distance. Numerical results show that by comparing with some classical braking and car-following models, our strategy can always keep the distance of two followed vehicles at a safety state.

A part of this trend is the search for more efficient in silico methods/tools for analysis of promoters, which are parts of DNA sequences that are involved in regulation of expression of genes into other functional molecules. Promoter regions vary greatly in their function based on the sequence of nucleotides and the arrangement of protein-binding short-regions called motifs. In fact, the regulatory nature of the promoters seems to be largely driven by the selective presence and/or the arrangement of these motifs. Here, we explore computational classification of promoter sequences based on the pattern of motif distributions, as such classification can pave a new way of functional analysis of promoters and to discover the functionally crucial motifs. We make use of Position Specific Motif Matrix (PSMM) features for exploring the possibility of accurately classifying promoter sequences using some of the popular classification techniques. The classification results on the complete feature set are low, perhaps due to the huge number of features. We propose two ways of reducing features. Our test results show improvement in the classification output after the reduction of features. The results also show that decision trees outperform SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) and ensemble classifier LibD3C, particularly with reduced features.

The code smell prediction using source code metrics can be used in starting phases of software development life cycle to reduce the maintenance and testing effort of software and also help in improving the quality of the software. The work in this paper empirically investigates and evaluates different classification techniques, feature selection techniques, and data sampling techniques to handle imbalance data in predicting 7 different types of code smell. The conclusion of this research is assessed over 629 application packages.

The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and the sigmoid were selected as the activate function and the transfer function, respectively, whereas the Adaptive moment estimation (Adam) was used to update and optimize the weights of the DLNN. A database for the study area, which includes factors of elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, stream density, NDVI, soil type, lithology, and rainfall, was established to train and validate the proposed model. Feature selection was carried out for these factors using the Information gain ratio.

Second, based on this insight, we show that the performance of such classifiers can be improved by incorporating the spatial context and discriminative learning that arises naturally in the Random Forest framework. Finally, we show that the ability of Random Forests to combine multiple features leads to a further increase in performance when textons, colour, filterbanks, and HOG features are used simultaneously.

The paper addresses the issues of verification and evaluation of KBs existing as rule-based systems and generated with classification algorithms. The framework consists of three steps.

Finally, during the last step, the set of rules is evaluated using two additional criteria: adequacy and reliability.

In intention based segmentation instead of comparing the contents of email as whole, it is divided into segments focusing on same intention and compared. Division of sentences is done on the basis of voices and tenses with the help of POS Tagging. After that, Hierarchical Clustering is used for clustering of segments and comparison is done using Vector Space Model.

Determining what is most pertinent in these situations is not always possible based only on the current sensory inputs, and often also depends on recent inputs and behavioral outputs that contribute to internal states. Thus, one can ask how cortical dynamics generate representations of these complex situations. It has been observed that mixed selectivity in cortical neurons contributes to represent diverse situations defined by a combination of the current stimuli, and that mixed selectivity is readily obtained in randomly connected recurrent networks. In this context, these reservoir networks reproduce the highly recurrent nature of local cortical connectivity. Recombining present and past inputs, random recurrent networks from the reservoir computing framework generate mixed selectivity which provides pre-coded representations of an essentially universal set of contexts. These representations can then be selectively amplified through learning to solve the task at hand. We thus explored their representational power and dynamical properties after training a reservoir to perform a complex cognitive task initially developed for monkeys. The reservoir model inherently displayed a dynamic form of mixed selectivity, key to the representation of the behavioral context over time. The pre-coded representation of context was amplified by training a feedback neuron to explicitly represent this context, thereby reproducing the effect of learning and allowing the model to perform more robustly. This second version of the model demonstrates how a hybrid dynamical regime combining spatio-temporal processing of reservoirs, and input driven attracting dynamics generated by the feedback neuron, can be used to solve a complex cognitive task. We compared reservoir activity to neural activity of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex of monkeys which revealed similar network dynamics.

Image pan-sharpening has seldom been utilized in Digital Soil Mapping research before. This research aimed to analyze the effects of pan-sharpened (PAN) remote sensing spectral indices on soil prediction models in smallholder farm settings. This research fused the panchromatic band and multispectral (MS) bands of WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, and Landsat 8 images in a village in Southern India by Brovey, Gram-Schmidt and Intensity-Hue-Saturation methods. Random Forest was utilized to develop soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil exchangeable potassium (K ex ) prediction models by incorporating multiple spectral indices from the PAN and MS images. Overall, our results showed that PAN remote sensing spectral indices have similar spectral characteristics with soil TN and K ex as MS remote sensing spectral indices. There is no soil prediction model incorporating the specific type of pan-sharpened spectral indices always had the strongest prediction capability of soil TN and K ex . The incorporation of pan-sharpened remote sensing spectral data not only increased the spatial resolution of the soil prediction maps, but also enhanced the prediction accuracy of soil prediction models. Small farms with limited footprint, fragmented ownership and diverse crop cycle should benefit greatly from the pan-sharpened high spatial resolution imagery for soil property mapping. Our results show that multiple high and medium resolution images can be used to map soil properties suggesting the possibility of an improvement in the maps\u2019 update frequency.

A comparison experiment between n-gram and connectionist language models is performed on a Polish text corpus. Statistical language modeling is based on estimating a joint probability function of a sequence of words in a given language. This task is made problematic due to a phenomenon known commonly as the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d. This occurs because the sequence of words used to test the model is most likely going to be different from anything present in the training data. Classic solutions to this problem are successfully achieved by using n-grams which generalize the data by concatenating short overlapping word sequences gathered from the training data. Connections models, however, can accomplish this by learning a distributed representation for words. They can simultaneously learn both the distributed representation for each word in the dictionary as well as the synaptic weights used for modeling the joint probability of word sequences. Generalization can be obtained thanks to the fact that if a sequence is made up of words that were already seen, it will receive a higher probability than an unseen sequence of words.

One such promising approach is the multiple classifier system, which aims at improving classification performance by combining the outputs of several classifiers. Here we present results of a multi-model ensemble applied to multibeam acoustic data covering more than 5000 km 2 of seabed in the North Sea with the aim to derive accurate spatial predictions of seabed substrate. A suite of six machine learning classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, Classification Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network and Naive Bayes) was trained with ground-truth sample data classified into seabed substrate classes and their prediction accuracy was assessed with an independent set of samples. The three and five best performing models were combined to classifier ensembles. Both ensembles led to increased prediction accuracy as compared to the best performing single classifier. The improvements were however not statistically significant at the 5% level. Although the three-model ensemble did not perform significantly better than its individual component models, we noticed that the five-model ensemble did perform significantly better than three of the five component models. A classifier ensemble might therefore be an effective strategy to improve classification performance.

Then, the SVR model with RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel function and BP (Back Propagation) neural network model are tested to validate the accuracy of the optimized SVR model. The results show that the optimized SVR model has the best performance than other two models. Finally, the effects of road conditions on driving decisions are analyzed quantitatively by comparing the reasoning results of DDM with different reference index combinations, and by the sensitivity analysis of DDM with added road conditions. The results demonstrate the significant improvement in the performance of DDM with added road conditions.

In this paper, we put forward a novel undersampling method i.e., granular weighted SVMs-repetitive under-sampling (GWSVM-RU) for highly imbalanced classification, which is a weighted SVMs version of the granular SVMs-repetitive undersampling (GSVM-RU) once proposed by Yuchun Tang et al. We complete the undersampling operation by extracting the negative information granules repetitively which are obtained through the naive SVMs algorithm, and then combine the negative and positive granules again to compose the new training data sets. Thus we rebalance the original imbalanced data sets and then build new models by weighted SVMs to predict the testing data set. Besides, we explore four other rebalance heuristic mechanisms including cost-sensitive learning, undersampling, oversampling and GSVM-RU, our approach holds the higher classification performance defined by new evaluation metrics including G-Mean, F-Measure and AUC-ROC.

To overcome these, our model is designed to obtain a simple and robust metric matrix through detecting the redundant rows and columns in the metric matrix and constraining the remaining matrix to a low rank space. To reduce feature redundancy, we employ the group sparsity regularization, i.e., the $\\ell _{2,1}$ norm, to encourage a sparse feature set. To address rank redundancy, we adopt the low rank regularization, the m ax norm, instead of calculating the SVD as in traditional models using the nuclear norm. Therefore, our model can not only generate a low rank metric matrix to avoid overfitting, but also achieves feature selection simultaneously. For model optimization, an online algorithm based on the stochastic proximal method is derived to solve this problem efficiently with the complexity of $O(d^2)$ . To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms, we apply our model to online scene categorization and synthesized data and conduct experiments on various benchmark datasets with comparisons to several state-of-the-art methods.

Yet they are increasingly threatened by natural pressure and anthropogenic activities. We observed an inaccurate distribution of mangroves over the Western Arabian Gulf (WAG) which is a vital habitat and resource for the local ecosystem, according to the United Stated Geological Survey (USGS) mangrove database through spectral analysis. Change detection analysis is conducted on mangrove forests along the Saudi Arabian coast of the WAG for the years 2000, 2010 and 2018 using Landsat 7 & 8 data. Three supervised classification methodologies are employed for mangrove mapping, including Supported Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), referred to as Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Random Forest (RF). CART\u2019s accuracy was recorded to be >95% while other classifiers were >90%. The CART supervised learning classifier, mapping mangroves\u2019 distribution and biomass using Google Earth Engine (GEE) online platform, indicates an overall increase in the northern Tarut Bay and Tarut Island, by 0.21 km2 from 2000 to 2010 and by 1.4 km2 from 2010 to 2018. The increase might be due to mitigation strategies such as mangrove breeding and plantation. It can be challenging to detect changes in certain regions due to the inadequate resolution of Landsat where submerged mangroves can be confused with salt marshes and macro algae. We employed a new method to identify and analyze submerged mangrove forests distribution via a submerged mangrove recognition index (SMRI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in Abu Ali Island. Our results show the robustness of SMRI as an effective indicator to detect submerged mangroves in both high and medium spatial resolution satellite images. NDVI values differentiated submerged mangroves from tidal flats between Landsat 7 & 8 as well as during conditions of low and high tides. High resolution WorldView-2 image showed agreement of mangroves distribution with the SMRI and NDVI results.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.047", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Indicators", "mag_id": "2929419255", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202909918", "201848690", "202904748", "211836104", "209353617", "198418172"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132114970"}

To what extent is human recognition of beauty in music cultural, or crosscultural? Music is prevalent in all human cultures. Music information retrieval is a growing field in which computational techniques have been applied to many musical problems such as genre recognition and measuring musical similarity. Computational ethnomusicology is rarer because the acquisition of non-Western music is difficult. Beauty in music has been little investigated with scientific methods, though there are some examples on which this thesis builds. The effect of timbral and 12-step chroma audio features, and a wide variety of different machine learning algorithms techniques were tested, with the combination of all the MARSYAS features and Support Vector Machines performing well. Predicting beauty was first investigated with a small Last.fm set and later with a larger world music survey with Singaporean participants. Beauty was predicted based on a small selection of Last.fm tags with good accuracy. Beauty ratings from the survey, conducted in Singapore, were predictable by machine learning using similar methods. Predicting the geographical origin of world music from audio features was attempted. Some promising results emerged, and novel methods for predicting points on the surface of the Earth were developed. An investigation into the link between beauty ratings and location was conducted. The Singaporean beauty ratings were predicted from audio content, geographic content and a combination of both, showing strong correlations between longitude, distance, and timbral features with the beauty ratings, which were statistically very closely linked with distance from Singapore. From this beauty in music is concluded to be culturally related and timbre is shown to be a good pointer to cultural differences.

Most existing methods generally learn part detectors to discover discriminative regions for better categorization performance. However, not all parts are beneficial and indispensable for visual categorization, and the setting of part detector number heavily relies on prior knowledge as well as experimental validation. As is known to all, when we describe the object of an image via textual descriptions, we mainly focus on the pivotal characteristics and rarely pay attention to common characteristics as well as the background areas. This is an involuntary transfer from human visual attention to textual attention, which leads to the fact that textual attention tells us how many and which parts are discriminative and significant to categorization. So, textual attention could help us to discover visual attention in the image. Inspired by this, we propose a fine-grained visual-textual representation learning (VTRL) approach, and its main contributions are: 1) fine-grained visual-textual pattern mining devotes to discovering discriminative visual-textual pairwise information for boosting categorization performance through jointly modeling vision and text with generative adversarial networks, which automatically and adaptively discovers discriminative parts and 2) VTRL jointly combines visual and textual information, which preserves the intra-modality and inter-modality information to generate complementary fine-grained representation, as well as further improves categorization performance. Comprehensive experimental results on the widely used CUB-200-2011 and Oxford Flowers-102 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our VTRL approach, which achieves the best categorization accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCSVT.2019.2892802", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2949943016,2909384861", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16119123", "9527101", "15193013", "14342571", "2118703", "5593552", "1422642", "10359118", "5127135", "17243627", "11710343", "1241368", "1185338", "13441936", "10685040", "145694528", "7102424", "3258810", "11348682", "14125992", "5902990", "8657174", "8970727", "2258583", "27654042", "10605093", "8085527", "490415", "2706742", "214764712", "2259387", "14217450", "14938932", "7638278", "122166830", "14304960", "202473", "6180274", "352650", "1915014", "368182", "1563370", "6628106", "6789015", "15326934", "14124313", "206597351", "206592484", "14152919", "2053770", "6099034", "1331231", "9267207", "16421909", "5679559", "206593396", "7076088", "15352170", "1325997", "4566688", "16500157", "64675975", "9813245", "29463683", "64675975", "1226440", "2473565", "6383532", "10618410", "868693", "6783548"], "inbound_citations": ["209429162", "204837544"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67919982"}

This is however not true in many real applications, especially when patterns occur as groups (where each group shares a homogeneous style). Such tasks are also called field classification. By breaking the i.i.d. assumption, one novel framework called Field Support Vector Machine (F-SVM) is proposed in this paper. The distinction lies that it is capable of training and predicting a group of patterns (i.e., a field pattern) simultaneously. Specifically, the proposed F-SVM classifier is investigated by learning simultaneously both the classifier and the Style Normalization Transformation for each group of data (called field). Such joint learning proves even feasible in the high-dimensional kernel space. An efficient optimization algorithm is further developed with the convergence guaranteed.

A robust machine learning Random Forest (RF) classification technique was deployed for the paddy acreage mapping. A simple linear regression yield model was developed for predicting yields. The key findings showed that the paddy acreage was about 68.3\u201377.8 thousand hectares based on Sentinel-1A and 2B satellite data, respectively. Accordingly, the paddy production of the district was estimated as 108\u2013126 thousand tonnes. The paddy yield was predicted as 1.60 tonnes/hectare. The spatial distribution of paddy based on RF classifier and accuracy assessment of LULC maps revealed that the SAR-based classified paddy map was more consistent than the optical data.

While one has some intuition of how to use the system, it is often the case that it is not entirely clear how to achieve this in practice. Reservoir computing represents a set of approaches that could be useful in such situations. As a paradigm, reservoir computing harbours enormous technological potential which can be naturally released in the context of unconventional computation. In this chapter several key concepts of reservoir computing are reviewed, re-interpreted, and synthesized to aid in realizing the unconventional computation agenda, and to illustrate what unconventional computation might be. Some philosophical approaches are discussed too, e.g. the strongly related implementation problem. The focus is on understanding reservoir computing in the classical setup, where a single fixed dynamical system is used: To this end, mathematical foundations of reservoir computing are presented, in particular the Stone-Weierstrass approximation theorem, with a mixture of rigor, and intuitive explanations. To make the synthesis it was crucial to thoroughly analyze both the differences and similarities between Liquid State Machines and Echo State Networks, and find a common context insensitive base.

Specifically, the SVM framework is reformulated, so each example would be classified in the unitary space. The cost function is redefined by considering the maximum margin of real and imaginary units of the complex number feature at the same time. The cost function is based on the expectation of the hinge loss, and its derivatives can be calculated in closed forms. Using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, this method allows for efficient implementation. For complex number feature, the example uncertainty is modeled by a sample preprocessing method based on within-class Euclidean distance Gaussian distribution sample (DGS). In addition, a complex number feature selection method based on improved hybrid discrimination analysis (HDA) is proposed by considering the correlation between real and imaginary units of complex number feature. The proposed classification algorithm is tested on synthetic data and three publicly available and popular datasets, namely, MNIST, WDBC, and Voc2012.

LOO error provides an almost unbiased estimate of the generalization error.

An effective approach is to approximate the LOO error by its upper bound that is a function of the parameters. Then, we search for parameter so that this upper bound is minimized.

McClelland (jlm@cnbc.cmu.edu) Psychology Department and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA Semantic dementia (SD) is a selective impairment to the semantic system due to progressive atrophy of the frontal and the temporal cortices. The temporal atrophy starts from the pole and progresses posteriorly. Tasks that are usually impaired in SD patients include object/picture naming, word-picture matching, and delayed copying. In addition to the semantic impairment, SD patients also show compromised performance on a number of lexical tasks such as word reading, spelling, verb past-tense inflection, and two-alternative forced choice lexical decision. Similarly to the semantic deficits, the lexical deficits are most prominent for atypical low-frequency items. For the majority of the patients, performance measures on the tasks mentioned above correlate with each other and with the overall semantic performance (cf. Patterson et al., 2005). These findings have motivated the idea that lexical and semantic deficits arise as consequences of damage to a single integrated system that mediates both semantic and lexical processing. Notably, however, the correlations of performance on the different tasks form a wide distribution. Furthermore, individual case studies have been reported of patients who fail to show a correlation between reading, in particular, and tasks such as naming and word-picture matching (e.g., Blazely et al., 2005; Cipolotti & Warrington, 1995). Such cases present a challenge to the single system view. Our purpose is to explore whether this challenge can be addressed. The aim of the current study was to shed more light on the mechanisms by which tasks such as reading and naming are performed and the reasons why performance on these tasks may be partially but not perfectly correlated across patients. We believe that the robustness of semantic and lexical knowledge may depend on a number of factors, so that the observed differences in performance in SD patients might arise from differences in experience, differences in the proficiency of the direct pathway mapping orthography to phonology, and/or differences in the spatial distribution of the brain atrophy. Method & Results The hypothesis was tested with a neural network simulation that included four input/output layers \u2013 visual (V), motor (M), orthographic (O), and phonological (P) (figure 1). There was full bidirectional connectivity between all input layers and semantics, and full recurrence within the semantic layer. There was also a direct pathway between O and P, which was also fully recurrent. The network was trained given a V or an O pattern as input to produce either all four corresponding outputs or only P output. Then, it was damaged by lesioning semantic units as well as links between semantics and V, M, O, and P. Testing included naming (producing the correct P pattern to a given V input) and reading (producing the correct P pattern to a given O input). We modeled the naming and reading data from five SD patients (GC, JL, and FM reported by Graham et al., 1994; EM and PC reported by Blazely et al., 2005). Three aspects of the network were manipulated to model individual differences: (1) training regime (ratio of V to O input = 1:1 vs. 1:2); (2) direct pathway size (10, 20 or 30 units); and (3) lesion distribution (damage of the connections between semantics and the four visible layers in equal ratio vs. biased toward V vs. biased toward O). The patients\u2019 performance broken down by frequency and regularity fit within the 95% confidence interval of the simulation results. Patient GC: Simulated by a central lesion in a network with a 10-unit direct pathway and 1:1 training regime. Patients PC & JL: Simulated by central lesions in a network with a 20-unit direct pathway and 1:1 training regime. Patients EM & FM: Simulated by visually-biased lesions in a network with a 20-unit direct pathway and 1:2 training regime. References Blazely, A., Coltheart, M., & Casey, B. J. (2005).

While anecdotal evidence indicates that drought-induced Bishop pine mortality has occurred in the past in the stand we studied, this is the first attempt to capture the spatial distribution of mortality, and begin to understand the environmental drivers underlying these events. We used high spatial resolution remote sensing data to quantify the spatial extent of tree mortality using a 1 m true color aerial photograph and a 1 m LiDAR digital elevation model. We found the highest density of dead trees in the drier, more inland margins of the forest stand. We used the Random Forest decision tree algorithm to test which environmental variables (e.g., summertime cloud frequency, solar insolation, and geomorphic attributes) would best separate live and dead tree populations. We also included tree height as a variable in our analysis, which we used as a proxy for overall tree size and potential rooting distribution. Based on the Random Forest analysis, we generated a map of the probability of survival. We found tree survivorship after drought was best explained by the frequency of summertime clouds, elevation, and tree height. Specifically, survivorship was greatest for larger trees (\u223c8\u201310 m tall) in more foggy parts of the stand located at moderate elevation. We found that probability of survival was lowest at the inland extent of the stand where trees occur at the upper limit of their elevation range (\u223c400 m). The coexistence of these main factors with other landscape variables help identify areas of suitable habitat for Bishop pines across the stand, and extend our understanding of this species\u2019 distribution.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.foreco.2013.12.020", "venue": null, "journal": "Forest Ecology and Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2013435024", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["22072102", "26820268", "140151371", "16337003", "87342643", "84515392", "13364209", "1378264", "22696742", "9046358", "128981968", "10017684", "131278361", "30164484", "128239469", "129093081", "14655216", "86361311", "55473698", "21144136", "12884129", "3204910", "128691319", "2484625", "5024809", "53443940", "9561021", "56078633", "129242494", "67794701", "84718053", "203388400", "85209100", "84992039", "140661081", "24834303", "84694143", "98443584", "11172462", "4603512", "84650748"], "inbound_citations": ["197548756", "52842624", "210912115", "90569793", "214647628", "215082520", "198979507", "92667404", "202189875", "49881843", "89503529", "85914585", "8963903", "3336236", "15170115", "131066349", "199107856", "197573290", "6562011"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16457908"}

This paper describes an improved random forests method to recognize each part of the human body. What is different from the traditional random forest structure is that the algorithm proposed in this paper provides a feature Pre-selection for examples with large feature space,making the feature set of each split node more efficient. This method not only ensures the independence between trees,but also ensures classification performance of each tree. In the combination among trees,according to the human part structure,we adopt the combined model of hierarchy forest to improve the classification performance of the forest.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Communication University of China", "mag_id": "2355315556", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124319364"}

Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1511.06434", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id":

However, it is quite challenging to propose an efficient and robust forecasting approach due to the inherent randomness and variations of metro passenger flow. In this study, we present a novel adaptive ensemble (AdaEnsemble) learning approach to accurately forecast the volume of metro passenger flows, and it combines the complementary advantages of variational mode decomposition (VMD), seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averaging (SARIMA), multilayer perceptron network (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The AdaEnsemble learning approach consists of three important stages. The first stage applies VMD to decompose the metro passenger flows data into periodic component, deterministic component and volatility component.

In many of these problems, there exist inherent temporal and spatial dependencies between the output vectors, as well as repeating output patterns and input-output associations, that can provide more robust and accurate predictors when modeled properly. With this intrinsic motivation, we propose a novel Output-Associative Relevance Vector Machine (OA-RVM) regression framework that augments the traditional RVM regression by being able to learn non-linear input and output dependencies. Instead of depending solely on the input patterns, OA-RVM models output covariances within a predefined temporal window, thus capturing past, current and future context. As a result, output patterns manifested in the training data are captured within a formal probabilistic framework, and subsequently used during inference. As a proof of concept, we target the highly challenging problem of dimensional and continuous prediction of emotions, and evaluate the proposed framework by focusing on the case of multiple nonverbal cues, namely facial expressions, shoulder movements and audio cues. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed OA-RVM regression by performing subject-independent evaluation using the SAL database that constitutes naturalistic conversational interactions.

With the growing importance of online networks, signals of suicidal ideation and intent are increasingly expressed on the web. Particular advantages of online communication are that it can offer anonymity and a sense of control. There is evidence that introverted individuals are strongly motivated to communicate online, which leads to more self-disclosure. ::: ::: Although suicidal expressions may be recognized and responded to by peers, this does not always happen in an appropriate or timely fashion. It is therefore preferable to also have prevention specialists monitor user-generated content, if this is not in conflict with users' preferences, safety and privacy concerns. ::: ::: The huge volume of online content prohibits manual monitoring, so automatic filtering approaches are required to prevent information overload. Previous research has focused on solutions based on keyword searches. Their efficacy is limited, since search queries can only cover a limited range of explicit suicidal expressions, they typically return many irrelevant hits, and are not robust to spelling errors. This paper presents a suicide prevention approach based on automatic text classification. ::: ::: ::: In supervised text classification, a system assigns each text to one of a number of predefined categories. In our use case, a text is an online post, and there are three categories: alarming posts that should be reviewed, suicide-related posts that are harmless, and irrelevant posts (i.e. the majority class). ::: ::: A set of 300,000 forum and blog messages was collected and partly labeled by staff and volunteers at the Belgian Suicide Prevention Centre (CPZ). We used natural language processing to represent each text as a rich set of features that should allow suicidality prediction, including words, characters, significant terms derived from transcripts from the CPZ emergency chat hotline, topic models capturing semantically related words, and the emotional orientation of words (positive, negative or neutral) based on two external sentiment lexicons. Support Vector Machines (SVM), a supervised machine learning technique, was trained, evaluated and optimized on the corpus to allow classification of unseen material. In practice, the model will classify newly posted content based on the knowledge it induced from the annotated training corpus, and notify a prevention specialist in case of a possibly alarming post. ::: ::: ::: The experimental results show that both suicide-related and alarming messages can be detected with high precision (80 to 90%). As a result, the amount of noise generated by the system is minimal: only 1 or 2 out of ten messages flagged by the system is irrelevant. In terms of recall, a measure for how many relevant messages were missed, suicide-related content is almost always detected (90%, i.e. missing one in ten). Recall for alarming posts is lower, at around 60%, a problem mainly attributable to implicit references to suicide, which often go undetected. The text classification approach outperforms a system based on keyword searching, most notably in terms of precision. ::: ::: In order to evaluate performance in a real-world prevention setting, we also tested the system on datasets of increasing size in which the class skew was augmented and thus the incidence of suicide-related material was decreased. Interestingly, we observe that the system also scores well on large datasets with high class skew, making it usable in big data automated prevention. ::: ::: ::: The results are a first and promising indication that text classification is a viable approach to online message filtering for suicide prevention purposes. Additional positive training data (i.e. messages that can be considered suicide-related) should allow further performance improvements. ::: ::: The resulting system is currently being validated on the message boards of two Belgian LGBT organizations. Volunteer website moderators, overwhelmed with the above-average amount of suicide-related content, receive training from CPZ professionals on how to screen possibly alarming content and how best to respond.

The adverse effects of PM have raised public concern, especially in heavily polluted areas in the world, making it imperative the development of strategies to keep the concentration levels of these pollutants below harmful thresholds. Traditional machine learning approaches have been used to forecast PM concentrations. However, complex chemical processes may be involved in the composition of PM in the atmosphere and influenced by many meteorological parameters. Thus, underlying data distributions of PM data, uninterruptedly collected, may evolve over time. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, implies an important challenge for traditional machine learning techniques since they do not have mechanisms to handle changes on data distribution at the running time, thus limiting their forecasting capabilities. The overall goal of this work is to evaluate whether the incorporation of mechanisms to deal with concept drift, together with online sequential learning approaches, can improve the accuracy of PM forecasting. To do so, new mechanisms that enable online dynamic ensembles to handle and retain knowledge from different concepts for more time were proposed and adapted to EOS and DOER algorithms, resulting in three approaches: EOS-rank, EOS-D and DOER-rank. These ensemble strategies, which were based on Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machines (OS-ELM), were compared with five algorithms from the literature. To evaluate their performance, real-world and artificial datasets, with known dynamic behaviors, and PM concentration datasets from different cities of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, were used in the experiments. The obtained results showed that the proposed approaches can handle dynamic environments with different rates of drift and that EOS-rank was capable of outperforming most approaches from the literature in scenarios with higher rates of drift. The results also indicate that PM data distributions slowly evolve over time and, consequently, the proposed mechanisms that keep information of past concepts and slowly adapt the ensemble tend to present better results when applied to forecast PM concentration.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106123", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Soft Computing", "mag_id": "3000924046", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213450721"}

Accurate detection of temporal changes in 2CMV AGI products can be challenging because of \u2019speckle noise\u2019 susceptibility and false positives that result from small orientation differences between objects imaged at different times. Accordingly, 2CMV products are often dominated by colored pixels when changes are detected via simple pixel-wise cross-correlation. The state-of-the-art in SAR image processing demonstrates that generating efficient 2CMV products, while accounting for the aforementioned problem cases, has not been well addressed. We propose a methodology to address the aforementioned two problem cases. Before detecting temporal changes, speckle and smoothing filters mitigate the effects of speckle noise. To detect temporal changes, we propose using unsupervised feature learning algorithms in conjunction with optical flow algorithms that track the motion of objects across time in small regions of interest.

In this paper, we demonstrate that two types of higher order potential, based on object detections and superpixels, can be included in a CRF embedded within a deep network. We design these higher order potentials to allow inference with the differentiable mean field algorithm. As a result, all the parameters of our richer CRF model can be learned end-to-end with our pixelwise CNN classifier. We achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance on the PASCAL VOC benchmark with these trainable higher order potentials.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1511.08119", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6_33", "venue": "ECCV 2016", "journal": "arXiv: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2346810359,2963753570,2950594919", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1806278", "13187368", "12972240", "1996665", "206594196", "1613420", "206593096", "12810923", "10880491", "206765110", "207663697", "206770307", "17114901", "6467749", "6683607", "9272368", "122598442", "7573669", "3084505", "206590944", "15197911", "14995779", "5574079", "14593894", "207763512", "2068733", "2794268", "33776056", "14554538", "14113767", "1686900", "10875471", "8254931", "56507745", "6529084", "3035960", "12513920", "10328909", "10617972", "22886446", "15939599", "242941", "14124313", "16129538", "392527", "30406272", "21342063", "3522817", "3014704", "17127188"], "inbound_citations": ["201622634", "12260755", "28531778", "30680748", "198949384", "4426384", "53280153", "211817876", "155107529", "199488994", "32225938", "197679574", "21557197", "202771656", "85542864", "4324021", "195451929", "180256418", "131777204", "211069559", "4670132", "54435860", "44058101", "53595420", "4322524", "54029603", "52399382", "57756888", "44149365", "203578891", "51967555", "8697199", "689238", "9392705", "15890805", "55510215", "1678852", "1381187", "90262893", "197488479", "19235777", "208107924", "52927363", "21670200", "13116458", "8238530", "9609915", "198164185", "502946", "21700828", "5299559", "58004609", "59234586", "43932342", "52842854", "4655075", "6499096", "201124533", "104291983", "44100533", "14707395", "52978684", "70349981", "53012799", "128342155", "26285072", "46919021", "207976755", "210966066", "8978852", "85503811", "52272942", "208224753", "4566142", "209202477", "209202477", "56895384", "49316062", "26907935", "18907310", "3418524", "214713957", "58949981", "197866008", "13186077", "16991836", "8883115", "7240840", "202572835", "49908128", "68046158", "3763726", "37099732", "5696978", "54440572", "8937693", "38650437", "21364204", "15515411", "4674162", "210180997", "202538012", "108290674", "53034122", "132084543", "53107197", "32489168", "198363310"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3058770"}

Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm which comprises numerous decision trees and nominates a class through majority voting for classification and averaging approach for regression. The prior research affirms that the learning time of the Random Forest algorithm linearly increases when the number of trees in the forest augments. This large number of decision trees in the Random Forest can cause certain challenges. Firstly, it can enlarge the model complexity, and secondly, it can negatively affect the efficiency of large-scale datasets. Hence, ensemble pruning methods (e.g. Clustering Ensemble Selection (CES)) are devised to select a subset of decision trees out of the forest. The main challenge is that the prior CES models require the number of clusters as input. To solve the problem, we devise an Automatic CES pruning model (Auto-CES) for Random Forest which can automatically find the proper number of clusters. Our proposed model is able to obtain an optimal subset of trees that can provide the same or even better effectiveness compared to the original set. Auto-CES has two components: clustering and selection. First, our algorithm utilizes a new clustering technique to classify homogeneous trees. In selection part, it takes both accuracy and diversity of the trees into consideration to choose the best tree.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-92013-9_22", "venue": "ADC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2803238288", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201127351", "195833703"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21696410"}

Metabolites are detected as peaks which are characterised by mass-over-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time (rt), and one of the most critical but also the most challenging tasks in metabolomics is to annotate the large number of peaks detected in biological samples. Accurate m/z measurements enable the prediction of molecular formulae which provide clues to the chemical identity of peaks, but often a number of metabolites have identical molecular formulae. Chromatographic behaviour, reflecting the physicochemical properties of metabolites, should also provide structural information. However, the variation in rt between analytical runs, and the complicating factors underlying the observed time shifts, make the use of such information for peak annotation a non-trivial task. To this end, we conducted Quantitative Structure\u2013Retention Relationship (QSRR) modelling between the calculated molecular descriptors (MDs) and the experimental retention times (rts) of 93 authentic compounds analysed using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled to high resolution MS. A predictive QSRR model based on Random Forests algorithm outperformed a Multiple Linear Regression based model, and achieved a high correlation between predicted rts and experimental rts (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient = 0.97), with mean and median absolute error of 0.52 min and 0.34 min (corresponding to 5.1 and 3.2 % error), respectively. We demonstrate that rt prediction with the precision achieved enables the systematic utilisation of rts for annotating unknown peaks detected in a metabolomics study. The application of the QSRR model with the strategy we outlined enhanced the peak annotation process by reducing the number of false positives resulting from database queries by matching accurate mass alone, and enriching the reference library.

Firstly, the proposed approach applied the MCSVM to train a multi-class classification model, and it adopted the NSGA-II to optimize the threshold values of trading rules. Then, the trained MCSVM model was used to forecast the movement direction and magnitude levels. Next, the proposed method forecasted the direction of crude oil price movements one week later and executed trading simulation according to the direction and magnitude level predictions. Finally, after a testing period lasted for four years, the performances of the proposed approach were gauged in terms of direction prediction correctness and investment yields.

A specific implementation of the VFNN using Euler's method to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and gaussian vector fields is tested. The first experiments present visual results remarking the important features of the new architecture and providing another contribution with the geometrically interpretable regularization of model parameters. Then, the new architecture is evaluated for different hyperparameters and inputs, with the objective of evaluating the influence on model performance, computational time, and complexity.

Based on chaos theory, aircraft accidents series of 1/1/1964 to 31/03/2018 are used for this study at different timescales(HM-scale, ETD-scale, EFD-scale and ED-scale). Firstly, the delay times and the optimal embedding dimensions of aircraft accidents series at four timescales are calculated, the phase space reconstruction for accident series are explored. Secondly, Lyapunov spectrums of four series are determined. Finally, the CSVR prediction model based on Support Vector Machine is introduced. A comparison of results reveals that the Largest Lyapunov exponents of four series are all positive, aircraft accident series have chaotic characteristic. There are no clear variation of the time delay, embedding dimension and the largest Lyapunov exponent along with the increase of timescale. The experimental results of prediction model show that the prediction error descends firstly and then ascends along with the decrease of timescale.

Previous approaches adopt a common strategy that models the shared structure as a bridge across different domains by reducing distribution divergences. However, those approaches totally ignore specific latent spaces, which can be utilized to learn non-shared concepts. Only specific latent spaces contain specific latent factors, lacking which will lead to ineffective distinct concept learning. Additionally, only learning latent factors in one latent feature space layer may ignore those in the other layers. The missing latent factors may also help us to model the latent structure shared as the bridge. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning method Multi-Layer Transfer Learning (MLTL). MLTL first generates specific latent feature spaces. Second, it combines these specific latent feature spaces with common latent feature space into one latent feature space layer. Third, it generates multiple layers to learn the corresponding distributions on different layers with their pluralism simultaneously. Specifically, the pluralism of the distributions on different layers means that learning the distributions on one layer can help us to learn the distributions on the others. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm based on Non-Negative Matrix Tri-Factorization is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MLTL can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art learning methods on topic and sentiment classification tasks.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2015.12.097", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2226984459", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202770258", "69225717", "52958890", "3739893", "39012500", "12648914", "36653313"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207112845"}

The pedestrian detection system has been implemented in two versions: i) fully body detection, and ii) upper body only detection. The latter is especially suited for very busy and crowded scenarios.

Our in-depth analyses also demonstrate that incorporating recurrent units is a simple yet effective method to prevent noisy information in graphs, which enables a deeper graph neural network.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1904.08035", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2937843018", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["3051291", "207238980", "8399404", "7490480", "207372751", "3144218", "4755450", "206594692", "3292002", "1915014", "5590763", "18939716", "474078", "5201925", "206756462", "13756489", "16447573", "62016134", "22191393", "1957433", "4640611", "6844431", "5273326", "6628106", "3952914", "8393918", "3880365", "3393165", "3508727", "3973810", "2687749"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:119314238"}
