We propose an anomaly detection model based on One-class SVM to detect network intrusions. The one-class SVM adopts only normal network connection records as the training dataset. But after being trained, it is able to recognize normal from various attacks. This just meets the requirements of the anomaly detection.

However, the existing hardware on which these models are trained severely limits the size of the images that can be generated. The rapid growth of high dimensional data in many fields of science therefore poses a significant challenge for generative models. In cosmology, the large-scale, three-dimensional matter distribution, modeled with N-body simulations, plays a crucial role in understanding the evolution of structures in the universe. As these simulations are computationally very expensive, GANs have recently generated interest as a possible method to emulate these datasets, but they have been, so far, mostly limited to two dimensional data. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for the generation of three dimensional N-body simulations, in order to stimulate new ideas in the machine learning community and move closer to the practical use of generative models in cosmology. As a first benchmark result, we propose a scalable GAN approach for training a generator of N-body three-dimensional cubes. Our technique relies on two key building blocks, (i) splitting the generation of the high-dimensional data into smaller parts, and (ii) using a multi-scale approach that efficiently captures global image features that might otherwise be lost in the splitting process. We evaluate the performance of our model for the generation of N-body samples using various statistical measures commonly used in cosmology. Our results show that the proposed model produces samples of high visual quality, although the statistical analysis reveals that capturing rare features in the data poses significant problems for the generative models.

Since the presence and number of CMBs have become a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of stroke, an automatic identification method is required.

CMBs on the MR T2* weighted images were manually rated according to the Microbleed Anatomic Rating Scale (MARS) criteria. Our automated method consisted of two steps: i) Pre-processing: After skull stripping, isolated islands of points were removed while holes were restored to avoid over segmentation. Local threshold segmentation was applied for the initial candidate selection. ii) Identification model: Seven features were extracted from each candidate: area, roundness, intensity, average of the boundary, contrast, shape-intensity and location-mark (according to the probability density templates calculated from the location information of the CMBs). For further identification of each candidate, Random Forest (RF) model was used to distinguish CMBs from the mimics. ::: ::: Results: A total of 337 CMBs in the 81 patients were studied. Comparing with the counting from the experienced doctors, high sensitivity of 92% (310/337) was achieved after pre-processing. The RF model eliminated most of the false-positives while maintaining a reliable sensitivity of 94% (291/310) and specificity of 96% (4272/4450). The area under the Receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.98 \u00b1 0.02 for the detection model. In summary, this CAD system had an overall sensitivity of 86% (291/337) and specificity of 96% (4272/4450), producing only 2.2 false-positives per subject. ::: ::: Conclusion: This presented strategy is technically effective.

It is widely recognized that weather plays a key role in extreme fire situations. It is therefore of great interest to analyze projected changes in fire danger under climate change scenarios and to assess the consequent impacts of forest fires. In this study we estimated burned areas in the European Mediterranean (EU-Med) countries under past and future climate conditions. Historical (1985\u20132004) monthly burned areas in EU-Med countries were modeled by using the Canadian Fire Weather Index (CFWI). Monthly averages of the CFWI sub-indices were used as explanatory variables to estimate the monthly burned areas in each of the five most affected countries in Europe using three different modeling approaches (Multiple Linear Regression \u2014 MLR, Random Forest \u2014 RF, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines \u2014 MARS). MARS outperformed the other methods. Regression equations and significant coefficients of determination were obtained, although there were noticeable differences from country to country. Climatic conditions at the end of the 21st Century were simulated using results from the runs of the regional climate model HIRHAM in the European project PRUDENCE, considering two IPCC SRES scenarios (A2\u2013B2). The MARS models were applied to both scenarios resulting in projected burned areas in each country and in the EU-Med region.

This study investigates the feasibility of using support vector machine regression (SVMr), an innovative artificial intelligence-based machine learning algorithm for predicting salinity concentrations at selected monitoring wells in an illustrative aquifer under variable groundwater pumping conditions. For evaluation purpose, the prediction results of SVMr are compared with well-established genetic programming (GP) based surrogate models. SVMr and GP models are trained and validated using identical sets of input (pumping) and output (salinity concentration) datasets. The trained and validated models are then used to predict salinity concentrations at specified monitoring wells in response to new pumping datasets. Prediction capabilities of the two learning machines are evaluated using different proficiency measures to ensure their practicality and generalisation ability. The performance evaluation results suggest that the prediction capability of SVMr is superior to GP models. Also, a sensitivity analysis methodology is proposed for assessing the impact of pumping rates on salt concentrations at monitoring locations. This sensitivity analysis provides a subset of most influential pumping rates, which is used to construct new SVMr surrogate models with improved predictive capabilities. The improved prediction capability and the generalisation ability of the SVMr models together with the ability to improve the accuracy of prediction by refining the input set for training makes the use of proposed SVMr models more attractive.

The geometric view is based on the intrinsic relation between Optimal Mass Transportation (OMT) theory and convex geometry, and leads to a variational approach to solve the Alexandrov problem: constructing a convex polytope with prescribed face normals and volumes. By using the optimal transportation view of GAN model, we show that the discriminator computes the Wasserstein distance via the Kantorovich potential, the generator calculates the transportation map. For a large class of transportation costs, the Kantorovich potential can give the optimal transportation map by a close-form formula. Therefore, it is sufficient to solely optimize the discriminator.

Even when no injury occurs, about half of all older adults who fall are unable to get up without assistance. The extended period of lying on the floor often leads to medical complications, including muscle damage, dehydration, anxiety and fear of falling. Wearable sensor systems incorporating accelerometers and/or gyroscopes are designed to prevent long lies by automatically detecting and alerting care providers to the occurrence of a fall. Research groups have reported up to 100% accuracy in detecting falls in experimental settings. However, there is a lack of studies examining accuracy in the real-world setting. In this study, we examined the accuracy of a fall detection system based on real-world fall and non-fall data sets. Five young adults and 19 older adults went about their daily activities while wearing tri-axial accelerometers. Older adults experienced 10 unanticipated falls during the data collection. Approximately 400 hours of activities of daily living were recorded. We employed a machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, to identify falls and non-fall events. We found that our system was able to detect 8 out of the 10 falls in older adults using signals from a single accelerometer (waist or sternum). Furthermore, our system did not report any false alarm during approximately 28.5 hours of recorded data from young adults. However, with older adults, the false positive rate among individuals ranged from 0 to 0.3 false alarms per hour. While our system showed higher fall detection and substantially lower false positive rate than the existing fall detection systems, there is a need for continuous efforts to collect real-world data within the target population to perform fall validation studies for fall detection systems on bigger real-world fall and non-fall datasets.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5498034", "pubmed_id": "28678808", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0180318", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2733439154", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["206801033", "19207252", "36711722", "23716079", "29371536", "45057509", "10106650", "33356873", "10180391", "7917269", "13368978", "29452320", "218044", "12603513", "10987334", "356259", "28531652", "8911690", "23554786", "28842266", "1739434", "89241", "75832612"], "inbound_citations": ["49620963", "44146113", "44123794", "212649984", "77385641", "209764929", "207832012", "69765717", "117659575"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24904874"}

However, it performs better on closed datasets and is less effective in real-world scenarios for text classification. As the data is updated and the amount of data increases, the models need to be retrained, in what is often a long training process. Therefore, we propose a novel incremental learning strategy to solve these problems. Our method, called Learn#, includes four components: a Student model, a reinforcement learning (RL) module, a Teacher model, and a discriminator model. The Student models first extract the features from the texts, then the RL module filters the results of multiple Student models. After that, the Teacher model reclassifies the filtered results to obtain the final texts category. To avoid increasing the Student models unlimitedly as the number of samples increases, the discriminator model is used to filter the Student models based on their similarity. The Learn# method has the advantage of a shorter training time than the One-Time model, because it only needs to train a new Student model each time, without changing the existing Student models. Furthermore, it can also obtain feedback during application and tune the models parameters over time. Experiments on different datasets show that our method for text classification outperforms many traditional One-Time methods, reducing training time by nearly 80%.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113198", "venue": "Expert Syst.

A computer-assisted classification method combining conventional MRI and perfusion MRI is developed and used for differential diagnosis.

The extracted features include tumor shape and intensity characteristics as well as rotation invariant texture features.

The explanation rule learned for a CBR solution is required to cover both the target problem and the most similar case, and is used together with the most similar case to explain the solution, thus integrating two approaches to explanation traditionally associated with different reasoning modalities. We also show how the approach can be generalized to enable the discovery of explanation rules for CBR solutions based on k-NN.

Using this data set, we apply machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Support Vector Machines) to build a classification model for SO questions. We then experiment with 82 different configurations regarding the preprocessing of the text and representation of the input data. The results of the best performing models show that our models can classify posts into the correct question category with an average precision and recall of 0.88 and 0.87 when using Random Forest and the phrases indicating a question category as input data for the training.

However, the high volume of reviews that are typically published for a single product makes harder for individuals as well as manufacturers to locate the best reviews and understand the true underlying quality of a product. In this paper, we re-examine the impact of reviews on economic outcomes like product sales and see how different factors affect social outcomes like the extent of their perceived usefulness. Our approach explores multiple aspects of review text, such as lexical, grammatical, semantic, and stylistic levels to identify important text-based features. In addition, we also examine multiple reviewer-level features such as average usefulness of past reviews and the self-disclosed identity measures of reviewers that are displayed next to a review. Our econometric analysis reveals that the extent of subjectivity, informativeness, readability, and linguistic correctness in reviews matters in influencing sales and perceived usefulness. Reviews that have a mixture of objective, and highly subjective sentences have a negative effect on product sales, compared to reviews that tend to include only subjective or only objective information. However, such reviews are considered more informative (or helpful) by the users. By using Random Forest based classifiers, we show that we can accurately predict the impact of reviews on sales and their perceived usefulness. Reviews for products that have received widely fluctuating reviews, also have reviews of widely fluctuating helpfulness. In particular, we find that highly detailed and readable reviews can have low helpfulness votes in cases when users tend to vote negatively not because they disapprove of the review quality but rather to convey their disapproval of the review polarity. We examine the relative importance of the three broad feature categories: \u2018reviewer-related\u2019 features, \u2018review subjectivity\u2019 features, and \u2018review readability\u2019 features, and find that using any of the three feature sets results in a statistically equivalent performance as in the case of using all available features.

One of the major detrimental microstructure properties associated with additive manufacturing (AM) is porosity within final parts. State-of-the-art porosity detection methods focus primarily on post-manufacturing approaches that are susceptible to high cost of process, longer process time, and are incapable of characterizing pores during fabrication. A real-time porosity prediction method is developed using morphological characteristics of the melt pool boundary (i.e., features obtained via functional principal component analysis (FPCA)). A thermal monitoring system is used to capture the time-varying melt pool signal, which are labeled as either pores or normal melt pools by X-ray tomography. Supervised learning methods are utilized to identify the patterns of melt pool images and build a black-box model for the probability distribution of class labels (namely, porosity) based on data characteristics of predictors (e.g., melt pool characteristics). The resultant model does not depend on specific design of specimens with varying material properties; and can be effectively developed as long as thermal-porosity data can be obtained. In the current study, multiple supervised machine learning approaches are used to classify melt pools to predict porosity in a part. Two different accuracy measures are used and numerical experiments show that among the classification approaches used (i.e., Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)), KNN results in the highest rate of accurately classifying melt pools (98.44%). However, DT results in the lowest rate for incorrectly identifying normal melt pools as pores (0.03%). A comparative study is conducted that compares the performance of supervised learning methods leveraging the proposed morphological model and simple metrics of the melt pool. Numerical experiments show that the morphological model combined with supervised learning techniques vastly outperform the simple melt pool metrics combined with supervised learning techniques (approximately 250% better performance for correctly predicting abnormal melt pools). Our approach may potentially be applied to other AM processes that share similar energy-material interactions (e.g., powder bed fusion, electron beam melting).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jmsy.2018.04.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Manufacturing Systems", "mag_id": "2799328997", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["86682541", "198364173", "197465907", "211629654", "52425791", "191179904"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117677065"}

One important motivation of these investigations is the RNN's promising ability of modeling time-behavior of nonlinear dynamic systems. It has been theoretically proved that RNN is able to map arbitrary input sequences to output sequences with infinite accuracy regardless underline dynamics with sufficient training samples [1]. Moreover, from biological point of view, RNN is more plausible to the real neural models as compared to other adaptive methods such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM), feed-forward networks and Support Vector Machines (SVM). From the practical point of view, the dynamics approximation and adaptive learning capability make RNN a highly competitive candidate for a wide range of applications. See [2] [3] [4] for examples. Among the various applications, the realtime signal processing has constantly been one of the active topics of RNN. In such kind of applications, the convergence speed is always an important concern because of the tight timing requirement. For example, the conventional training algorithms of RNN, such as the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and the Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) always suffer from slow convergence speed. If a large learning rate is selected to speed up the weight updating, the training process may become unstable. Thus it is desirable to develop robust learning algorithms with variable or adaptive learning coe\u00b1cients to obtain a tradeoff between the stability and fast convergence speed. The issue has already been extensively studied for linear adaptive filters, e.g., the famous Normalized Least Mean Square (N-LMS) algorithm. However, for online training algorithms of RNN this is still an open topic. Due to the inherent feedback and distributive parallel structure, the adjustments of RNN weights can affect the entire neural network state variables during network training. Hence it is difficult to obtain the error derivative for gradient type updating rules, and in turn difficulty in the analysis of the underlying dynamics of the training. So far, a great number of works have been carried out to solve the problem. To name a few, in [5], B. Pearlmutter presented a detail survey on gradient calculation for RNN training algorithms.

Performance assessment of PV plants is usually based on the comparison between measured and modeled outputs of PV plants, i.e., an alarm occurs for abnormal operation when a significant difference is detected. For such methods, it is critical to estimate the potential electricity generation of PV plants in normal operation. However, unpredictable conditions affecting solar modules pose challenges to develop reliable PV models. In this paper, a practical approach to improve estimating daily energy generation of PV plants for performance assessment is proposed, which includes two main components: (i) a data preprocessing method; (ii) sub-models in different weather conditions. The proposed data preprocessing method detects outliers by comparing normalized outputs of adjacent inverters instantaneously. It is robust against erroneous measurements in normal operation. Sub-models in different weather conditions are developed using a Principal Component Analysis and Support Vector Machine method for better representation of PV plant outputs. Results show that the proposed method can detect deviations between the estimated and the measured daily energy generation of 10%. Moreover, false alarms, i.e., an abnormal point identified while the system is operating normally, are significantly reduced.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.047", "venue": null, "journal": "Energy", "mag_id": "2896472034", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["209315063"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115685032"}

To overcome these shortcomings, new dynamic configuration methods for intelligent algorithms (DC-IA) is presented in this paper on the basis of the requirements of three kinds of algorithm users. It separates the optimization problems and intelligent algorithms, modularizes each step of algorithms and extracts their core operators. Based on the coarse-grained operator modules, three-layer dynamical configurations, i.e., parameter-based configuration, operator-based configuration and algorithm-based configuration, are fully exploited and implemented. Under these methods, dozens of hybrid and improved intelligent algorithms can be easily produced in a few minutes just based on several configurable operator modules. Also, problem-oriented customizations in configurations can further extend the application range and advance the efficiency of the existing operators enormously.

However, machine learning models require abundant training data specific to each target hospital and may not be able to benefit from available labeled data from each of the hospitals due to data variations. Such training data limitations have presented one of the major obstacles for maximising potential application of machine learning approaches in the healthcare domain. We investigated transferability of artificial neural network models across hospitals from different domains representing various age demographic groups (i.e., children, adults, and mixed) in order to cope with such limitations. ::: ::: ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS ::: We explored the transferability of artificial neural networks for clinical document classification. Our case study was to detect abnormalities from limb X-ray reports obtained from the emergency department (ED) of three hospitals within different domains. Different transfer learning scenarios were investigated in order to employ a source hospital's trained model for addressing a target hospital's abnormality detection problem. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model exhibited the best effectiveness compared to other networks when employing an embedding model trained on a large corpus of clinical documents. Furthermore, CNN models derived from a source hospital outperformed a conventional machine learning approach based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) when applied to a different (target) hospital. These models were further improved by leveraging available training data in target hospitals and outperformed the models that used only the target hospital data with F1-Score of 0.92-0.96 across three hospitals. ::: ::: ::: DISCUSSION ::: Our transfer learning model used only simple vector representations of documents without any task-specific feature engineering. Transferring the CNN model significantly improved (approx.10% in F1-Score) the state-of-the-art approach for clinical document classification based on a trivial transferred model. In addition, the results showed that transfer learning techniques can further improve a CNN model that is trained only on either a source or target hospital's data. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Transferring a pre-trained CNN model generated in one hospital to another facilitates application of machine learning approaches that alleviate both hospital-specific feature engineering and training data.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30026067", "doi": "10.1016/j.jbi.2018.07.017", "venue": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "journal": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "mag_id": "2883641150", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["54438508"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51702213"}

The methods were tested on three types of descriptors: molecular descriptors including E-state values, counts of atoms determined for E-state atom types, and substructural molecular fragments (SMF). Comparison of the models was performed using a 5-fold external cross-validation procedure. Robust statistical tests (bootstrap and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics) were employed to evaluate the significance of calculated models. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the performance of methods. Individual structure-complexation property models obtained with nonlinear methods demonstrated a significantly better performance than the models built using multilinear regression analysis (MLRA). However, the averaging of several MLRA models based on SMF descriptors provided as good of a prediction as the most efficient nonlinear techniques. Support Vector Machines and Associative Neural Networks contributed in the largest number of significant models.

{"paper_id": "99738832", "title": "A taste of pepper: genetics, biochemistry and prediction of sweet pepper flavor", "authors": [{"first": "P.", "middle": ["M."], "last": "Eggink", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This PhD project started with the composition of a diverse panel of genotypes that represented, (i) roughly the flavor variation in the commercial Capsicum annuum breeding program of Rijk Zwaan, (ii) parents of available mapping populations and (iii) some genotypes that were expected to have extraordinary flavors. The complete set consisted of 35 genotypes of which 24 genotypes were non-pungent. Volatile and non-volatile compounds as well as some breeding parameters were measured in mature fruits of all genotypes throughout the growing season. In addition, from three harvests the non-pungent genotypes were evaluated for taste by a trained descriptive sensory panel. The biochemical profiling with use of SPME-GC-MS allowed visualization of between- and within-species volatile compound variation. Principal components analysis (PCA) on the intensity patterns of 391 putative volatile compounds revealed individual grouping of C. chinense, C. baccatum var. pendulum and C. annuum, indicating potentially interesting volatile variation present in the former two groups. A large group of saturated and unsaturated esters were mainly responsible for the individual grouping of the C. chinense accessions. Due to the elevated acid concentrations and aberrant volatile profiles of the C. baccatum var. pendulum accessions PEN45 and PEN79, the two BIL populations derived from these accessions were identified as interesting candidates for further study. Compared to e.g. Mazurka the citrate concentration of the C. baccatum accessions was 2.5-3 times higher and the malate concentrations were even up to 12 times higher (Chapter 2). Based on the non-pungent genotypes, we found highly correlated clusters of volatiles and non-volatiles, which could be related to metabolic pathways and common biochemical precursors (Chapter 3). Contrasts between genotypes were caused by both qualitative and quantitative differences in these metabolic clusters, with the phenolic derivatives, higher alkanes, sesquiterpenes and lipid derived volatiles forming the major determinants. For the description of the non-pungent genotypes the panelists used fourteen attributes to describe the flavor sensation in the mouth/throat, which were the texture attributes crunchiness, stickiness of the skin, toughness and juiciness, the basic taste attributes sweetness and sourness and the retronasal flavor attributes aroma intensity, grassiness, green bean, carrot, fruity/apple, perfume, petrochemical and musty. The variation in flavor could be reduced into two major sensory contrasts, which were a texture related contrast and the basic sweet-sour contrast. The structure of the PCA plots resulting from the analysis with one harvest (Chapter 3) and the analysis with the combined three harvests (Chapter 4) remained almost identical, indicating the stability of these contrasts. To relate the sensory attributes to the metabolite data and to determine the importance of the individual compounds we used Random Forest regression on the individual harvests and on the three harvests together. Several predictors for the attributes aroma, fruity/apple, sourness and sweetness were found in common between harvests, which we proposed as key-metabolites involved in flavor determination of sweet pepper (Chapter 4). This list contains compounds with known relations to attributes, like sweetness and sugars, but also several compounds with new relations. In this respect we have demonstrated for the first time, that the metabolites p-menth-1-en-9-al, (E)-\u03b2-ocimene, (Z)-2-penten-1-ol, and 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene are related to fruity/apple taste and/or sweetness of pepper. For sourness the only compound with a consistent significant contribution was an unknown C 6 H 8 O 2 compound. We postulated therefore the hypothesis that in pepper the effect of sourness related metabolites is masked by other volatile and non-volatile compounds or texture differences (Chapter 3). Subsequently in Chapter 4 we described a clear sweetness-sourness interaction and demonstrated that the masking effect of fructose and other sugars explained why we did not find organic acids contributing to the prediction of sourness. The major sensory attributes were also predicted between harvests. The Random Forest predictions of the texture related attributes (juiciness, toughness, crunchiness and stickiness of the skin) and sweetness were very good. The predictions of the attributes aroma intensity, sourness and fruity/apple were somewhat lower and more variable between harvests, especially in the second harvest. In general, we concluded that prediction of attributes with higher heritabilities works better and is more consistent over harvests (Chapter 4). Based on the results of the initial experiments (Chapter 2) the species C. baccatum was chosen for further study. To exploit the potential flavor wealth of C. baccatum PEN45 we combined interspecific crossing with embryo rescue, resulting in a multi-parent BC 2 S 1 population, that was characterized for sensory and biochemical variation (Chapter 5). We developed a population specific genetic linkage map for QTL mapping of characterized traits. Because of the complex structure of our BC 2 S 1 mapping population we encountered several limitations, such as accidental co-segregation, underrepresentation of color linked markers and pre-selection leading to skewness, which might have resulted in false positive or missed QTLs. Despite these limitations, we were still fairly well able to map several biochemical, physical and sensory traits, as demonstrated at first for the (monogenic) control traits red color and pungency in the BC 2 S 1 mapping population and in second instance by validation of genetic effects via an experiment with near-isogenic lines (NILs).This two-step approach turned out to be very powerful, since it led to the identification of the main results from this thesis: (i) Asmall C. baccatum LG3 introgression causing an extraordinary effect on flavor, which resulted in significantly higher scores for the attributes aroma, flowers, spices, celery and chives. In an attempt to identify the responsible biochemical compounds few consistently up- and down-regulated metabolites were detected, including the well-known pepper compound 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (down) and 6-methyl-4-oxo-5-heptenal (up); (ii) Two introgressions (LG10.1 and LG1) had major effects on terpenoid content of mature fruits, affecting at least fifteen different monoterpenes; (iii) A second LG3 fragment resulted in a strong increase in Brix (total soluble solids) without negative effects on fruit size (Chapter 5). In Chapter 6 some extra sensory results of the pungent genotypes are given and a comparison between the two C. baccatum pendulum BILs (PEN45 and PEN79 derived) is made in light of the overall results. Finally the perspectives for breeding are discussed and presented in the form of a flowchart for flavor improvement.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2589081567", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:99738832"}

Being a relatively new class of financial instruments there is no generally recognised pricing framework used within the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm for pricing contracts. Our novel algorithm, which is called Stochastic Model GP (SMGP), is able to generate and evolve stochastic equations of rainfall, which allows us to probabilistically transform rainfall predictions from the risky world to the risk-neutral world. In order to achieve this, SMGP's representation allows its individuals to comprise of two weighted parts, namely a seasonal component and an autoregressive component. To create the stochastic nature of an equation for each SMGP individual, we estimate the weights by using a probabilistic approach. We evaluate the models produced by SMGP in terms of rainfall predictive accuracy and in terms of pricing performance on 42 cities from Europe and the USA. We compare SMGP to 8 methods: its predecessor DGP, 5 well-known machine learning methods (M5 Rules, M5 Model trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression, Radial Basis Function), and two statistical methods, namely AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Monte Carlo Rainfall Prediction (MCRP).

An individual\u05f3s appearance is likely to change with the variation in different clothes which further compounds the problem of gait identification. The clothing differences between gallery and probe datasets capture the possible changes in their silhouette\u05f3s shape which increases the inability to discriminate between individuals. In this paper, an attempt has been made to provide a novel statistical shape analysis method based on Gait Energy Image (GEI) which is decomposed into three independent shape segmentations such as horizontal, vertical and grid resolution. The pooled segmented statistical features describe the shape of the GEI edge contour. The higher order moments about the shape centroid are likely to be invariant to small changes in silhouette shape. They implicitly describe the underlying distribution of the shape and can be used in conjunction with a set of other area based features to increase the efficacy of the classification results. The features reliability test has been performed with three classical statistical methods such as intra cloths variance (F-Statistics), inter subject distance (t-Statistics) and Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) on each set of segment of features. This analysis illustrates that combination of features holds less discrimination in comparison to grid based shape segmentation for different clothes. The similarity measurement comprises of different classification techniques (k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes\u05f3, Decision Tree (C4.5) and Random Forest) to produce acceptable recognition results on OU-ISIR dataset.

The best combination three-level classifier, the arrangement of the three best classifiers for each level in hierarchical music emotion classification is by using the SVM (Kernel: Linear) classifier at Level 1, then kNN (k = 3) at Level 2.1 and Level 2.2.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISRITI48646.2019.9034651", "venue": "2019 International Seminar on Research of Information Technology and Intelligent Systems (ISRITI)", "journal": "2019 International Seminar on Research of Information Technology and Intelligent Systems (ISRITI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3011086090", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["27761453", "16328039", "1854005", "1350330", "56103182", "33504", "468987", "54736657", "214795512", "15450102"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213188303"}

In this paper we study the problem of understanding the importance of messages in Twitter. We approach this problem in two stages. First, we perform an extensive characterization of a very large Twitter dataset which includes all users, social relations, and messages posted from the beginning of the service up to August 2009. We show evidence that information overload is present: users sometimes have to search through hundreds of messages to find those that are interesting to reply or retweet. We then identify factors that influence user response or retweet probability: previous responses to the same tweeter, the tweeter's sending rate, the age and some basic text elements of the tweet. In our second stage, we show that some of these factors can be used to improve the presentation order of tweets to the user. First, by inspecting user activity over time, we construct a simple on-off model of user behavior that allows us to infer when a user is actively using Twitter. Then, we explore two methods from machine learning for ranking tweets: a Naive Bayes predictor and a Support Vector Machine classifier. We show that it is possible to reorder tweets to increase the fraction of replied or retweeted messages appearing in the first p positions of the list by as much as 50-60%.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2309996.2310017", "venue": "HT '12", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2112262480", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14278534", "2946044", "14727973", "13708499", "8395950", "10579176", "961425", "9417635", "15556648", "36777484", "18664455", "3865671", "207168661", "1673150", "2256753", "1234838", "9973484"], "inbound_citations": ["27196062", "215461137", "11713191", "88477396", "15455828", "11572984", "13182026", "197928322", "36117004", "15372448", "11112752", "1986745", "6910081", "19159078", "13578011", "237896", "113396819", "204229682", "52304602", "214776525", "2742273", "147201157", "3423157", "15862998", "53238602", "15273880", "15273880", "7135581", "3716442", "2966999", "17040412", "18472670"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12912338"}

This work describes techniques that can be used to convert website categorization into a supervised classification problem. To do so, each data record should summarize the content of an entire website.

This solitary bee is the only representative in the Western Hemisphere of the Old World genus Lithurgus , and likely a conspecific with the Indo-Australian species Lithurgus atratus . L. huberi appears to have reached the continent at least 100 years ago, when it was discovered and described. Because this species seems to be oligolectic on pollen of Convolvulaceae flowers in South America, we attempted to integrate this biotic interaction (plant\u2013bee relationships) to our species distribution model (SDM) procedures to predict its potential distribution in South America. The modeled distribution of seven L. huberi 's host plant species did not improve the algorithms\u2019 ability to predict its distribution, but it produced constrained ranges. These results suggest that our biotic variables are not independent of the abiotic variables used (mostly related to climate). We employed five modeling algorithms, Envelope Score, GARP, Mahalanobis Distance, Support Vector Machines, and MaxEnt, but only the former two showed a good performance when predicting the occurrence of both, the host plant species and L. huberi . Our results indicate that this exotic pollinator is mainly distributed in eastern, northeastern, central, and southwestern South America, with few suitable areas in the Amazon region.

FloWPS requires training on the data for the individuals with known clinical outcomes to create a clinically relevant classifier. The genetic profiles linked with the outcomes are broken as usual into the training and validation datasets. The unique property of FloWPS is that irrelevant features in validation dataset that don\u2019t have significant number of neighboring hits in the training dataset are removed from further analyses. Next, similarly to the k nearest neighbors (kNN) method, for each point of a validation dataset, FloWPS takes into account only the proximal points of the training dataset. Thus, for every point of a validation dataset, the training dataset is adjusted to form a floating window. FloWPS performance was tested on ten gene expression datasets for 992 cancer patients either responding or not on the different types of chemotherapy.

This medicinal activity is produced by interaction of the functional groups on the ligand with a binding site on a target protein. In identifying structure-activity relations of this kind there are three principal issues: (1) It is often difficult to \"align\" the ligands in order to identify common structural properties that may be responsible for activity; (2) Ligands in solution can adopt different shapes (or `conformations') arising from torsional rotations about bonds. The 3-D molecular substructure is typically sought on one or more low-energy conformers; and (3) Pharmacophore models must, ideally, predict medicinal activity on some quantitative scale. It has been shown that the logical representation adopted by Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) naturally resolves many of the difficulties associated with the alignment and multi-conformation issues. However, the predictions of models constructed by ILP have hitherto only been nominal, predicting medicinal activity to be present or absent. In this paper, we investigate the construction of two kinds of quantitative pharmacophoric models with ILP: (a) Models that predict the probability that a ligand is \"active\"; and (b) Models that predict the actual medicinal activity of a ligand. Quantitative predictions are obtained by the utilising the following statistical procedures as background knowledge: logistic regression and naive Bayes, for probability prediction; linear and kernel regression, for activity prediction. The multi-conformation issue and, more generally, the relational representation used by ILP results in some special difficulties in the use of any statistical procedure. We present the principal issues and some solutions. Specifically, using data on the inhibition of the protease Thermolysin, we demonstrate that it is possible for an ILP program to construct good quantitative structure-activity models.

The realization of the advantage often requires the ability to load classical data efficiently into quantum states. However, the best known methods require $${\\mathcal{O}}\\left({2}^{n}\\right)$$ gates to load an exact representation of a generic data structure into an $$n$$-qubit state. This scaling can easily predominate the complexity of a quantum algorithm and, thereby, impair potential quantum advantage. Our work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for efficient, approximate quantum state loading. More precisely, we use quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) to facilitate efficient learning and loading of generic probability distributions - implicitly given by data samples - into quantum states. Through the interplay of a quantum channel, such as a variational quantum circuit, and a classical neural network, the qGAN can learn a representation of the probability distribution underlying the data samples and load it into a quantum state. The loading requires $${\\mathcal{O}}\\left(poly\\left(n\\right)\\right)$$ gates and can thus enable the use of potentially advantageous quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Amplitude Estimation. We implement the qGAN distribution learning and loading method with Qiskit and test it using a quantum simulation as well as actual quantum processors provided by the IBM Q Experience.

Although classification and outlier detection appear as different problems, their theoretical underpinnings are quite similar in terms of the bias-variance trade-off [1], where outlier detection is considered as a binary classification task with unobserved labels but a similar bias-variance decomposition of error. ::: In this paper, we propose a sequential ensemble approach called CARE that employs a two-phase aggregation of the intermediate results in each iteration to reach the final outcome. Unlike existing outlier ensembles which solely incorporate a parallel framework by aggregating the outcomes of independent base detectors to reduce variance, our ensemble incorporates both the parallel and sequential building blocks to reduce bias as well as variance by ($i$) successively eliminating outliers from the original dataset to build a better data model on which outlierness is estimated (sequentially), and ($ii$) combining the results from individual base detectors and across iterations (parallelly). Through extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets mainly from the UCI machine learning repository [2], we show that CARE performs significantly better than or at least similar to the individual baselines.

Models were trained on 80%, while 20% were set aside for validation testing. Baseline information and standard grading scales were evaluated: age, sex, Hunt Hess grade, modified Fisher Scale (mFS), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). An unsupervised approach applying random kernels was used to extract features from physiological time series (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation). Classifiers (Partial Least Squares, linear and kernel Support Vector Machines) were trained on feature subsets of the derivation dataset. Models were applied to the validation dataset. The performances of the best classifiers on the validation dataset are reported by feature subset. Standard grading scale (mFS): AUC 0.58. Combined demographics and grading scales: AUC 0.60.

The majority of prostate cancer studies focused on individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) while SNP-SNP interactions are suggested having a great impact on unveiling the underlying mechanism of complex disease. Using 1,151 prostate cancer patients in the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) dataset, 2,651 SNPs in the angiogenesis genes associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness were evaluated. SNP-SNP interactions were primarily assessed using the two-stage Random Forests plus Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (TRM) approach in the CGEMS group, and were then re-evaluated in the Moffitt group with 1,040 patients. For the identified gene pairs, cross-evaluation was applied to evaluate SNP interactions in both study groups. Five SNP-SNP interactions in three gene pairs (MMP16+ ROBO1, MMP16+ CSF1, and MMP16+ EGFR) were identified to be associated with aggressive prostate cancer in both groups. Three pairs of SNPs (rs1477908+ rs1387665, rs1467251+ rs7625555, and rs1824717+ rs7625555) were in MMP16 and ROBO1, one pair (rs2176771+ rs333970) in MMP16 and CSF1, and one pair (rs1401862+ rs6964705) in MMP16 and EGFR. The results suggest that MMP16 may play an important role in prostate cancer aggressiveness. By integrating our novel findings and available biomedical literature, a hypothetical gene interaction network was proposed.

Recent Machine learning techniques, like e.g. the Support Vector Machines, own a remarkable generalization ability and are among the first choices to confront such complex data. However, the black-box structure of most machine learning algorithms constitutes a significant drawback. On the other hand, Fuzzy rule based systems form an attractive alternative since they result in linguistically, interpretable rules, but suffer from the problem of overfitting and are sensitive to the curse of dimensionality. In order to merge the advantages of both approaches Support Vector algorithms have been adapted for the identification of a Support Vector Fuzzy Inference (SVFI) system. However, although the high generalization performance of the SVM approach is retained, the SVFI rules usually lack understandability. The paper proposes the derivation of a simpler fuzzy system that approximates the accurate set of rules keeping only the more important aspects of the data. The approximation algorithms either receive an a priori description of a set of fuzzy sets or, especially for the case when interpretable fuzzy sets cannot be prespecified by the experts, an algorithm is presented for building them automatically. After the construction of the interpretable fuzzy partitions, the developed algorithms extract from the SVFI rules a small and consice set of interpretable rules. Finally, the Pseudo-Outer Product (POP) fuzzy rule selection orders the interpretable rules by using a Hebbian like evaluation in order to present the designer with the most capable rules.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "49262363", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["58195663", "5101951", "207788608", "1894191", "961425", "121424630", "11178847", "30842856", "53763080", "647501"], "inbound_citations": ["50479473", "17193191", "17156377"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55245444"}

The ambiguity in the values is due to the fact that the PTWs are particularly difficult to detect because of their unknown interactions with the other vehicles on the road.

A skeleton-indexed feature learning procedure is developed to further exploit the detailed local features from RGB and optical flow videos. In particular, the proposed framework is built based on a deep Convolutional Network (ConvNet) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). A skeleton-indexed transform layer is designed to automatically extract visual features around key joints, and a part-aggregated pooling is developed to uniformly regulate the visual features from different body parts and actors. Besides, several fusion schemes are explored to take advantage of multi-modal data.

However, due to the autoregressive factorization nature, these models suffer from heavy latency during inference. Recently, non-autoregressive sequence models were proposed to speed up the inference time. However, these models assume that the decoding process of each token is conditionally independent of others. Such a generation process sometimes makes the output sentence inconsistent, and thus the learned non-autoregressive models could only achieve inferior accuracy compared to their autoregressive counterparts. To improve then decoding consistency and reduce the inference cost at the same time, we propose to incorporate a structured inference module into the non-autoregressive models. Specifically, we design an efficient approximation for Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for non-autoregressive sequence models, and further propose a dynamic transition technique to model positional contexts in the CRF. Experiments in machine translation show that while increasing little latency (8~14ms, our model could achieve significantly better translation performance than previous non-autoregressive models on different translation datasets. In particular, for the WMT14 En-De dataset, our model obtains a BLEU score of 26.80, which largely outperforms the previous non-autoregressive baselines and is only 0.61 lower in BLEU than purely autoregressive models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1910.11555", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2981648103,2990389671", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["13756489", "3603249", "5590763", "61556494", "3648736", "127627301", "67855400", "3438497", "277918", "7200347", "8451212", "4720016", "44089406", "56169317", "6210126", "6961760", "351666", "2952144", "3988816", "775373", "14096841", "3718988", "56895270", "6628106", "206593880", "11080756"], "inbound_citations": ["214795061", "210911571", "211076379", "210698654", "211068728"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204916079"}

For example, their deployment in automated border control gates plays a crucial role in accurate document authentication and reduced traveller flow rates in congested border zones. The proliferation of such systems is further spurred by the advent of portable devices. On the one hand, modern smartphone and tablet cameras have in-built user authentication applications while on the other hand, their displays are being consistently exploited for face spoofing. Similar to biometric systems of other physiological biometric identifiers, face biometric systems have their own unique set of potential vulnerabilities. In this work, these vulnerabilities (presentation attacks) are being explored via a biologically-inspired presentation attack detection model which is termed \u2018BIOPAD\u2019. Our model employs Gabor features in a feedforward hierarchical structure of layers that progressively process and train from visual information of people\u2019s faces, along with their presentation attacks, in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. BIOPAD\u2019s performance is directly compared with other popular biologically-inspired layered models such as the \u2018Hierarchical Model And X\u2019 (HMAX) that applies similar handcrafted features, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that discover low-level features through stochastic descent training. BIOPAD shows superior performance to both HMAX and CNN in all of the three presentation attack databases examined and these results were consistent in two different classifiers (Support Vector Machine and k-nearest neighbour). In certain cases, our findings have shown that BIOPAD can produce authentication rates with 99% accuracy. Finally, we further introduce a new presentation attack database with visible and near-infrared information for direct comparisons. Overall, BIOPAD\u2019s operation, which is to fuse information from different spectral bands at both feature and score levels for the purpose of face presentation attack detection, has never been attempted before with a biologically-inspired algorithm.

Although conventional change detection methods may be used to assess the building damage, the analysis is directed to all classes, both damaged and undamaged, but is not focused on the class of interest. In this paper, we proposed to detect the building damage in urban environments from multitemporal VHR image data using the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), a recently developed one-class classifier, which requires training samples from the building damage only. This was illustrated with building damage detection in an urban environment from multitemporal Quickbird images. The detection was conducted at pixel level and object level. Different input vectors for the OCSVM classifier were tested in order to assess the discrimination power of spectral and spatial features: pixel level spectral features and texture features, as well as object-based features.

To address this, we propose an Adversarial Similarity Metric Learning (ASML) method in this paper. More specifically, ASML consists of two adversarial phases: confusion and discrimination. In confusion phase, ambiguous adversarial pairs are automatically generated to challenge the learned similarity metric; while in discrimination phase, the learned metric tries its best to adjust itself to distinguish both the original pairs and the generated adversarial pairs. Consequently, a robust and discriminative similarity metric can be learned by iteratively performing the two adversarial phases.

Waiting time uncertainty can cause patients, who are already sick or in pain, to worry about when they will receive the care they need. These waiting periods are often difficult for staff to predict and only rough estimates are typically provided based on personal experience. This level of uncertainty leaves most patients unable to plan their calendar, making the waiting experience uncomfortable, even painful. In the present era of electronic health records (EHRs), waiting times need not be so uncertain. Extensive EHRs provide unprecedented amounts of data that can statistically cluster towards representative values when appropriate patient cohorts are selected. Predictive modelling, such as machine learning, is a powerful approach that benefits from large, potentially complex, datasets. The essence of machine learning is to predict future outcomes by learning from previous experience. The application of a machine learning algorithm to waiting time data has the potential to produce personalized waiting time predictions such that the uncertainty may be removed from the patient's waiting experience. ::: ::: Methods: ::: In radiation oncology, patients typically experience several types of waiting (eg waiting at home for treatment planning, waiting in the waiting room for oncologist appointments and daily waiting in the waiting room for radiotherapy treatments). A daily treatment wait time model is discussed in this report. To develop a prediction model using our large dataset (with more than 100k sample points) a variety of machine learning algorithms from the Python package sklearn were tested. ::: ::: Results: ::: We found that the Random Forest Regressor model provides the best predictions for daily radiotherapy treatment waiting times. Using this model, we achieved a median residual (actual value minus predicted value) of 0.25 minutes and a standard deviation residual of 6.5 minutes. This means that the majority of our estimates are within 6.5 minutes of the actual wait time. ::: ::: Conclusion: ::: The goal of this project was to define an appropriate machine learning algorithm to estimate waiting times based on the collective knowledge and experience learned from previous patients. Our results offer an opportunity to improve the information that is provided to patients and family members regarding the amount of time they can expect to wait for radiotherapy treatment at our centre. ::: ::: AJ acknowledges support by the CREATE Medical Physics Research Training Network grant of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Grant number: 432290) and from the 2014 Q+ Initiative of the McGill University Health Centre.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28047670", "doi": "10.1118/1.4955727", "venue": "Medical physics", "journal": "Medical physics", "mag_id": "2461510999", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204971533"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:39632620"}

The conventional paddy crop stress identification and classification activities invariably rely on human experts to identify visual symptoms as a means of categorization.

The proposed work presented in this paper aims to develop an automated computer vision system for the recognition and classification of paddy crop stress types from the field images using the state-of-the-art color features. The work examines the impact of eleven stress types, two biotic and nine abiotic stresses, on five different paddy crop varieties during the booting growth stage using field images and analyzes the stress responses in terms of color variations using lower-order color moments and two visual color descriptors defined by the MPEG-7 standard, the Dominant Color Descriptor (DCD) and Color Layout Descriptor (CLD). The Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS) algorithm has been employed to reduce the overlapping between the features. Three different classifiers, the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), the Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) have been deployed to distinguish among stress types. The average stress classification accuracies of 89.12%, 84.44% and 76.34% have been achieved using the BPNN, SVM, and k-NN classifiers, respectively.

The nucleotide sequences of maturaseK (matK) and ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) marker loci are commonly used in plant species identification. Here, we present a new and highly efficient approach for identifying a unique set of discriminating nucleotide patterns to generate a signature (i.e. regular expression) for plant species identification. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: In order to generate molecular signatures, we used matK and rbcL loci datasets, which encompass 125 plant species in 52 genera reported by the CBOL plant working group. Initially, we performed Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of all species followed by Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) for both loci to achieve a percentage of discrimination among species. Further, we detected Discriminating Patterns (DP) at genus and species level using PSSM for the matK dataset. Combining DP and consecutive pattern distances, we generated molecular signatures for each species. Finally, we performed a comparative assessment of these signatures with the existing methods including BLASTn, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Jrip-RIPPER, J48 (C4.5 algorithm), and the Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) methods against NCBI-GenBank matK dataset. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Due to the higher discrimination success obtained with the matK as compared to the rbcL, we selected matK gene for signature generation. We generated signatures for 60 species based on identified discriminating patterns at genus and species level. Our comparative assessment results suggest that a total of 46 out of 60 species could be correctly identified using generated signatures, followed by BLASTn (34 species), SVM (18 species), C4.5 (7 species), NB (4 species) and RIPPER (3 species) methods As a final outcome of this study, we converted signatures into QR codes and developed a software matK-QR Classifier (http://www.neeri.res.in/matk_classifier/index.htm), which search signatures in the query matK gene sequences and predict corresponding plant species. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: This novel approach of employing pattern-based signatures opens new avenues for the classification of species. In addition to existing methods, we believe that matK-QR Classifier would be a valuable tool for molecular taxonomists enabling precise identification of plant species.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5148893", "pubmed_id": "27990177", "doi": "10.1186/s13040-016-0120-6", "venue": "BioData Mining", "journal": "BioData Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2559759650", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["9907697", "9349456", "73552779", "6517747", "23508481", "35372844", "6582983", "24131362", "29377266", "4979478", "43060183", "206946560", "9679923", "28440369", "8017302", "30246976", "13206476", "3257689", "10539149", "19320654", "7337180", "17448330", "82421255", "15563751", "5122852", "8151483", "4057355", "8323728", "33201614", "32780545", "38666829", "6621019", "24636291", "16421618"], "inbound_citations": ["71148033"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9201430"}

Texts were mined using the closed-vocabulary approach based on the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) semantic dictionary, and an open-vocabulary approach performed via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Then, we examined associations between emerging textual features and alcohol-drinking scores as assessed using the AUDIT-C questionnaire. As a final aim, we employed the Random Forest machine-learning algorithm to determine and compare the predictive accuracy of closed- and open-vocabulary features over users' AUDIT-C scores. We found use of words about family, school, and positive feelings and emotions to be negatively associated with alcohol use and problematic drinking, while words suggesting interest in sport events, politics and economics, nightlife, and use of coarse language were more frequent among problematic drinkers. Results coming from LIWC and LDA analyses were quite similar, but LDA added information that could not be retrieved only with LIWC analysis. Furthermore, open-vocabulary features outperformed closed-vocabulary features in terms of predictive power over participants\u2019 AUDIT-C scores (r = .46 vs. r = .28, respectively).

Current advancements in automated detection have not achieved a sensitive measure for classifying early lameness; it remains to be a key challenge to be solved. The state-of-the-art also lacks behind on other aspects e.g. robust feature detection from a cow's body and the identification of the lame leg/side. This multidisciplinary research addresses the above issues by proposing an overhead, non-intrusive and covert 3-Dimensional (3D) video setup. This facilitates an automated process in order to record freely walking Holstein dairy cows at a commercial farm scale, in an unconstrained environment. ::: ::: The 3D data of the cow's body have been used to automatically track key regions such as the hook bones and the spine using a curvedness feature descriptor which operates at a high detection accuracy (100% for the spine, >97% for the hooks). From these tracked regions, two locomotion traits have been developed. First, motivated by a novel biomechanical approach, a proxy for the animal's gait asymmetry is introduced. This dynamic proxy is derived from the height variations in the hip joint (hooks) during walking, and extrapolated into right/left vertical leg motion signals. This proxy is evidently affected by minor lameness and directly contributes in identifying the lame leg. Second, back posture, which is analysed using two cubic-fit curvatures (X-Z plane and X-Y plane) from the spine region. The X-Z plane curvature is used to assess the spine's arch as an early lameness trait, while the X-Y plane curvature provides a novel definition for localising the lame side. ::: ::: Objective variables were extracted from both traits to be trained using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Validation is made against ground truth data manually scored using a 1\u20135 locomotion scoring (LS) system, which consist of two datasets, 23 sessions and 60 sessions of walking cows. A threshold has been identified between LS 1 and 2 (and above). This boundary is important as it represents the earliest point in time at which a cow is considered lame, and its early detection could improve intervention outcome, thereby minimising losses and reducing animal suffering. The threshold achieved an accuracy of 95.7% with a 100% sensitivity (detecting lame cows), and 75% specificity (detecting non-lame cows) on dataset 1 and an accuracy of 88.3% with an 88% sensitivity and 92% specificity on dataset 2. Thereby outperforming the state-of-the-art at a stricter lameness boundary. The 3D video based multi-trait detection strives towards providing a comprehensive locomotion assessment on dairy farms.

Traditional experimental methods are expensive and time-consuming for detecting DTIs. Therefore, computational approaches provide many effective strategies to deal with this issue.

In this paper, we propose a novel computational model of DTIs prediction, based on machine learning methods. To improve the performance of prediction, we further use molecular substructure fingerprints, Multivariate Mutual Information (MMI) of proteins and network topology to represent drugs, targets and relationship between them.

In typical multi-objective optimization algorithms, such as Indicator-based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA), all of parents and offspring need to be evaluated in every generation, and then the better solutions of them are selected as the next generation candidates. This leads to a large amount of calculation and slows down convergence rate for IBEA related applications. Our discovery is that the evaluation of evolutionary algorithm is a binary classification in nature and a meaningful preselection method will accelerate the convergence rate. Therefore this paper presents a novel preselection approach to improve the performance of the IBEA, in which a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier is adopted to sort the promising solutions from unpromising solutions and then the newly generated solutions are conversely added as train sample to increase the accuracy of the classifier. Firstly, we proposed an online and asynchronous training method for SVM model with empirical kernel. The initial population is randomly generated among population size, which is used as initial training. In the process of training, SVM classifier is modified and perfected to adapt to the evolutionary algorithm sample. Secondly, the classifier divides all the new generated solutions from the whole solution spaces into promising solutions and unpromising ones. And only the promising ones are forwarded for evaluation. In this way, the evaluation time can be greatly reduced and the solution quality can be obviously improved. Thirdly, the promising and unpromising solutions are labeled as new train samples in next generation to refine classifier model. A number of experiments on benchmark functions validates the proposed approach.

This paper addresses the deraining problem from a completely different perspective of feature-wise disentanglement, and introduces the interactions and constraints between two disentangled latent spaces. Specifically, we propose an Asynchronous Interactive Generative Adversarial Network (AI-GAN) to progressively disentangle the rainy image into background and rain spaces in feature level through a two-branch structure. Each branch employs a two-stage synthesis strategy and interacts asynchronously by exchanging feed-forward information and sharing feedback gradients, achieving complementary adversarial optimization. This \u2018adversarial\u2019 is not only the \u2018adversarial\u2019 between the generator and the discriminator, but also means that the two generators are entangled, and interact with each other in the optimization process.

In this paper, an alternative method, greedy stagewise algorithm for SVMs, named GS-SVMs, is presented to cope with the overfitting of HM-SVMs without employing the regularization term. The most attractive property of GS-SVMs is that its computational complexity in the worst case only scales quadratically with the size of training samples.

Considering that each complex action is composed of a sequence of simple actions which can be easily obtained from existing data sets, this paper presents a simple to complex action transfer learning model (SCA-TLM) for complex human action recognition. SCA-TLM improves the performance of complex action recognition by leveraging the abundant labeled simple actions. In particular, it optimizes the weight parameters, enabling the complex actions to be learned to be reconstructed by simple actions. The optimal reconstruct coefficients are acquired by minimizing the objective function, and the target weight parameters are then represented as a combination of source weight parameters. The main advantage of the proposed SCA-TLM compared with existing approaches is that we exploit simple actions to recognize complex actions instead of only using complex actions as training samples.

To involve the unlabelled data, most existing SSL methods are based on common density-based cluster assumption: samples lying in the same high-density region are likely to belong to the same class, including the methods performing consistency regularization or generating pseudo-labels for the unlabelled images. Despite their impressive performance, we argue three limitations exist: 1) Though the density information is demonstrated to be an important clue, they all use it in an implicit way and have not exploited it in depth. 2) For feature learning, they often learn the feature embedding based on the single data sample and ignore the neighborhood information. 3) For label-propagation based pseudo-label generation, it is often done offline and difficult to be end-to-end trained with feature learning. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes to solve the SSL problem by building a novel density-aware graph, based on which the neighborhood information can be easily leveraged and the feature learning and label propagation can also be trained in an end-to-end way. Specifically, we first propose a new Density-aware Neighborhood Aggregation(DNA) module to learn more discriminative features by incorporating the neighborhood information in a density-aware manner. Then a novel Density-ascending Path based Label Propagation(DPLP) module is proposed to generate the pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples more efficiently according to the feature distribution characterized by density. Finally, the DNA module and DPLP module evolve and improve each other end-to-end.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.13194", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3013978485", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["108297336", "146808485", "46422691", "14283441", "206597351", "7890982", "4755450", "199577414", "206594692", "104291869", "202541560", "3144218", "18268744", "18507866", "199577547", "4381935", "13748870", "206550568", "201650656", "206756462", "52958532", "3292002", "73729288", "8909022", "52895589", "3162051", "198967789", "116930672", "88523028"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214713684"}

Developers both contribute effort in the form of patches and demand effort from the component maintainers to resolve issues reported against it. Open source components depend on each other directly and transitively, and evidence suggests that more effort is required for reporting and resolving the issues reported further upstream in this supply chain. Aim: Identify and characterize patterns of effort contribution and demand throughout the open source supply chain and investigate if and how these patterns vary with developer activity; identify different groups of developers; and predict developers' company affiliation based on their participation patterns. Method: 1,376,946 issues and pull-requests created for 4433 NPM packages with over 10,000 monthly downloads and full (public) commit activity data of the 272,142 issue creators is obtained and analyzed and dependencies on NPM packages are identified. Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is used to find the groups among the users based on their effort contribution and demand patterns, and Random Forest is used as the predictive modeling technique to identify their company affiliations. Result: Users contribute and demand effort primarily from packages that they depend on directly with only a tiny fraction of contributions and demand going to transitive dependencies. A significant portion of demand goes into packages outside the users' respective supply chains (constructed based on publicly visible version control data). Three and two different groups of users are observed based on the effort demand and effort contribution patterns respectively. The Random Forest model used for identifying the company affiliation of the users gives a AUC-ROC value of 0.68, and variables representing aggregate participation patterns proved to be the important predictors.

Looking at the preliminary results, the integration of X- and C-band images does provide valuable information for the retrieval of SMC, while the simulated CP parameters exhibit a certain sensitivity to SMC. On the South Tyrol test area, both SVR and ANN tested with different combinations of RS2 and CSK data were able to retrieve SMC with a RMSE between 2% and 4% of SMC and correlation coefficient R between 0.85 and 0.97, depending on the combination of inputs.

This is achieved in three steps: we i) identify the top-level structure (headings) of the report, ii) classify the report content into the top-level headings, iii) convert the free-text detailed findings in the report to a semi-structured format (post-structuring). Top level structure and content of report were predicted with an F1 score of 0.97 and 0.94, respectively using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. For automatic structuring, our proposed hierarchical Conditional Random Field (CRF) outperformed the baseline CRF with an F1 score of 0.78 vs 0.71. The determined structure of the report is represented in semi-structured XML format of the free-text report, which helps to easily visualize the conformance of the findings to the protocols. This format also allows easy extraction of specific information for other purposes such as search, evaluation and research.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31059453", "doi": "10.1109/TCBB.2019.2914678", "venue": "IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics", "journal": "IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics", "mag_id": "2943444949", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202718297"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:146811175"}

Most annotations of PPIs mix experimental and computational data. The mix optimizes coverage, but obfuscates the annotation origin. Some resources excel at focusing on reliable experimental data. Here, we focused on new pairs of interacting proteins for several model organisms based solely on sequence-based prediction methods. Results We extracted reliable experimental data about which proteins interact (binary) for eight diverse model organisms from public databases, namely from Escherichia coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and for the previously used Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Those data were the base to develop a PPI prediction method for each model organism. The method used evolutionary information through a profile-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM). With the resulting eight models, we predicted all possible protein pairs in each organism and made the top predictions available through a web application. Almost all of the PPIs made available were predicted between proteins that have not been observed in any interaction, in particular for less well-studied organisms. Thus, our work complements existing resources and is particularly helpful for designing experiments because of its uniqueness. Experimental annotations and computational predictions are strongly influenced by the fact that some proteins have many partners and others few. To optimize machine learning, the newly methods explicitly ignored such a network-structure and rely either on domain knowledge or sequence-only methods. Our approach is independent of domain-knowledge and leverages evolutionary information.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed metrics we have compared the prediction performances of several models based on supervised learning approaches among those most used in literature. As a result, we obtained that the Random Forest approach is able to predict the music album rank in the Billboard 200 Chart with an expected accuracy of 97%.

Lots of computing time would be spent on tuning parameters. In order to reduce this workload, we proposed using L-1 SVM instead of L-2 SVM for LUPI in our previous work. Different from LUPI with L-2 SVM, which is formulated as quadratic programming, LUPI with L-1 SVM is essentially a linear programming and is computationally much cheaper. On this basis, we discuss how to employ the wisdom from teachers better and more flexible by LUPI with L-1 SVM in this paper. By introducing kernels, an extended L-1 SVM model, which is still a linear programming, is proposed.

Materials and Methods 102 patients with histopathologically proven PDAC were retrospectively assessed as the training cohort and 30 prospectively enrolled patients served as the external validation cohort. Tumors were segmented in pre-operative diffusion weighted-(DW)-MRI derived ADC maps and radiomic features were extracted. A Random Forest machine learning algorithm was fit to the training cohort and tested in the external validation cohort. The histopathological subtype of the tumor samples was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 21/30 patients of the external validation cohort. Individual radiomic feature importance was evaluated. Results The machine learning algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 80% (ROC-AUC 90%) for the prediction of above- vs. below-median survival on the unseen data of the external validation cohort. Heterogeneity-related features were highly ranked by the model. Of the 21 patients for whom the histopathological subtype was determined, 8/9 patients predicted by the model to experience below-median overall survival exhibited the quasi-mesenchymal subtype, while 11/12 patients predicted to experience above-median survival exhibited a non-quasi-mesenchymal subtype (Fisher\u2019s exact test P<0.001). Conclusion The application of machine-learning to the radiomic analysis of DW-MRI-derived ADC maps allowed the prediction of overall survival with high diagnostic accuracy in a prospectively collected cohort.

Complexity gets compounded as we move from airborne hyperspectral to Spaceborne technology. It is unclear how different classification algorithms will perform on a complex scene of tropical forests collected by spaceborne hyperspectral sensor. The present study was carried out to evaluate the performance of three different classifiers (Artificial Neural Network, Spectral Angle Mapper, Support Vector Machine) over highly diverse tropical forest vegetation utilizing hyperspectral (EO-1) data. Appropriate band selection was done by Stepwise Discriminant Analysis. The Stepwise Discriminant Analysis resulted in identifying 22 best bands to discriminate the eight identified tropical vegetation classes. Maximum numbers of bands came from SWIR region. ANN classifier gave highest OAA values of 81% with the help of 22 selected bands from SDA. The image classified with the help SVM showed OAA of 71%, whereas the SAM showed the lowest OAA of 66%. All the three classifiers were also tested to check their efficiency in classifying spectra coming from 165 processed bands. SVM showed highest OAA of 80%. Classified subset images coming from ANN (from 22 bands) and SVM (from 165 bands) are quite similar in showing the distribution of eight vegetation classes.

The first method, Random Project, employs a random projection matrix to produce linear combinations of input features, while the second method, Random Boost, employs random feature selection to enhance the performance of the Logit Boost algorithm. Random Boost is, in fact, a combination of Logit Boost and Random Forest. Experimental results, using TREC and CEAS as challenging spam benchmark sets, show that the Random Boost method significantly improves the performance of the spam filter compared to the Logit Boost algorithm (e.g., a 5% increase in AUC, which is the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve), and yields similar classification accuracy compared to the Random Forest method but using only one fourth the runtime complexity of the Random Forest algorithm.

Distinguishing among these diseases is challenging to physicians due their wide variety and unknown causes. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is a useful approach to improve diagnostic accuracy, by combining information provided by experts with Machine Learning (ML) methods. Objectives Exploring the potential of dimensionality reduction combined with ML methods for diagnosis of DLDs; improving the classification accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. Methods A data set composed of 3252 regions of interest (ROIs) was used, from which 28 features were extracted per ROI. We used Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Stepwise Selection \u2013 Forward, Backward, and Forward-Backward to reduce feature dimensionality. The feature subsets obtained were used as input to the following ML methods: Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Mixture Model, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Deep Feedforward Neural Network. We also applied a Deep Convolutional Neural Network directly to the ROIs. Results We achieved the maximum reduction from 28 to 5 dimensions using LDA.

Therefore, considering the statistical properties of the status data change over time in unforeseen ways if intrusions occur, we propose a concept drift based ensemble incremental learning approach in IDS (CDIL).

However, manual quality control procedures are often time-consuming and error-prone. In order to meet the growing demand for high-quality products, the use of intelligent visual inspection systems is becoming essential in production lines. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performance in both image classification and localization tasks. In this article, a system is proposed for the identification of casting defects in X-ray images, based on the Mask Region-based CNN architecture. The proposed defect detection system simultaneously performs defect detection and segmentation on input images, making it suitable for a range of defect detection tasks. It is shown that training the network to simultaneously perform defect detection and defect instance segmentation, results in a higher defect detection accuracy than training on defect detection alone. Transfer learning is leveraged to reduce the training data demands and increase the prediction accuracy of the trained model. More specifically, the model is first trained with two large openly-available image datasets before finetuning on a relatively small metal casting X-ray dataset. The accuracy of the trained model exceeds state-of-the art performance on the GRIMA database of X-ray images (GDXray) Castings dataset and is fast enough to be used in a production setting. The system also performs well on the GDXray Welds dataset.

However, there is a trade-off between computation time (speed) and accuracy among clustering algorithms. Specifically, general type-2 fuzzy c-means (GT2 FCM) is considered to be a highly accurate clustering approach, but it is computationally intensive. To improve its computation time we propose a hybrid clustering algorithm called KFGT2FCM that combines GT2 FCM with two fast algorithms k-means and Fuzzy C-means algorithm for input data preprocessing of classification algorithms.

Hyperspectral remote sensing has proved to be valuable for estimation of vegetation biophysical parameters such as biomass using different statistical techniques.

The aim of this study was to examine the prospect of above ground biomass estimation in a heterogeneous Mediterranean rangeland employing multivariate calibration methods. Canopy spectral measurements were made in the field using a GER 3700 spectroradiometer, along with concomitant in situ measurements of above ground biomass for 170 sample plots. Multivariate calibrations including partial least squares regression (PLSR), principal component regression (PCR), and Least-Squared Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) were used to estimate the above ground biomass. The prediction accuracy of the multivariate calibration methods were assessed using cross validated R2 and RMSE. The best model performance was obtained using LS_SVM and then PLSR both calibrated with first derivative reflectance dataset with R2CV=0.88 & 0.86 and RMSECV=1.15 & 1.07 respectively. The weakest prediction accuracy was appeared when PCR were used (R2CV = 0.31 and RMSECV= 2.48).

Changes of trabecular bone structure throughout the proximal tibia are indicative of several musculoskeletal disorders involving changes in the bone quality and the surrounding soft tissue. Recent studies have shown that MR imaging also allows non-invasive 3-D characterization of bone microstructure. Sophisticated features like the scaling index method (SIM) can estimate local structural and geometric properties of the trabecular bone and may improve the ability of MR imaging to determine local bone quality in vivo. A set of 67 bone cubes was extracted from knee specimens and their biomechanical strength estimated by the yield stress (YS) [in MPa] was determined through mechanical testing. The regional apparent bone volume fraction (BVF) and SIM derived features were calculated for each bone cube. A linear multiregression analysis (MultiReg) and a optimized support vector regression (SVR) algorithm were used to predict the YS from the image features. The prediction accuracy was measured by the root mean square error (RMSE) for each image feature on independent test sets. The best prediction result with the lowest prediction error of RMSE = 1.021 MPa was obtained with a combination of BVF and SIM features and by using SVR. The prediction accuracy with only SIM features and SVR (RMSE = 1.023 MPa) was still significantly better than BVF alone and MultiReg (RMSE = 1.073 MPa).

It affects not only the subsequent production, but also the quality of the end-products. However, due to the rare occurrence and appearance variations of defects, surface defect identification of steels has always been a challenging task. Recently, deep learning methods have shown outstanding performance in image classification, especially when there are enough training samples. Since most sample images of steel surface are unlabeled, a new semi-supervised learning method is proposed to classify surface defects of steels. The new method is named CAE-SGAN, as it is based on Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) and semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAN). CAE-SGAN first trains a stacked CAE through massive unlabeled data. Considering the appearance variations of defects, the passthrough layer is used to help CAE extract fine-grained features. After CAE is trained, the encoder network of CAE is reserved as the feature extractor and fed into a softmax layer to form a new classifier. SGAN is introduced for semi-supervised learning to further improve the generalization ability of the new method. The classifier is trained with images collected from real production lines and images randomly generated by SGAN. Extensive experiments are carried out with samples captured from different steel production lines, and the results indicate that CAE-SGAN had yielded best performances compared with traditional methods. Especially for hot rolled plates, the classification rate is improved by around 16%.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.optlaseng.2019.01.011", "venue": null, "journal": "Optics and Lasers in Engineering", "mag_id": "2912069721", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201235197", "214594489", "211121607", "210177304", "207923827", "207923827", "212665971", "207971879"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126642866"}

Commonly employed data inversion techniques, such as the one based on maximum likelihood theory, require the direct model which describes the way the data are generated by the system under test. When the needed model is not available or is too much difficult to be handled, a suitable analytical approximation of it could be used instead. In these cases, the artificial neural networks proved to be effective because of their well known function approximation and system identification capabilities.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "201322731", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107297544"}

In this paper, we propose a novel parameter tuning approach for SVM via kernel matrix approximation, based on the observation that approximate computation is sufficient for parameter tuning. We first develop a preliminary approximate computation theory of parameter tuning for SVM. We present a kernel matrix approximation algorithm MoCIC. We design an approximate parameter tuning algorithm APT, which applies MoCIC to compute a low-dimension and low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix, and uses this approximate matrix to efficiently solve the quadratic programming of SVM, then selects the optimal candidate parameter through the approximate cross validation error (ACVE). Finally, we verify and compare the feasibility and efficiency of APT on 10 artificial and benchmark datasets.

One solution to addressing this gap in education has been the proposal of Intelligent Tutoring Systems which promised to deliver adaptive learning experience to improve student learning outcomes. Unfortunately, results have been less than satisfactory - one factor attributing to this poor performance is that such systems fail to adapt to varying student learning needs. To investigate how this poor performance can be improved upon, this paper examines several incremental machine learning techniques by incorporating them in intelligent tutor systems to evaluate their performance for adaptive pedagogy to determine the most appropriate incremental machine learning technique for implementation in intelligent tutor systems.

Results obtained from training the three methods using the same datasets revealed that the naive Bayes outperformed the k-NN and the SVMs. The results led to the conclusion that Naive Bayes would perform well when implemented for pedagogical decision-making in ITSs.

To overcome this, the biased intrusion detection system is used for detecting the intrusion with encrypted date, time, and file location with less false-positive and false-negative rates and thereby preventing the SCADA system from further intrusion. It is done in three phases. First, Modified Grey Wolf Optimization (MGWO) is used to extract the features needed for classification and to find the best weight. Second, Entropy-based Extreme Learning Machine (EELM) is used to extort the features and detect the intruded data with its intruded time, file location, and date. Finally, the data are encrypted using the Hybrid Elliptical Curve Cryptography (HECC) to prevent further attack. Experimental results show better accuracy in both detection as well as prevention.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2019/1082485", "venue": "Security and Communication Networks", "journal": "Security and Communication Networks", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2991409407", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5055958", "53807250", "14156757", "38310166", "9012233", "13191427", "113474011", "145927659", "14678902", "52075253", "63687838", "17386653", "1867465", "46461988", "18534615"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209325208"}

It only requires users to specify the training data source, the classification algorithm and the desired parallelization level. First, a distributed stratified sampling algorithm is proposed to generate stratified samples from large, pre-partitioned datasets in a shared-nothing architecture. It executes in a single pass over the data and minimizes inter-machine communication. Second, the specified classification algorithm training is parallelized and executed on any number of heterogeneous machines. Finally, the trained classifiers are aggregated to produce the final classifier. Data miners can use LADEL to run any classification algorithm on any distributed framework, without any experience in parallel and distributed systems. The proposed LADEL model can be implemented on any distributed framework (Drill, Spark, Hadoop, etc.) to speed up the development of its data mining capabilities. It is also generic and can be used to distribute the training of any classification algorithm of any sequential single-node data mining library (Weka, R, scikit-learn, etc.). Distributed frameworks can implement LADEL to distribute the execution of existing data mining libraries without rewriting the algorithms to run in parallel. As a proof-of-concept, the LADEL model is implemented on Apache Drill to distribute the training execution of Weka's classification algorithms.

Also, it has obvious advantages over other biometric techniques, since it is natural, socially well accepted, and notably non-intrusive. In reality, several reliable biometrics authentication techniques are available and widely used nowadays (such as iris or fingerprint), but they mostly rely on an active participation of the user. On the contrary, facial biometric demands very little cooperation from the user; thanks to this user-friendly capability, face recognition is said to be non-intrusive. Over the last decades, significant progress has been achieved in face recognition area. Since the seminal work of Turk and Pentland (Turk & Pentland, 1991), where the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is proposed to apply to face images (Eigenfaces), more sophisticated techniques for face recognition appear, such as Fisherfaces (Belhumeur et al., 1997), based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Elastic Bunch Graph Matching (EBGM) (Wiskott et al., 1997), as well as approaches based upon Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Phillips, 1999), or Hidden Markov Models (HMM) (Nefian & III, 1998; Vu & Caplier, 2010b), etc. Nevertheless, face recognition, notably under uncontrolled scenarios, remains active and unsolved. Among many factors affecting the performance of face recognition systems, illumination is known to be one of the most significant. Indeed, it was proven, both theoretically (Moses et al., 1994) and experimentally (Adini et al., 1997) that image variation due to lighting changes is more significant than that due to different personal identities. In other words, the difference between two face images of the same individual taken under varying lighting conditions is larger than the difference between any two face images taken under the same lighting conditions, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Inspired by the great ability of human retina that enables the eyes to see objects in different lighting conditions, we present in this chapter a novel method of illumination normalization by simulating the performance of its two layers: the photoreceptors and the outer plexiform layer. Thus, we say the algorithm biologically inspired. The rest of the chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly discusses the related work; Section 3 presents the model of retinal processing and its advantage.

First, obtain monitoring data of the tunnel arch crown settlement. Second, transform the data of three arch crown settlement into a triangular fuzzy particle. The three parameters, Low, R, and Up in the fuzzy particle represent the minimum, average and maximum value of the settlement of the arch crown in three days. Then, use the SVM to predict the Low, R, and Up values of the tunnel arch crown settlement. Finally, the established prediction model of surrounding rock with SVM information granulation method was applied to the Panlongshan tunnel on the line of the Qinglan expressway in China and prediction results agree well with practical situations, which means the method of SVM information granulation used in this study could provide relatively high accuracy when applied to deformation prediction of surrounding rock in shallow-buried tunnels.

Then, given a traffic scene image, we employ the obtained vehicle models to perform vehicle detection in it for vehicle extraction. After that, model alignment is performed on the extracted image crop, based on which features are extracted for creating a representation for the vehicle in the given image.

It examines whether second language learners can acquire implicit knowledge of noun\u2013verb agreement. In addition it tests whether their ability to do so is influenced by the number of words that intervene between the relevant noun and the finite verb in the input sentences, as this affects performance in artificial grammar learning, the serial response time task and the statistical learning paradigm. Experimental participants were exposed to a modified version of Persian or Basque while performing a memory task. Next, two grammaticality judgement tests (one timed and one untimed) and a sentence correction task assessed whether the participants had acquired either the target noun\u2013verb agreement or pairs of adjacent words that appeared frequently in the learning items. Performance reflecting implicit and explicit knowledge was distinguished according to three criteria based on R. Ellis (2005) and according to the assumption that the former is not under conscious control. Participants\u2019 performance suggested that they had implicit knowledge of the adjacent word pairs. Similarly, the results indicated that they had implicit knowledge of subject\u2013verb agreement when a single word intervened between the subject and the verb, but not with two intervening words. Connectionist simulations supported the results and indicated that performance was unlikely to improve if more exposure were given. Although the influence of additional factors is discussed, the results generally supported the view that an increase in the number of intervening words reduces learning outcome.

Awareness of the uncertainty of perception is a fundamental requirement for proper high level decision making in a robotic system.

This is the case of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), the success of which stems from their ability to infer the most likely world configuration, but they do not directly allow to estimate the uncertainty of the solution. In this paper, we consider the setting of assigning semantic labels to the pixels of an image sequence. Instead of using a CRF, we employ a Perturb-and-MAP Random Field, a recently introduced probabilistic model that allows performing fast approximate sampling from its probability density function. This allows to effectively compute the uncertainty of the solution, indicating the reliability of the most likely labeling in each region of the image. We report results on the CamVid dataset, a standard benchmark for semantic labeling of urban image sequences.

The work is partially inspired on current neuroscience hypotheses about the control of the human arm and the computational processes used by the brain. A first experiment uses inspiration from the classical neuroscience experiment of the Waiter Task. In the original experiment, the non-dominant human arm is holding a weight of 1 Kg. When this weight is unloaded by a self-generated action (with the dominant arm), it is observed that the non-dominant arm does not suffer perceptible postural changes. The reason arguably stems from the prediction of the forces occurring at the unloading, since the inherently delayed sensory feedback present in biological systems would not suffice to react in such a short notice as observed. The experiment is reproduced in a robotic platform by means of forward models and compliance adaption via stiffness control as speculated in neuroscience hypotheses.

Visible cameras are commonly used in real-life applications, and thermal cameras are typically only available in lab situations due to their high price. Thermal imaging for facial expression recognition is not frequently used in real-world situations. To address this, we propose a novel thermally enhanced facial expression recognition method which uses thermal images as privileged information to construct better visible feature representation and improved classifiers by incorporating adversarial learning and similarity constraints during training. Specifically, we train two deep neural networks from visible images and thermal images. We impose adversarial loss to enforce statistical similarity between the learned representations of two modalities, and a similarity constraint to regulate the mapping functions from visible and thermal representation to expressions. Thus, thermal images are leveraged to simultaneously improve visible feature representation and classification during training. To mimic real-world scenarios, only visible images are available during testing. We further extend the proposed expression recognition method for partially unpaired data to explore thermal images' supplementary role in visible facial expression recognition when visible images and thermal images are not synchronously recorded.

This has important implications for public health. Interrelated behaviors have been shown to be most effectively targeted by multimodal interventions addressing wider-ranging improvements in lifestyle instead of via separate interventions targeting individual behaviors. However, few previous studies have taken into account a broad, multi-disciplinary range of health-related behaviors and connected these behavioral patterns to health-related outcomes. This paper presents an analysis of the clustering of a broad range of health-related behaviors with relevant demographic factors and several health-related outcomes in adolescents. Self-report questionnaire data were collected from a sample of 2,690 Dutch high school adolescents. Behavioral patterns were deducted via Principal Components Analysis. Subsequently a Two-Step Cluster Analysis was used to identify groups of adolescents with similar behavioral patterns and health-related outcomes. Four distinct behavioral patterns describe the analyzed individual behaviors: 1- risk-prone behavior, 2- bully behavior, 3- problematic screen time use, and 4- sedentary behavior. Subsequent cluster analysis identified four clusters of adolescents. Multi-problem behavior was associated with problematic physical and psychosocial health outcomes, as opposed to those exerting relatively few unhealthy behaviors. These associations were relatively independent of demographics such as ethnicity, gender and socio-economic status. The results show that health-related behaviors tend to cluster, indicating that specific behavioral patterns underlie individual health behaviors.

PL works with an ordinal dataset, used frequently in areas such as behavioural science, medical science, education, psychology and social science.

Many ideas have been developed to build better recommendation techniques. One of the challenges in RSs is how to develop systems that are proactive and unobtrusive. To address this problem, we have studied the use of pairwise comparisons in preference elicitation as a very simple way of expressing preferences. Research in PL has also discovered this kind of representation and considers it to be learning from binary relations. ::: There are three contributions in this thesis: ::: The first and the most significant contribution is a new approach based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) in Description Logics (DL) representation to learn the relation of order. The second contribution is a strategy based on Active Learning (AL) to support the inference process and make choices more informative for learning purposes. A third contribution is a recommender system algorithm based on the ILP in DL approach, implemented in a real-world recommender system with a large used-car dataset. ::: The proposed approach has been evaluated by using both offline and online experiments. The offline experiments were performed using two publicly available preference datasets, while the online experiment was conducted using 24 participants to evaluate the system.

However, even efficient heuristics such as BLAST may not scale to the data sets now emerging, motivating a range of alignment-free alternatives exploiting the underlying lexical structure of each sequence. In this paper, we introduce SuperVec, a novel supervised approach to learning sequence embeddings. Our method extends earlier Representation Learning (RL) based methods to include jointly contextual and class-related information for each sequence during training. This ensures that related sequence fragments have proximal representations in the target space, better reflecting the structure of the domain. Such representations may be used for downstream machine learning tasks or employed directly. Here, we apply SuperVec embeddings to a sequence retrieval task, where the goal is to retrieve sequences with the same family label as a given query. The SuperVec approach is extended further through H-SuperVec, a tree-based hierarchical method which learns embeddings across a range of feature spaces based on the class labels and their exclusive and exhaustive subsets. Experiments show that supervised learning of embeddings based on sequence labels using SuperVec and H-SuperVec provides a substantial improvement in retrieval performance over existing (unsupervised) RL-based approaches. Further, the new methods are an order of magnitude faster than BLAST for the database retrieval task, supporting hybrid approaches in which SuperVec rapidly filters the collection so that only potentially relevant records remain, allowing slower, more accurate methods to be executed quickly over a far smaller dataset. Thus, we may achieve faster query processing and higher precision than before. Finally, for some problems, direct use of embeddings is already sufficient to yield high levels of precision and recall.

These drugs include alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium), clonazepam (Klonopin), and others. There are two distinct types of pharmacological binding sites for benzodiazepines in the brain (BZ1 and BZ2), these sites are on GABA-A receptors, and are classified as short, intermediate, or long-acting. From the thienobenzodiazepine class (TBZ), Olanzapine (2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-l-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepine) (Zyprexa) was used as an example to demonstrate the antagonism of this class of compounds for multiples receptors including: dopamine D 1 \u2013D 5 , \u03b1-adrenoreceptor, histamine H 1 , muscarinic M 1 \u2013M 5 and 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 2C , 5-HT 3 and 5-HT 6 receptors. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent, structurally related to clozapine, and extensively used for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder-associated mania, and the behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The functional blockade of these multiple receptors contributes to the wide range of its pharmacologic and therapeutic activities, having relatively few side effects when compared to other antipsychotics agents. Thienobenzodiazepines (such as Olanzapine) are characterized as multi- receptor- targeted- acting- agents. This mini-review discusses these 2 drug classes that act on the central nervous system, the main active compounds used, and the various receptors with which they interact.

Aiming at this, a detection algorithm for factors inducing heart diseases based on a particle swarm optimisation-support vector machine (PSO-SVM) optimised by association rules (ARs) was proposed. Firstly, AR was used to select features from a disease data set so as to train feature sets. Then, PSO-SVM was used to classify training and testing sets, and then the factors inducing heart diseases were analysed. Finally, the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm was verified by experiments on the UCI Cleveland data set with confidence as the index. The experimental results showed that females have less risk of having a heart attack than males. Irrespective of gender, once diagnosed with chest pain without symptoms and angina caused by exercise, people are more likely to suffer from heart disease. Moreover, compared with another two advanced classification algorithms, the proposed algorithm showed better classification performance and therefore can be used as a powerful tool to help doctors diagnose and treat heart diseases.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1515/jisys-2016-0014", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Intelligent Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2727390596", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["36982673", "14339543", "52045379", "5394579", "74375161", "19850618", "61202839", "7521560", "137879", "24685953", "29780337", "6834689", "206498131", "26784193", "20175733", "9677771", "33081044", "6779403", "1154187", "24548248", "5494649", "63906569", "36183186", "18574938", "124944078"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195952900"}

The efficiency of SVM algorithm and its performance mainly depends on the kernel type and its parameters. Furthermore, the feature subset selection that is used to train the SVM model is another important factor that has a major influence on it classification accuracy. The feature subset selection is a very important step in machine learning, specially when dealing with high-dimensional data sets. Most of the previous researches handled these important factors separately. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach based on the Grasshopper optimisation algorithm (GOA), which is a recent algorithm inspired by the biological behavior shown in swarms of grasshoppers. The goal of the proposed approach is to optimize the parameters of the SVM model, and locate the best features subset simultaneously. Eighteen low- and high-dimensional benchmark data sets are used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approach.

In this paper, the problem of machine running condition recognition based on images is treated purely as image recognition problem, so the procedure of meaningful features selection and extraction can be avoided. Sparse non-negative matrix factorization (SNMF) and support vector machine (SVM) are introduced to recognize the time-frequency spectra and therefore the corresponding running condition of machine automatically. After applying SNMF to image, the dimension is reduced obviously while the connotative and main features of image are reserved, therefore the computation cost of image recognition with SVM is saved and the recognition accuracy is possibly improved.

The reason is that images from an X-ray machine are usually obstructed with other objects and to itself, therefore object classification and localization is a challenging task. Furthermore, obtaining X-ray data is difficult due to an insufficient dataset available compared with photographic images from a digital camera. It is vital to easily detect objects in an X-ray image because it can be used as decision support in the detection of threat items such as improvised explosive devices (IED\u2019s) in airports, train stations, and public places. Detection of IED components accurately requires an expert and can be achieved through extensive training. Also, manual inspection is tedious, and the probability of missed detection increases due to several pieces of baggage are scanned in a short period of time. As a solution, this paper used different object detection techniques (Faster R-CNN, SSD, R-FCN) and feature extractors (ResNet, MobileNet, Inception, Inception-ResNet) based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) in a novel IEDXray dataset in the detection of IED components. The IEDXray dataset is an X-ray image of IED replicas without the explosive material.

The Random Forest classifier is able to obtain an accuracy of 0.6660 and an area under the ROC curve of 0.8562 on the OHGS genetic dataset, when 3335 SNPs are selected by MTD Feature Selection for classification. This area is considerably better than the previous high score of 0.608 obtained by Davies et al. in 2010 on the same dataset.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": "1402.0459", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.20381/ruor-3739", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "mag_id": "1498792559", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211677623"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14087351"}

Early detection of tumor is particularly important for better treatment of patients. A notable issue is how to effectively discriminate tumor samples from normal ones. Many classification methods, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), have been proposed for tumor classification. Recently, deep learning has achieved satisfactory performance in the classification task of many areas. However, the application of deep learning is rare in tumor classification due to insufficient training samples of gene expression data. In this paper, a Sample Expansion method is proposed to address the problem. Inspired by the idea of Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), a large number of samples are obtained by randomly cleaning partially corrupted input many times. The expanded samples can not only maintain the merits of corrupted data in DAE but also deal with the problem of insufficient training samples of gene expression data to a certain extent. Since Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models show excellent performance in classification task, the applicability of SAE and 1-dimensional CNN (1DCNN) on gene expression data is analyzed. Finally, two deep learning models, Sample Expansion-Based SAE (SESAE) and Sample Expansion-Based 1DCNN (SE1DCNN), are designed to carry out tumor gene expression data classification by using the expanded samples. Experimental studies indicate that SESAE and SE1DCNN are very effective in tumor classification.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5752549", "pubmed_id": "29312636", "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.22762", "venue": "Oncotarget", "journal": "Oncotarget", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2768371426", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["8343795", "18500713", "9521910", "11653892", "24096015", "61649919", "14869040", "393948", "110359062", "196065172", "14899722", "8771159", "1658773", "2814088", "1241368", "207763512", "2161592", "37336258", "9061359", "20038241", "17804904", "20278284", "62497190", "9281966", "60626986", "2583079", "16138498"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24962605"}

When networks were trained only on phonological encodings of stem-suhed pairs similar to English regular verbs (e.g., walk x walked), long-term deficits (i.e., \u201ccritical period\u201d effects) were not observed, yet there were substantive short-term effects of injury. When training vocabulary reflected the English-like competition between regular (suffixed) and irregular verbs (e.g., go x went, hit x hit), the acquisition of regular verbs became increasingly susceptible to injury, while the irregulars were learned quickly and were relatively impervious to damage. Patterns of generalization to novel forms conflicts with the assumption that this behavioral dissociation is indicative of selective impairment of the learning and generalization of the past tense rule, while the associative lexical-based mechanism is left intact. Instead, we propose a view of network performance in which the regular-irregular dissociation derives from a general reduction in the ability to find a single-mechanism solution when resolving the competition between two classes of mappings. In light of other models in which \u201cregular\u201d and \u201cirregular\u201d forms compete (e.g., Patterson, Seidenberg, & McClelland, 1989), as well as patterns of performance in normal and disordered English speakers (e.g., Pinker, 1991), two general implications are discussed: (1) critical period effects need not derive from endog-enously determined maturational change, but instead may in part result from learning history in relation to characteristics of the language to be learned (i.e., entrenchment), and (2) selective dissociations can result from general damage in systems that are not modularized in terms of rule-based vs. associative mechanisms.", "year": 1993, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "23972155", "doi": "10.1162/jocn.1993.5.2.215", "venue": "Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience", "journal": "Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1964809799", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["42456381", "11487879", "4488523", "37936295", "10199017", "197658202", "4360334", "35733622", "59853354", "143453011", "58779360", "146253352", "202927997", "14698780", "146490250", "77950237", "143450017", "19109554", "18121997", "207056257", "58788111", "43544282", "23789004", "30165868", "149096534", "33482537", "144248762", "8784464", "19343294", "12662523"], "inbound_citations": ["36818761", "6423256", "2740421", "144077348", "16660719", "6022883", "5490630", "73497737", "15955007", "12407971", "72334173", "42861103", "2397164", "14028158", "18648016", "17662971", "118180", "38288606", "5587008", "9177428", "61974208", "15250126", "44415215", "440636", "16079640", "6464607", "8661794", "15997449", "1173375", "205549199", "3839258", "54998964", "2235654", "8673308", "8562035", "8216501", "215051801", "10917997", "207149377", "14838462", "12246419", "18418209", "24978194", "8752391", "13064080", "211088529", "5934267", "5846843", "13877325", "37746514", "59849792", "45967061", "853194", "201720618", "8288013", "17968357", "6046534", "39693254", "60630330", "15175536", "13046661", "25099773", "46799014", "16829562", "17654813", "53990724", "2134329"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20501973"}

We first employed a random forest approach for selection and weighting of features. We find that SVMs are an effective method to preselect quasar candidates from multiwavelength data. Two data sets were used, one from SDSS, USNO-B1.0, and FIRST (the \u201cFIRST sample\u201d), and another from SDSS, USNO-B1.0, and ROSAT (the \u201cROSAT sample\u201d). We analyzed SVM performance for different features in Tables 1 and 2 and find that the accuracy with the FIRST sample was superior to that with the ROSAT sample except in the case of feature selection.

In this paper, we have proposed an efficient Re-Id approach that is based on a highly discriminative hybrid person representation which combines the low-level hand-crafted appearance based features together with the mid-level attributes and semantic based deep features. The low-level hand crafted features are extracted by using hierarchical Gaussian and local histogram distributions in different color spaces. These features incorporate discriminative texture, shape and color information which is invariant to distractors, e.g., variations in pose, viewpoint and illumination, and so on. The mid-level attribute based deep features are extracted to incorporate contextual- and semantic-based information. The feature space is optimized and self-learned using cross-view quadratic discriminant analysis and multiple metric learning, with the aim to reduce the intra-class differences and increase the inter-class variations for robust person matching.

They provide a natural and powerful tool for dealing with two problems that occur throughout applied mathematics and engineering: uncertainty and complexity. In recent years, there has been a gradual yet widespread adoption of PGMs in many areas of computer vision and pattern recognition. Current applications of PGMs in computer vision, however, are limited to modeling either causal or mutually dependent relationships, but not both. For many computer vision problems, the relationships among different image entities are often heterogeneous and of different types. A hybrid probabilistic graphical model is, therefore, needed in order to effectively capture these complex relationships. ::: This thesis aims at developing a hybrid probabilistic graphical model that can exploit both directed links and undirected links for modeling heterogeneous relationships and demonstrating its application to image segmentation problems. We propose a systematic way to deal with the modeling, parameter learning, and inference issues for such a hybrid graphical model. Specifically, we construct the hybrid graphical model structure with different types of links based on the relationships between random variables. We derive the joint probability distribution represented by the hybrid graphical model using the Markov property encoded in the graphical structure. We then propose a joint parameter learning approach to train the hybrid graphical model based on the combination of an analytic solution and a numerical solution through Gibbs sampling. Finally, we propose to convert the hybrid graphical model into a factor graph representation to perform probabilistic inference through principled methods. ::: For the application of PGMs to image segmentation, we first study an undirected graphical model (i.e. Conditional Random Field) that models the spatial relationships among region labels for image segmentation. We then study a directed graphical model (i.e. Bayesian Network) that captures the causality among the fundamental image entities (regions, edges, vertices, etc) and various constraints such as contour smoothness and connectivity for image segmentation. Subsequently, we propose a hybrid graphical model for image segmentation, which consists of both directed links and undirected links to capture the causality and spatial relationships among image entities. We further extend the hybrid graphical model to a multiscale hybrid graphical model that exploits other contextual relationships such as the homogeneity of multiscale labels. ::: The hybrid graphical model allows the systematic modeling and integration of different types of uncertain knowledge including image measurements, contextual knowledge, and subjective human knowledge for effective and robust image segmentation. It also allows combining region-based image segmentation with edge-based image segmentation. The performance of the unified framework is quantitatively evaluated against techniques based on either directed or undirected graphical models alone and against other state-of-the-art image segmentation techniques on commonly used image databases. Our experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid graphical model can be successfully applied to image segmentation and the performance outperforms state-of-the-art approaches due to the integration of multiple image measurements and incorporation of the informative contextual relationships.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2337844617", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43636665"}

The basis of the non-linear manifold is derived using the kernel principal components derived using kernel principal component analysis where fewer components are retained in order to identify the lower-dimensional manifold. Data instances are projected onto the manifold, and those with a large distance between the original point and the projection are considered to be derived from a different underlying process.

However, most existing FER methods recognize facial expression images by training the CNN models with cross-entropy (CE) loss in a single stage, which have limited capability to deal with these problems because each expression example is assigned equal weight of loss. Inspired by the recently proposed focal loss which reduces the relative loss for those well-classified expression examples and pay more attention to those misclassified ones, we can mitigate these problems by introducing the focal loss into the existing FER system when facing imbalanced data or hard expression examples. Considering that the focal loss allows the network to further extract discriminative features based on the learned feature-separating capability, we present a two-stage training strategy utilizing CE loss in the first stage and focal loss in the second stage to boost the FER performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two well-known FER datasets called CK+ and Oulu-CASIA.

The commonly used system against network attacks is firewalls. In this study, a novel firewall data classification approach is presented. This approach uses 10 cases to obtain numerical results. The proposed approach consists of data acquisition from Firewall, feature selection and classification steps. Firstly, the Firewall data were gathered from a Firewall. Then, the redundant features are eliminated and these features are normalized using min\u2013max normalization. The obtained final feature sets are forwarded to classifiers. In the cases defined, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are utilized as classifiers. It was seen from the results, the deep learning approach are more successful than SVM classifier and the highest classification accuracy was calculated as 97.38% by using Bi-LSTM-LSTM hybrid network. The proposed method has several advantages and these are (1) the proposed method achieved high success rates using hybrid deep learning approaches (2) the training time of the proposed method is short (3) an intelligent network security monitoring method is presented using basic methods and deep learning.

The literature on this topic has demonstrated that Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and human development (HD) are important promoters of progress towards environmental sustainability. The impact of these factors is most often examined by using standard regression analysis which suffers from the problems of multicollinearity and non-linear dependency. In order to resolve this problem, a non-parametric method is proposed. To be specific, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predicting environmental performance growth has been developed, based on various predictors- ICT and HD indexes, population growth, and an economic development indicator. The prediction is made at the macro level using a sample of 139 countries. The model was created by a prediction procedure consisting of the optimization of the SVM learner parameters using the grid-search method, as well as k-fold cross-validation. A predictive accuracy of the SVR model of 80.4% was achieved. The model predicts growth in environmental performance of 1.5% for each 1% increase in the ICT index, while an increase of the HD index of 1% produces an environmental performance increase of 4.3%. The results of the sensitivity analysis confirm that the effects of both predictors are enhanced when they operate in interaction. This the first study to apply the predictive machine learning method to the analysis of the impact of ICT and HD on environmental performance and empirically confirmed its efficiency.

Since it has been proven empirically that ensembles tend to yield better results when there is a significant diversity among the constituent models, the objective of this paper is twofold. First, it investigates how data clustering (a well known diversity technique) can be applied to identify groups of similar decision trees in an RF in order to eliminate redundant trees by selecting a representative from each group (cluster). Second, these likely diverse representatives are then used to produce an extension of RF termed CLUB-DRF that is much smaller in size than RF, and yet performs at least as good as RF, and mostly exhibits higher performance in terms of accuracy. The latter refers to a known technique called ensemble pruning. Experimental results on 15 real datasets from the UCI repository prove the superiority of our proposed extension over the traditional RF.

The goal of person re-identification is to make the truly matched pedestrian pair rank as the first place among all pairs, with the direct translation in math language, which equals that the distance of matched pedestrian pair is the minimum value of the distances of all pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel metric learning method for person re-identification to learn such an optimal feature mapping function, which minimizes the difference between the distance of matched pair and the minimum distance of all pairs, namely Ranking Loss. Furthermore, we develop an improved version of ranking loss by using p-norm as a smooth approximation of minimum function, with the advantage of manipulating parameter p to control the distance margin between matched pair and unmatched pair to benefit the re-identification accuracy. We also present an efficient solver using only a small portion of pairs in computation, achieving almost the same performance as using all. Compared with other loss function, the proposed ranking loss optimizes the ultimate ranking goal in the most direct and intuitional way, and it directly acts on the whole gallery set efficiently instead of comparatively measuring in small subset.

The PSVM approach, rather than estimating an SVM model per class according to the \"one versus all\" discriminative paradigm, classifies pairs of examples as belonging or not to the same class. Training a PSVM with large amount of data, however, is a memory and computational expensive task, because the number of training pairs grows quadratically with the number of training patterns. This paper proposes an approach that allows discarding the training pairs that do not essentially contribute to the set of Support Vectors (SVs) of the training set. This selection of training pairs is feasible because we show that the number of SVs does not grow quadratically, with the number of pairs, but only linearly with the number of speakers in the training set. Our approach dramatically reduces the memory and computational complexity of PSVM training, making possible the use of large datasets, including many speakers. It has been assessed on the extended core conditions of the 2012 Speaker Recognition Evaluation. The results show that the accuracy of the trained PSVMs increases with the training set size, and that the Cprimary of a PSVM trained with a small subset of the i-vectors pairs is 10-30% better than the one obtained by a generative model trained on the complete set of i-vectors", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853877", "venue": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "journal": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1965968825", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["41754", "9760419", "4253493", "11925758", "5504875", "7138354", "52874011", "5522142", "7374264", "12619079", "961425", "7028342", "1618696", "207168225", "15174027", "58363491", "3189615"], "inbound_citations": ["3432766", "13311922", "7260228", "37225351"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10498729"}

The difference between the maximum and the average, variance, kurtosis, and skewness of the subtracted image were calculated. Those of the cross-correlation distribution were also calculated. These eight statistics were used as feature vectors for training Support Vector Machine because they were the simplest of features that was expected to be closely associated with the physical properties of water ice clouds. The generalization ability was tested using 10-fold cross-validation. F-measure and accuracy tended to be approximately 0.8 if the maximum in the normalized reflectance and the difference of the maximum and the average in the cross-correlation were selected as features.

Diagnostic modalities such as toxigenic culture and nucleic acid amplification testing can identify the presence of toxigenic C difficile in stools. But these tests are confounded by the presence of asymptomatic colonization of toxigenic C difficile and lead to overdiagnosis of CDI. The presence of two large toxins, toxin A and B (TcdA and TcdB) is necessary for pathogenicity. Detection of toxins using toxin enzyme immunoassay is difficult as it has low sensitivity and moderate specificity. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a novel technology that is used to detect bacteria and their toxins. RS does not require any reagents for detection such as antibodies, enzymes, primers, or stains. We hypothesize that RS is a sensitive method to detect C difficile toxins in stool and will solve the problem of overdiagnosis of CDI. Materials and methods CDI negative stool samples were spiked with concentrations (1 ng/mL, 100 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, and 0.1 pg/mL) of TcdA and TcdB. RS was performed on air-dried smeared samples of stool supernatant on a mirror-polished stainless-steel slide. As RS of feces is difficult because of confounding background material and autofluorescence, samples were photo-bleached before spectral acquisition to reduce autofluorescence. Raman spectra were obtained, background corrected, and vector normalized. The data were split into training (70%) and test (30%) datasets. The machine learning methods used on the training data set were Support Vector Machine with Linear and Radial Kernels, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting Machine, and Principle Component Analysis\u2014Linear Discriminant Analysis. Results were validated using a test data set. The best model was chosen, and its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined. Results In our preliminary results, at all concentrations (1 ng/mL, 100 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, and 0.1 pg/mL), TcdA or TcdB spiked stool was distinguished from unspiked stool by all models with accuracies ranging from 64% to 77%. Gradient Boosting Machine, Principle Component Analysis\u2014Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine Linear Kernel performed best with sensitivities ranging from 69% to 90% and specificities ranging from 43% to 78%. Conclusions Using RS, we successfully detected TcdA and TcdB in stool samples albeit with moderate-to-high sensitivity and low-to-moderate specificity. Sensitivity and specificity could be further increased with the implementation of deep learning methods, which require large sample sizes. In terms of sensitivity, RS performs better than toxin enzyme immunoassay and has the potential to rapidly detect C difficile toxins in stool at clinically relevant concentrations and thereby help mitigate overdiagnosis of CDI.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31279995", "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2019.06.039", "venue": "The Journal of surgical research", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "mag_id": "2956013028", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195829669"}

Even so, the principal advantage of the associative classifiers lies in interpretation. However, pruning the useless rules among the huge set of the mined rules as well as combining them to build a classifier remains a subject for improvement and further research. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm to build a classifier based on Regularized Class Association Rules in a categorical data space called RCAR. The characteristic of this algorithm is, therefore, threefold: First, mining an exhaustive set of Class Association Rules (CARs) according to a predefined values of support and confidence thresholds. Second, applying a regularized logistic regression algorithm with Lasso penalty on the rules space to build a model that predicts the conditional probability of the existence of the outcome. Useless rules are pruned thanks to the selective nature of Lasso regularization. Third, organizing and visualizing the CARs which survive the first step of pruning by Lasso regularization using metarules. An optional step of pruning could be undertaken on the basis of the metarules and subject knowledge. Likewise, the empirical results indicate that RCAR gives comparable accuracy against Random Forest and GBM.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2019.01.047", "venue": "Inf.

As the propagation time delay in the coupling varies, stability switches for the trivial solution are found. Conditions ensuring the stability and direction of the Hopf bifurcation are determined by applying the normal form theory and the center manifold theorem. We also discuss the spatio-temporal patterns of bifurcating periodic oscillations by using the symmetric bifurcation theory of delay differential equations combined with representation theory of Lie groups. In particular, we obtain that the spatio-temporal patterns of bifurcating periodic oscillations will alternate according to the change of the propagation time delay in the coupling, i.e., different ranges of delays correspond to different patterns of neural activities.

In this work, we investigate as to what extent can transfer learning address these issues when using deep RNNs to model multivariate clinical time series. We consider transferring the knowledge captured in an RNN trained on several source tasks simultaneously using a large labeled dataset to build the model for a target task with limited labeled data. An RNN pre-trained on several tasks provides generic features, which are then used to build simpler linear models for new target tasks without training task-specific RNNs. For evaluation, we train a deep RNN to identify several patient phenotypes on time series from MIMIC-III database, and then use the features extracted using that RNN to build classifiers for identifying previously unseen phenotypes, and also for a seemingly unrelated task of in-hospital mortality. We demonstrate that (i) models trained on features extracted using pre-trained RNN outperform or, in the worst case, perform as well as task-specific RNNs; (ii) the models using features from pre-trained models are more robust to the size of labeled data than task-specific RNNs; and (iii) features extracted using pre-trained RNN are generic enough and perform better than typical statistical hand-crafted features.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1807.01705", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2811027900", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["4900015", "5590763", "5842463", "51953582", "14502739", "150290167", "33285731", "6628106", "6502142", "13880", "37174872", "4404566", "2740197", "9919769", "10641834", "7979241", "18121764"], "inbound_citations": ["139106327", "201622556", "211268683", "202577942", "213188154", "90262239", "140295406", "211083016", "199016733"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49567853"}

As a result, the constructed feature mapping may not be precise due to the bias issue of the correspondences in the target or (and) source domain(s).

The kernel parameters of the SVM were determined with Bayesian inference. The efficiency of the method was illustrated through analyzing Jinan urban traffic flow data.

Different lighting conditions, precipitation and the road users large intra-class variabilities caused by variations in scale, rotation, texture and occlusion has made it difficult to create systems that can successfully perform pedestrian detection. As a result, the classifiers that exist today are mostly binary classifiers concerned with separating one class of road user from the background. There is however a large number of different pedestrians with different characteristics and capabilities. Detecting and separating these from each other is necessary in order to adjust the traffic lights signalling to appropriately serve the road users present. User-orientation can help with optimizing the traffic flow as well as increasing safety. In this thesis, a qualitative evaluation has been done in order to identify the most important pedestrian categories, and the identified categories have been selected as labels in a multi-label classification problem. A stereo camera, suitable for real world applications, has been used when conducting a series of experiments to evaluate visual methods based on Histograms of Oriented Gradient and Support Vector Machines, as well as methods based on low-level spatial and temporal features, such as velocity and size. The result is a proposed architecture of a system based on an ensemble of binary classifiers.

For ordinary feedforward neural networks, the sparsification is usually done by introducing certain regularization technique into the learning process of the network. However, this strategy cannot be applied for ELM, since the input-hidden weights of ELM are supposed to be randomly chosen rather than iteratively learned. To this end, we propose a modified ELM, called ELM-LC (ELM with local connections), which is designed for the sparsification of the input-hidden weights as follows: The hidden nodes and the input nodes are divided respectively into several corresponding groups, and each input node group is fully connected with its corresponding hidden node group, but is not connected with any other hidden node group. As in the usual ELM, the input-hidden weights are randomly given, and the hidden-output weights are obtained through a least square learning. In the numerical simulations on some benchmark problems, the new ELM-LC behaves better than the traditional ELM and the ELM with normal sparse input-hidden weights.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1801.06975", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2019.08.069", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2785194690,2970263937", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60577818", "60602644", "41312633", "116858", "206757279", "5117817", "14406817", "18027537", "1417306", "207763512", "1302462", "11263623", "3775743", "14542261", "14026523", "10307730", "17055992", "33492707", "41879949", "19861033", "54549252", "34572826", "121529370", "63629462", "122543681", "18268504"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10488671"}

As a first step Self-reported data on training parameters and injuries from high-level runners (duration=37 weeks, n=23, male=16, female=7) were used to identify the most predictive variables for injuries, and train a machine learning tree algorithm to predict an injury. The model was validated by splitting the data in training and a test set. The 10 most important variables were identified from 85 possible variables using the Random Forest algorithm. To predict at an earliest stage, so the runner or the coach is able to intervene, the variables were classified by time to build tree algorithms up to 7 weeks before the occurrence of an injury.

In this study ML algorithms; Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) were used to develop MMEs for annual, monsoon and winter; precipitation (P), maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperature over Pakistan using 36 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 GCMs. GCMs were ranked using Taylor Skill Score for individual seasons and variables, and then using a comprehensive Rating Metric (RM) overall rank of each GCM was determined. It was found that, HadGEM2-AO is the most skilled GCM and IPSL-CM5B-LR is the least skilled GCMs in simulating the 3 climate variables. The performance of MMEs did not improve after the inclusion of about 18 top-ranked GCMs. Thus, it was understood that the optimum performance of MMEs is achieved when about 50% of the top-ranked GCMs are used. The inter-comparison of MMEs developed with ANN, KNN, SVM and RVM revealed that KNN and RVM-based MMEs show better skills. It was found that RVM yields MMEs which show smaller variations in performance over space unlike ANN which displayed large fluctuations in performance over space.

Among numerous components of E-learning systems, question bank is a primordial component. Question bank is a repository of questions that assists students and instructors in the educational process. In question bank, questions are annotated, stored and retrieved based on predefined criteria such as bloom's cognitive levels. Definitely, for question bank management, the automatic classification of questions according to Bloom's cognitive levels is of particular benefit. This paper explores the effectiveness of support vector machines (SVMs), in tackling the problem of question classification into Bloom's cognitive levels. To do so, a dataset of pre-classified questions has been collected. Each question is processed through removal of punctuations and stop words, tokenization, stemming, term weighting and length normalization. SVMs classifiers, namely linear kernel, have been built and evaluated on approximately 70% and 30% of the dataset respectively, using SVM-Light software package. The obtained preliminary results show a satisfactory effectiveness of SVMs with respect to classification accuracy and precision. However, due to the small size of the current dataset, the results of the classifiers' recall and F-measure suggest a need for further experiments with larger dataset to obtain conclusive results.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2598198979", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["143166610", "194951", "59910378", "1194024", "617436", "2427083", "2274179", "15762467", "11027141", "3091", "3142786", "61992482", "28637672", "113901940"], "inbound_citations": ["70154070"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:42621358"}

For this reason, studies of automated melanoma discrimination using image analysis have been conducted.

In this paper, we propose an automated melanoma discrimination system that it is capable of providing not only the discrimination results but also their grounds by means of utilizing a Random Forest (RF) technique. Our system was constructed based on a total of 1,148 dermoscopy images (168 melanomas and 980 nevi) and uses only their color features in order to ensure the readability of the grounds for the discrimination results. By virtue of our efficient feature selection procedure, our system provides accurate discrimination results (a sensitivity of 79.8 % and a specificity of 80.7 % with 10-fold cross-validation) under human-oriented limitations and presents the grounds for the results in an intelligible format.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-27863-6_67", "venue": "ISVC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2395411317", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["2765521"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:29416937"}

Among them, the accurate measurement of oil-gas two-phase parameters is one of the bottlenecks in oil extraction technology. It is found that through the experiment the flow patterns of the oil-gas two-phase flow will change after passing through the venturi tube with the same flow rates. Under the different oil-gas flow rate, the change will be diverse. Being motivated by the above experiments, we use the dual ECT sensors to collect the capacitance values before and after the venturi tube, respectively. Additionally, we use the linear projection algorithm (LBP) algorithm to reconstruct the image of flow patterns. This paper discusses the relationship between the change of flow patterns and the flow rates. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm is proposed to predict the oil flow rate, gas flow rate, and GVF (gas void fraction, especially referring to sectional gas fraction) of the two-phase flow. We use ElasticNet regression as the loss function to effectively avoid possible overfitting problems. In actual experiments, we compare the Typical-ECT-imaging-based-GVF algorithm and SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm with CNN algorithm based on three different ECT datasets. Three different sets of ECT data are used to predict the gas flow rate, oil flow rate, and GVF, and they are respectively using the venturi front-based ECT data only, while using the venturi behind-based ECT data and using both these data.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7070799", "pubmed_id": "32098262", "doi": "10.3390/s20041200", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3007140325", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["102510812", "125455211", "126175988", "114847197", "124180452", "10808572", "202034023", "111179865", "110378921", "110515457", "104329323", "111232422", "46692669", "94114215", "109504656", "104375909", "120324387", "62818615", "116249892", "97308746", "121509671", "94168283", "123660991", "14531578", "120516954", "31989945", "121407469", "125093975", "122226984", "52874011", "27081001"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211523419"}

The primary assumption of the proposed cross-domain distance metric learning (CDDML) framework is that training data are adequate in the source domain but limited in the target domain. One major problem of cross-domain scene classification caused by different dates, sensor positions, lighting conditions, and sensor types is data distribution bias. To solve this problem, the CDDML framework first replaces the existing color space with the proposed hybrid color features derived from all candidate color components to decrease the spectral shift between domains. Then, hybrid color features and bag of convolution features (BOCFs) are put into a discriminating DML (DDML) method to reduce the data distribution bias in the feature space. Finally, the image-to-subcategory distance measure is proposed to decrease the effect of intraclass variability on the nearest neighbor classifier by fusing hybrid color features and BOCF in the distance space. The experiments on three aerial target images or data sets confirm that the CDDML framework can obtain better results than most of the previous methods in the case of inadequate samples.

Many optimization approaches have been proposed that aim at tackling this task. However, the computational requirements can still be very high, especially in case large data sets are considered and many model parameters need to be tuned. A recent trend in the field of big data analytics is to make use of graphics processing units to speed up computationally intensive tasks.

Simply having more compute platforms does not provide a means of addressing challenging problems in the big data era. Rather, alternative processing approaches are needed and the application of machine learning to big data is hugely important. The MapReduce programming paradigm is an alternative to conventional supercomputing approaches, and requires less stringent data passing constrained problem decompositions. Rather, MapReduce relies upon defining a means of partitioning the desired problem so that subsets may be computed independently and recom- bined to yield the net desired result. However, not all machine learning algorithms are amenable to such an approach. Game-theoretic algorithms are often innately distributed, consisting of local interactions between players without requiring a central authority and are iterative by nature rather than requiring extensive retraining. Effectively, a game-theoretic approach to machine learning is well suited for the MapReduce paradigm and provides a novel, alternative new perspective to addressing the big data problem.

On the contrary, the use of Radar remote sensing has not been as prevalent in the past, due to insufficiencies that were better met with the high resolution capabilities of optical remote sensing. However, with the advent of VHR Radar imagery this data source gained renewed interest for urban settlement classification, especially since it is capable of weather- and daytime-independent acquisition, limitations which are present in optical remote sensing imagery. ::: Since techniques for delineating informal settlements in urban environments using Radar imagery have not yet had the maturation time optical data has, they are still in need of further investigation. With the launch of Sentinel-1A in April 2014 and the launch of Sentinal-1B following in 2016, the utility of Radarsat-2 data for informal settlement classification may draw conclusions about the usefulness of the free and widely-available Sentinel-1 data, since specifications are very similar. ::: Various characteristics can be used in order to classify informal settlements. In this thesis several textural features were tested, specifically texture measures derived from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices, i.e. Homogeneity, Contrast, Dissimilarity, Entropy, Angular Second Moment, Mean, Standard Deviation and Correlation. Using the texture measures derived for all blocks of buildings of Mumbai, the following three different classification algorithms were investigated: Linear discriminant analysis, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest. The best result was achieved using Random Forest with an Overall Accuracy of 91% and a User\u2019s Accuracy for informal settlements of likewise 91%. Linear Discriminant Analysis showed an Overall Accuracy of 89% but a User\u2019s Accuracy for informal settlements of only 55%, while Support Vector Machines got an Overall Accuracy of 89% and a User\u2019s Accuracy of 64%. All three classifiers underestimated informal settlements to a certain degree.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2284524728", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52047695"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:130554716"}

Here, we present an efficient framework for segmentation of brain MR images. For this purpose, Gabor transform method is used to compute features of brain MRI.

Therefore, to improve the performance of the BCI, it is imperative to exploit the characteristics of the EEG data as much as possible. For motor imagery based self-paced BCIs, during motor imagery task the EEG signal of each subject goes through several internal state changes.

In this work, we propose to refine the predictions of structured prediction models by effectively integrating discriminative models into the prediction.

Similar to the adversarial learning, discriminative models are trained to estimate scores which measure the quality of predicted outputs, while structured prediction models are trained to predict contrastive outputs with maximal energy scores. In this way, the gradient vanishing problem is ameliorated, and thus we are able to perform inference by following the ascent gradient directions of discriminative models to refine structured prediction models.

Stage 1 proposes a hybrid method to effectively remove MA with a low computation complexity, where two MA removal algorithms are combined by an accurate binary decision algorithm whose aim is to decide whether or not to adopt the second MA removal algorithm. Stage 2 proposes a random forest-based spectral peak-tracking algorithm, whose aim is to locate the spectral peak corresponding to HR, formulating the problem of spectral peak tracking into a pattern classification problem.

In addition their widespread coverage and quick growth make them a critical component of the terrestrial carbon cycle and for mitigating the impacts of climate change. In this study, the capability of using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for estimating canopy structure and biomass of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) was assessed, which is one of the most valuable and widely distributed bamboo species in the subtropical forests of south China. To do so, we first evaluated the accuracy of using LiDAR data to interpolate the underlying ground terrain under bamboo forests and developed uncertainty surfaces using both LiDAR-derived vegetation and topographic metrics and a Random Forest (RF) classifier. Second, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to quantify the variation of the vertical distribution of LiDAR-derived effective Leaf Area Index (LAI) of bamboo stands, and fitted regression models between selected LiDAR metrics and the field-measured attributes such mean height, DBH and biomass components (i.e., culm, branch, foliage and aboveground biomass (AGB)) across a range of management strategies. Once models were developed, the results were spatially extrapolated and compared across the bamboo stands. Results indicated that the LiDAR interpolated DTMs were accurate even under the dense intensively managed bamboo stands (RMSE = 0.117\u20130.126 m) as well as under secondary stands (RMSE = 0.102 m) with rugged terrain and near-ground dense vegetation. The development of uncertainty maps of terrain was valuable when examining the magnitude and spatial distribution of potential errors in the DTMs. The middle height intervals (i.e., HI4 and HI5) within the bamboo cumulative effective LAI profiles explained more variances by PCA analysis in the bamboo stands. Moso bamboo AGB was well predicted by the LiDAR metrics (R2 = 0.59\u20130.87, rRMSE = 11.92\u201321.11%) with percentile heights (h25-h95) and the coefficient of variation of height (hcv) having the highest relative importances for estimating AGB and culm biomass. The hcv explained the most variance in branch and foliage biomass. According to the spatial extrapolation results, areas of relatively low biomass were found on secondary stands (AGB = 49.42 \u00b1 14.16 Mg ha\u22121), whereas the intensively managed stands (AGB = 173.47 \u00b1 34.16 Mg ha\u22121) have much higher AGB and biomass components, followed by the extensively managed bamboo stands (AGB = 67.61 \u00b1 13.10 Mg ha\u22121). This study demonstrated the potential benefits of using airborne LiDAR to accurately derive high resolution DTMs, characterize vertical structure of canopy and estimate the magnitude and distribution of biomass within Moso bamboo forests, providing key data for regional ecological, environmental and global carbon cycle models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2018.12.006", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2907738775", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["144207739"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127300665"}

Remote Access Trojans (RAT), a kind of spyware, are used to invade the PC of a victim through targeted attacks.

Since it is hard to prevent the intrusion of RATs completely, preventing confidential information being leaked back to the attacker is the main issue. Various existing approaches introduce different network behaviors of RAT to construct detection systems. Unfortunately, two challenges remain: one is to detect RAT sessions as early as possible, the other is to remain a high accuracy to detect RAT sessions, while there exist normal applications whose traffic behave similarly to RATs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect RAT sessions in the early stage of communication. To differentiate network behaviors between normal applications and RAT, we extract the features from the traffic of a short period of time at the beginning. Afterward, we use machine learning techniques to train the detection model, then evaluate it by K-Fold cross-validation.

With this challenge in mind, we propose a novel utilization of variograms for selecting potentially useful relationship types, whose merits are then evaluated using a Gaussian Conditional Random Field model for node attribute prediction of temporal social networks with a multigraph structure. Our flexible model allows for measuring many kinds of relationships between nodes in the network that evolve over time, as well as using those relationships to augment the outputs of various unstructured predictors to further improve performance. The experimental results exhibit the effectiveness of using particular relationships to boost performance of unstructured predictors, show that using other relationships could actually impede performance, and also indicate that while variograms alone are not necessarily sufficient to identify a useful relationship, they greatly help in removing obviously useless measures, and can be combined with intuition to identify the optimal relationships.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2492517.2492529", "venue": "ASONAM '13", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2055921502", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1002598", "16982763", "1616901", "44433201", "16726149", "15346510", "5963413", "16401004", "277918", "12943282"], "inbound_citations": ["18984674", "2908726", "54457611", "7380711", "16497242", "7809678", "10204594", "215250433", "202540676"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3392548"}

Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic.

This paper hereby proposes a method to construct environmental symmetric big data using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during flight by designating the imaging and non-imaging points for surveillance and patrols. The K-Means-based algorithm proposed in this paper is then employed to divide the imaging points, which is set by the pilot, into K clusters, and K imaging points are determined using these clusters. Flight data are then used to set the points to which the UAV will fly. In our experiment, flight records were gathered through an UAV in order to monitor a stadium and the imaging and non-imaging points were set using the proposed method and compared with the points determined by a traditional K-Means algorithm. Through the proposed method, the cluster centroids and cumulative distance of its members were reduced by 87.57% more than with the traditional K-Means algorithm. With the traditional K-Means algorithm, imaging points were not created in the five points desired by the pilot, and two incorrect points were obtained.

In this work, we take advantage of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) due to its capability of distribution learning and propose a generic multi-agent probabilistic prediction and tracking framework which takes the interactions among multiple entities into account, in which all the entities are treated as a whole. However, since GAN is very hard to train, we make an empirical research and present the relationship between training performance and hyperparameter values with a numerical case study. The results imply that the proposed model can capture both the mean, variance and multi-modalities of the groundtruth distribution. Moreover, we apply the proposed approach to a real-world task of vehicle behavior prediction to demonstrate its effectiveness and accuracy. The results illustrate that the proposed model trained by adversarial learning can achieve a better prediction performance than other state-of-the-art models trained by traditional supervised learning which maximizes the data likelihood. The well-trained model can also be utilized as an implicit proposal distribution for particle filtered based Bayesian state estimation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1904.02390", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICRA.2019.8793661", "venue": "2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)", "journal": "2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2967835402,2931957428", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["23567012", "51993789", "9854676", "29861587", "3919839", "21657320", "5765430", "9228629", "9960489", "52183597", "52179912", "8394584", "7980756", "16153365", "2349418", "1033682", "12803511", "11758569", "2057420", "5002792", "8424807", "259842", "29681354", "3529917", "52876529", "1915014"], "inbound_citations": ["214727763", "214727620", "201812740", "214743112", "201244939", "203610478", "146121264", "208512647", "211132657", "209386397"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:102354060"}

This paper presents an initial approach to robot-assisted hand-motion therapies. Our goal was twofold: firstly, we have applied machine learning methods to identify and characterize finger motion patterns from healthy individuals. To this purpose, Electromyographic (EMG) signals have been acquired from flexor and extensor muscles in the forearm using surface electrodes. Time and frequency features were used as inputs to machine learning algorithms for recognition of six hand gestures. In particular, we compared the performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithms for classification. Secondly, each identified gesture was turned into a joint reference trajectory by applying interpolation methods. This allowed us to reconstruct the hand/finger motion kinematics and to simulate the dynamics of each motion pattern. Experiments were carried out to create an EMG database from 20 control subjects, and a VICON camera tracking system was used to validate the accuracy of the proposed system. The average correlation between the EMG-based generated joint trajectories and the tracked hand-motion was 0.91. Furthermore, statistical analysis applied to 14 different SVM, ANN and k-NN configurations showed that Fine k-NN and Weighted k-NN have a better performance for the classification of gestures (98% of accuracy).

In addition, we would like to see for how large problems RSVM outperforms SVM on training time. In this paper we show that the RSVM formulation is already in a form of linear SVM and discuss four RSVM implementations. Experiments indicate that in general the test accuracy of RSVM are a little lower than that of the standard SVM. In addition, for problems with up to tens of thousands of data, if the percentage of support vectors is not high, existing implementations for SVM is quite competitive on the training time. Thus, from this empirical study, RSVM will be mainly useful for either larger problems or those with many support vectors.

We automate the extraction of relevant parts of medical history files; if sufficiently accurate, this would eliminate the need for human evaluators to comb through hundreds of pages of medical history files. We first create a list of medical concepts, mainly disease and procedure names, from the cardiovascular section of the \"Blue Book\" for Disability Evaluation under Social Security. Then, using a variation of the longest common substring algorithm, we characterize each medical file line using its substring overlaps with the list of medical concepts. Finally, with human annotations of whether each medical file line is relevant or not, we build machine learning classifiers predicting each line's relevance using its overlap characterization.

In order to overcome the difficulties this paper developed an approach for Plant Leaf Image Retrieval(PLIR) system using boundary extraction, feature fusion (shape, color and texture feature) extraction, feature selection using Genetic Algorithm(GA) and an efficient classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed.

In this study, a two-step modeling approach was used to map the type and timing of forest disturbances occurring between 1984 and 2010 in ten Landsat scenes located in diverse forest systems of the conterminous U.S. In step one, Random Forest (RF) models were developed to predict the presence of five forest disturbance agents (conversion, fire, harvest, stress and wind) and stable (i.e. undisturbed) forest. Models were developed using a suite of predictors including spectral change metrics derived from a nonparametric shape-restricted spline fitting algorithm, as well as several topographic and biophysical variables which potentially influence the initiation and/or spread of forest disturbance agents. Step two involved applying a rule-based model to the spectrally-based shape parameters (e.g. shape type, year and duration) to assign a year to the disturbance types and locations predicted in step one. Out of bag (OOB) predictions from RF showed that across the ten scenes, overall agreement was highest when only causal agent was considered (avg = 80%, min = 69%, max = 86%), and was lowest when both agent and year (within \u00b1 1 of the reference date) were required to be correct (avg = 71%, min = 56%, max = 80%).

However, these methods always tend to miss segmented results for the important regions of colon gland or make a wrong segmenting decision.In this paper, we address the challenging problem by proposed a novel framework through conditional generative adversarial network. First, the generator in the framework is trained to learn a mapping from gland colon image to a confidence map indicating the probabilities of being a pixel of gland object. The discriminator is responsible to penalize the mismatch between colon gland image and the confidence map. This additional adversarial learning facilitates the generator to produce higher quality confidence map. Then we transform the confidence map into a binary image using a fixed threshold to fulfill the segmentation task.

Generally, peptide binding prediction models are commonly used to find out whether a binding exists between a certain peptide(s) and a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule(s). Recent research efforts have been focused on quantifying the binding predictions. The objective of this thesis is to develop reliable real-value predictive models through the use of fuzzy systems. A non-linear system is proposed with the aid of support vector-based regression to improve the fuzzy system and applied to the real value prediction of degree of peptide binding. This research study introduced two novel methods to improve structure and parameter identification of fuzzy systems. First, the support-vector based regression is used to identify initial parameter values of the consequent part of type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy systems. Second, an overlapping clustering concept is used to derive interval valued parameters of the premise part of the type-2 fuzzy system. Publicly available peptide binding affinity data sets obtained from the literature are used in the experimental studies of this thesis. First, the proposed models are blind validated using the peptide binding affinity data sets obtained from a modelling competition. In that competition, almost an equal number of peptide sequences in the training and testing data sets (89, 76, 133 and 133 peptides for the training and 88, 76, 133 and 47 peptides for the testing) are provided to the participants. Each peptide in the data sets was represented by 643 bio-chemical descriptors assigned to each amino acid. Second, the proposed models are cross validated using mouse class I MHC alleles (H2-Db, H2-Kb and H2-Kk). H2-Db, H2-Kb, and H2-Kk consist of 65 nona-peptides, 62 octa-peptides, and 154 octa-peptides, respectively. Compared to the previously published results in the literature, the support vector-based type-1 and support vector-based interval type-2 fuzzy models yield an improvement in the prediction accuracy. The quantitative predictive performances have been improved as much as 33.6% for the first group of data sets and 1.32% for the second group of data sets. The proposed models not only improved the performance of the fuzzy system (which used support vector-based regression), but the support vector-based regression benefited from the fuzzy concept also. The results obtained here sets the platform for the presented models to be considered for other application domains in computational and/or systems biology. Apart from improving the prediction accuracy, this research study has also identified specific features which play a key role(s) in making reliable peptide binding affinity predictions. The amino acid features \u201cPolarity\u201d, \u201cPositive charge\u201d, \u201cHydrophobicity coefficient\u201d, and \u201cZimm-Bragg parameter\u201d are considered as highly discriminating features in the peptide binding affinity data sets. This information can be valuable in the design of peptides with strong binding affinity to a MHC I molecule(s). This information may also be useful when designing drugs and vaccines.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2287811234", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19619144"}

Following Poincare, we consider the construction of the perceptual space as a continuum equipped with a notion of magnitude. The study of the relationships of objects in the perceptual space gives rise to what we may call perceptual geometry. Computational modeling of objects and investigation of their deeper perceptual geometrical properties (beyond qualitative arguments) require a mathematical representation of the perceptual space. Within the realm of such a mathematical/computational representation, visual perception can be studied as in the well-understood logic-based geometry. This, however, does not mean that one could reduce all problems of visual perception to their geometric counterparts. Rather, visual perception as reported by a human observer, has a subjective factor that could be analytically quantified only through statistical reasoning and in the course of repetitive experiments. Thus, the desire to experimentally verify the statements in perceptual geometry leads to an additional probabilistic structure imposed on the perceptual space, whose amplitudes are measured through intervention by human observers. We propose a model for the perceptual space and the case of perception of textured surfaces as a starting point for object recognition. To rigorously present these ideas and propose computational simulations for testing the theory, we present the model of the perceptual geometry of surfaces through an amplification of theory of Riemannian foliation in differential topology, augmented by statistical learning theory. When we refer to the perceptual geometry of a human observer, the theory takes into account the Bayesian formulation of the prior state of the knowledge of the observer and Hebbian learning.

The frames of the PLP were compressed using vector quantization, with six codebook sizes namely; 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32. We used the technique of Leave One Person Out (LOPO) and the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifier with two types of kernels; RBF and Linear. The obtained results using the codebook size of 1 were no stable. Therefore, we proceeded to a bench of 100 trials. The best average accuracy obtained was 75.8%, and the maximum classification accuracy obtained was 91.17% using the codebook size of 1.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.15849/icit.2015.0026", "venue": "ICIT 2015", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2130932932", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["82253990", "249341", "4824951", "24895403", "15491516", "32004674", "82465038", "25141632", "15052804", "57997101", "41234860", "121901256", "6431632", "33981409", "13154535"], "inbound_citations": ["22774087", "18407935"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123356238"}

Analysis of the structure of an artificial neural network (ANN) in that class of networks shows a possibility to introduce geometric and categorical modeling methods. This can be described briefly as follows. A (noncommutative) geometric space can be interpreted as a so-called geometric net. To a given ANN a corresponding geometric net can be associated. Geometric spaces form a category. Consequently, one obtains a category of geometric nets with a suitable notion of morphism. Then it is natural to interpret a learning step of an ANN as a morphism, thus learning corresponds to a finite sequence of morphisms (the associated networks are the objects). An associated (\u201clocal\u201d) geometric net is less complex than the original ANN, but it contains all necessary information about the network structure. The association process together with learning (expressed by morphisms) leads to a commutative diagram corresponding to a suitable natural transformation, in terms of category theory. Commutativity of the diagram can be exploited to make learning \u201ccheaper\u201d. The simplified mathematical network model was used in ANN simulation applied in an industrial project on quality control. The \u201ceconomy\u201d of the model could be observed in a considerable increase of performance and decrease of production costs.

A problem faced by these systems is that as the number of items to be stored increases across a finite set of neurons/synapses, the cumulative changes in synaptic weight eventually lead to a sudden and dramatic loss of the stored information (catastrophic interference, CI) as the previous changes in synaptic weight are effectively lost. This effect does not occur in the brain, where information loss is gradual. Various attempts have been made to overcome the effects of CI, but these generally use schemes that impose restrictions on the system or its inputs rather than allowing the system to intrinsically cope with increasing storage demands. We show here that catastrophic interference occurs as a result of interference among patterns that lead to catastrophic effects when the number of patterns stored exceeds a critical limit. However, when Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is combined with the Hebb-Hopfield model, the model attains the ability to eliminate CI. This approach differs from previous orthogonalisation schemes used in connectionist networks which essentially reflect sparse coding of the input. Here CI is avoided in a network of a fixed size without setting limits on the rate or number of patterns encoded, and without separating encoding and retrieval, thus offering the advantage of allowing associations between incoming and stored patterns. ::: ::: PACS Nos.: 87.10.+e, 87.18.Bb, 87.18.Sn, 87.19.La", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4152133", "pubmed_id": "25180550", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0105619", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2054255785", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["14304798", "1607496", "314083", "22100845", "376004", "121114125", "119396061", "4420637", "34761008", "44305847", "2691726", "115910364", "18556305", "14689272", "11360891", "2981869", "2832081", "1419310", "16320016", "10651579", "7347604", "11295161", "61019113", "13086666", "7426803", "206027600", "5798849", "144400005", "18753333", "45569933", "1467377", "122951718", "17443611", "62249459", "2129036", "23574666", "143120758", "9039817"], "inbound_citations": ["55730012", "214784438"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15242940"}

Two types of features, unigrams and phrases are considered. Term frequency-inverse document (TF-IDF) scores are used as independent variables in these models. Experimental results show that the accuracy of phrases-only models has a range of 0-2% improvement for LR, NB, and RF compared with unigrams-only models. The accuracy of phrase-only model for SVC is close to that of unigrams-only model. The 74.53% accuracy of unigrams-only model for SVC classifier performs the best among all tested classifiers.

Further, we tune model parameters of one linear model (LR) and one non-linear model (RF) to see how these parameters will impact the models' performance.

However, the current diagnostic tools have poor sensitivity, especially for the early stages of AD and do not allow for diagnosis until AD has lead to irreversible brain damage. Therefore, it is crucial that AD is detected as early as possible. Although it is very hard, laborious and time-consuming to gather many AD and non-AD labeled samples, gathering unlabeled samples is easier than labeled samples. Since standard learning algorithms learn a diagnosis model from labeled samples only, they require many labeled samples and do not work well when the number of training samples is small. Therefore, it is very desirable to develop a predictive learning method to achieve high performance using both labeled samples and unlabeled samples. To address these problems, we propose semi-supervised distance metric learning using Random Forests with label propagation (SRF-LP) which incorporates labeled data for obtaining good metrics and propagates labels based on them. Experimental results showed that SRF-LP outperformed standard supervised learning algorithms, i.e., RF, SVM, Adaboost and CART and reached 93.1% accuracy at a maximum. Especially, SRF-LP largely outperformed when the number of training samples is very small.

To better understand which methods are more accurate when classifying data, some publicly available peak detection algorithms for Matrix assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) data were recently compared; however, the issue of different feature selection methods and different classification models as they relate to classification performance has not been addressed. With the application of intelligent computing, much progress has been made in the development of feature selection methods and learning classifiers for the analysis of high-throughput biological data. The main objective of this paper is to compare the methods of feature selection and different learning classifiers when applied to MALDI-MS data and to provide a subsequent reference for the analysis of MS proteomics data.ResultsWe compared a well-known method of feature selection, Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVMRFE), and a recently developed method, Gradient based Leave-one-out Gene Selection (GLGS) that effectively performs microarray data analysis. We also compared several learning classifiers including K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (KNNC), Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier (NBC), Nearest Mean Scaled Classifier (NMSC), uncorrelated normal based quadratic Bayes Classifier recorded as UDC, Support Vector Machines, and a distance metric learning for Large Margin Nearest Neighbor classifier (LMNN) based on Mahanalobis distance. To compare, we conducted a comprehensive experimental study using three types of MALDI-MS data.ConclusionRegarding feature selection, SVMRFE outperformed GLGS in classification. As for the learning classifiers, when classification models derived from the best training were compared, SVMs performed the best with respect to the expected testing accuracy. However, the distance metric learning LMNN outperformed SVMs and other classifiers on evaluating the best testing. In such cases, the optimum classification model based on LMNN is worth investigating for future study.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2709264", "pubmed_id": "19594880", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-10-S1-S3", "venue": "BMC Genomics", "journal": "BMC Genomics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2136970782", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["16846871", "196706314", "36028605", "14170117", "907319", "7105368", "82889711", "13920437", "2733884", "207720429", "2398824", "5175359", "13847763", "29625818", "9606870", "59771475", "1536455", "2071866", "14879317", "2643381", "7839315", "10303594", "8616518", "2257586", "5555257", "47325215", "64930269"], "inbound_citations": ["2583670", "55551331", "13227104", "215596167", "38398650", "18942758", "11341696", "13350652", "40301737", "14684503", "12474081", "28923400", "7634532", "9739501", "10306208", "15936481", "4957662", "15614907", "13290800", "5051078", "217936"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1513386"}

It is a well-known fact that around one million people suffer from Parkinson's disease in the United States whereas the number of people suffering from Parkinson's disease worldwide is around 5 million. Thus, it is important to predict Parkinson's disease in early stages so that early plan for the necessary treatment can be made. People are mostly familiar with the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, however, an increasing amount of research is being done to predict the Parkinson's disease from non-motor symptoms that precede the motor ones. If an early and reliable prediction is possible then a patient can get a proper treatment at the right time. Nonmotor symptoms considered are Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) and olfactory loss. Developing machine learning models that can help us in predicting the disease can play a vital role in early prediction. In this paper, we extend a work which used the non-motor features such as RBD and olfactory loss. Along with this the extended work also uses important biomarkers. In this paper, we try to model this classifier using different machine learning models that have not been used before. We developed automated diagnostic models using Multilayer Perceptron, BayesNet, Random Forest and Boosted Logistic Regression. It has been observed that Boosted Logistic Regression provides the best performance with an impressive accuracy of 97.159 % and the area under the ROC curve was 98.9%.

Objective In this study, we propose a text mining methodology which consists of two phases, NLP parsing and SVM classification to extract phosphorylation information from literature. Methods First, using NLP parsing we divide the data into three base-forms depending on the biomedical entities related to phosphorylation and further classify into ten sub-forms based on their distribution with phosphorylation keyword. Next, we extract the phosphorylation entity singles/pairs/triplets and apply SVM to classify the extracted singles/pairs/triplets using a set of features applicable to each sub-form. Results The performance of our methodology was evaluated on three corpora namely PLC, iProLink and hPP corpus. We obtained promising results of >85% F-score on ten sub-forms of training datasets on cross validation test. Our system achieved overall F-score of 93.0% on iProLink and 96.3% on hPP corpus test datasets. Furthermore, our proposed system achieved best performance on cross corpus evaluation and outperformed the existing system with recall of 90.1%.

Despite this fact, and as a result of the difficulty of establishing that a function is a positive definite kernel, only a few standard kernels (e.g. polynomial and Gaussian) are typically used.

However, experimentally determining protein structure is costly and slow, so the number of proteins with known sequence but unknown structure is increasing. Thus, computational methods for prediction of structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence are very useful. In this thesis, we focus on the problem of a special type of protein structure prediction called secondary structure prediction. The problem of structure prediction can be analyzed in categories. Some sequences can be enriched by forming multiple alignment profiles, whereas some are single sequences where one cannot form profiles. We look into different aspects of both cases in this thesis. The first case we focus in this thesis is when multiple sequence alignment information exists. We introduce a novel feature extraction technique that extracts unigram, bigram and positional features from profiles using dimension reduction and feature selection techniques. We use both these novel features and regular raw features for classification. We experimented with the following types of first level classifiers: Linear Discriminant Classifier (LDCs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). A novel method that combines these classifiers is introduced. Secondly, we focus on protein secondary structure prediction of single sequences. We explored different methods of training set reduction in order to increase the prediction accuracy of the IPSSP (Iterative Protein Secondary Structure Prediction) algorithm that was introduced before [34]. Results show that composition-based training set reduction is useful in prediction of secondary structures of orphan proteins.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "121323050", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115886972"}

In the AVI scheme, the region localization module is implemented by using a template-matching technique to locate the subject to be inspected based on the localization sub-mode. The defect detection module is realized by using the representative features obtained from the feature extraction module and executing the verification sub-model built in the model training module.

Automating this process is challenging due to the high diversity in appearance of tumor tissue among different patients and in many cases, similarity between tumor and normal tissue. This paper deals with an efficient segmentation algorithm for extracting the brain tumors in computed tomography images using Support Vector Machine classifier. The objective of this work is to compare the dominant grey level run length feature extraction method with wavelet based texture feature extraction method and SGLDM method. A dominant gray level run length texture feature set is derived from the region of interest (ROI) of the image to be selected. The optimal texture features are selected using Genetic Algorithm. The selected optimal run length texture features are fed to the Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM) to classify and segment the tumor from brain CT images. The method is applied on real data of CT images of 120 images with normal and abnormal tumor images. The results are compared with radiologist labeled ground truth. Quantitative analysis between ground truth and segmented tumor is presented in terms of classification accuracy. From the analysis and performance measures like classification accuracy, it is inferred that the brain tumor classification and segmentation is best done using SVM with dominant run length feature extraction method than SVM with wavelet based texture feature extraction method and SVM with SGLDM method.

Different case studies have already reported practical results proving that accurate forecasts may support optimization of operations in Water Distribution Networks (WDN). However, tuning the hyper-parameters of machine leaning algorithms is still an open problem. This paper proposes a parallel global optimization model to optimize the hyperparameters of Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression trained to provide accurate water demand forecasts in the short-time horizon (i.e. 24 h). Every SVM has the first 6 hourly water consumptions as input features and a specific hourly water demand as target to be predicted, among the remaining 18. The Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE), computed on leave-one-out validation, is the black-box objective function optimized. Moreover, a preliminary time-series clustering has been applied in order to evaluate if this can improve the accuracy of the forecasting mechanism. Time-series clustering implies that the overall number of SVMs, whose hyperparameters are optimized through parallel global optimization, increases, with a SVM trained for each cluster identified and for each hourly water demand to be predicted, making even more critical a quick tuning of the hyperparameters. Results on the urban water demand data in Milan prove that forecasting error is significantly low and that preliminary clustering allows for further reducing error while also improving computational performances.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cor.2018.01.013", "venue": "Comput.

Data was collected from the database provided by the University of Southern California (USC) for human activity recognition. Six features were computed to obtain the feature set. Different feature subsets were then evaluated based on the precision and recall scores. Using grid search algorithm, the best subset of hyperparameters (SVM kernel, regularization parameter(C) and \u03b3) for the SVM classifier which gives the highest precision and recall score was selected from the parameter space. The best set of features and the SVM hyperparameters for obtaining best results in activity recognition are proposed in this work.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISCMI.2016.30", "venue": "2016 3rd International Conference on Soft Computing & Machine Intelligence (ISCMI)", "journal": "2016 3rd International Conference on Soft Computing & Machine Intelligence (ISCMI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2763575759", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6870922", "2791599", "3258484", "17790805", "2443126", "9988056", "2905889", "2443126", "113453181"], "inbound_citations": ["126156189", "201743032", "133552667"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28246799"}

The one of source data is from a Lidar because it provides highly dense point cloud data with three dimensional position, intensities and ranges from the sensor to target. In this paper, we focus on how to segment point cloud data from a Lidar on a vehicle and classify objects on the road for the highly precise map.

Objects can be distinguish by geometrical features based on a surface normal of each point.

Our results also include a generalization of the standard AdaBoost to the cases where the output of each classifier may be probabilistic even for the same input. We prove that the update rules and the query complexity of the non-deterministic classifiers are the same as those of deterministic classifiers, which may be of independent interest to the classical machine-learning community. Furthermore, the AdaBoost algorithm can also be applied to data encoded in the form of quantum states; we show how the training set can be simplified by using the tools of t-design. Our approach describes a model of quantum machine learning where quantum speedup is achieved in finding the optimal classifier, which can then be applied for classical machine-learning applications.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1902.00869", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2914911440", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Physics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["125588372", "64536201", "52289576"], "inbound_citations": ["211082729", "208262191"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59599716"}

To mitigate the problem of exhaustively searching for model optimization, we propose the Dynamic Transfer Networks (DTN), a gated architecture which learns the appropriate parameter sharing scheme between source and target datasets.

The knowledge of the spatial distribution of vegetation types is an important information source for all social benefit areas.

The development and evaluation of concepts\u2019 for ::: integrated land-cover assessments attracted increased interest in the remote sensing community since evolving standards for the characterization of land-cover enable an easier access and intercomparability of earth observation data. ::: Regarding the complexity of the savanna biome in terms of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the vegetation structure and rainfall variability, the main research needs are addressing the assessment of the capabilities and limitations of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data for mapping vegetation types in Namibia. The Random Forest framework was evaluated for mapping MODIS time series metrics in a Kalahari test site in north-eastern Namibia. ::: In regard of the necessity to report the usefulness of the FAO and UNEP Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) in regional case studies, LCCS is evaluated in terms of the applicability in open savanna ecosystems and as ontology for the semantic integration of an in-situ vegetation database in a coarse scale mapping framework based on MODIS data. The results of the ::: integrated use of in-situ-, Landsat, and MODIS data in a standard mapping framework are used to assess the capabilities of the methodological setups of global land-cover mapping initiatives. In order to assess the existing accuracy uncertainties of mapping savannas at global scales, the effects ::: of composite length and varying observation periods were compared in terms of mapping accuracy. ::: The implications for global monitoring were discussed. The determinants of precipitation amount and mapping accuracy were evaluated by comparing MODIS and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) time series. ::: The synergistic use of multi-scale land-cover information, such as life form, cover, and height of vegetation types (in-situ), vegetation physiognomy and local patterns (Landsat), and phenology (MODIS) in an integrated ecosystem assessment framework resulted in a flexible land-cover map including a broad structural-physiognomic and a hytosociological legend. The principle of classifiers and modifiers in LCCS proved to be applicable in dry savanna ecosystems and can be confirmed as overarching land-cover ontology. Analyses of time series classifications showed that mapping accuracy increases with increasing observation period. Small composite period lengths ::: lead to increased mapping accuracies. The relationship between mapping accuracy and observation period was observed as a function of precipitation input and the magnitude of change between land-cover stages. ::: The integration of in-situ data in a multi-scale framework leads to improved knowledge of the regionalisation of Namibian vegetation types.

In recent years, the method based on Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) has achieved great success in generating high quality images. Among them, as a special case of GANs, Conditional GANs (CGANs) introduces prior information in the process of image generation to guide the generator to generate sample images with specific conditions. Inspired by CGANs, and in order to solve some problems in face aging research: (1) the accuracy of aging; (2) the aging effect is realistic and natural; (3) identity information is invariant, we propose a face aging simulation method based on conditional cycle loss and the principle of homology continuity. Different from the previous CGANs method for aging process simulation, we reconstruct the input face by using the synthesized aging face and the age label of the input face. By minimizing the reconstruction loss, the identity information during the process of face aging is maintained. At the same time, in order to ensure the accuracy of aging, we introduce an age classification network based on the Principle of Homology-Continuity, which is more consistent with the process of human \u201ccognition\u201d.

Conceptualized as a dynamic capability, incremental learning is expected to be a vital driver of organizational adaptation. As dynamic capabilities consist of bundles of relatively stable routines, it is proposed that an organization's level of incremental learning capabilities will be highly persistent over time. It is also argued that building and exercising incremental learning capabilities is resource intensive and will as such tend to rely on the availability of sufficient slack resources. Last, it is suggested that incremental learning will be positively related to organizational performance, especially when the underlying business model is labour rather than capital intensive.

Recent years have witnessed an increasing amount of available electronic health record (EHR) data and machine learning (ML) techniques have been considerably evolving. However, managing and modeling this amount of information may lead to several challenges, such as overfitting, model interpretability, and computational cost. Starting from these motivations, we introduced an ML method called sparse balanced support vector machine (SB-SVM) for discovering T2D in a novel collected EHR dataset (named Federazione Italiana Medici di Medicina Generale dataset). In particular, among all the EHR features related to exemptions, examination, and drug prescriptions, we have selected only those collected before T2D diagnosis from an uniform age group of subjects.

Identifying variables which affect quality variables is called causal analysis. In batch processes, time-series data of process variables and the corresponding data of quality variables are generally acquired. Since causal analysis using the raw data needs a large computation load, it is often performed after compressing time-series process variables data into non-time-series feature variables data. Various causal analysis methods using such data have been developed, however, none have shown effective results in actual plants. In the present work, non-time-series kernel Granger causality (NTS-KGC) is proposed for causal analysis with non-time-series data of batch processes. This is a method that kernel Granger causality [1], which is used for causal analysis with time-series data in nonlinear systems, is expanded for causal analysis with non-time-series data. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical example of a nonlinear batch process. In addition, we conducted a case study of applying NTS-KGC to data obtained from a real steelmaking process. The results demonstrate that NTS-KGC is superior to other existing methods using the following indexes, i.e. variable influence on projection (VIP) of partial least squares (PLS), regression coefficients of PLS, and variable importance of Random Forest.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ASCC.2017.8287443", "venue": "2017 11th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)", "journal": "2017 11th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2786757896", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17141953", "124075845", "27749586", "17767360", "122830292", "123722079", "59473531", "121610058", "16652370", "582140", "124742846", "35730151", "27353286", "16162039", "11920190", "89141"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3419072"}

However, the state-of-the-art gk-SK runs extremely slow when we increase the dictionary size (\u03a3) or allow more mismatches (M). This is because current gk-SK uses a trie-based algorithm to calculate co-occurrence of mismatched substrings resulting in a time cost proportional to O(\u03a3M). We propose a fast algorithm for calculating Gapped k-mer Kernel using Counting (GaKCo). GaKCo uses associative arrays to calculate the co-occurrence of substrings using cumulative counting. This algorithm is fast, scalable to larger \u03a3 and M, and naturally parallelizable. We provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis that compares GaKCo with the state-of-the-art gk-SK. Theoretically, the time cost of GaKCo is independent of the \u03a3M term that slows down the trie-based approach. Experimentally, we observe that GaKCo achieves the same accuracy as the state-of-the-art and outperforms its speed by factors of 2, 100, and 4, on classifying sequences of DNA (5 datasets), protein (12 datasets), and character-based English text (2 datasets). 1", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/329425", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2950956043", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["3204652", "14656696", "2488082", "41874679", "256149", "961425", "331378", "91479189", "3116168", "23040938", "25808974", "2048632", "120470419", "1909052", "7217980", "2847896", "11894600", "9725578", "8961273", "669209", "2591554", "33411681", "7862344", "27402999", "215213529", "16969601", "990233", "784094", "61112307", "368182", "9067453"], "inbound_citations": ["211840533", "209565886", "393535", "52089888"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196655688"}

There are too many objects to classify manually in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, one of the premier data sources in astronomy. Therefore, efficient machine learning and classification algorithms are required to automate the classifying process. We propose to apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify galaxy morphologies and Krylov iterative methods to improve runtime of the classification. The accuracy of the classification is measured on various categories of galaxies from the survey. A three-class algorithm is presented that makes use of multiple SVMs. This algorithm is used to assign the categories of spiral, elliptical, and irregular galaxies. A selection of Krylov iterative solvers are compared based on their efficiency and accuracy of the resulting classification. The experimental results demonstrate that runtime can be significantly improved by utilizing Krylov iterative methods without impacting classification accuracy.

Audio data is ingested, segmented, decoded to produce a sequence of phones, and subsequently indexed using phone N-grams. Search is performed by expanding queries into phone sequences and matching against the index. The approximate match score is derived from a CRF, trained on parallel transcripts, which provides a general framework for modeling the errors that a recognition system may make taking contextual effects into consideration. Our approach differs from other work in the field in that we focus on using CRFs to model context dependent phone level confusions, rather than on explicitly modeling parameters of an edit distance.

This system fully utilizes both aural and visual data from birds to perform classification tasks at two levels of recognition. The neural network performs an initial classification that is validated by the expert system. Once accepted, the expert system applies its knowledge base for further discrimination within the class. This system optimizes classification performance by incorporating reasoning capabilities for validation as well as for providing further decision support to the neural network.

According to the unbalanced number of stage specific EEG segments the concordance between expert scoring and automatically generated classification had to be evaluated by a set of criteria. The training of the networks and the adaptation of the fuzzy rules was controlled by multi criteria optimization.

Analyzing these networks sheds light on different aspects of social life such as the structure of societies, information diffusion, and communication patterns. In reality, however, the large scale of information networks often makes network analytic tasks computationally expensive or intractable. Network representation learning has been recently proposed as a new learning paradigm to embed network vertices into a low-dimensional vector space, by preserving network topology structure, vertex content, and other side information. This facilitates the original network to be easily handled in the new vector space for further analysis. In this survey, we perform a comprehensive review of the current literature on network representation learning in the data mining and machine learning field. We propose new taxonomies to categorize and summarize the state-of-the-art network representation learning techniques according to the underlying learning mechanisms, the network information intended to preserve, as well as the algorithmic designs and methodologies. We summarize evaluation protocols used for validating network representation learning including published benchmark datasets, evaluation methods, and open source algorithms. We also perform empirical studies to compare the performance of representative algorithms on common datasets, and analyze their computational complexity.

The idea was to analyse complex behaviour (speaking, thinking, problem-solving) from different angles or levels and to build models that could account for them. ::: ::: ::: GOALS ::: ::: While ambitious and intriguing, the idea looked promising enough to attract numerous researchers, and there were plenty of opportunities then to present this kind of work. Alas, the situation has changed, the discipline has lost speed during the last decade. And if the reasons for this are multiple, ranging from lack of results to unkept promises (\u00ab cognitive science \u00bb remaining wishful thinking rather than a widely shared way of doing research), the fact is that funding has become more and more scarce, and so have the opportunities to present work done within this framework. ::: ::: In the meantime statistical approaches have gained in popularity, and evaluation has become an obligatory feature for presentation of work in the arena of computational linguistics. While there is no doubt that evaluation has certain qualities, it does not guarantee progress or insights per se. A broader perspective is needed. To get the necessary insights and to get the big picture, we probably need to get back to the framework in which we worked in those days, which means, we should adopt and integrate multiple viewpoints, that is, take a cognitive science approach. This is the goal of this workshop. ::: ::: ::: JUSTIFICATION OF THE NEW NAME AND RELATION TO THE TOPICS ::: ::: The workshop used to be called NLUCS (Natural Language Understanding and Cognitive Science), yet, realising that this is too restrictive, we decided to rename it NLPCS (Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Science), as NLP is obviously more than just natural language understanding. Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, Machine Translation, Question Answering, Text Summarization, Text Generation,etc. are all part of NLP or HLT (Human Language Technology), and they all go clearly beyond language understanding. This being so, it might be a valuable proposition to integrate them into the debate. In other words, we would like to widen the scope and provide a forum for all researchers of NLP working within the CS paradigm. ::: ::: Also, while certain components (dictionaries, grammars, or ontologies)are very general, the way they are used varies considerably with the task. Hence it is important to show how the task reflects in the use of a given resource. ::: The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers working within the paradigm of cognitive science ::: ::: TOPICS OF INTEREST INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: ::: ::: \u2022 Computational Models of NLP ::: \u2022 Cognitive and Psychological Models of NLP ::: \u2022 Evolutionary NLP ::: \u2022 Situated (embodied) NLP ::: \u2022 Multimodality in speech / text processing ::: \u2022 Text Summarization and Information Extraction ::: \u2022 Natural Language Interfaces and Dialogue Systems ::: \u2022 Computer Assisted Language Learning ::: \u2022 Multi-Lingual Processing ::: \u2022 Pragmatics and NLP ::: \u2022 Speech Processing ::: \u2022 Tools and Resources in NLP ::: \u2022 Ontologies ::: \u2022 Text Mining ::: \u2022 Electronic Dictionaries ::: \u2022 Evaluation of NLP Systems ::: ::: These topics can be addressed from any of the following perspectives: ::: full automation by machines for machine (traditional NLP or HLT), semi-automated processing, i.e. machine-mediated processing (programs assisting people in their tasks), simulation of human cognitive process. ::: ::: ::: SUBMISSION OF PAPERS ::: ::: Prospective authors are invited to submit papers for oral presentation in any of the areas listed above.

How does the brain effectively learn concepts from a small number of examples despite the fact that each example contains a huge amount of information? We provide a novel analysis for a model of robust concept learning (closely related to \"margin classifiers\"), and show that a relatively small number of examples are sufficient to learn rich concept classes (including threshold functions, Boolean formulae and polynomial surfaces). As a result, we obtain simple intuitive proofs for the generalization bounds of Support Vector Machines. In addition, the new algorithm has several advantages-they are faster conceptually simpler and highly resistant to noise. For example, a robust half-space can be PAC-learned in linear time using only a constant number of training examples, regardless of the number of attributes. A general (algorithmic) consequence of the model, that \"more robust concepts are easier to learn\", is supported by a multitude of psychological studies.", "year": 1999, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SFFCS.1999.814637", "venue": "40th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (Cat.

In this paper, we introduce a novel Adaptive Generative Adversarial Network (AdaGAN) for non-parallel VC task, which effectively requires single generator, and two discriminators for transferring the style from one speaker to another while preserving the linguistic content in the converted voices. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to introduce a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based architecture (i.e., AdaGAN) in machine learning literature, and the first attempt to apply this architecture for nonparallel VC task. In this paper, we compared the results of the AdaGAN w.r.t. state-of-the-art CycleGAN architecture. Detailed subjective and objective tests are carried out on the publicly available VC Challenge 2018 corpus. In addition, we perform three statistical analysis which show effectiveness of AdaGAN over CycleGAN for parallel-data free one-to-one VC. For inter-gender and intra-gender VC, We observe that the AdaGAN yield objective results that are comparable to the CycleGAN, and are superior in terms of subjective evaluation. A subjective evaluation shows that AdaGAN outperforms CycleGAN-VC in terms of naturalness, sound quality, and speaker similarity.

The berry size is one of the most important fruit traits in grapevine breeding. Non-invasive, image-based phenotyping promises a fast and precise method for the monitoring of the grapevine berry size. In the present study an automated image analyzing framework was developed in order to estimate the size of grapevine berries from images in a high-throughput manner. The framework includes (i) the detection of circular structures which are potentially berries and (ii) the classification of these into the class 'berry' or 'non-berry' by utilizing a conditional random field. The approach used the concept of a one-class classification, since only the target class 'berry' is of interest and needs to be modeled. Moreover, the classification was carried out by using an automated active learning approach, i.e. no user interaction is required during the classification process and in addition, the process adapts automatically to changing image conditions, e.g. illumination or berry color. The framework was tested on three datasets consisting in total of 139 images. The images were taken in an experimental vineyard at different stages of grapevine growth according to the BBCH scale.

First, we design a generative adversarial network based multi-label edge classification model to classify rarely labeled edges in graphs with a large amount of noise data into K classes.

Such a discovery has yet to be made for GANs, and reported disentanglement scores of GAN-based methods are significantly inferior to VAE-based methods on benchmark datasets. To this end, we propose a novel regularizer that achieves higher disentanglement scores than state-of-the-art VAE- and GAN-based approaches. The proposed contrastive regularizer is inspired by a natural notion of disentanglement: latent traversal. Latent traversal refers to generating images by varying one latent code while fixing the rest. We turn this intuition into a regularizer by adding a discriminator that detects how the latent codes are coupled together, in paired examples.

Subsequently, the resulted features along with four RR features are fed into Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify five categories. Thereafter, the heartbeats are further classified to one of the classes belonging to the assigned category. Two different strategies for classification have been investigated: One versus All and One versus One. The proposed method has been applied on data from lead 1 and lead 2. A new fusion step is introduced, where stacked generalisation algorithm is applied and different types of classifiers have been examined. Experiments have been carried out using a MIT_BIH database.

Moreover, the factors those affect users\u2019 preference for items and friends are complex in social networks. For example, users may be influenced by their friends in addition to their own preferences when they choose items. To tackle these problems, we first construct two implicit graphs of users according to the users\u2019 shared neighbours in friendship network and the users\u2019 common interested items in interest network to ease data sparsity issue. Then we stand on recent advances in embedding learning techniques and propose a unified graph-based embedding model, called UGE.

In this work, we propose a novel methodology for generating realistic flow-based network traffic. Our approach is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which achieve good results for image generation. A major challenge lies in the fact that GANs can only process continuous attributes. However, flow-based data inevitably contain categorical attributes such as IP addresses or port numbers. Therefore, we propose three different preprocessing approaches for flow-based data in order to transform them into continuous values.

Our net is pruned from the VGG-16 model starting from the last convolutional (conv) layer where we find neuron activations are highly uncorrelated given the gender. Through Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), we show that this high decorrelation makes it safe to discard directly last conv layer neurons with high within-class variance and low between-class variance.

In the proposed methodology, we use K-means clustering for partitioning each category EEG data set (e.g. healthy; epileptic seizure) into several clusters and then extract some representative characteristics from each cluster. Subsequently, we integrate all the features from all the clusters in one feature set and then evaluate that feature set by three well-known machine learning methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive bayes and Logistic regression.

We have designed an observational study intended to assess the comparative effectiveness of supplementation with a juice powder concentrate foreseeing multiple exposure groups, multiple primary endpoints and prospective use of propensity score matching. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: Three different exposure groups (Control, \"Capsules\" and \"Shake\") and three primary endpoints have been identified (TNF-\u03b1, Homocysteine and Vitamin C). This study design presents a multiplicity problem with two sources of multiplicity. The two supplementation-control comparisons (Capsules vs Control and Shake vs Control) and the between-supplementation comparison (Capsules vs Shake) will serve as the first source of multiplicity. In addition to that, three multiple primary endpoints are tested in each comparison.A formal power analysis is carried out through simulations assuming: i) specific effect sizes per comparison per endpoint; ii) t-test with parallel gatekeeping with truncated Holm test as the multiplicity adjustment procedure; iii) control of the familywise error rate (FWER) at a pre-specified 0.05 level.For a proper comparative analysis of effectiveness, we foresee the use of matching on a propensity score (PS) prospectively. PSs are typically applied in retrospective cohort studies. However we initially developed a Random Forest-based PS model on historical data. The PSs predicted by this tool are used to match patients on an ongoing basis to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of supplementation. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: With a sample size of 20 subjects per exposure group, the disjunctive power for testing each primary endpoint (i.e., the probability of establishing a significant effect in Capsules vs. Control or Shake vs. Control or Capsules vs. Shake) is 78%, 51%, 97% for TNF-\u03b1, Homocysteine and Vitamin C, respectively. ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: The increasing availability of computational resources and methods allows researchers to conduct comparative effectiveness cohort studies that require prospective data collection, by transporting Pss to new patients.

In musical notation both kinds are present, although the notation of continuous time is less developed than that of metric time (often just a word like \"rubato\" or \"accelerando\" is notated in the score). In the experimental literature, different ways in which a musician can add continuous timing changes to the metrical score have been identified. There are systematic changes in certain rhythmic forms: for example, shortening triplets (Vos and Handel 1987) and timing differences occurring in voice leading with ensemble playing (Rasch 1979). Deliberate departures from metricality, such as rubato, seem to be used to emphasize musical struc- ture, as exemplified in the phrase-final lengthening principle formalized by Todd (1985). In addition to these effects, which are collectively called expressive timing, there are nonvoluntary effects, such as random timing errors caused by the limits in the accuracy of the motor system (Shaffer 1981) and errors in mental time-keeping processes (Vorberg and Hambuch 1978). These effects are generally rather small - in the order of 10-100 msec. To make sense of most musical styles, it is necessary to separate the discrete and continuous components of musical time. We will call this process of separation quantization, although the term is generally used to reflect only the extraction of a metrical score from a musical performance.", "year": 1989, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2307/3680012", "venue": null, "journal": "Computer Music Journal", "mag_id": "2120053230,2587470186", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["54029868", "17458314", "15563964", "36441731", "206475167", "215704207", "10431952", "13677284", "16217276", "18660062", "12936377", "8994163", "18559516", "49480728", "18798082", "15082138", "503917", "18331850", "52083997", "3453648", "10043759", "3666328", "55505390", "16534266", "56464482", "13915120", "18975220", "14688421", "1381859", "14417168", "13070747", "16618551", "1543685", "599918", "57570839", "53959492", "13896070", "8433839", "7635059", "15092108", "2590227", "25839526", "53747190", "18897402", "12784925", "17867007", "6939137", "55115996", "201103754", "8705736", "8411272", "2065799", "16887592", "26226229", "17419139", "1040581", "198162714", "17392959", "52856897", "15285890", "18168497", "2541164", "52037959", "5289731", "16799657", "17332405", "7198024", "552372", "15462290", "207871137", "10700175", "11221579"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57790272"}

While previous studies have examined a wide range of above-ground parameters in ecotones, soil microbial communities have received little attention. Here we investigated spatial patterns, composition, and co-occurrences of archaea, bacteria, and fungi, and their relationships with soil ecological processes across a woodland-grassland ecotone. Geostatistical kriging and network analysis revealed that the community structure and spatial patterns of soil microbiota varied considerably between three habitat components across the ecotone. Woodland samples had significantly higher diversity of archaea while the grassland samples had significantly higher diversity of bacteria. Microbial co-occurrences reflected differences in soil properties and ecological processes. While microbial networks were dominated by bacterial nodes, different ecological processes were linked to specific microbial guilds. For example, soil phosphorus and phosphatase activity formed the largest clusters in their respective networks, and two lignolytic enzymes formed joined clusters. Bacterial ammonia oxidizers were dominant over archaeal oxidizers and showed a significant association (p < 0.001) with potential nitrification (PNR), with the PNR subnetwork being dominated by Betaproteobacteria.

The output or the response can then be fine-tuned by changing the design parameters based on this information. However, simply fine-tuning the output to the desired or target value is not adequate. Robust design principles suggest that we not only study the mean response for a given input vector but also the variance in the output attributed to noise and other unaccounted factors. Given our desire to reduce variability in any process, it is also important to understand which of the input factors affect the variability in the output the most. Given the significant computational overhead associated with most Computer Aided Engineering models, it is becoming popular to conduct such analysis through surrogate models built using a variety of metamodeling techniques. In this regard, existing literature on metamodeling and sensitivity analysis techniques provides useful insights into the various scenarios that they suit the best. However, there has been a limitation of studies that simultaneously consider the combination of metamodeling and sensitivity analysis and the environments in which they operate the best. This paper aims at contributing to reduce this limitation by basing the study on multiple metrics and using two test problems. Two test functions have been used to build metamodels, using three popular metamodeling techniques: Kriging, Radial-Basis Function (RBF) networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The metamodels are then used for sensitivity analysis, using two popular sensitivity analysis methods, Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) and Sobol, to determine the influence of variance in the input variables on the variance of the output variables. The advantages and disadvantages of the different metamodeling techniques, in combination with the sensitivity analysis methods, in determining the extent to which the variabilities in the input affect the variabilities in the output are analyzed.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cie.2009.04.003", "venue": "Comput.

This thesis covers a comprehensive design of 2D Hybrid, 2D+Time, and 3D Active Appearance Models (AAM) based on extending the AAM framework introduced by Edwards, Taylor and Cootes. ::: Under the AAM technique, manually traced segmentation examples create a statistical model of appearance during an automated training stage. Information about the shape and appearance of similar objects is contained in a single model ensuring a spatially and/or temporally consistent segmentation. This technique segments images by optimizing this appearance model onto the target image. ::: In addition to segmentation, we develop a fully automated landmark placement technique to assign point corresponding landmarks onto to a set of training images. This is critical for the 3D AAMs because determining point correspondence is a time consuming and often ill-posed task. ::: AAM coefficients, generated in the segmentation process, capture the shape and appearance variations of the target object; therefore we hypothesize that AAM coefficients may be used for the classification of disease abnormalities. Classification techniques like Linear Discriminant Analysis, Kernel Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machines showed tendency of disease prediction within a 9% misclassification error. This thesis demonstrates the clinical potential of AAM techniques in short-axis cardiac MR images. We assess the method's performance by comparing manual independent standards in 162 images for 2D, 25 image sequences for 2D+Time, and 56 volumes for 3D models.

Most of the bees studied so far are temperate or tropical species but many ecosystems are predicted to experience increased aridification under climate change. Therefore, we need to understand how pollinator species are likely to respond.

Overall, our models predict that this bee will have an increased area of suitable habitat as climate change progresses, including an increased range within protected areas. However, its potential range will shift further into coastal areas, that are highly human populated and urbanised.

Based on two quantum chemical descriptors (the thermal energy Ethermal and the total energy of the whole system EHF) calculated from the structures of the repeat units of polyacrylamides by density functional theory (DFT), the support vector regression (SVR) approach combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO), is proposed to establish a model for prediction of the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polyacrylamides. The prediction performance of SVR was compared with that of multivariate linear regression (MLR). The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE=4.65K), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE=1.28%) and correlation coefficient (R2=0.9818) calculated by leave-one\u2013out cross validation (LOOCV) via SVR models are superior to those achieved by QSPR (MAE=14.25K, MAPE=4.39% and R2=0.9211) and QSPR-LOO (MAE=17.01K, MAPE=5.66% and R2=0.8823) models for the identical samples, respectively. The prediction results strongly demonstrate that the modeling and generalization abilities of SVR model consistently surpass those of QSPR and QSPR-LOO models. It is revealed that the established SVR model is more suitable to be used for prediction of the Tg values for unknown polymers possessing similar structure than the conventional MLR approach.

An existing IA account of aphasic naming is described, in which two network parameters ( decay rate and connection strength ) are varied to fit the error production of an aphasic patient. Fairly similar results can be obtained through modification of additional parameters, including the so-called \u201cshared weight increase factor\u201d linking lexical and semantic units.

A modular connectionist architecture is presented, in which semantic\u2013lexical and phonological knowledge are instantiated using self-organizing Kohonen maps, while connections between them are implemented using Hebbian networks; a linear connectionist network (Madaline) is used to simulate nonword repetition.

Most approaches follow a Discrimination based paradigm, where the aim is to find the best way to separate the examples of one class from those of other classes. A less popular approach follows a Characterization based paradigm, where the aim is to build a description (model) of every class from examples, and use this model to recognizes instances of that class. This paper focuses on the specific task of classifying and tagging symbolic sequences, by introducing a Characterization approach, based on Structured Hidden Markov Models, and compares its perfomances against a widely used discriminative approach, i.e. kernel machines. This task is particulary relevant to several applications in many fields, such as molecular biology, web log analysis, network traffic analysis, user profiling, and so on. In order to assess the validity of the proposed approach, an artificial benchmark has been designed in such a way that the regularities to be discovered are well known and allow for a controlled evaluation of the real capabilities the learning algorithms investigated.

This paper proposes a systematic approach to reduce the computational complexity of HEVC based on an ensemble of online and offline Random Forests classifiers. A reduced set of features for training the Random Forests classifier is proposed, based on the rankings obtained from information gain and a wrapper-based approach. The best model parameters are also obtained through a consistent and generalizable method. The proposed Random Forests classifier is used to model the coding unit and transform unit-splitting decision and the SKIP-mode prediction, as binary classification problems, taking advantage from the combination of online and offline approaches, which adapts better to the dynamic characteristics of video content. Experimental results show that, on average, the proposed approach reduces the computational complexity of HEVC by 62.64% for the random access (RA) profile and 54.57% for the low-delay (LD) main profile, with an increase in BD-Rate of 2.58% for RA and 2.97% for LD, respectively.

We present here one such technique, the Random Forest classifier, to aid medical practitioners in accurate diagnosis of the diseases. A computer-aided diagnosis system is proposed for detecting retina abnormalities, which combines K means-based segmentation of the retina image, after due preprocessing, followed by machine learning techniques, using several low level and statistical features. Abnormalities in the retina that are classified are caused by age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Performance measures used in the analysis are accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, and Mathew correlation coefficient.

Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate the re-id advantages of the proposed DPFL model over a wide range of state-of-the-art re-id methods on three benchmarks Market-1501, CUHK03, and DukeMTMC-reID.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCVW.2017.304", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)", "journal": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2768610172", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5707386", "1330580", "206593071", "206593071", "2177856", "3332134", "206590483", "207323040", "17087021", "7973738", "3198903", "7546954", "3961724", "206594692", "1396647", "7200347", "12670695", "10070153", "207763512", "938105", "938105", "3489845", "13536642", "14124239", "13262103", "6141990", "2057858", "2024800", "130535382", "9431917", "11333819", "656536", "3804840", "2904170", "11008236", "11758569", "5584770", "2930547", "15636047", "14124313", "5231143", "10632692", "1322267", "206593880", "15402687", "15172651", "15172651", "16756781", "16756781", "2304733", "1029934", "1345724", "3464415", "13829574", "4234245", "3043202", "122694523", "564273", "6114905", "480975", "14297895", "11864530", "12148694", "14991802", "1661291", "2683207", "206595765"], "inbound_citations": ["212636987", "181687792", "51748458", "199489215", "4556464", "207985433", "195823196", "208005613", "4331913", "4418812", "196621849", "54453936", "209853223", "49538012", "203951462", "208039005", "52146342", "203170085", "203952464", "203605190", "208229342", "106411821", "197935526", "52988211", "210971181", "71152843", "102352528", "202763956", "4955915", "21691985", "4564819", "47017849", "102352688", "51876005", "53988782", "201138966", "211031851", "211679724", "211679724", "201058617", "4882356", "210930217", "56719496", "50775160", "202777812", "131775324", "203996702", "53037289", "204837019", "203654603", "52842960", "126875482", "207828637", "210839277", "210703887", "209449506", "199577547", "70278399", "195065162", "4410813", "146121263", "149769455", "49671490", "204837045", "208139398", "59235652", "208205977", "171096332", "211206976", "211082584", "52188130", "53037926", "53099351", "198179699", "195886226", "195258763", "215722888", "102483234", "53114190", "214676444", "207985236", "52166927", "199577776", "90262786", "53287847", "53287847", "13676613", "203605652", "145050804", "201069002", "211226767", "54442121", "199001188", "14685197", "198929507", "210930925", "195329288", "54440427", "201646405", "174799416", "13742156", "203654937", "52895837", "3708495", "212645006", "198148096", "195881905", "212640052", "145957153", "204955154", "155444222", "52024680", "208881165", "49558981", "202774756", "52289810", "198161521", "4591954", "4462331", "22786961", "210963842", "195823307", "3458516", "49907834", "51927412", "53039958", "85499670", "198172599", "202773963", "71715323", "4546391", "67874682", "210838897", "208268532", "4305188", "214637439", "3087218", "52084273", "54440460", "210164857", "209350352", "52292078", "202686279", "186206547", "49366785", "209383237", "53722850", "53084484", "146809315", "202775647", "10013306", "69214677", "52181345", "7953821", "208278814", "188052581", "202765401", "203951481", "201900512", "52821276", "202539991", "199439043", "52275719", "198147238", "198930760", "69636558", "204575830", "54464253", "49569466", "106406922", "53835584", "51878485", "54202049", "204512264", "209461278", "182425060", "54457546", "210931729"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4729614"}

Nevertheless, this is not as straightforward as it may seem, because market conditions must be studied first. Relationships between magnitudes of deviations between forecast and actual production and market penalties that apply at each moment are crucial. In this study, we analyze various day-ahead production forecasts for a 1.86 MW photovoltaic plant considering different techniques and sets of inputs. A nRMSE of 22.54% was obtained for a Support Vector Regression model trained by numerical weather predictions (NWP). This model produced the most benefits. An annual forecasting value of 4788\u20ac with respect to a persistence model was obtained for trading in the Iberian (Spain and Portugal) day-ahead electricity market. Annual value added by the NWP service totaled 2801\u20ac and room for improvement regarding NWP variables rose to 3877\u20ac. As a general trend, it was found that smaller errors (RMSE) generated higher incomes. For each 1 kW h improvement in RMSE, the annual value of forecasting increased 22.32\u20ac. Nevertheless, some models that gave larger errors than others also brought greater benefits.

However, many applications in artificial intelligence involve more than one modality. It is therefore of broad interest to study the more difficult and complex problem of modeling and learning across multiple modalities. In this paper, a technical review of the models and learning methods for multimodal intelligence is provided. The main focus is the combination of vision and natural language, which has become an important area in both computer vision and natural language processing research communities. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent work on multimodal deep learning from three angles --- learning multimodal representations, the fusion of multimodal signals at various levels, and multimodal applications. On multimodal representation learning, we review the key concept of embedding, which unifies the multimodal signals into the same vector space and thus enables cross-modality signal processing. We also review the properties of the many types of embedding constructed and learned for general downstream tasks. On multimodal fusion, this review focuses on special architectures for the integration of the representation of unimodal signals for a particular task. On applications, selected areas of a broad interest in current literature are covered, including image-to-text caption generation, text-to-image generation, and visual question answering.

Previous words in the sentence can influence the processing of the current word in the timescale of hundreds of milliseconds. Recent neurophysiological studies in humans suggest that the fronto-striatal system (frontal cortex, and striatum \u2013 the major input locus of the basal ganglia) plays a crucial role in this process. The current research provides a possible explanation of how certain aspects of this real-time processing can occur, based on the dynamics of recurrent cortical networks, and plasticity in the cortico-striatal system. We simulate prefrontal area BA47 as a recurrent network that receives on-line input about word categories during sentence processing, with plastic connections between cortex and striatum. We exploit the homology between the cortico-striatal system and reservoir computing, where recurrent frontal cortical networks are the reservoir, and plastic cortico-striatal synapses are the readout. The system is trained on sentence-meaning pairs, where meaning is coded as activation in the striatum corresponding to the roles that different nouns and verbs play in the sentences. The model learns an extended set of grammatical constructions, and demonstrates the ability to generalize to novel constructions. It demonstrates how early in the sentence, a parallel set of predictions are made concerning the meaning, which are then confirmed or updated as the processing of the input sentence proceeds. It demonstrates how on-line responses to words are influenced by previous words in the sentence, and by previous sentences in the discourse, providing new insight into the neurophysiology of the P600 ERP scalp response to grammatical complexity. This demonstrates that a recurrent neural network can decode grammatical structure from sentences in real-time in order to generate a predictive representation of the meaning of the sentences.

For extracting feature, the distance between two articulated points and the angle between horizontal axis and joint vector are measured and normalized on each detected body. A codebook is then constructed using the K-means algorithm to encode the merged set of distance and angle. For modeling activities from sparse features, a hierarchical model developed on the Pachinko Allocation Model is proposed to describe the flexible relationship between features - poselets - activities in the temporal dimension.

The detection of broken strands in transmission lines using inspection robots equipped with suitable detectors is a method with good prospects. In this paper, a method for detecting broken strands in transmission lines using an eddy current transducer (ECT) carried by a robot is developed, and an approach for identifying broken strands in transmission lines based on an S-transform is proposed. The proposed approach utilizes the S-transform to extract the module and phase information at each frequency point from detection signals. Through module phase and comparison, the characteristic frequency points are ascertained, and the fault information of the detection signal is constructed. The degree of confidence of broken strand identification is defined by the Shannon fuzzy entropy (SFE-BSICD). The proposed approach combines module information while utilizing phase information, SFE-BSICD, and the energy, so the reliability is greatly improved. These characteristic qualities of broken strands in transmission lines are used as the input of a multi-classification SVM, allowing the number of broken strands to be determined.

A family of models was constructed by orthogonally varying training environment (naturalistic versus non-naturalistic) and number representation (one-to-one versus magnitude). The ability of the models to account for the adult distance and size effects depended critically on a naturalistic training environment but was relatively independent of number representation. With respect to the developmental data, the naturalistic/one-to-one model provided a good account of response times and errors. The relation between the current models and prior models and avenues for future exploration are discussed. Keywords: number comparison; distance effect; size effect; connectionism; models; development Introduction The nature of number representations is an enduring question in cognitive science. One clue to this representation is the distance effect: the time it takes to judge the greater (or lesser) of two numbers decreases with the distance between the numbers (Moyer & Landauer, 1967). For example, 1 vs. 9 is judged faster than 1 vs. 3. Another clue is the size effect: the time to judge the greater (or lesser) of two numbers that are a fixed distance apart increases with the absolute magnitude of the numbers (Parkman, 1971). For example, 7 vs. 9 is judged more slowly than 1 vs. 3. The distance and size effects conform to psychophysical laws (i.e., ) and are therefore commonly interpreted as evidence that numbers are represented as analog representations, perhaps localized to the intra-parietal sulcus (Dehaene, Piazza, Pinel, & Cohen, 2003). Researchers have proposed various implementations of these analog representations. The classic ones are as points on a compressed mental number line (Dehaene & Mehler, 1992; Rule, 1969) and as points on a linear mental number line associated with increasing variability (e.g., Gallistel & Gelman, 2000). More recently, two connectionist models of number representation have appeared. Zorzi and Butterworth (1999) assumed magnitude representations whereby numbers are represented by banks of overlapping units. This model was able to account for the adult distance effect. By contrast, Verguts, Fias, and Steven (2005) assumed a coarse-coded representation, with each number corresponding primarily to one unit, but with graded activation of adjacent units. This model was able to account for the adult distance and size effects. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the ability of connectionist models to (1) account for the adult distance and size effects as a function of training environment and number representation and to (2) account for the development of the distance effect. In these regards, the reported simulations are the first of their kind. With respect to training environment, some connectionist models (Zorzi & Butterworth, 1999) have employed a non- naturalistic training environment (i.e., every one-digit number appears with equal likelihood). However, corpus studies indicate that the frequency of a number falls off as a power function of its magnitude (Dehaene & Mehler, 1992), implying that one-digit numbers are non-uniformly distributed in a naturalistic environment. Some connectionist models have employed a naturalistic training environment (Verguts et al., 2005). We sampled comparisons (i.e., pairs of one-digit numbers) from these contrasting training environments to evaluate whether the distance and size effects were contingent upon naturalistic input. With respect to number representation, we considered the magnitude representation implemented by the Zorzi and Butterworth (1999) model and a one-to-one variant of the coarse-coded representation implemented by the Verguts et al. (2005) model 1 . Finally, in the first study to model the development of the distance effect, we evaluated whether improvements in model performance throughout training parallel improvements in children\u2019s response times and error rates throughout development. Method We developed four connectionist models by orthogonally varying training environment (naturalistic versus non- naturalistic) and number representation (magnitude versus one-to-one). The models were implemented within a common connectionist architecture patterned after Verguts et al. (2005). Both of these codings represent exact numbers. We use the label \u201cmagnitude\u201d to reflect the fact that the number of representation nodes activated in this coding corresponds to the number being compared.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2767510062", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["22067176", "144483083", "42822507", "15533559", "39057590", "63549281"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14874991"}

It is well known that when data dimension is very high, the search time can exceed the time required for performing a linear scan on the entire dataset. To alleviate this dimensionality curse, indexing schemes such as locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and M-trees were proposed to perform approximate searches. In this chapter,\\(^\\dagger\\) we present a hypersphere indexer, named \\({\\sf SphereDex},\\) to perform such searches. \\({\\sf SphereDex}\\) partitions the data space using concentric hyperspheres. By exploiting geometric properties, \\({\\sf SphereDex}\\) can perform effective pruning. Our empirical study shows that \\({\\sf SphereDex}\\) enjoys three advantages over competing schemes for achieving the same level of search accuracy. First, \\({\\sf SphereDex}\\) requires fewer disk-seek operations. Second, \\({\\sf SphereDex}\\) can maintain disk accesses sequential most of the time. And third, it requires fewer distance computations. More importantly, \\({\\sf SphereDex}\\) can be extended to support hyperplane queries for Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or the kernel methods. In classification problems using SVMs, the data instances closest to the hyperplane are considered to be most ambiguous, and the ones farthest away from the hyperplane to be most certain (or most confident) regarding their class membership. Hyperplane queries, rather than point queries, are essential to supporting fast retrieval of applications using SVMs. In the end of this chapter, we illustrate how \\({\\sf SphereDex}\\) can be extended to support both nearest and farthest neighbor hyperplane query processing.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-20429-6_11", "venue": "Foundations of Large-Scale Multimedia Information Management and Retrieval", "journal": "Foundations of Large-Scale Multimedia Information Management and Retrieval", "mag_id": "24166384", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["56346278"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115856382"}

Moreover, an embedded CPU with very limited processing power could least cater such heavy processing. Therefore our research in general focuses on developing application specific architectures for hardware acceleration of computer vision algorithms. This paper presents a continuation of a series of research to hardware accelerate HOG-SVM algorithm on FPGA. In this paper we mainly present the high performance application specific architecture for hardware acceleration of HOG-SVM which was successful in achieving a high throughput of 240fps on HD frames of size 1920x1080 which is a significant improvement of performance compared to previous research. On the other-hand, both hardware utilization and power consumption are minimized. A mechanism based around Block RAM (BRAM) structures and deep pipelining are used as the key architectural techniques of achieving high performance. The proposed design was deployed on Zynq 7000 FPGA platform which contains a hardwired ARM CPU along with the programmable FPGA fabric.

In the rule based method, we employed the existing Synesketch algorithm with two types of emotion word list: a manually written and a translated WordNet-Affect list. In the statistical based method, we employed SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm with unigram feature and feature selection algorithms of Information Gain and Minimum Frequency. Other than a pure statistical based method, we also employed the manually built emotion word list in the SVM based classification.

False negative errors are usually the worst in terms of social and economic losses because they are related to a misclassification of areas at risk. In this paper we present a new methodology aimed at improve the accuracy of the LSMs using measurement points (PS, Permanent Scatterers and DS, Distributed Scatterers) retrieved through the multi-interferometric SqueeSAR technique.

However, due to the difficulty of data acquisition, sometimes we could only obtain small-scale datasets which may leads to unreasonable generalization performances. For SVM-like algorithms, we could resort to Large Margin theory to find out solutions for such dilemma. Recent studies on large margin theory show that, besides maximizing the minimum margin of a given training dataset, it is also necessary to optimization the margin distribution to boost the overall generalization ability. Correspondingly, a novel SVM-like algorithm called Large Margin Distribution Machine (LDM) realizes this idea by maximizing the average of margin and minimizing the variance of margin simultaneously. And a series of applications has been reported thereafter. There is another well-known machine learning algorithm called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) which shares similar framework with SVM. It is believed in this paper ELM could also benefit from the virtues of margin distribution optimization. Bearing this in mind, a novel algorithm called Extreme Large Margin Distribution Machine(ELDM) is proposed in this paper by bridging the advantages of ELM and LDM.

Biological invasions are a major consequence of globalization and pose a significant threat to biodiversity. Because only a small fraction of introduced species become invasive, identification of those species most likely to become invasive after introduction is highly desirable to focus management efforts. The predictive potential of species-specific traits has been much investigated in plants and animals. However, despite the importance of fungi as a biological group and the potentially severe effects of pathogenic fungi on agrosystems and natural ecosystems, the specific identification of traits correlated with the invasion success of fungi has not been attempted previously. ::: ::: ::: ::: 2. We addressed this question by constructing an ad hoc data set including invasive and non-invasive species of forest pathogenic fungi introduced into Europe. Data were analysed with a machine learning method based on classification trees (Random Forest). The performance of the classification rule based on species traits was compared with that of several random decision rules, and the principal trait predictors associated with invasive species were identified. ::: ::: ::: ::: 3. Invasion success was more accurately predicted by the classification rule including biological traits than by random decision rules. The effect of species traits was maintained when confounding variables linked to residence time and habitat availability were included. The selected traits were unlikely to be affected by a phylogenetic bias as invasive and non-invasive species were evenly distributed in fungal clades. ::: ::: ::: ::: 4. The species-level predictors identified as useful for distinguishing between invasive and non-invasive species were traits related to long-distance dispersal, sexual reproduction (in addition to asexual reproduction), spore shape and size, number of cells in spores, optimal temperature for growth and parasitic specialization (host range and infected organs). ::: ::: ::: ::: 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that some species-level traits are predictors of invasion success for forest pathogenic fungi in Europe. These traits could be used to refine current pest risk assessment (PRA) schemes. Our results suggest that current schemes, which are mostly based on sequential questionnaires, could be improved by taking into account trait interactions or combinations.

Small, specialised systems have a large number of feasible solutions, but developing truly adaptive, and still understandable, systems for highly complex systems require domain expertise and more compact approaches at the basic level. This paper focuses on the integration of methodologies in the smart adaptive applications. Statistical methods and arti cial neural networks form a good basis for the data-driven analysis of interactions and fuzzy logic introduces solutions for knowledge-based understanding the system behaviour and the meaning of variable levels. Efficient normalisation, scaling and decomposition approaches are the key methodologies in developing large-scale applications. Linguistic equation (LE) approach originating from fuzzy logic is an efficient technique for these problems. The nonlinear scaling methodology based on advanced statistical analysis is the corner stone in representing the variable meanings in a compact way to introduce intelligent indices for control and diagnostics. The new constraint handling together with generalised norms and moments facilitates recursive parameter estimation approaches for the adaptive scaling. Well-known linear methodologies are used for the steady state, dynamic and case-based modelling in connection with the cascade and interactive structures in building complex large scale applications. To achieve insight and robustness the parameters are de ned separately for the scaling and the interactions.

This paper focuses on an integrated approach that combines both types of approaches in an adaptive manner. The proposed models were inspired by recent advances in neurological context. Both a neural model and a more abstracted cognitive model are presented. In the first place emotion reading is modelled involving (preparatory) mirroring of body states of the observed person within the observing person. This involves a recursive body loop: a converging positive feedback loop based on reciprocal causation between preparations for body states and emotions felt. Here emotion reading involves the person's own body states and emotions in reading somebody else's emotions: first the same feeling is developed by mirroring, and after feeling the emotion, it is imputed to the other person. In the second place, as an extension an adaptive process is modelled based on Hebbian learning of a direct connection between a sensed stimulus concerning another agent's body state (e.g., face expression) and an emotion imputation state.

Both the mirroring and Hebbian learning processes first have been modelled at a neural level, and next, in a more abstracted form at a cognitive level.

In an increasingly globalized economy, bankruptcy results both in huge economic losses and tremendous social impact. While early prediction for a bankruptcy, if done appropriately, is of great importance to banks, insurance firms, creditors, and investors, the need of substantially more accurately predicting models becomes crucial. This problem has been approached by various methods ranging from statistics to machine learning, however they find a class decision estimate rather than a probabilistic confidence of the class distribution. In this paper we show that sparse Bayesian models also known as Relevance Vector Machine (RVMs) are superior to the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) therefore leading to predictors of choice. The advantage of RVM approach is that the classifier can yield a decision function that is much sparser than the SVM while maintaining its detection accuracy. This can lead to significant reduction in the computational complexity of the decision function, thereby making it more suitable for real-time applications. Preliminary experiments on Coface Data set (French credit risk provider) show that RVM classifiers outperform SVM, lead to more sparse and accurate prediction models.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247338", "venue": "The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings", "journal": "The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2127610742", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["166776939", "18241516", "57323334", "15734886", "8188805", "152519561", "123141880", "6530745", "7596571", "7138354", "18702845", "59684330"], "inbound_citations": ["14307715", "12561905", "199526066"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1108540"}

Besides testing the recommendations in terms of accuracy and Kappa (for MH and categorical parameters), RMSE and R2 (for numerical parameters), we also explore the importance of each meta-feature in MH recommendation models.

In this way, the unique characteristics of each technique are combined to capture different patterns in the data. At first, wavelet analysis is used to decompose rainfall time series into wavelet coefficients, and then the wavelet coefficients are used as inputs into the ELM model to forecast rainfall. The accuracy of the model is further improved using a modular learning approach. In the modular learning, an innovative approach to determine the optimum number of clusters entitled threshold cluster number is introduced. The relative performances of the proposed models are compared with the single ELM model for three cases consisting of one daily rainfall series from Iran (Kharjeguil station), one daily rainfall series from India (Ajmer station) and one daily rainfall series from the United States (Barton Pond station). The correlation coefficient (r), root mean square errors (RMSE) and Nash\u2013Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS) statistics are used as the comparing criteria. The comparison results indicate that the proposed modular wavelet\u2013ELM method could significantly increase the forecast accuracy and perform much better than both the wavelet\u2013ELM and single ELM. Moreover, three case study results indicate the importance of determining the optimum number of clusters based on the new concept of threshold cluster number in order to achieve optimum forecast results.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11269-019-02333-5", "venue": "Water Resources Management", "journal": "Water Resources Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2967025041", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["127467091", "129607262", "117934195", "46005708", "128559290", "140583136", "130309865", "53411510", "124152565", "53326336", "100496403", "140556691", "26796528", "131180257", "122961094", "131297556", "116858", "128901040", "5258073", "153697833", "207616769", "8027278", "206775459", "206380974", "119889815", "128906704", "2356353", "13590682", "53400555", "129593982", "128560507", "129084388", "7105508", "127861352", "12592464", "14300576", "10198475", "123142823", "109973948"], "inbound_citations": ["208359979"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201017930"}
