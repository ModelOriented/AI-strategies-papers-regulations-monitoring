One of structured models, Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (GCRF), utilizing multiple unstructured models to learn the non-linear relationships between node attributes and the structured response variable, achieves high prediction accuracy. However, it does not scale well with large networks. We propose a novel model, called Scalable Approximate GCRF (SA-GCRF), which integrates weighted attributed network compression with GCRF, with the aim of making GCRF applicable to large networks. The model consists of three steps: first, it compresses a network into a smaller one by generalizing nodes into supernodes and edges into superedges; then, it applies GCRF to the reduced network; and finally, it unfolds the predicted response variables into the original nodes. Our hypothesis is that the reduced network maintains most information of the original network such that the loss in prediction accuracy obtained by GCRF on the reduced network is minor. The comprehensive experimental results indicate that SA-GCRF was 150\u2013520 times faster than standard GCRF and 11\u201329 times faster than state-of-the-art UmGCRF on large networks, and provided regression results where GCRF and UmGCRF were not applicable.

Semisupervised learning (SSL) methods provide promising solutions to address the aforementioned issue. Graph-based SSL algorithms, also called label propagation methods, have obtained increasing attention in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, the graphs constructed by utilizing the geometrical structure similarity of samples are unreliable due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the HSIs, especially for the case of very limited labeled pixels. Our motivation is to construct label propagation ensemble (LPE) model, then use the decision fusion of multiple label propagations to obtain pseudolabeled pixels with high classification confidence. In LPE, random subspace method is introduced to partition the feature space into multiple subspaces, then several label propagation models are constructed on corresponding subspaces, finally the results of different label propagation models are fused at decision level, and only the unlabeled pixels whose label propagation results are the same will be assigned with pseudolabels. Meanwhile extreme learning machine classifiers are trained on the labeled and pseudolabeled samples during the iteration. Compared with traditional label propagation methods, our proposed method can deal with the situation of very limited labeled samples by providing pseudolabeled pixels with high classification confidence, consequently, the accurate base classifiers are obtained. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, LPE is compared with several state-of-the-art methods on four hyperspectral datasets.

The optimization requirement in turn, establishes the need to develop fast and effective approaches to the optimization procedure, providing the best predictive power of the constructed model. In this study, we investigated the Bayesian and random search optimization of Support Vector Machine hyperparameters for classifying bioactive compounds. The effectiveness of these strategies was compared with the most popular optimization procedures\u2014grid search and heuristic choice. We demonstrated that Bayesian optimization not only provides better, more efficient classification but is also much faster\u2014the number of iterations it required for reaching optimal predictive performance was the lowest out of the all tested optimization methods. Moreover, for the Bayesian approach, the choice of parameters in subsequent iterations is directed and justified; therefore, the results obtained by using it are constantly improved and the range of hyperparameters tested provides the best overall performance of Support Vector Machine. Additionally, we showed that a random search optimization of hyperparameters leads to significantly better performance than grid search and heuristic-based approaches. The Bayesian approach to the optimization of Support Vector Machine parameters was demonstrated to outperform other optimization methods for tasks concerned with the bioactivity assessment of chemical compounds. This strategy not only provides a higher accuracy of classification, but is also much faster and more directed than other approaches for optimization. It appears that, despite its simplicity, random search optimization strategy should be used as a second choice if Bayesian approach application is not feasible.Graphical abstract The improvement of classification accuracy obtained after the application of Bayesian approach to the optimization of Support Vector Machines parameters.

For this challenging problem, distance metric learning is shown to be effective in matching person images. However, existing approaches either require a heavy computation due to the positive semidefinite (PSD) constraint, or ignore the PSD constraint and learn a free distance function that makes the learned metric potentially noisy. We argue that the PSD constraint provides a useful regularization to smooth the solution of the metric, and hence the learned metric is more robust than without the PSD constraint. Another problem with metric learning algorithms is that the number of positive sample pairs is very limited, and the learning process is largely dominated by the large amount of negative sample pairs. To address the above issues, we derive a logistic metric learning approach with the PSD constraint and an asymmetric sample weighting strategy. Besides, we successfully apply the accelerated proximal gradient approach to find a global minimum solution of the proposed formulation, with a convergence rate of O(1/t^2) where t is the number of iterations. The proposed algorithm termed MLAPG is shown to be computationally efficient and able to perform low rank selection.

Smartphones with accelerometer and gyroscope sensors are a convenient, minimally invasive, and low cost approach for mobility monitoring. HAR systems typically pre-process raw signals, segment the signals, and then extract features to be used in a classifier. Feature selection is a crucial step in the process to reduce potentially large data dimensionality and provide viable parameters to enable activity classification. Most HAR systems are customized to an individual research group, including a unique data set, classes, algorithms, and signal features. These data sets are obtained predominantly from able-bodied participants. In this paper, smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data were collected from populations that can benefit from human activity recognition: able-bodied, elderly, and stroke patients. Data from a consecutive sequence of 41 mobility tasks (18 different tasks) were collected for a total of 44 participants. Seventy-six signal features were calculated and subsets of these features were selected using three filter-based, classifier-independent, feature selection methods (Relief-F, Correlation-based Feature Selection, Fast Correlation Based Filter). The feature subsets were then evaluated using three generic classifiers (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, j48 Decision Tree).

Apart from the conventional ADR information contained in the structured section of ADERs, more detailed information such as pre- and post- ADR symptoms, multi-drug usages and ADR-relief treatments are described in the free-text section, which can be mined through Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. Objective The goal of this study was to extract ADR-related entities from free-text section of Chinese ADERs, which can act as supplements for the information contained in structured section, so as to further assist in ADR evaluation. Methods Three models of Conditional Random Field (CRF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-CRF (BiLSTM-CRF) and Lexical Feature based BiLSTM-CRF (LF-BiLSTM-CRF) were constructed to conduct Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks in free-text section of Chinese ADERs. A semi-supervised learning method of tri-training was applied on the basis of the three established models to give un-annotated raw data with reliable tags. Results Among the three basic models, the LF-BiLSTM-CRF achieved the highest average F1 score of 94.35%. After the process of tri-training, almost half of the un-annotated cases were tagged with labels, and the performances of all the three models improved after iterative training. Conclusions The LF-BiLSTM-CRF model that we constructed could achieve a comparatively high F1 score, and the fusion of CRF, while BiLSTM-CRF and LF-BiLSTM-CRF in tri-training might further strengthen the reliability of predicted tags. The results suggested the usefulness of our methods in developing the specialized NER tools for identifying ADR-related information from Chinese ADERs.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31323311", "doi": "10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103252", "venue": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "journal": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "mag_id": "2957763665", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198131847"}

The process of predicting emotions from facial expression images contains several stages. The first stage of this system is the pre-processing stage, which is applied by detecting the face in images and then resizing the images. The second stage involves extracting features from facial expression images using Facial Landmarks and Center of Gravity (COG) feature extraction algorithms, which generate the training and testing datasets that contain the expressions of Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Neutrality, Sadness, and Surprise.

It also proposes a modified decision making approach using bit-wise OR operation at the output of the classifier for different colour components. The R, G, B and grey scale values are extracted from the input image. This is then subject to 2D EWT to form the sub-band images. Then correntropy is extracted from these decomposed components. Features are selected using two methods: Student\u2019s t-test and PCA. Features are classified using Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) to classify between normal and glaucoma images. For performance analysis, the impact of testing and training on the detection and performance analysis of the classifier was done. It is found that the accuracy of detection using Student\u2019s t-test to the blue component is 78.8% and combined response of red, blue, green and grey component gives 97% whereas the accuracy of detection using PCA to the red component is 87.3% and the combined response of red, blue, green and grey component is 99%.

However, this method may not be a straight-forward task considering several issues such as original network size or large differences between the source and target domain. In this paper, we perform transfer learning for semantic segmentation of off-road driving environments using a pre-trained segmentation network called DeconvNet. We explore and verify two important aspects regarding transfer learning. First, since the original network size was very large and did not perform well for our application, we proposed a smaller network, which we call the light-weight network. This light-weight network is half the size to the original DeconvNet architecture. We transferred the knowledge from the pre-trained DeconvNet to our light-weight network and fine-tuned it. Second, we used synthetic datasets as the intermediate domain before training with the real-world off-road driving data. Fine-tuning the model trained with the synthetic dataset that simulates the off-road driving environment provides more accurate results for the segmentation of real-world off-road driving environments than transfer learning without using a synthetic dataset does, as long as the synthetic dataset is generated considering real-world variations. We also explore the issue whereby the use of a too simple and/or too random synthetic dataset results in negative transfer.

The KPCA was used to extract nonlinear features from the complexity parameters of EEG and to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors. SVM was used to classify two fatigue states. The experimental result shows that complexity parameters are significantly decreased as the fatigue level increases, which suggests that the proposed parameters can be used to characterize mental fatigue level.

A surge of effort has been spent design the best feature representation, and to learn either the transformation of such features across cameras or an optimal matching metric. Metric learning solutions which are currently in vogue in the field generally require a dimensionality reduction pre-processing stage to handle the high-dimensionality of the adopted feature representation. Such an approach is suboptimal and a better solution can be achieved by combining such a step in the metric learning process. Towards this objective, a low-rank matrix which projects the high-dimensional vectors to a low-dimensional manifold with a discriminative Euclidean distance is introduced. The goal is achieved with a stochastic accelerated proximal gradient method.

The paper proposes two new ELM variants: Binary ELM, with a weight initialization scheme based on { 0 , 1 } -weights; and Ternary ELM, with a weight initialization scheme based on { - 1 , 0 , 1 } -weights. The motivation behind this approach is that these features will be from very different subspaces and therefore each neuron extracts more diverse information from the inputs than neurons with completely random features traditionally used in ELM. Therefore, ideally it should lead to better ELMs. Experiments show that indeed ELMs with ternary weights generally achieve lower test error. Furthermore, the experiments show that the Binary and Ternary ELMs are more robust to irrelevant and noisy variables and are in fact performing implicit variable selection. Finally, since only the weight generation scheme is adapted, the computational time of the ELM is unaffected, and the improved accuracy, added robustness and the implicit variable selection of Binary ELM and Ternary ELM come for free.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2014.01.072", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2081489378", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15589402", "116858", "11124791", "14383241", "14555837", "16795400", "15017201", "685382", "2891159", "17292559", "125898915", "10941293", "17128241", "2208295", "9245771", "9953398", "2825141", "16538082", "15601363"], "inbound_citations": ["59232483", "46895754", "53565993", "55332234", "59261859", "35590603", "210148979", "69519147", "46407846", "51611053", "34555232", "45485202", "198334499"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13144767"}

Preprogramming robots for execution of complex domestic tasks such as setting a dinner table is of little use, since the same order of subtasks may not be conceivable in the run time due to the changed state of the world. In our approach, we aim to learn the goal of the task and use a task planner to reach the goal given different initial states of the world. For some tasks, there are underlying constraints that must be fulfille, and knowing just the final goal is not sufficient. We propose two techniques for constraint identification. In the first case, the teacher can directly instruct the system about the underlying constraints. In the second case, the constraints are identified by the robot itself based on multiple observations. The constraints are then considered in the planning phase, allowing the task to be executed without violating any of them.

Principal component analysis (PCA) of the NIR data displayed the clustering of objects with respect to the type of chips. NIR spectra were rank-ordered with the use of the sparingly applied multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) ranking methods, PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation) and GAIA (Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Aid), and a comprehensive quantitative description of the data was obtained. The four traditional parameters were predicted on the basis of the NIR spectra; the performance of the Partial Least Squares (PLS), and Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) calibrations was compared with those from Least Squares-Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) method. The LS-SVM calibrations, which model better data linearity and non-linearity, successfully predicted all four parameters.

Based on visual inspection and Inception scores, we demonstrate that ArtGAN is able to draw high resolution and realistic artwork, as well as generate images of much higher quality in four other datasets (i.e. CIFAR-10, STL-10, Oxford-102 and CUB-200).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1708.09533", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2750823072", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1033682", "14124313", "206592484", "206594692", "12803511", "11758569", "6230637", "1282515", "1099052", "1563370", "1277217", "60282629", "18268744", "2930547", "15876696", "9957731", "7208970", "308212", "15193013", "16119123", "14168099", "1687220", "1915923", "2063572", "6142708", "5554756", "1930231", "8142135", "14989939", "12663716", "6138149", "10894094", "35563", "57832010", "2202933", "6200260", "16365915", "1902025", "3559987", "5002792", "5284428", "2023211", "18920693", "6628106", "5216145", "5707386", "2187805", "64200748", "14803274", "122932724", "3073252", "6104263", "16367617", "13619197", "1840346", "8094560"], "inbound_citations": ["49530438"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195347056"}

Identifying the resident\u2019s activities in an apartment is an important module in such systems. Dense sensing approach aims to embed sensors in the environment to report the detected events continuously. The events are segmented and analyzed via classifiers to identify the corresponding activity. Although several methods were introduced in recent years for detecting simple activities, the recognition of complex ones requires more effort. Due to the different time duration and event density of each activity, finding the best size of the segments is one of the challenges in detecting the activity. Also, using appropriate classifiers that are capable of detecting simple and interleaved activities is the other issue. In this paper, we devised a two-phase approach called CARER (Complex Activity Recognition using Emerging patterns and Random forest). In the first phase, the emerging patterns are mined, and various features of the activities are extracted to build a model using the Random Forest technique. In the second phase, the sequences of events are segmented dynamically by considering their recency and sensor correlation. Then, the segments are analyzed by the generated model from the previous phase to recognize both simple and complex activities. We examined the performance of the devised approach using the CASAS dataset. To do this, first we investigated several classifiers. The outcome showed that the combination of emerging patterns and the random forest provide a higher degree of accuracy. Then, we compared CARER with the static window approach, which used Hidden Markov Model. To have a fair comparison, we replaced the dynamic segmentation module of CARER with the static one. The results showed more than 12% improvement in f-measure. Finally, we compared our work with Dynamic sensor segmentation for real-time activity recognition, which used dynamic segmentation.

The most common approach is based on inferred homology using a statistically based sequence similarity (SIM) method, e.g. PSI-BLAST. Alternative non-SIM based bioinformatic methods are becoming popular. One such method is Data Mining Prediction (DMP). This is based on combining evidence from amino-acid attributes, predicted structure and phylogenic patterns; and uses a combination of Inductive Logic Programming data mining, and decision trees to produce prediction rules for functional class. DMP predictions are more general than is possible using homology. In 2000/1, DMP was used to make public predictions of the function of 1309 Escherichia coli ORFs. Since then biological knowledge has advanced allowing us to test our predictions. ::: ::: Results: We examined the updated (20.02.02) Riley group genome annotation, and examined the scientific literature for direct experimental derivations of ORF function. Both tests confirmed the DMP predictions. Accuracy varied between rules, and with the detail of prediction, but they were generally significantly better than random. For voting rules, accuracies of 75--100% were obtained. Twenty-one of these DMP predictions have been confirmed by direct experimentation. The DMP rules also have interesting biological explanations. DMP is, to the best of our knowledge, the first non-SIM based prediction method to have been tested directly on new data. ::: ::: Availability: We have designed the 'Genepredictions' database for protein functional predictions.

This is a particular challenge for driver drowsiness detection, where many publicly available datasets are unrepresentative as they cover only certain ethnicity groups. Traditional augmentation methods are unable to improve a model\u2019s performance when tested on other groups with different facial attributes, and it is often challenging to build new, more representative datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that boosts the performance of detection of drowsiness for different ethnicity groups.

A sampling method selects faces where the model is not performing well, which are used to fine-tune the CNN. Experiments show the efficacy of our approach in improving driver drowsiness detection for under represented ethnicity groups.

Materials and Methods: The clinically meaningful representations of medical concepts and patients are the key for health analytic applications. Most of existing approaches directly construct features mapped to raw data (e.g., ICD or CPT codes), or utilize some ontology mapping such as SNOMED codes. However, none of the existing approaches leverage EHR data directly for learning such concept representation. We propose a new way to represent heterogeneous medical concepts (e.g., diagnoses, medications and procedures) based on co-occurrence patterns in longitudinal electronic health records. The intuition behind the method is to map medical concepts that are co-occuring closely in time to similar concept vectors so that their distance will be small. We also derive a simple method to construct patient vectors from the related medical concept vectors. Results: We evaluate similar medical concepts across diagnosis, medication and procedure. The results show xx% relevancy between similar pairs of medical concepts.

One of the SemEval challenges in the year 2011 and 2013 was designed to tackle the task where the best system achieved an F1 score of 0.80. In this paper, we propose to utilize dependency embeddings and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) embeddings as features for extracting DDIs. Our contribution is two-fold.

The dependency embeddings incorporated structural syntactic contexts into the embeddings, which were not present in the conventional word embeddings. Second, we proposed a novel syntactic embedding approach using AMR. AMR aims to abstract away from syntactic idiosyncrasies and attempts to capture only the core meaning of a sentence, which could potentially improve DDI extraction from sentences. Two classifiers (Support Vector Machine and Random Forest) taking these embedding features as input were evaluated on the DDIExtraction 2013 challenge corpus.

Reliable and precise regional multi-step-ahead PM2.5 forecasts are crucial and beneficial for mitigating health risks. This work explores a novel framework (MM-SVM) that combines the Multi-output Support Vector Machine (M-SVM) and the Multi-Task Learning (MTL) algorithm for effectively increasing the accuracy of regional multi-step-ahead forecasts through tackling error accumulation and propagation that is commonly encountered in regional forecasting. The Single-output SVM (S-SVM) is implemented as a benchmark. Taipei City of Taiwan is our study area, where three types of air quality monitoring stations are selected to represent areas imposed with high traffic influences, high human activities and commercial trading influences, and less human interventions close to nature situation, respectively. We consider forecasts of PM2.5 concentrations as a function of meteorological and air quality factors based on long-term (2010\u20132016) observational datasets. Firstly, the Kendall tau coefficient is conducted to extract key spatiotemporal factors from regional meteorological and air quality inputs. Secondly, the M-SVM model is trained by the MTL to capture non-linear relationships and share correlation information across related tasks. Lastly, the MM-SVM model is validated using hourly time series of PM2.5 concentrations as well as meteorological and air quality datasets. Regarding the applicability of regional multi-step-ahead forecasts, the results demonstrate that the MM-SVM model is much more promising than the S-SVM model because only one forecast model (MM-SVM) is required, instead of constructing a site-specific S-SVM model for each station. Moreover, the forecasts of the MM-SVM are found better consistent with observations than those of any single S-SVM in both training and testing stages. Consequently, the results clearly demonstrate that the MM-SVM model could be recommended as a novel integrative technique for improving the spatiotemporal stability and accuracy of regional multi-step-ahead PM2.5 forecasts.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30243160", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.09.111", "venue": "The Science of the total environment", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "mag_id": "2891750563", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201983829", "211227456", "208164972"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52879370"}

Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm not only is efficient and reliable but also meets the real-time requirements of anomaly detection in industrial control system.

Previous identity preserving face synthesis processes are largely confined to synthesizing faces with known identities that are already in the training dataset. To synthesize a face with identity outside the training dataset, our framework requires one input image of that subject to produce an identity vector, and any other input face image to extract an attribute vector capturing, e.g., pose, emotion, illumination, and even the background. We then recombine the identity vector and the attribute vector to synthesize a new face of the subject with the extracted attribute. Our proposed framework does not need to annotate the attributes of faces in any way. It is trained with an asymmetric loss function to better preserve the identity and stabilize the training process. It can also effectively leverage large amounts of unlabeled training face images to further improve the fidelity of the synthesized faces for subjects that are not presented in the labeled training face dataset.

Usually, the model assumes that a full Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation will be performed for inference, which can be really slow in practice. In this paper, we argue that through appropriate training, a MRF/CRF model can be trained to perform very well on a suboptimal inference algorithm. The model is trained together with a fast inference algorithm through an optimization of a loss function on a training set containing pairs of input images and desired outputs. A validation set can be used in this approach to estimate the generalization performance of the trained system.

SVMs (Support Vector Machines) are a useful technique for data classification. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a linear machine working in the highly dimensional feature space formed by the nonlinear mapping of the N-dimensional input vector x into a K-dimensional feature space (K>N) through the use of a mapping \u03a6 (x). The data points corresponding to the non-zero weights are called support vectors. The main goal is to measure the error to get the exact solution can be approximated by a function and also get the error accurately to determine the best function implemented by learning system using finite training set and testing set (unseen). The best function closely measure the optimization error in finite training set then the function have less approximation to lead a large estimation error. The main goal of learning algorithm is minimize the training set or time. Smaller constraint by the number of training data, the error is dominated by the approximation then the optimization error can be reduced the iterative time. Indian Jour al of Applied Resear h Website: www.theglobaljournals.com (ISSN 2249-555X) INTRODUCTION Machine learning system is trained by using a sample set of training data. SVMs estimate a linear decision function; mapping of the data into a higherdimensional feature space may be needed. This mapping is characterized by the choice of a class of functions known as kernels [1]. The foundations of Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been developed by Vapnik [2]. A step in SVM classification involves identification as which are intimately connected to the known classes. This is called feature selection or feature extraction. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a classification and regression prediction tool that uses machine learning theory to maximize predictive accuracy while automatically avoiding over-fit to the data. Support Vector machines can be defined as systems which use hypothesis space of a linear functions in a high dimensional feature space, trained with a learning algorithm from optimization theory that implements a learning bias derived from statistical learning theory. Each instance in the training set contains one target values and several variables. SVM CLASSIFICATION The training set is said to be linearly separable when there exists a linear discriminant function whose sign matches the class of all training examples. When a training set is linearly separable there usually is infinity of separating hyperplane. When the data set is large this optimization problem becomes very challenging, because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets (1, 00,000 data points) [3]. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. Optimal Hyperplane The SVM classification technique and show how it leads to the formulation of a QP programming problem in a number of variables that is equal to the number of data points.

Empirical data has established that literacy leads to changes to the way in which phonological information is processed. Harm & Seidenberg (1999) demonstrated that a connectionist network trained to map between English orthographic and phonological representations display\u2019s more componential phonological processing than a network trained only to stably represent the phonological forms of words. Within this study we use a similar model yet manipulate the transparency of orthographic-to-phonological mappings. We observe that networks trained on a transparent orthography are better at restoring phonetic features and phonemes. However, networks trained on non-transparent orthographies are more likely to restore corrupted phonological segments with legal, coarser linguistic units (e.g. onset, coda). Our study therefore provides an explicit description of how differences in orthographic transparency can lead to varying strains and symptoms of the \u2018literacy virus\u2019. Keywords: Connectionist Modeling, Reading, Literacy, Spoken word recognition. Introduction There is a well-established link between the acquisition of literacy and changes to the manner in which phonological information is processed. Children\u2019s awareness of the phonological structure of words has been shown to improve qualitatively and quantitatively when exposed to literacy training (e.g. Alcock, Ngorosho, Deus, & Jukes, 2010; Hulme et al., 2005). Critically, similar improvements have been recorded in adults who receive literacy training later in life (e.g. Morais, 1979), indicating that changes in phonological processing are consequent upon literacy and not due to extended language exposure or other developmental factors. Literacy training has also been shown to relate to improvements in categorical perception of speech sounds (Serniclaes et al., 2005). Participants who were literate indicated a sharper boundary in judging syllables along a ba-da continuum, compared to illiterates. Further, effects of orthography on speech perception have been reported widely using varying tasks (Taft et al., 2008; Pattamadilok et al., 2009; Peereman et al., 2009), languages (Ventura et al., 2004; Zeigler et al., 2008) and orthographic manipulations (Orthographic Neighborhood: Zeigler et al., 2003; Orthographic Consistency: Zeigler et al., 2004). Many of these previous studies have investigated effects of literacy on phonological processing by manipulating the properties of the phonological form of the word. In addition, recent evidence from studies of language-mediated visual attention has linked literacy to changes in the granularity of online speech processing without requiring explicit operations on the phonological structure of the word (Huettig, Singh & Mishra, 2011; Smith, Monaghan & Huettig, 2013). In eye-tracking behavioral studies, and computational models of the effects, they found that literate, but not illiterate participants, demonstrated phonological cohort effects on visual search of objects with similar names, but equivalent levels of co-activation of visual search of objects with similar meanings. These studies suggest a broader impact of literacy-related changes to phonological processing that extends to language processes that interface with visual systems. Brain imaging data provides further support for changes to phonological processing as a consequence of literacy training, suggesting both an influence of activation in orthographic processing regions when processing speech (Dehaene et al., 2010) and a restructuring of phonological processing regions (Perre et al., 2009, 2011; Pattamadilok et al., 2010). Computational modelling studies offer a means by which mechanisms that drive such effects can be isolated. Harm & Seidenberg (1999) captured explicitly the emergent effects of learning orthographic-to-phonological mappings on phonological representations in a connectionist model of reading. They trained a model that learned to stably represent the phonological forms of a large set of English", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CogSci", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "238136921", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4488760", "205847300", "1359577", "3020446", "10301716", "689874", "143281183", "26145930", "17520587", "16412063", "15089549", "215530911", "37975682", "40345122", "9657835", "21307291", "10410983", "36513832", "7562927", "143184915", "41974577", "7082443", "143766253", "17926630"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9217940"}

This dissociation has been cap- tured in connectionist models of dyslexia in terms of im- pairments to the models\u2019 phonological representations. We report a series of connectionist simulations based on an alternative neuro-anatomically motivated theory that dyslexia is at least partly caused by hemispheric desyn- chronisation. Problems of interhemispheric transfer af- fect the mapping between orthography and phonology be- cause the human fovea is precisely vertically split: a fix- ated word is initially split and the two parts contralaterally projected to the two hemispheres of the brain. Much of lexical processing can be reconstrued as the integration of this information (Shillcock, Ellison & Monaghan, 2000). We demonstrate that the dissociation between the read- ing of irregular words and nonwords can be understood in terms of a failure to integrate the initially split input. Introduction The word pint is pronounced differently from its ortho- graphic neighbours dint, hint, lint, mint, tint. In this sense its pronunciation is irregular. Because of the presence of such words in its lexicon, English is said to have a deep orthography. Irregular pronunciations have been observed to cause processing problems both for normal readers and for certain impaired readers: in the former a low frequency irregular word such as pint may take measurably longer to pronounce than a matched regu- lar word, and in the latter such a word might be er- roneously regularised (pint pronounced to rhyme with mint). For these reasons irregular words have been used in a large number of studies of how readers translate the orthographic representation of a word into its phonolog- ical specification. In this paper we approach the pro- nunciation of irregular words from the perspective of a new model of visual word recognition based on the neuro-anatomical observation of foveal splitting (Shill- cock, Ellison & Monaghan, 2000). We will argue that this model provides a principled motivation for some of the problems associated with irregular pronunciations in both normal and impaired readers. The measurable processing problems that normal adult readers have with low frequency irregular words (pint) do not extend to high frequency irregular words such as have (whose pronunciation cannot be predicted from cave, rave, pave, knave) (Paap & Noel, 1991; Seiden- berg, Waters, Barnes & Tanenhaus, 1984; Taraban & Mc- Clelland, 1987). Perhaps the most productive approach to modelling this interaction between regularity and fre- quency has been that developed by Seidenberg and Mc- Clelland in their (1989) connectionist model of reading and by Plaut and others subsequently (e.g. Plaut & Mc- Clelland, 1993; Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg & Pat- terson, 1996; Harm & Seidenberg, 1999). Seidenberg and McClelland\u2019s original model was a simple feedfor- ward model; later models have contained recurrent con- nections and more structured input and output layers. In general, in these models the apparently rule-based be- haviour that generates regular pronunciations is recast in statistical terms, so that a low frequency irregular pro- nunciation (pint) is militated against by the more fre- quently occurring regular pronunciation of the relevant vowel in similar contexts. Thus, when the irregular pro- nunciation is itself high frequency (have), that particular mapping between orthography and phonology is suffi- ciently emphasised to co-exist with the regular mapping. The superpositional storage that characterises these mod- els means that a minority mapping such as that required by pint is disproportionately demanding in terms of com- putational resources compared with the efficient general- isation represented by a regular pronunciation. This fact is also demonstrated in Plaut and McClelland\u2019s (1993) model in which attractors behave componentially when the input and output representations of words are split into onset, nucleus and coda. In their model, pronunci- ation of the vowel in pint involves the connections from all three input slots (onset, nucleus and coda), whereas the regular, default pronunciation of the i involves only the nucleus. Irregular words pose particular problems for surface dyslexics, who are liable to produce regularisation er- rors (Patterson, Coltheart & Marshall, 1985; Manis et al., 1996). In connectionist models, the learning and re- tention of irregular pronunciations are generally vulner- able. For instance, Seidenberg and McClelland showed that restricting the number of hidden units impairs learn- ing low frequency irregular words, and Harm and Sei- denberg (1999) produced a similar effect by lowering the learning rate overall. Plaut et al. (1996) and others ex- plore the idea that a division of labour occurs between the direct orthography-phonology mapping and the same", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2623172615", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["145760134", "144173152", "10301716", "43741056", "143907894", "5923001", "557347", "143537260", "30165868", "145565964", "22218635", "15757187", "144705169"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56013595"}

The large forests dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) that cover the lowland regions in northeast Germany have already been affected regularly by cyclic mass propagations of lepidopteran species in the past with climate projections implying an even more advantageous environment for devastating outbreaks in the future. To improve predictive and responsive capacities we have investigated a wide range of ecological parameters to identify those most strongly related to past outbreak waves of three central species. In total, we analyzed 3,748 variables covering stand and neighborhood properties, site quality, and climatic conditions for an area of roughly 750,000 ha of pine forests in the period 2002-2016. To reflect sensitivity against varying climate, we computed \"floating windows\" in relation to critical phenological phases of the respective insects. The parameters with the highest explanatory power resulted from the variable importance measures of the Random Forest (RF) methodology and have been evaluated by a 10-fold cross-validation process. Our findings closely reflect the known specific gradation patterns and show that relative variable importance varies with species. While Lymantria monacha L. feeding was mainly dependent on the surroundings of the respective stand, Diprion pini L. proved to be almost exclusively susceptible to climatic effects in its population dynamics. Dendrolimus pini L. exhibited a mixed pattern of variable importance involving both climatic and forest structure parameters. In many cases the obtained statistical results support well-known ecological cause-effect relations and long-term population change dynamics. The RF delivered very high levels of sensitivity and specificity in the developed classifications and proved to be an excellent tool to handle the large amounts of data utilized for this study.

With the gadget, tourist can find information about the destination, or supporting information like transportation, hotel, weather and exchange rate. They need prediction of traveling and visiting time, to arrange their journey. If traveling time has predicted accurately by Google Map using the location feature, visiting time has another issue. Until today, Google detects the user's position based on crowdsourcing data from customer visits to a specific location over the last several weeks. It cannot be denied that this method will give a valid information for the tourists. However, because it needs a lot of data, there are many destinations that have no information about visiting time. From the case study that we used, there are 626 destinations in East Java, Indonesia, and from that amount only 224 destinations or 35.78% has the visiting time. To complete the information and help tourists, this research developed the prediction model for visiting time. For the first data is tested statistically to make sure the model development was using the right method. Multiple linear regression become the common model, because there are six factors that influenced the visiting time, i.e. access, government, rating, number of reviews, number of pictures, and other information. Those factors become the independent variables to predict dependent variable or visiting time. From normality test as the linear regression requirement, the significant value was less than p that means the data cannot pass the statistic test, even though we transformed the data based on the skewness. Because of three of them are ordinal data and the others are interval data, we tried to exclude and include the ordinal by transform it to interval. We also used the Ordinal Logistic Regression by transform the interval data in dependent variable into ordinal data using Expectation Maximization, one of clustering algorithm in machine learning, but the model still did not fit even though we used 5 functions. Then we used the classification algorithm in machine learning by using 5 top algorithm which are Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, and Multi-Layer Perceptron.

We divided each single trial dataset into thirty segments and extracted features (mean, variance, standard deviation, and skewness) from all segments. To reduce the dimension of the feature vector, we applied a feature selection algorithm based on the sparse regression model. These features were classified using a support vector machine with a radial basis function kernel, an extreme learning machine, and two variants of an extreme learning machine with different kernels. Because each single trial consisted of thirty segments, our algorithm decided the label of the single trial by selecting the most frequent output among the outputs of the thirty segments. As a result, we observed that the extreme learning machine and its variants achieved better classification rates than the support vector machine with a radial basis function kernel and linear discrimination analysis.

{"paper_id": "51888068", "title": "Metadiscourse tagging in academic lectures", "authors": [{"first": "Ghada", "middle": [], "last": "Alharbi", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This thesis presents a study into the nature and structure of academic lectures, with a special focus on metadiscourse phenomena. Metadiscourse refers to a set of linguistics expressions that signal specific discourse functions such as the Introduction: \u201cToday we will talk about...\u201d and Emphasising: \u201cThis is an important point\u201d. These functions are important because they are part of lecturers\u2019 strategies in understanding of what happens in a lecture. The knowledge of their presence and identity could serve as initial steps toward downstream applications that will require functional analysis of lecture content such as a browser for lectures archives, summarisation, or an automatic minute-taker for lectures. One challenging aspect for metadiscourse detection and classification is that the set of expressions are semi-fixed, meaning that different phrases can indicate the same function. ::: ::: To that end a four-stage approach is developed to study metadiscourse in academic lectures. Firstly, a corpus of metadiscourse for academic lectures from Physics and Economics courses is built by adapting an existing scheme that describes functional-oriented metadiscourse categories. Second, because producing reference transcripts is a time-consuming task and prone to some errors due to the manual efforts required, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is built specifically to produce transcripts of lectures. Since the reference transcripts lack time-stamp information, an alignment system is applied to the reference to be able to evaluate the ASR system. Then, a model is developed using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify metadiscourse tags using both textual and acoustical features. The results show that n-grams are the most inductive features for the task; however, due to data sparsity the model does not generalise for unseen n-grams. This limits its ability to solve the variation issue in metadiscourse expressions. Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) provide a promising solution as this can capture both the syntactic and semantic similarities between words and thus is able to solve the generalisation issue. However, CBOW ignores the word order completely, something which is very important to be retained when classifying metadiscourse tags. ::: ::: The final stage aims to address the issue of sequence modelling by developing a joint CBOW and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. CNNs can work with continuous features such as word embedding in an elegant and robust fashion by producing a fixed-size feature vector that is able to identify indicative local information for the tagging task. The results show that metadiscourse tagging using CNNs outperforms the SVMs model significantly even on ASR outputs, owing to its ability to predict a sequence of words that is more representative for the task regardless of its position in the sentence. In addition, the inclusion of other features such as part-of-speech (POS) tags and prosodic cues improved the results further. These findings are consistent in both disciplines. ::: ::: The final contribution in this thesis is to investigate the suitability of using metadiscourse tags as discourse features in the lecture structure segmentation model, despite the fact that the task is approached as a classification model and most of the state-of-art models are unsupervised. In general, the obtained results show remarkable improvements over the state-of-the-art models in both disciplines.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2606627367", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["44008270"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51888068"}

It aims at learning a function which estimates the targets for test inputs as precise as possible. Generally, the function value for a test input is estimated by a weighted average of the surrounding training examples. The weights are typically computed by a distance-based kernel function and they strongly depend on the distances between examples. In this paper, we first review the latest developments of sparse metric learning and kernel regression. Then a novel kernel regression method involving sparse metric learning, which is called kernel regression with sparse metric learning (KR$\\_$SML), is proposed. The sparse kernel regression model is established by enforcing a mixed $(2,1)$-norm regularization over the metric matrix. It learns a Mahalanobis distance metric by a gradient descent procedure, which can simultaneously conduct dimensionality reduction and lead to good prediction results. Our work is the first to combine kernel regression with sparse metric learning. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is evaluated on 19 data sets for regression. Furthermore, the new method is also applied to solving practical problems of forecasting short-term traffic flows. In the end, we compare the proposed method with other three related kernel regression methods on all test data sets under two criterions. Experimental results show that the proposed method is much more competitive.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1712.09001", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3233/IFS-2012-0597", "venue": "Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 2013, 24(4): 775-787", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2950581303,1577808708", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["124218927", "120067924", "861459", "29834115", "11938373", "7515610", "47325215", "5103649", "850937", "11131225", "13913904", "10047484", "36638535", "36740249", "6998485", "6617228", "2643381", "17544476", "13498381", "44696989", "2908949", "6674407", "877929", "1529020", "7036341", "33396634", "6471199", "2385031", "5326429", "2877073", "122725444"], "inbound_citations": ["6278079", "116418477", "15771901", "20160639", "8425521", "17486382", "34416072", "3969327", "53082034", "13897901"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14717710"}

We trained a set of mice on a visual change detection task with multiple stages, starting with direct transitions between gratings, adding an intervening gray screen, and subsequently moving to multiple sets of natural images. We observe that, when progressing to new stages, the performance increases very fast. However, when transitioning to a task of higher complexity, the peak performance decreases. This setup facilitates for the first time an experimental platform to study the transfer learning phenomena in mice using visual stimuli. Based on these results and additional neuroscience insight, we propose a cognitive model to explain the quick adaptation observed in mice. It extends a deep Q learning agent with a multi-tiered architecture and the possibility of performing a representation remapping at every level of the hierarchy to prevent the downstream propagation of representation anomalies. This architecture provides the substrate of an adaptation algorithm based on ideas of optimal transport of probability distributions. It matches well key behavioral aspects observed in mice and the experimental constraint that the mice are initially trained using a single task variant before it transitions to the new training phase. The modelling process helped us to gain biological insights: first, the optimal transport mechanism of the representation remapping indicated that a possible reason for the reduced performance when mice move to a new more complex task could be due to limited representation resources which were optimized for the previous task. Second, the multi-tiered architecture was first an engineering constraint and later a biologic insight confirmed by the literature. A final insight came from the computations required to perform the representation remapping.

The financial series are fitted into a family of asymmetric power ARCH (APARCH) models. As the skewness and kurtosis are common characteristics of the financial series, a skew\u2010t distributed innovation is assumed to model the fat tail and asymmetry. Prior research indicates that the QML estimator for the APARCH model is inefficient when the data distribution shows departure from normality, so the current paper utilizes the semi\u2010parametric\u2010based SVM method and shows that it is more efficient than the QML under the skewed Student's\u2010t distributed error. As the SVM is a kernel\u2010based technique, we further investigate its performance by applying separately a Gaussian kernel and a wavelet kernel. The results suggest that the SVM\u2010based method generally performs better than QML for both in\u2010sample and out\u2010of\u2010sample data. The outcomes also highlight the fact that the wavelet kernel outperforms the Gaussian kernel with lower forecasting error, better generation capability and more computation efficiency.

Many real-world graphs such as molecules exhibit structure at varying levels of granularities. To tackle this problem, we propose a new graph kernel called Tree++ in this paper. At the heart of Tree++ is a graph kernel called the path-pattern graph kernel. The path-pattern graph kernel first builds a truncated BFS tree rooted at each vertex and then uses paths from the root to every vertex in the truncated BFS tree as features to represent graphs. The path-pattern graph kernel can only capture graph similarity at fine granularities. In order to capture graph similarity at coarse granularities, we incorporate a new concept called super path into it. The super path contains truncated BFS trees rooted at the vertices in a path. Our evaluation on a variety of real-world graphs demonstrates that Tree++ achieves the best classification accuracy compared with previous graph kernels.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2002.09846", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TKDE.2019.2946149", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2979477452,3009436782", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["145392072", "1550330", "8174592", "961425", "16262476", "10856944", "2448512", "10742222", "10239406", "2782489", "5129873", "11276629", "16069154", "8790929", "846818", "47001915", "12833578", "5943581", "65142907", "14487732", "7218366", "1430801", "3637603", "15486265", "195675942", "3051291", "8914045", "12726277", "38663643", "119981743", "1901669", "1797579", "17557614", "2427807", "197183971", "1081340", "2596211"], "inbound_citations": ["214802399"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208104997"}

We propose the concept of Dynamic Effort Scaling (DES), which refers to dynamic management of the control knobs that are exposed by scalable effort systems. We argue the need for DES by observing that the degree of resilience often varies significantly across applications, across datasets, and even within a dataset. We propose a general conceptual framework for DES by formulating it as a feedback control problem, wherein the scaling mechanisms are regulated with the goal of maintaining output quality within a certain specified limit. We present an implementation of Dynamic Effort Scaling in the context of a scalable-effort processor for Support Vector Machines, and evaluate it under various application scenarios and data sets.

The induction of Decision Trees (i.e. training stage) involves intense memory communication and inherent parallel processing, making an FPGA device a promising platform for accelerating the training process due to high memory bandwidth enabled by the embedded memory blocks in the device. However, peak memory bandwidth is reached when all the channels of the block RAMs on the FPGA are free for concurrent communication, whereas to accommodate large data sets several block RAMs are often combined together making unavailable a number of memory channels. Therefore, efficient use of the embedded memory is critical not only for allowing larger training dataset to be processed on an FPGA but also for making available as many memory channels as possible to the rest of the system. In this work, a data compression scheme is proposed for the training data stored in the embedded memory for improving the memory utilisation of the device, targeting specifically the axis-parallel decision tree classifier. The proposed scheme takes advantage of the nature of the problem of the decision tree induction and improves the memory efficiency of the system without any compromise on the performance of the classifier.

This decomposed series were then used as the input to the SVM model to forecast the palm oil price. This study also utilizes the application of partial correlation-based input variable selection as the preprocessing steps in determining the best input to the model. The performance of the W-SVM model was then compared with the classical SVM model and also artificial neural network (ANN) model. The empirical result shows that the addition of wavelet technique in W-SVM model enhances the forecasting performance of classical SVM and performs better than ANN.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.11113/mjfas.v15n3.1149", "venue": null, "journal": "Malaysian Journal of Fundamental and Applied Sciences", "mag_id": "2954139581", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198339529"}

Traditional metric learning methods usually calculate the pairwise distance with fixed distance functions (\\emph{e.g.,}\\ Euclidean distance) in the projected feature spaces. However, they fail to learn the underlying geometries of the sample space, and thus cannot exactly predict the intrinsic distances between data points. To address this issue, we first reveal that the traditional linear distance metric is equivalent to the cumulative arc length between the data pair's nearest points on the learned straight measurer lines. After that, by extending such straight lines to general curved forms, we propose a Curvilinear Distance Metric Learning (CDML) method, which adaptively learns the nonlinear geometries of the training data. By virtue of Weierstrass theorem, the proposed CDML is equivalently parameterized with a 3-order tensor, and the optimization algorithm is designed to learn the tensor parameter.

In many real-world applications however, models may have to sacrifice predictive power in favour of human-interpretability. When this is the case, feature engineering becomes a crucial task, which requires significant and time-consuming human effort. Whilst some features are inherently static, representing properties that cannot be influenced (e.g., the age of an individual), others capture characteristics that could be adjusted (e.g., the daily amount of carbohydrates taken). Nonetheless, once a model is learned from the data, each prediction it makes on new instances is irreversible - assuming every instance to be a static point located in the chosen feature space. There are many circumstances however where it is important to understand (i) why a model outputs a certain prediction on a given instance, (ii) which adjustable features of that instance should be modified, and finally (iii) how to alter such a prediction when the mutated instance is input back to the model. In this paper, we present a technique that exploits the internals of a tree-based ensemble classifier to offer recommendations for transforming true negative instances into positively predicted ones. We demonstrate the validity of our approach using an online advertising application. First, we design a Random Forest classifier that effectively separates between two types of ads: low (negative) and high (positive) quality ads (instances). Then, we introduce an algorithm that provides recommendations that aim to transform a low quality ad (negative instance) into a high quality one (positive instance).

The goal of this paper is to disentangle the contribution of the optimization procedure and the network parametrization to the success of GANs. To this end we introduce and study Generative Latent Optimization (GLO), a framework to train a generator without the need to learn a discriminator, thus avoiding challenging adversarial optimization problems.

This study introduces new ensemble margin criteria to evaluate the performance of Random Forests (RF) in the context of large area land cover classification and examines the effect of different training data characteristics (imbalance and mislabelling) on classification accuracy and uncertainty. The study presents a new margin weighted confusion matrix, which used in combination with the traditional confusion matrix, provides confidence estimates associated with correctly and misclassified instances in the RF classification model. Landsat TM satellite imagery, topographic and climate ancillary data are used to build binary (forest/non-forest) and multiclass (forest canopy cover classes) classification models, trained using sample aerial photograph maps, across Victoria, Australia. Experiments were undertaken to reveal insights into the behaviour of RF over large and complex data, in which training data are not evenly distributed among classes (imbalance) and contain systematically mislabelled instances. Results of experiments reveal that while the error rate of the RF classifier is relatively insensitive to mislabelled training data (in the multiclass experiment, overall 78.3% Kappa with no mislabelled instances to 70.1% with 25% mislabelling in each class), the level of associated confidence falls at a faster rate than overall accuracy with increasing amounts of mislabelled training data. In general, balanced training data resulted in the lowest overall error rates for classification experiments (82.3% and 78.3% for the binary and multiclass experiments respectively). However, results of the study demonstrate that imbalance can be introduced to improve error rates of more difficult classes, without adversely affecting overall classification accuracy.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2015.03.014", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "1998979050", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["5010713", "52298570", "114555833", "199589728", "199589728", "4875462", "33341095", "214249040", "15102426", "201666785", "44070104", "32536", "64346845", "49574740", "3485851", "195970989", "49669281", "204270595", "56241800", "33264541", "52927183", "86672594", "207829447", "208038692", "126415389", "3804135", "26309611", "3113573", "51965386"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:121049522"}

Prior art in the field has largely considered supervised or reinforcement learning tasks, and often assumes full knowledge of task labels and boundaries.

The focus is on learning representations without any knowledge about task identity, and we explore scenarios when there are abrupt changes between tasks, smooth transitions from one task to another, or even when the data is shuffled.

Selecting an appropriate method to evaluate susceptibility to geological disasters is an important part of geological disaster research. The aims of this study are to explore the accuracy and reliability of multi-regression methods for geological disaster susceptibility evaluation, including Logistic Regression (LR), Spatial Autoregression (SAR), Geographical Weighted Regression (GWR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), all of which have been widely discussed in the literature. In this study, we selected Yunnan Province of China as the research site and collected data on typical geological disaster events and the associated hazards that occurred within the study area to construct a corresponding index system for geological disaster assessment. Four methods were used to model and evaluate geological disaster susceptibility. The predictive capabilities of the methods were verified using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the success rate curve. Lastly, spatial accuracy validation was introduced to improve the results of the evaluation, which was demonstrated by the spatial receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and the spatial success rate (SSR) curve. The results suggest that: 1) these methods are all valid with respect to the SROC and SSR curves, and the spatial accuracy validation method improved their modelling results and accuracy, such that the area under the curve (AUC) values of the ROC curves increased by about 3%\u201313% and the AUC of the success rate curve values increased by 15%\u201320%; 2) the evaluation accuracies of LR, SAR, GWR, and SVR were 0.8325, 0.8393, 0.8370 and 0.8539, which proved the four statistical regression methods all have good evaluation capability for geological disaster susceptibility evaluation and the evaluation results of SVR are more reasonable than others; 3) according to the evaluation results of SVR, the central-southern Yunnan Province are the highest susceptibility areas and the lowest susceptibility is mainly located in the central and northern parts of the study area.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11442-017-1386-4", "venue": "Journal of Geographical Sciences", "journal": "Journal of Geographical Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2570219563", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["127198621", "128538823", "128711444", "129490838", "128979104", "128408175", "107832057", "53634732", "152839764", "129645623", "140695233", "129524579", "56429425", "131478535", "129264265", "84803334", "156720398", "140564727", "129311092", "128825250", "129425176", "129625613", "26071515", "129763538", "16145536", "129208910", "62796914", "127680998", "128756567", "130712631", "130140174", "129259655", "129831389", "128485601", "205085055", "10358895", "129300393", "62238669", "133156370", "130938454", "128645072", "129116486", "130754264", "129314224", "129426661", "129775057", "129447041", "129153900", "16195956", "84948808", "133418561"], "inbound_citations": ["209340048", "51965424", "134890145", "53436785", "195546071", "212678925"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133268422"}

The prediction performance of the VMD-RKELM is compared with the performance of robust Extreme Learning Machine (RELM), Extreme Learning Machine integrated with EMD (EMD-RELM). Robust Kernel Extreme Learning Machine integrated with EMD (EMD-RKELM) and two benchmark approaches i.e. Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA). The trend prediction results are compared with Naive\u2013Bayes classifier, ANN (artificial neural network), and SVM (support vector machine).

Three hundred fifteen potatoes were bought in farmers market as research object, and semi-transmission hyperspectral image acquisition system was constructed to acquire the hyperspectral images of normal external defects (bud and green rind) and internal defect (hollow heart) potatoes. In order to conform to the actual production, defect part is randomly put right, side and back to the acquisition probe when the hyperspectral images of external defects potatoes are acquired. The average spectrums (390-1,040 nm) were extracted from the region of interests for spectral preprocessing. Then three kinds of manifold learning algorithm were respectively utilized to reduce the dimension of spectrum data, including supervised locally linear embedding (SLLE), locally linear embedding (LLE) and isometric mapping (ISOMAP), the low-dimensional data gotten by manifold learning algorithms is used as model input, Error Correcting Output Code (ECOC) and LSSVM were combined to develop the multi-target classification model. By comparing and analyzing results of the three models, we concluded that SLLE is the optimal manifold learning dimension reduction algorithm, and the SLLE-LSSVM model is determined to get the best recognition rate for recognizing internal and external defects potatoes. For test set data, the single recognition rate of normal, bud, green rind and hollow heart potato reached 96.83%, 86.96%, 86.96% and 95% respectively, and he hybrid recognition rate was 93.02%.

Tool wear in machining is difficult to predict due to large number of influencing variables and tool-to-tool performance variation.

In this paper, machine learning classification methods for modeling tool life using production shop-floor tool wear data are presented. Tool wear data is simulated using a known \u2018true\u2019 tool life curve as a function of cutting speed. Two machine learning classification methods are evaluated, Support Vector Machines, and logistic, and the results are compared to the true tool life curve.

In order to make the best use of the large variety of statistical and machine learning classification methods, it is necessary to assess their performance differences and make recommendations for classifier selection and improvement. The objective of this paper is to compare different classification techniques for oil-spill detection in RADARSAT-1 imagery. The data of this study consists of 15 fea- tures of 192 oil spills and look-alikes identified by Canadian Ice Service between 2004 and 2008 off Canada's east and west coastal areas. The studied classifiers include the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Net- work (ANN), tree-based ensemble classifiers (bagging, bundling and boosting), Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Penalized Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA). Two performance measures, the specificity at fixed sensitivity (80%) and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), were estimated using cross-validation to evaluate the performance of classifiers at a high sensitivity. Overall, the bundling tech- nique which achieved a median specificity of 90.7%, at sensitivity of 80%, significantly outperformed the second best (i.e. bagging) by 1.5 percentage points, and the worst (i.e. ANN) by 15 percentage points. The median values of AUC measure indicated consistent results. Bundling and bagging achieved comparable median AUC values of about 92%, followed by GAM and PLDA, with ANN yielding the smallest. Most classifiers (SVM, bundling and especially PLDA and ANN) performed significantly better on datasets pre-processed by log-transformation and standardization than on the original dataset.

In this study, we compared the potential of DP, FP, and CP SAR data for wetland classification in a case study located in Newfoundland, Canada.

The MapReduce paradigm has frequently proven to be a simple yet flexible and scalable technique to distribute algorithms across thousands of nodes and petabytes of information. Under these circumstances, classic data mining algorithms have been adapted to this model, in order to run in production environments. Unfortunately, the high latency nature of this architecture has relegated the applicability of these algorithms to batch-processing scenarios. In spite of this shortcoming, the emergence of massively threaded shared-memory multiprocessors, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPU), on the commodity computing market has enabled these algorithms to be executed orders of magnitude faster, while keeping the same MapReduce-based model. In this chapter, we propose the integration of massively threaded shared-memory multiprocessors into MapReduce-based clusters, creating a unified heterogeneous architecture that enables executing Map and Reduce operators on thousands of threads across multiple GPU devices and nodes, while maintaining the built-in reliability of the baseline system. For this purpose, we created a programming model that facilitates the collaboration of multiple CPU cores and multiple GPU devices towards the resolution of a data intensive problem. In order to prove the potential of this hybrid system, we take a popular NP-hard supervised learning algorithm, the Support Vector Machine (SVM), and show that a 36 \u00d7\u2212192\u00d7 speedup can be achieved on large datasets without changing the model or leaving the commodity hardware paradigm.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4614-9242-9_5", "venue": "Large-Scale Data Analytics", "journal": null, "mag_id": "949642480", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31952711"}

This thesis is organized into three main parts: ::: In the first part, we explore multiple formalisms to improve existing machine comprehension systems. We propose a formulation for abductive reasoning in natural language and show its effectiveness, especially in domains with limited training data. Additionally, to help reasoning systems cope with irrelevant or redundant information, we create a supervised approach to learn and detect the essential terms in questions. ::: In the second part, we propose two new challenge datasets. In particular, we create two datasets of natural language questions where (i) the first one requires reasoning over multiple sentences; (ii) the second one requires temporal common sense reasoning. We hope that the two proposed datasets will motivate the field to address more complex problems. ::: In the final part, we present the first formal framework for multi-step reasoning algorithms, in the presence of a few important properties of language use, such as incompleteness, ambiguity, etc. We apply this framework to prove fundamental limitations for reasoning algorithms.

In the second case, the resulting network has lost most of its attractivity because seriality needs to be hard-coded into the structure of the net. We here present a hybrid symbolic connectionist parser, which was designed to fulfill the following goals: (1) parsing of sentences without length restriction, (2) soundness and completeness for any context-free grammar, and (3) learning the applicability of parsing rules with a neural network.

In this paper, we propose two Deep Differentiable Random Forests methods, Deep Label Distribution Learning Forest (DLDLF) and Deep Regression Forest (DRF), for age estimation. Both of them connect split nodes to the top layer of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deal with inhomogeneous data by jointly learning input-dependent data partitions at the split nodes and age distributions at the leaf nodes. This joint learning follows an alternating strategy: (1) Fixing the leaf nodes and optimizing the split nodes and the CNN parameters by Back-propagation; (2) Fixing the split nodes and optimizing the leaf nodes by Variational Bounding. Two Deterministic Annealing processes are introduced into the learning of the split and leaf nodes, respectively, to avoid poor local optima and obtain better estimates of tree parameters free of initial values.

Hardware-based malware detectors take advantage of Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to detect pattern of malicious applications at run-time. These ML classifiers are trained using low-level features such as processor Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) data which are captured at run-time to appropriately represent the application behaviour. Recent studies show the potential of standard ML-based classifiers for detecting malware using analysis of large number of microarchitectural events, more than the very limited number of HPC registers available in today\u2019s microprocessors which varies from 2 to 8. This results in executing the application more than once to collect the required data, which in turn makes the solution less practical for effective run-time malware detection. Our results show a clear trade-off between the performance of standard ML classifiers and the number and diversity of HPCs available in modern microprocessors. This paper proposes a machine learning-based solution to break this trade-off to realize effective run-time detection of malware. We propose ensemble learning techniques to improve the performance of the hardware-based malware detectors despite using a very small number of microarchitectural events that are captured at run-time by existing HPCs, eliminating the need to run an application several times. For this purpose, eight robust machine learning models and two well-known ensemble learning classifiers applied on all studied ML models (sixteen in total) are implemented for malware detection and precisely compared and characterized in terms of detection accuracy, robustness, performance (accuracy \u00d7 robustness), and hardware overheads. The experimental results show that the proposed ensemble learning-based malware detection with just 2 HPCs using ensemble technique outperforms standard classifiers with 8 HPCs by up to 17%. In addition, it can match the robustness and performance of standard ML-based detectors with 16 HPCs while using only 4 HPCs allowing effective run-time detection of malware.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3195970.3196047", "venue": "2018 55th ACM/ESDA/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)", "journal": "2018 55th ACM/ESDA/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2809457377", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16349484", "30315043", "14684437", "195859031", "11434709", "6112571", "16154185", "8951380", "9091141", "3086375", "5634706", "207738357", "4370323", "16409864", "3391314", "25730843"], "inbound_citations": ["203610609", "211212119", "58671891", "53965154", "52160135", "44008442", "59608693", "209452586", "155109931", "102501420", "21690024", "208277600", "210174044", "51877595", "88508458", "51929182", "50768551", "163164538", "215416341", "204732520", "80628108", "53968552", "209695731", "13070825", "208116287", "214604026", "212423048", "53587508", "198986102", "53994989", "208291214", "201131156"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49291657"}

A network that is initially presented only with a semantic representation of sentences uses the inflectional verb ending -t to mark those sentences that are low in transitivity, whereas all other verb endings occur randomly. This behavior matches an early stage in German language acquisition where verb endings encode a similar semantic rather than a grammatical function. When information about the surface structure of the sentences is added to the input data, the network learns to use the correct verb inflections in a process very similar to children''s learning. This second phase is facilitated by the semantic phase, suggesting that there is no shift from semantic to grammatical encoding, but rather an extension of the initial semantic encoding to include grammatical information.

Subjects consisted of 84 chronic brain-damaged patients (31 with anterior cerebral lesions and 53 with posterior lesions). The study's aim was to investigate the effects of frontal lobe damage on two aspects of inductive reasoning, prediction and hypothesis behavior. When prediction was examined by Temporal rule induction test, patients with anterior lesions showed deficits in predicting a rule, even in the memory-aid condition in which memory factors were excluded. The poor results on Temporal rule induction test in frontal patients did not appear to be related to deficits in temporal integration, which is generally interpretedas frontal dysfunction. Rule induction may be impaired by frontal damage whenever complicated information-processing is required, even when temporal succession is not involved. Second, two stages of hypothesis behavior, hypothesis-formationand hypothesis-testing, were evaluated. Patients with anterior lesions showed impairment in hypothesis-formation. Their decreased fluency in hypothesis production affected the hypothesis-testing process. However, frontal patients committed fewer errors, most of which were perseverative (lose-stay errors) on hypothesis-testing. Patients with posterior lesions revealed other characteristic errors, such as inconsistent responses and divergent-type errors (improper lose-shift errors). The hemispheric site of the lesion affected only the ability to maintain a hypothesis (win-shift errors). The results illustrated the differences in problem-solving deficits in these two groups of patients. Disturbed prediction of future events, decreased hypothesis fluency, and abnormal lose-stay behavior in patients with frontal lobe damage may be crucial factors in coping with daily problem-solving situations.", "year": 1992, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "1619853", "doi": "10.2302/kjm.41.87", "venue": "The Keio journal of medicine", "journal": "The Keio journal of medicine", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2335762497", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["40631023", "140965519", "149826823", "4476832", "20074460", "41860650", "143591935", "44943054", "80874359"], "inbound_citations": ["992566", "10998687"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8035576"}

In this paper, novel multi-scale deep learning models, namely ASPP-Unet and ResASPP-Unet are proposed for urban land cover classification based on very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. The proposed ASPP-Unet model consists of a contracting path which extracts the high-level features, and an expansive path, which up-samples the features to create a high-resolution output. The atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) technique is utilized in the bottom layer in order to incorporate multi-scale deep features into a discriminative feature. The ResASPP-Unet model further improves the architecture by replacing each layer with residual unit. The models were trained and tested based on WorldView-2 (WV2) and WorldView-3 (WV3) imageries over the city of Beijing. Model parameters including layer depth and the number of initial feature maps (IFMs) as well as the input image bands were evaluated in terms of their impact on the model performances. It is shown that the ResASPP-Unet model with 11 layers and 64 IFMs based on 8-band WV2 imagery produced the highest classification accuracy (87.1% for WV2 imagery and 84.0% for WV3 imagery). The ASPP-Unet model with the same parameter setting produced slightly lower accuracy, with overall accuracy of 85.2% for WV2 imagery and 83.2% for WV3 imagery.

Therefore, researchers have tried to forecast financial time-series using various data mining techniques such as regression, artificial neural networks, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor etc. Recently, support vector machines (SVMs) are popularly applied to this research area because they have advantages that they don't require huge training data and have low possibility of overfitting. However, a user must determine several design factors by heuristics in order to use SVM. For example, the selection of appropriate kernel function and its parameters and proper feature subset selection are major design factors of SVM. Other than these factors, the proper selection of instance subset may also improve the forecasting performance of SVM by eliminating irrelevant and distorting training instances. Nonetheless, there have been few studies that have applied instance selection to SVM, especially in the domain of stock market prediction. Instance selection tries to choose proper instance subsets from original training data. It may be considered as a method of knowledge refinement and it maintains the instance-base. This study proposes the novel instance selection algorithm for SVMs. The proposed technique in this study uses genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize instance selection process with parameter optimization simultaneously. We call the model as ISVM (SVM with Instance selection) in this study. Experiments on stock market data are implemented using ISVM. In this study, the GA searches for optimal or near-optimal values of kernel parameters and relevant instances for SVMs. This study needs two sets of parameters in chromosomes in GA setting : The codes for kernel parameters and for instance selection. For the controlling parameters of the GA search, the population size is set at 50 organisms and the value of the crossover rate is set at 0.7 while the mutation rate is 0.1. As the stopping condition, 50 generations are permitted. The application data used in this study consists of technical indicators and the direction of change in the daily Korea stock price index (KOSPI). The total number of samples is 2218 trading days. We separate the whole data into three subsets as training, test, hold-out data set. The number of data in each subset is 1056, 581, 581 respectively. This study compares ISVM to several comparative models including logistic regression (logit), backpropagation neural networks (ANN), nearest neighbor (1-NN), conventional SVM (SVM) and SVM with the optimized parameters (PSVM). In especial, PSVM uses optimized kernel parameters by the genetic algorithm. The experimental results show that ISVM outperforms 1-NN by 15.32%, ANN by 6.89%, Logit and SVM by 5.34%, and PSVM by 4.82% for the holdout data. For ISVM, only 556 data from 1056 original training data are used to produce the result. In addition, the two-sample test for proportions is used to examine whether ISVM significantly outperforms other comparative models. The results indicate that ISVM outperforms ANN and 1-NN at the 1% statistical significance level. In addition, ISVM performs better than Logit, SVM and PSVM at the 5% statistical significance level.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.13088/jiis.2011.17.4.241", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "852617744", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["56095751", "20420895"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60387645"}

Thus, for each compound a binary annotation \"yes/no\" was applied to DILI and seven endpoints causing different liver pathologies in humans: Cholestasis (CH), Oxidative Stress (OS), Mitochondrial injury (MT), Cirrhosis and Steatosis (CS), Hepatitis (HS), Hepatocellular (HC), and Reactive Metabolite (RM). Different machine-learning methods were used to build classification models linking DILI with molecular structure: Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forests. Three types of models were developed: (i) involving molecular descriptors calculated directly from chemical structure, (ii) involving selected endpoints as \"biological\" descriptors, and (iii) involving both types of descriptors. It has been found that the models based solely on molecular descriptors have much weaker prediction performance than those involving in vivo measured endpoints. Taking into account difficulties in obtaining of in vivo data, at the validation stage we used instead five endpoints (CH, CS, HC, MT and OS) measured in vitro in human hepatocyte cultures.

QPSO-TWSVM avoids using the empirical values to appoint the parameters successfully.

Torsade de pointes (TdP) is one such important adverse effect, which causes cardiac arrhythmia and, in some cases, sudden death, making it crucial for potential drugs to be screened for torsadogenicity. The need to tap the power of computational approaches for the prediction of adverse effects such as TdP is increasingly becoming evident. The availability of screening data including those in organized databases greatly facilitates exploration of newer computational approaches. In this paper, we report the development of a prediction method based on a support machine vector algorithm. The method uses a combination of descriptors, encoding both the type of toxicophore as well as the position of the toxicophore in the drug molecule, thus considering both the pharmacophore and the three-dimensional shape information of the molecule. For delineating toxicophores, a novel pattern-recognition method that utilizes substructures within a molecule has been developed. The results obtained using the hybrid approach have been compared with those available in the literature for the same data set.

To the patient, waiting times feel long and are seemingly unpredictable. Delays for treatment at our centre depend on the durations of preceding patients scheduled in the queue.

Natural images exhibit strong contextual dependencies in the form of spatial interactions among components. For example, neighboring pixels tend to have similar class labels, and different parts of an object are related through geometric constraints. Going beyond these, different regions e.g., sky and water, or objects e.g., monitor and keyboard appear in restricted spatial configurations. Modeling these interactions is crucial to achieve good classification accuracy. ::: In this thesis, we present discriminative field models that capture spatial interactions in images in a discriminative framework based on the concept of Conditional Random Fields proposed by Lafferty et al. The discriminative fields offer several advantages over the Markov Random Fields (MRFs) popularly used in computer vision. First, they allow to capture arbitrary dependencies in the observed data by relaxing the restrictive assumption of conditional independence generally made in MRFs for tractability. Second, the interaction in labels in discriminative fields is based on the observed data, instead of being fixed a priori as in MRFs. This is critical to incorporate different types of context in images within a single framework. Finally, the discriminative fields derive their classification power by exploiting probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in MRFs. ::: Since the graphs induced by the discriminative fields may have arbitrary topology, exact maximum likelihood parameter learning may not be feasible. We present an approach which approximates the gradients of the likelihood with simple piecewise constant functions constructed using inference techniques.

In many real applications, it may often be difficult to find a sufficient number of labels on the nodes for the classification process. When typical social networks often have a significant amount of content in the form of text, it is much harder to characterize the nodes in terms of pre-defined properties of interest (or class labels). This is because the nodes in the social network are autonomously created by different entities, who may not label them in a way, which is specific or friendly to particular kinds of applications. The lack of availability of labels on the nodes is analogous to the training data paucity which is often encountered in the classification problem. However, there is often copious availability of text collections, which describe a wide variety of subjects, including the desired properties of interest. Since social network nodes are also often associated with some amount of text content, such collections can be used as a transfer bridge in the learning process.

However, the state explosion problem and the exponentially computational complexity restrict the further applications of LTL model checking. A lot of approaches have been presented to address these problems. And they work well. However, the essential issue has not been resolved due to the limitation of inherent complexity of the problem. As a result, the running time of LTL model checking algorithms will be inacceptable if a LTL formula is too long. To this end, this study tries to seek an acceptable approximate solution for LTL model checking by introducing the Machine Learning (ML) technique. And a method for predicting LTL model checking results is proposed, using the several ML algorithms including Boosted Tree (BT), Random Forest (RF), Decision tree (DT) or Logistic Regression (LR), respectively. First, for a number of Kripke structures and LTL formulas, a data set A containing model checking results is obtained, using one of the existing LTL model checking algorithm. Second, the LTL model checking problem can be induced to a binary classification problem of machine learning. In other words, some records in A form a training set for the given machine learning algorithm, where formulas and kripke structures are the two features, and model checking results are the one label. On the basis of it, a ML model M is obtained to predict the results of LTL model checking. As a result, an approximate LTL model checking technique occurs. The experiments show that the new method has the similar max accuracy with the state of the art algorithm in the classical LTL model checking technique, while the average efficiency of the former method is at most 6.3 million times higher than that of the latter algorithms, if the length of each of LTL formulas equals to 500.

The first Data set consists of 12 variables which are the predictors, including crude oil hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon compositions and some reservoir properties. The other two data sets consist of laboratory viscosity-pressure measurements and laboratory gas/oil ratio-pressure measurements for plotting the viscosity and solution GOR curves respectively.

Our approach is based on a high\u2010throughput Deep Transfer Learning (DTL) method that first predicts MP contacts by learning from non\u2010MPs and then predicts the 3D model of the MP using the predicted contacts as distance restraints. This algorithm is derived from our previous Deep Learning (DL) method originally developed for soluble protein contact prediction, which has been officially ranked No. 1 in CASP12. The DTL framework in our approach overcomes the challenge that there are only a limited number of solved MP structures for training the deep learning model. There are three modules in the PredMP server: (i) The DTL framework followed by the contact\u2010assisted folding protocol has already been implemented in RaptorX\u2010Contact, which serves as the key module for 3D model generation; (ii) The 1D annotation module, implemented in RaptorX\u2010Property, is used to predict the secondary structure and disordered regions; and (iii) the visualization module to display the predicted MPs embedded in the lipid bilayer guided by the predicted transmembrane topology.

The main objective of the present study has been to evaluate the combined use of Hyperion hyperspectral imagery with the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) classifiers for discriminating land-cover classes in a typical Mediterranean setting. Accuracy assessment of the derived thematic maps was based on the analysis of the classification confusion matrix statistics computed for each classification map, using for consistency the same set of validation points.Results indicated a close classification accuracy between the two classifiers, with the SVMs somehow outperforming the ANNs by 3.31% overall accuracy and by 0.038 kappa coefficient. Although both classifiers produced close results, SVMs generally appeared most useful in describing the spatial distribution and the cover density of each land cover category. The higher classification accuracy by SVMs was attributed principally to the ability of this classifier to identify an optimal separating hyperplane for classes' separation which allows a low generalization error, thus producing the best possible classes' separation. On the other, as a key disadvantage of both techniques was identified that both do not operate on a sub-pixel level, which can significantly reduce their accuracy due to possible mixture problems occurred when coarse spatial resolution remote sensing imagery is used.All in all, this study demonstrated that, provided that a Hyperion hyperspectral imagery can be made available at regular time intervals over a given region, when combined with either SVMs or ANNs classifiers, can potentially enable a wider approach in land use/cover mapping.

The standard cross-entropy loss for classification has been largely overlooked in DML. On the surface, the cross-entropy may seem unrelated and irrelevant to metric learning as it does not explicitly involve pairwise distances. However, we provide a theoretical analysis that links the cross-entropy to several well-known and recent pairwise losses. Our connections are drawn from two different perspectives: one based on an explicit optimization insight; the other on discriminative and generative views of the mutual information between the labels and the learned features. First, we explicitly demonstrate that the cross-entropy is an upper bound on a new pairwise loss, which has a structure similar to various pairwise losses: it minimizes intra-class distances while maximizing inter-class distances. As a result, minimizing the cross-entropy can be seen as an approximate bound-optimization (or Majorize-Minimize) algorithm for minimizing this pairwise loss. Second, we show that, more generally, minimizing the cross-entropy is actually equivalent to maximizing the mutual information, to which we connect several well-known pairwise losses. These findings indicate that the cross-entropy represents a proxy for maximizing the mutual information -- as pairwise losses do -- without the need for complex sample-mining and optimization schemes. Furthermore, we show that various standard pairwise losses can be explicitly related to one another via bound relationships. Our experiments over four standard DML benchmarks (CUB200, Cars-196, Stanford Online Product and In-Shop) strongly support our findings. We consistently obtained state-of-the-art results, outperforming many recent and complex DML methods.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.08983", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3012909811", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2261947", "206597351", "52956249", "8616518", "8281592", "6447277", "51876267", "262323", "4570002", "14342571", "206596594", "206593370", "2989237", "17861456", "5417872", "206595144", "22274380", "202786778", "189898159", "206592766", "9851945", "911406", "57723680", "206592484", "206593880", "386159", "16119123", "9683805", "68589", "23083969", "8253094", "118646482", "47325215", "4711865", "52005617", "2643381", "52006925", "104292483", "7849657", "6538459", "199442350", "76668137"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214605748"}

Support Vector Machines for pattern classification (PRoNTo Toolbox-UCL) were applied to verify the usefulness of Granger-causality effective connectivity maps in correctly classifying patients and controls. Nineteen patients and eighteen healthy controls were recruited for the study and were scanned using DTI and resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs fc-MRI). Analysis of covariance with age as a confounding factor was applied to DTI data to identify areas related to disease progression. Granger mapping was used to identify brain areas related to differences of effective connectivity between groups. Maps were then input to feature extraction procedures. Models were specified with second-level masks and, after training, classifiers were validated by a leave- one-subject-out schedule. The main difference area between groups was found in the white matter below BA6, in the right hemisphere. Weight vector maps showed differences in areas related to attentional processing and auditory stimulus integration.

A classification algorithm was developed using a Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model based on Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) or Speeded Up Robust Feature (SURF) features with crop row information in the form of the Out-of-Row Regional Index (ORRI).

Image is segmented by using colour K-means Clustering algorithm. Then segmented image along with Optic Disc (OD) is chosen. Next segmented region, features and texture are extracted.

In this paper, we propose a fine-tuning approach with the pre-trained classification layer. We employ layer-wise fine-tuning to determine which layers should be frozen for optimal performance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that the proposed fine-tuning performs better than traditional fine-tuning. This finding indicates that the pre-trained classification layer holds less category-specific or more global information than believed earlier. Thus, we hypothesize that the presence of this layer is crucial for growing network depth to adapt better to a new task. Our study manifests that careful normalization and scaling are essential for creating harmony between the pre-trained and new layers for target domain adaptation.

While much progress has been made towards scalingup experimental methods for functional assignment to putative genes, most current genomic annotation systems rely on computational solutions for homology modeling via sequence or structural similarity. We present a new method for remote homology detection that relies on combining probabilistic modeling and supervised learning in high-dimensional features spaces. Our system uses a transformation that converts protein domains to fixed-dimension representative feature vectors, where each feature records the sensitivity of each protein domain to a previously learned set of \u2018protein motifs\u2019 or \u2018blocks\u2019. Subsequently, the system utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to learn the boundaries between structural protein classes.

It is not difficult to note from previous discussion that there are major difference between PSO and GSO. The first and the most fundamental one is that the PSO was originally developed from the models of coordinated animal motion. Animal swarm behavior, mainly bird flocking and fish schooling, serves as the metaphor for the design of PSO. The GSO was inspired by general animal searching behavior. A genetic social foraging model, e.g., PS model was employed as the framework to derive GSO. Secondly the producer of GSO is quite similar to the global best particle of PSO, the major difference is the producer performs producing, which is a search strategy that differs from the strategies performed by the scroungers and the dispersed members. While, in PSO each individual performs the same searching strategy. Thirdly, in GSO the producer remembers its head angle when it starts producing. In PSO each individual maintains memory to remember the best place it visited.

It is also known that these systems perform at their best when the sound environment of the training data is similar to that of the context of use (test context). For some applications however, training data from the same type of sound environment is scarce, whereas a considerable amount of data from a different type of environment is available. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for text-independent speaker verification systems that are satisfactorily trained by virtue of a limited amount of application-specific data, supplemented with a sufficient amount of training data from some other context. This architecture is based on the extraction of parameters (i-vectors) from a low-dimensional space (total variability space) proposed by Dehak [1]. Our aim is to extend Dehak\u2019s work to speaker recognition on sparse data, namely microphone speech. The main challenge is to overcome the fact that insufficient application-specific data is available to accurately estimate the total variability covariance matrix. We propose a method based on Joint Factor Analysis (JFA) to estimate microphone eigenchannels (sparse data) with telephone eigenchannels (sufficient data). For classification, we experimented with the following two approaches: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Cosine Distance Scoring (CDS) classifier, based on cosine distances. We present recognition results for the part of female voices in the interview data of the NIST 2008 SRE. The best performance is obtained when our system is fused with the state-of-the-art JFA.

Multimodality pre- and post-gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance images (MRI) were taken before and after treatment for 30 patients. Regional variations in the tumor bed were measured quantitatively. The voxel values from the tumor region were used as features and a fuzzy clustering algorithm was used to segment the tumor into three spatial regions. The regions were given labels of high, intermediate and low based on the average signal intensity of pixels from the post-contrast T1 modality. These spatially distinct regions were viewed as essential meta-features to predict the response of the tumor to therapy based on necrosis (dead tissue in tumor bed) and metastatic disease (spread of tumor to sites other than primary). The best feature was the difference in the number of pixels in the highest intensity regions of tumors before and after treatment. This enabled prediction of patients with metastatic disease and lack of positive treatment response (i.e. less necrosis).

The type identification of power quality transient disturbances is of great significance for analyzing power quality problems and solving power quality problems.

Many kernel distance metric learning (KML) algorithms have been developed in order to capture the nonlinear relationships between visual features and semantics of the images. One fundamental limitation in applying KML to image annotation is that it requires converting image annotations into binary constraints, leading to a significant information loss. In addition, most KML algorithms suffer from high computational cost due to the requirement that the learned matrix has to be positive semi-definitive (PSD). In this paper, we propose a robust kernel metric learning (RKML) algorithm based on the regression technique that is able to directly utilize image annotations. The proposed method is also computationally more efficient because PSD property is automatically ensured by regression. We provide the theoretical guarantee for the proposed algorithm, and verify its efficiency and effectiveness for image annotation by comparing it to state-of-the-art approaches for both distance metric learning and image annotation.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCV.2013.203", "venue": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision", "journal": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2130398002", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8600094", "7036341", "2717049", "43462652", "13292371", "2773057", "7951749", "3829888", "14100730", "10747436", "13417115", "4470709", "15911134", "1845522", "44235727", "10082278", "58530979", "15571753", "13937697", "2489151", "64543020", "6674407", "14307736", "8118901", "14053941", "47325215", "861459", "5667114", "9658546", "8271312", "850937"], "inbound_citations": ["17912825", "6905440", "1195240", "14811744", "20578663", "204969091", "14424813", "5386670", "2927187", "18290774", "6445333", "8890823", "3398717", "35616105", "28383416", "207985236", "204777814", "125570093", "52044673", "25071405", "28783804", "4657643", "4657643", "15252304", "2744581", "8267731", "31041384", "17074003", "7570553", "3466201", "196591462", "9344331", "5376684", "67434178", "12276493", "86396620"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2829728"}

Re-ranking of the search results according to the user's interest based on his relevance feedback, has received wide attention in information retrieval. Also, recent work in collaborative filtering and information retrieval has shown that sharing of search experiences among users having similar interests, typically called a community, reduces the effort put in by any given user in retrieving the exact information of interest. In this paper, we propose a collaborative filtering based re-ranking strategy for the search processes in a digital library system. Our approach is to learn a user profile representing user's interests using Machine Learning techniques and to re-rank the search results based on collaborative filtering techniques.

Therefore, video text can be used as a valuable source for automated video indexing in digital video libraries. In this paper, we propose a workflow for video text detection and recognition. In the text detection stage, we have developed a fast localization-verification scheme, in which an edge-based multi-scale text detector first identifies potential text candidates with high recall rate. Then, detected candidate text lines are refined by using an image entropy-based filter.

In an attempt to uncover the physic-chemical attributes which govern HA subtyping, we performed a large scale functional analysis of over 7000 sequences of 16 different HA subtypes. Large number (896) of physic-chemical protein characteristics were calculated for each HA sequence. Then, 10 different attribute weighting algorithms were used to find the key characteristics distinguishing HA subtypes. Furthermore, to discover machine leaning models which can predict HA subtypes, various Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Neural Network models were trained on calculated protein characteristics dataset as well as 10 trimmed datasets generated by attribute weighting algorithms. The prediction accuracies of the machine learning methods were evaluated by 10-fold cross validation. The results highlighted the frequency of Gln (selected by 80% of attribute weighting algorithms), percentage/frequency of Tyr, percentage of Cys, and frequencies of Try and Glu (selected by 70% of attribute weighting algorithms) as the key features that are associated with HA subtyping. Random Forest tree induction algorithm and RBF kernel function of SVM (scaled by grid search) showed high accuracy of 98% in clustering and predicting HA subtypes based on protein attributes. Decision tree models were successful in monitoring the short mutation/reassortment paths by which influenza virus can gain the key protein structure of another HA subtype and increase its host range in a short period of time with less energy consumption.

A variety of approaches exists for detecting communities in dynamic social networks, among which the label propagation algorithm (LPA) is the well-known approach. This approach has made remarkable performance, but still has several problems. One of the difficulties of this approach is the new nodes added to the social network graph in the current snapshot has a very slight chance of creating new communities. In fact, these nodes fall under the influence of existing communities. This drawback decreases the accuracy of community detection in dynamic social networks. We propose a new method based on label propagation approach and the cascade information diffusion model in order to solve this difficulty. Here, the newly proposed method, Speaker Listener Propagation Algorithm Dynamic (SLPAD), Dominant Label Propagation Algorithm Evolutionary (DLPAE) and Intrinsic Longitudinal Community Detection (ILCD) on real and synthetic networks are implemented. The findings indicate that the modularity and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and also F1 AVG of this proposed method is considerably higher than the earlier available methods in most datasets.

In this paper, in order to solve this challenging problem, we propose a Multi-Branch Ensemble Learning architecture based on the three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (MBEL-3D-CNN). The method combines three key ideas: 1) constructing a 3D-CNN to make the maximum utilization of spatial information of lung nodules in the 3D space; 2) embedding a multi-branch network architecture in the 3D-CNN that is well adapted to the heterogeneity of lung nodules, and; 3) using ensemble learning to effectively improve the generalization performance of the 3D-CNN model. In addition, we use offline hard mining operations to make the network capable of handling those indistinguishable positive and negative samples. The proposed method was tested on the dataset LUNA16 in our experiments.

Many security issues arise with the transition to this computing paradigm including intrusions detection. Intrusion and attack tools have become more sophisticated defeating traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) by large amount of network traffic data and dynamic behaviors. The existing Cloud IDSs suffer form low detection accuracy, high false positive rate and high running time. In this paper we present a distributed Machine Learning based intrusion detection system for Cloud environments. The proposed system is designed to be inserted in the Cloud side by side with the edge network components of the Cloud provider. This allows to intercept incoming network traffic to the edge network routers of the physical layer. A time-based sliding window algorithm is used to preprocess the captured network traffic on each Cloud router and pass it to an anomaly detection module using Naive Bayes classifier. A set of commodity server nodes based on Hadoop and MapReduce are available for each anomaly detection module to use when the network congestion increases. For each time window, the anomaly network traffic data on each router side are synchronized to a central storage server. Next, an ensemble learning classifiers based on the Random Forest is used to perform a final multi-class classification step in order to detect the type of each attack. Various experiment are performed in the Google Cloud Platform in order to assess the proposed system using the CIDDS-001 public dataset. The obtained results are satisfactory when compared to a standard Random Forest classifier.

Data came from Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT). Random Forest (RF) and Neural Network (NN) methods were compared to find predictors of OOP health expenditures for the year 2015 by generating a decision tree. RF outperforms NN and showed classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, value of 0.5352, 0.2925, 0.7855 respectively. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) was 0.5539.

Results indicated that the most important auxiliary variables were rainfall (27.09%), valley depth (26.66%), terrain surface texture (23.42%), air temperature (20.18%), channel network base level (16.61%) and terrain vector roughness (14.47%). Results also showed that Random Forests (RF) performed best in predicting the spatial distribution of SOC (RMSE = 0.35% and R2 = 0.60), compared to the other ML algorithms (i.e. Cubist: CU, k-Nearest Neighbor: kNN, Extreme Gradient Boosting: XGBoost and Support Vector Machines: SVM). Furthermore, results estimated the total SOC stocks (SOCS) for the whole study area (~15,208 Tg) and amounts under different land uses. These were bareland (~6 Tg), orchard (~356 Tg), irrigated farming (~782 Tg), forest (~1773 Tg), grassland (~5991 Tg) and dry farming (~6297 Tg).

To address these challenges, we propose GRaph-based Attention Model (GRAM) that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical information inherent to medical ontologies. Based on the data volume and the ontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its ancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism. We compared predictive performance (i.e. accuracy, data needs, interpretability) of GRAM to various methods including the recurrent neural network (RNN) in two sequential diagnoses prediction tasks and one heart failure prediction task. Compared to the basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10% higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely observed in the training data and 3% improved area under the ROC curve for predicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data. Additionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned by GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology.

This information needs to be complete and accurate so stakeholders of affected products can prevent and react to exploits of the reported vulnerabilities.

The current proposal is carried out by using an artificial intelligence technique, a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN), which is trained by Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm to predict the banks profile morphology or shape profile characteristics of banks after stability. Moreover, the performance of proposed FFNN-ELM model is compared with eight famous previous traditional models and also a designed Non-Linear Regression (NLR). The analyses have been validated using a large number of experimental studies at different flow discharge rates. The results of ELM in comparison with NLR and traditional methods shows that the FFNN-ELM model has the best performance with lower error index values of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) equal to 5.6E-5 and Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE) equal to 0.016, compared to NLR (RMSE = 2.2E-4 and MARE = 0.1225) and the most accurate traditional model which is related to Cao and Knight\u2019s [15] model (RMSE = 0.119 and MARE = 0.1095). Therefore, the FFNN-ELM model proposed in this paper maintains a suitable computational efficiency, as second-degree polynomial, for its performance compared to NLR and previous traditional models in estimating shape profile of stable channels banks. Furthermore, the uncertainty of proposed FFNN-ELM is calculated by Monte-Carlo based simulation method to assess the reliability of model to predict bank profile shape. The uncertainty result shows the less uncertainty of the FFNN-ELM model in shape simulation with the percentage of observed data bracketed by 95 percentage prediction uncertainties (95PPU) equal to 81.35% and d-factor value equal to 1.26 in test stage. Furthermore, the sensitivity of FFNN-ELM model relative to input parameters (flow discharge, Q, and lateral distance from the centreline of the channel, x,) represents that in nearly all discharges, the sensitivity value is negative, indicates that by increasing the value of x parameter, the predicted value for the vertical level of the bank\u2019s by model decreases. Moreover, by increasing the flow discharge, the sensitivity of the FFNN-ELM model to the two effective parameters of Q and x on the estimation of vertical level of the stable channels bank is increased.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2019.107411", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "mag_id": "2996066241", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213213906"}

The new data-driven online learning approach includes not only the adaptation of linear parameters appearing in the rule consequents, but also the incremental learning of premise parameters appearing in the membership functions (fuzzy sets), together with a rule learning strategy in sample mode. A modified version of vector quantization is exploited for rule evolution and an incremental learning of the rules' premise parts. The modifications include an automatic generation of new clusters based on the nature, distribution, and quality of new data and an alternative strategy for selecting the winning cluster (rule) in each incremental learning step. Antecedent and consequent learning are connected in a stable manner, meaning that a convergence toward the optimal parameter set in the least-squares sense can be achieved. An evaluation and a comparison to conventional batch methods based on static and dynamic process models are presented for high-dimensional data recorded at engine test benches and at rolling mills. For the latter, the obtained data-driven fuzzy models are even compared with an analytical physical model.

At the global scale, it mainly distributes in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and other similar alpine environments. However, its spatial patterns and the relations with environmental conditions remain unknown. This study attempts to explore key environmental variables responsible for the occurrence of the special surface soil horizon and based on those factors to predict and map digitally the spatial distribution of ME. By combining a variable selection procedure and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, the variables extracted from Landsat 5 TM mosaic image, ASTER GDEM, and climate data were optimized and their importance was measured. The classification accuracy was compared with that obtained from binary logistic regression algorithm. In addition, a land use/land cover (LULC) map-based modification was conducted to further improve the classification accuracy. Results showed that the variable selection procedure had little effect in improving prediction accuracy. However, the number of used variables markedly reduced from 26 to 6 with a 77% decrease, which could speed up the training of the RF model (about one-third of the computation time could be saved). Analysis of variable importance showed that band 3 of TM and normalized difference vegetation index were the most important environmental variables influencing the occurrence of ME. The final overall accuracy of the ME map was predicted to be 84%. Our results demonstrate that the proposed procedure, which combined the proposed variables (derived from remote sensing, GDEM, and climate data), the variable selection approach, the RF algorithm, and the LULC map-based modification method can identify key environmental variables influencing the occurrence of ME and map the spatial distribution of ME effectively on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geodrs.2017.02.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma Regional", "mag_id": "2587070874", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["45987225"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131832950"}

As a result, they have been widely adopted across a variety of applications, ranging from challenging inverse problems like image completion, to being used as a prior in problems such as anomaly detection and adversarial defense. A recurring theme in many of these applications is the notion of projecting an image observation onto the manifold that is inferred by the generator. In this context, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) has been the most popular approach, which essentially searches for a latent representation with the goal of minimizing discrepancy between a generated image and the given observation. However, PGD is an extremely brittle optimization technique that fails to identify the right projection when the observation is corrupted, even by a small amount. Unfortunately, such corruptions are common in the real world, for example arbitrary images with unknown crops, rotations, missing pixels, or other kinds of distribution shifts requiring a more robust projection technique. In this paper we propose corruption-mimicking, a new strategy that utilizes a surrogate network to approximate the unknown corruption directly at test time, without the need for additional supervision or data augmentation. The proposed projection technique significantly improves the robustness of PGD under a wide variety of corruptions, thereby enabling a more effective use of GANs in real-world applications. More importantly, we show that our approach produces state-of-the-art performance in several GAN-based applications -- anomaly detection, domain adaptation, and adversarial defense, that rely on an accurate projection.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "1912.07748", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11263-020-01310-5", "venue": "International Journal of Computer Vision", "journal": "International Journal of Computer Vision", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2994907479,3009309344", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["5707386", "102350964", "21688963", "36663713", "125672975", "3310672", "44064976", "10450851", "2019311", "9272289", "52889459", "2893830", "3621348", "84591", "6104263", "9440223", "2871880", "1033682", "6706414", "206594692", "7646250", "53293944", "54023121", "46927131", "43038649", "6200260", "6099034", "211022860", "1257772", "8785311", "60282629", "211227", "15763546", "3783306", "459456", "10627900", "3488815", "12387176", "11558223", "2202933", "191074", "11758569", "2930547", "3458858", "4547917", "44093597", "88522390", "3512124", "4357800", "212408756", "702279", "24005817", "3305321", "14924561", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["212725770"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209386905"}

It is well known that some facial obstructions may severely affect the extraction and recognition quality and accuracy of facial features, which in turn disturbs the prediction accuracy of facial recognition model and algorithms. In this paper, we propose a Facial Obstructions Removal Scheme (FORS) based on an Enhanced Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (ECGAN) for face recognition. By training a convolution neural network based facial image classifier, we identify those images that contain facial obstructions. Then the images with facial obstructions are processed by using the facial image converter of FORS and the ECGAN model, which removes facial obstructions seamlessly while preserving the facial features.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for the topic classification task. To retrieve only user entered location name related documents, we apply geographic reference to validate location name, enrich query with alias names and solve place name ambiguity problem. The dataset of 20-newsgroup that is collected from 20 different news sites is used in this project. For SVM classifier construction, we use LibSVM and for the geographic reference application, we employ Gazetteer, WordNet and Named Entity Tagger. The text preprocessing process includes stemming, stop words removal, too short/long or frequent/infrequent words deletion. The TF-IDF weight calculation is applied to convert text into vectors and scripts provided by LibSVM are applied to search optimal parameters for classifier construction. The Gazetteer is used to check whether the user entered text is a valid location name and the WordNet service is applied to collect all possible alias names for a place. Named Entity Tagger is employed to extract only location named entities for document filtering. With the collection of alias names collection and location named entities, we search documents to retrieve only local related documents as expected. After implementing this automatic local newsletter generator, we analyse experimental results in several ways: Effectiveness of text preprocessing, optimal number of features and optimal parameters for classifiers, location name enrichment, and location named entity identification. The best feature number and optimal parameters are chosen by experiments for our final classifier. The experimental results show that our project is able to successfully retrieve local information from numerous documents and our solutions for topic classification and geographic reference are significant and effective.

When the source data distribution is different from the target data, transferring knowledge between these domains may lead to negative transfer. To mitigate this problem, a typical way is to select useful source domain data for transferring. However, limited studies focus on selecting high-quality source data to help neural network based transfer learning. To bridge this gap, we propose a general Minimax Game based model for selective Transfer Learning (MGTL). More specifically, we build a selector, a discriminator and a TL module in the proposed method. The discriminator aims to maximize the differences between selected source data and target data, while the selector acts as an attacker to selected source data that are close to the target to minimize the differences. The TL module trains on the selected data and provides rewards to guide the selector. Those three modules play a minimax game to help select useful source data for transferring. Our method is also shown to speed up the training process of the learning task in the target domain than traditional TL methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to build a minimax game based model for selective transfer learning. To examine the generality of our method, we evaluate it on two different tasks: item recommendation and text retrieval. Extensive experiments over both public and real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competing methods by a large margin.

It is still unclear, however, to what extent syntactic information actually matters for the representation of meaning. LSA (La- tent Semantic Analysis) allows you to derive informa- tion about the meaning without paying attention even to the order of words within a sentence. This is consis- tent with the view that syntax plays a subordinate role for semantic processing of text. But LSA does not per- form as well as humans do in discriminating meanings. Can syntax be the missing link that will help LSA? This paper seeks to address that question. Introduction In the beginning, there was syntax. And it was good. But it did not give us what we really want to know about a text \u2014 what it means. Then there was latent seman- tic analysis (Deerwester, Dumais, Furnas, Landauer, & Harshman, 1990, LSA), which provided a means of com- paring the \u201csemantic\u201d similarity between a source and target text, and thereby giving some idea of meaning of the source. That was good too, almost as good as hu- mans in a simple task, but not quite. Because LSA pays no attention to syntax at all \u2014 not even word order \u2014 one promising approach to improving LSA is by giving it some of the information that is provided by syntax. Knowledge about the syntactic structure of a sentence provides information about the relationships between the words: which words modify which other words, and the relationships between verbs and their arguments or the- matic roles. The research presented here is an attempt to evaluate the bene\ufb01ts of providing LSA with thematic role information which comes from syntactic knowledge. Previous work The primary goal of the AutoTutor project (Graesser, Franklin, Wiemer-Hastings, & the Tutoring Research Group, 1998; Wiemer-Hastings, Wiemer-Hastings, & Graesser, 1999) is to model human tutorial dialogue. It is based on studies of the discourse patterns of hu- man tutors during tutoring sessions (Person, Graesser, Magliano, & Kreuz, 1994). These analyses have shown that human tutors do not have complete understanding of their students\u2019 answers to questions, but the do get an approximation. For AutoTutor, LSA provides such approximate understanding of student inputs by com- paring them to expected answers, and using the LSA cosines as a metric of the extent to which the student entered what was expected. We evaluated this approach by randomly selecting a set of 8 student answers to each of 24 questions in our do- main of computer literacy (Wiemer-Hastings, Graesser, Harter, & the Tutoring Research Group, 1998). We asked human raters to evaluate these answers by pro- viding an aggregate measure of the percentage of stu- dent answer propositions that \u201cmatch\u201d some expected answer proposition. Proposition was de\ufb01ned loosely as an atomic sentence. Match was left to the human raters to de\ufb01ne. Then we performed the same analysis with LSA, modeling the match function by adjusting the co- sine threshold. The best performance was realized with a 200-dimensional space with a cosine threshold of 0.5. This provided a correlation of r = 0.49 with the average rating of the human judges. Because the distribution of ratings was skewed, we also calculated Cronbach\u2019s al- pha. The average alpha score between human raters was \u03b1 = 0.76. The alpha score between LSA and the aver- age human rating was \u03b1 = 0.60. These results were very encouraging. LSA provided much of the discrimination shown by human raters, enough to use in the AutoTutor system. It could however, be improved. The obvious information source that LSA ignores is syntax. It is a \u201cbag-of-words\u201d approach, simply adding together term vectors to make a vector for a text. This paper is an attempt to identify whether the addition of syntactic knowledge can strengthen LSA judgments. Related work Partially as a result of the Behaviorist movement in psy- chology, linguistics and natural language processing fo- cused for a long time primarily on the syntactic structure of sentences (Chomsky, 1981, for example). In the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s, Schank sought to change this by claiming that semantics alone was su\ufb03cient (Schank & Riesbeck, 1981, for example). More recently, researchers from psychol- ogy have championed LSA as both a technique for de- termining the meaning of texts and as a model of human language. Much of the recent interest (and controversy) regard- ing LSA can be traced to Landauer, Kintsch, and col- leagues. They imported LSA from the realm of infor- mation retrieval and hailed it as part or parcel of a psy-", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE COGNITIVE SCIENCE SOCIETY", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "156841640", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1127776", "145000945", "62167489", "54137891", "56540352", "141303362", "61894598", "9030129", "61138693", "1144461", "30529950", "144027334", "1935697", "67721423", "14577201", "1362090", "11013156"], "inbound_citations": ["764162", "60450851", "35052244", "4297423", "49541882", "1668200", "645645", "18624204", "24505795", "5394113", "31984791", "36513975", "8937986", "12007882", "8985868", "861291", "18195900", "17463660", "8944572", "16281035", "20673110", "11537936", "7819391", "9130746", "3348905", "59793139", "1235293", "206556", "29306222", "184481374", "7285034"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8936373"}

In order to compile a national soil type map with harmonized legend as well as with spatially relatively homogeneous predictive power and accuracy, the authors unified their resources. Soil profile data originating from the two sources (agriculture and forestry) were cleaned up and harmonized according to a common soil type classification. Various methods were tested for the compilation of the target map: segmentation of a synthesized image consisting of the predictor variables, multi stage classification by Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forests and Artificial Neural Networks. Evaluation of the results showed that the object based, multi-level mapping approach performs significantly better than the simple classification techniques.

But its potential is often severely compromised at the early stage of a software project when we face a shortage of high-quality training data and have to rely on overly generic hand-crafted features. This paper addresses this cold-start problem of machine learning, by learning rich features that generalize across similar projects. To reach an optimal balance between feature-richness and generalizability, we devise a data-driven method including the following innovative ideas. First, the code semantics are revealed through serialized abstract syntax trees (ASTs), with tokens encoded by Continuous Bag-of-Words neural embeddings. Next, the serialized ASTs are fed to a sequential deep learning classifier (Bi-LSTM) to obtain a representation indicative of software vulnerability. Finally, the neural representation obtained from existing software projects is then transferred to the new project to enable early vulnerability detection even with a small set of training labels.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a Machine Learning technique capable of extracting data representation. This paper presents a CNN framework to tackle assets predictive maintenance problem and a method to transform 1-dimensional (1-D) data into an image-like representation (2-D). A data transformation step is very important to make the use of CNN feasible. To evaluate the proposed framework two datasets were obtained from fans, with distinct electrical pattern, from a building at Western University. The data was preprocessed, transformed in a image-like representation and fed to a tuned classifier. The results presented by the CNN-PdM framework showed that the combination of CNN with the proposed data transformation method outperformed traditional machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Multi-Layer Perceptron).

One of the main reasons for this success is the efficiency on large data sets which is a result of the fact that kernel methods like support vector machines (SVM) are based on a convex optimization problem. Solving a new learning problem can now often be reduced to the choice of an appropriate kernel function and kernel parameters. However, it can be shown that even the most powerful kernel methods can still fail on quite simple data sets in cases where the inherent feature space induced by the used kernel function is not sufficient. In these cases, an explicit feature space transformation or detection of latent variables proved to be more successful. Since such an explicit feature construction is often not feasible for large data sets, the ultimate goal for efficient kernel learning would be the adaptive creation of new and appropriate kernel functions. It can, however, not be guaranteed that such a kernel function still leads to a convex optimization problem for Support Vector Machines. Therefore, we have to enhance the optimization core of the learning method itself before we can use it with arbitrary, i.e., non-positive semidefinite, kernel functions. This article motivates the usage of appropriate feature spaces and discusses the possible consequences leading to non-convex optimization problems. We will show that these new non-convex optimization SVM are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on eight real-world benchmark data sets in terms of the generalization performance. They always outperform traditional approaches in terms of the original optimization problem. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite or indefinite kernel functions.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11634-008-0033-4", "venue": null, "journal": "Advances in Data Analysis and Classification", "mag_id": "1993371222", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16643544", "36008312", "8461540", "18774447"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31824108"}

The samples with larger and smaller class proportion are referred to as the majority and the minority class respectively. Traditional extreme learning machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) provides equal importance to all the samples leading to results biased towards the majority class. Many variants of ELM-like Weighted ELM (WELM), Boosting WELM (BWELM) etc. are designed to solve the class imbalance problem effectively. This work develops a novel UnderBagging based kernelized ELM (UBKELM) to address the class imbalance problem more effectively. In this paper, an UnderBagging ensemble is proposed which employs kernelized ELM as the component classifier. UnderBagging ensemble incorporates the strength of random undersampling and the bagging. This work creates several balanced training subsets by random undersampling of the majority class samples. The number of training subsets depending on the degree of the class imbalance.

The computational cost of UBKELM is significantly lower than BWELM, BalanceCascade, EasyEnsemble, hybrid artificial bee colony WELM.

The feasibility of such models integration was tested in the Aist catchment (630 km2) in Austria. The potential FPM habitat and the sand accumulation risk for the whole catchment were predicted with good accuracy. Results show that while the potentially suitable habitats for adults FPM cover 34% of the river network, only few habitat patches can maximize the dispersal potential (4% of the river network) and even less are showing limited impact of accumulations (3.5% of river network).

Particularly, present evolutionary optimization approaches generally start their search from scratch or the ground-zero state of knowledge, independent of how similar the given new problem of interest is to those optimized previously. There has thus been the apparent lack of automated knowledge transfers and reuse across problems. Taking this cue, this paper presents a Memetic Computational Paradigm based on Evolutionary Optimization\\(+\\)Transfer Learning for search, one that models how human solves problems, and embarks on a study towards intelligent evolutionary optimization of problems through the transfers of structured knowledge in the form of memes as building blocks learned from previous problem-solving experiences, to enhance future evolutionary searches. The proposed approach is composed of four culture-inspired operators, namely, Learning, Selection, Variation and Imitation. The role of the learning operator is to mine for latent knowledge buried in past experiences of problem-solving. The learning task is modelled as a mapping between past problem instances solved and the respective optimized solution by maximizing their statistical dependence.

In recent years, activity recognition using skeletal-recognition technology has been studied. In these studies, human activity is divided into data for classifying human behavior. Human activity was learned as one-label action data of the whole body. However, the action of the whole body should not be represented by a single label, because it consists of the behaviors of individual parts, such as the arms and legs. Also, human activity includes parallel actions, such as walking while carrying something. This study divides human joints into six groups. Our method produces histograms of the action data and learns it with histograms of each group. It then integrates these histograms collaboratively by labeling the overall operation. We conducted experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. Finally, we made a dataset of actions similar to that of Xia et al.

The features are extracted from HRV signal in time, frequency and nonlinear domains. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimension of the extracted features in order to reduce computational complexity and to reveal the hidden information underlaid in the data.

The proposed method is composed of three main steps: 1) feature extraction; 2) bio-inspired representation learning; and 3) visual attention map generation. First, the high-level semantic feature is extracted from the refined VGG16, while the low-level contrast feature is extracted by the proposed contrast feature extraction block in a deep network. Second, during bio-inspired representation learning, both the extracted low-level contrast and high-level semantic features are combined by the designed densely connected block, which is proposed to concatenate various features scale by scale.

Several distinguished features are obtained from the integration design. First, the method is able to take into account both global and local information of the data set. We introduce a new formula for calculating the conditional probabilities, which can remove the locality distortions from MCML. Second, discrimination information is applied so that a projection matrix is formed which can collapse all data points of the same class closer together, while pushing points of different classes further away.

Also, in terms of frequency there is a considerable dissimilarity between the male and female speech. In some situations, either the frequency of male is almost same as female or the frequency of female is same as male. It is difficult to find out the exact gender in such conditions.

The objective of this work was the comparison of two different classification approaches to detect four different tree species of a highly diverse tropical Atlantic Forest area. In order to achieve the objective, images were acquired with the Rikola hyperspectral camera onboard the UX4 UAV. The study area is in the Western part of Sao Paulo State, a tropical Atlantic Forest area protected by governmental laws, which contains areas already deforested in the past and which are currently in regeneration. The tested approaches were one based only in the pixel values and other one based in regions. After the image acquisition, the images were radiometrically and geometrically processed. In addition, an airborne laser scanning point cloud was used to calculate the canopy height model of the area, which was used to detect the individual tree crowns with the superpixels method. Those superpixels were used to the region-based classification and to feature extraction.

Our main contribution is a novel approach for visual categorization of objects by synchronous hierarchical matching to a prototype, where high level matches between an object and a prototype are gradually discovered through several steps of binding, selection and inhibition. We show that categorization can be achieved without an excessive collection of evidence or learning from examples. Instead, by discovering commonalities between an object and a prototype, categorization can be based on the notion of ``family resemblances'' that does not require an explicit modeling of features to define a category. ::: We combine the successful methods for categorization based on local features with a flexible and general prototype matching framework that balances the prevalent dependence of local methods on patch appearance by a gradual construction of high level features in a hierarchical feature binding process, where the descriptive power of features gradually increases from localized features with little or no structural information to complex composite features that span wider areas, until they encompass the whole object. ::: We start with a low level description, which defines relatively stable local regions of interest (ROI) based on their appearance. Features are then dynamically constructed, or activated, in order to search for possible matches between the view being interpreted and a prototype view of an object. The composite features describe geometrical and photometric properties of a local area that expands, until a high level focused response, with a receptive field that potentially covers the whole object, is constructed. The construction of high level features is not steered by matching to a predefined set of features, but is rather conditioned by a hierarchical matching and inhibition of ad-hoc features. The advantage of such an approach is that we do not have to define a category with respect to a set of learning examples, since objects from the same category can be articulated using many different local geometrical and appearance matches. ::: In order to characterize the appearance variation within local regions, we learn a codebook of ICA filters which impose a maximally sparse response; we intentionally keep the number of filters in the codebook low. In that way, local regions are strongly informed in terms of their structural (orientation, scale) properties, but carry only a basic information on appearance. Clusters of local features that conform to a subset of Gestalt rules are then grouped. This reduces the redundancy and provides a raw description of linear structures and equi-curvature areas. Based on a prototype image, we also learn the structure of the geometric conceptual space. ::: The hierarchical binding is a massively parallel process that does not require global information. Twoplets of features are matched to twoplets of features, where the shape of the receptive field is conditioned to simulate attentive processing. The result is a set of matches of composite features at level the highest level of the hierarchy, where each of the features can be tracked to the constituent features at different levels. The decision whether the object categories match can be done based on the number of high level matches. ::: We evaluate our framework on two domains: the first set of experiments assesses the performance of the hierarchical categorization on segmented images of objects that come from multiple categories, and the task is to find the closest match to a given image. The second set of experiments assesses the performance of hierarchical categorization of objects in occluded images. We use the ETH80 and the Caltech-101 public databases. ::: The results show that our framework achieves a reliable categorization of objects in a canonical view. Besides categorization, it enables a reliable detection of an object as a whole, and of matching the object parts at different resolutions. We argue that the model could be integrated in a cognitive framework, where several other sources of information can be used to establish a stable interpretation of the scene. We also claim that categorization by visual matching to a prototype has biological plausibility, and that our architecture implements some ideas that originate in enactive cognitive science.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1020007573", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60445091"}

These panels were evaluated in terms of the ability to discriminate as a whole and breed-by-breed, as well as linkage disequilibrium within each panel. The obtained results showed that for the 48-SNP panel, the error rate increased mainly for autochthonous breeds, probably as a consequence of their admixed origin lower selection pressure and by ascertaining bias in the construction of the SNP chip. The 96-SNP panels were generally more able to discriminate all breeds.

Despite the existence of several methods and techniques for segmenting images, this task still remains a crucial problem. In our research we have developed a neural network-based fuzzy clustering technique to segment images into regions of specific interest using a quadtree segmentation approach. Since different regions of an image contain varying amount of detail, it is advantageous to segment the regions into blocks of different sizes depending on the content of information present within each block.

Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) identified an important pattern of regularities in such domains, which they called systematicity. Several attempts have been made to show that connectionist networks can generalize in accordance with these regularities, but not to the satisfaction of the critics. To address this challenge, this paper starts by establishing the implications of systematicity for connectionist solutions to the variable binding problem. Based on the work of Hadley (1994a), we argue that the network must generalize information it learns in one variable binding to other variable bindings. We then show that temporal synchrony variable binding (Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1993) inherently generalizes in this way. Thereby we show that temporal synchronyvariable binding is a connectionist architecture that accounts for systematicity.

Nuclear receptors being important regulators of gene expression, constitute 13% of proteins targeted by various drugs. Thus it becomes important to identify the ligand binding pockets on these proteins. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was built to identify nuclear receptor ligand binding pockets. Positive dataset consisted of the ligand binding pockets of known nuclear receptor-ligand complex structures. Negative dataset consisted of ligand binding pockets of proteins other than nuclear receptors and nonligand binding pockets of nuclear receptors. SVM model yielded a 10 fold cross-validation accuracy of 96% using linear kernel. Also, it is helpful to find out the class of nuclear receptor in order to design a \"class-specific\" drug. In case of the multiclass nuclear receptor dataset comprising of nuclear receptors belonging to three different classes, SVM model for classification yielded an average 10-fold cross validation accuracy of 92 % for this dataset. SVM algorithm identifies and classifies nuclear receptor binding pockets with excellent accuracy. Top ranked features indicate the hydrophobic nature of ligand binding pocket of nuclear receptors.

Different cotton foreign matter causes various levels of damage to textile products and decreases the monetary value of cotton. Hyperspectral imaging technique has shown the capability of discriminating the foreign matter, but its large amount of information which is mostly correlated and redundant limits the classification accuracy and processing speed. The goal of this study was to explore a new method of feature selection (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance algorithm) to select optimal wavelengths from the visible to near infrared spectra of the hyperspectral imaging data for cotton foreign matter classification. A spectral dataset containing 480 samples was collected from hyperspectral reflectance images of cotton lint and 15 types of foreign matter. Each sample was represented by a mean spectrum containing 256 wavelengths ranging from 400nm to 1000nm. The dataset was pre-processed by removing the noise, and the number of wavelengths was reduced from 256 to 223 by removing those with a signal to noise ratio lower than 10dB. The optimal wavelengths were selected from the pre-processed dataset by a two-stage approach. The first step was to rank the features using the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance algorithm and to provide only the top ranked features for the following feature selection. In the second step, the sequential backward elimination was applied to the top ranked wavelengths to select the optimal wavelengths for foreign matter classification. The generality of the selected wavelengths was evaluated by comparing the classification performance using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). A total of 12 wavelengths were selected as the optimal feature set for foreign matter classification. Eight wavelengths from the visible range were related to the natural or artificial pigments of foreign matter, and the other four from the near-infrared range were related to the proteins or nutrients in foreign matter. The selected wavelengths achieved average classification rates of 91.25%, 86.67%, and 86.67% for the LDA, SVM, and ANNs, respectively, indicating the generality of the selected features.

Recent years, more and more applications of activity recognition based on sensors are developed for routine behavior monitoring and helping the users form a healthy habit.

In this study, we construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify human activities using the data collected from the three-axis accelerometer integrated in users' smartphones. The daily human activities that are chosen to be recognized include walking, jogging, sitting, standing, upstairs and downstairs. The three-dimensional (3D) raw accelerometer data is directly used as the input for training the CNN without any complex pretreatment. The performance of our CNN-based method for multi human activity recognition showed 91.97% accuracy, which outperformed the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach of 82.27% trained and tested with six kinds of features extracted from the 3D raw accelerometer data.

Such information is commonly obtained through remote sensing image thematic classification and a wide range of classifiers have been suggested for this purpose. The objective of the present study has been to investigate the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifier combined with multispectral Landsat TM image for obtaining burnt area mapping. As a case study a typical Mediterranean landscape in Greece was used, in which occurred one of the most devastating fires during the summer of 2007. Accuracy assessment was based on the classification overall statistical accuracy results and also on comparisons of the derived burnt area estimates versus validated estimates from the Risk-EOS Burnt Scar Mapping service. Results from the implementation of the SVM using diverse kernel functions showed an average overall classification accuracy of 95.87% and a mean kappa coefficient of 0.948, with the burnt area class always clearly separable from all the other classes used in the classification scheme. Total burnt area estimate computed from the SVM was also in close agreement with that from Risk-EOS (mean difference of less than 1%).

Compared with conventional approaches, the proposed method has several advantages. 1) The histogram intersection strategy is adopted into metric learning to deal with the widely used histogram features effectively. 2) By introducing discriminative term and classification error term into metric learning, a more discriminative distance metric and a classifier can be learned together. 3) The objective function is robust to outliers and noises for both features and labels in the training.

A prediction system for the early intervention and prevention of heart diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CDVs) and arrhythmia, is important. This paper introduces the classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeats into normal or abnormal. The approach is based on the combination of swarm optimization algorithms with a modified PannTompkins algorithm (MPTA) and support vector machines (SVMs). The MPTA was implemented to remove ECG noise, followed by the application of the extended features extraction algorithm (EFEA) for ECG feature extraction. Then, elephant herding optimization (EHO) was used to find a subset of ECG features from a larger feature pool that provided better classification performance than that achieved using the whole set. Finally, SVMs were used for classification. The results show that the EHOSVM approach achieved good classification results in terms of five statistical indices: accuracy, 93.31%; sensitivity, 45.49%; precision, 46.45%; F-measure, 45.48%; and specificity, 45.48%.

For example, research by Domingos and Pazzani demonstrated that in a simple Bayesian classifier (SBC) attributes can be dependent and that they can make the application of SBCs in bioinformatics possible (1). Later, the concept of gene expression monitoring was proposed and implemented by T. R. Golub in 1999 (2). This new method offers a new way to classify cancer cells, and it gave rise to a series of researches of how to detect diseases from a gene expression array. Following this study, a new research was proposed using the Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm to identify the DNA array of cells (3). Different cancer cases were classified by comparing the DNA patterns of cells using the NB algorithm. According to the research result, a disease can be reliably diagnosed by the proposed system. Subsequent research from Slonim et al. demonstrated the feasibility of combining the NB algorithm and the DNA array data for multi-class cancer diagnosis (4). Based on these successful results, multidisciplinary researches integrating boinformatics have been prosperiously developed over the last two decades. A bio-inspired structural health monitoring (SHM) system integrating the concepts of both molecular biology and information technology is proposed in this paper. Novel techniques including DNA array expression data, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) classification are used as the core of the SHM system, and the system is implemented on a prototype system. To develop the rapid and reliable system, a scale-down 8-story building at National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) is used as the benchmark structure. The system is designed to operate under two different vibration modes : the ambient vibration mode for daily life and the strong vibration mode for serious external excitation such as earthquakes. To extract the structural characteristic, a two-tier auto-regression-auto-regression with exogenous (AR-ARX) method is applied under ambinet vibration mode while a ARX-only method is used under the strong excitation mode to obtain the coefficients representing the DNA of structures from different damage patterns, and two sets of data including the Multi-Array Expression (MAE) Data and Multi-Set Expression (MSE) Data are generated to supply the array matrixes required by the diagnosis algorithms, which are SVM and NB classifications in this research. The flowchart of the research is shown in Figure 1. To implement the proposed system in practice, a prototype SHM system implemented on the CompactRio system with field-programmable gate array (FPGA), Real-time (RT), and wireless transmission components named WirelessPlug utilizing the General packet radio service (GPRS) protocol is developed as shown in Figure 2. Data collected from the on-site sensor can be rapidly processed by the built-in software shown in Figure 3 with the support of the CompactRio system and transmitted to the monitoring center by the WirelessPlug component while a backup of the vibration record is also saved in the prototype system for verification if required. By using the system, the mass data collected can be processed and compared with the pre-established database by the on-site mobile SHM module every 20 seconds to predict the possible damage condition and location.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2557182782", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115097175"}

However, compared to ? -Support Vector Classification ( ? -SVC) (Scholkopf et?al., 2000), ? -SVR introduces an additional linear term into its objective function. Thus, directly applying the accurate on-line ? -SVC algorithm (AONSVM) to ? -SVR will not generate an effective initial solution. It is the main challenge to design an incremental ? -SVR learning algorithm. To overcome this challenge, we propose a special procedure called initial adjustments in this paper. This procedure adjusts the weights of ? -SVC based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to prepare an initial solution for the incremental learning. Combining the initial adjustments with the two steps of AONSVM produces an exact and effective incremental ? -SVR learning algorithm (INSVR).

We performed feature selection, using Information Gain (IG), Chi-Squared (CHI2) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operation (LASSO), on the set of these relevant miRNAs to rank them by importance.

Typically, CNN is trained by a stochastic gradient descent algorithm using Back-Propagation (BP) but the training process is adversely affected by slow convergence and the need for extensive parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a new CNN architecture and training algorithm based on an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to overcome these drawbacks. The proposed training algorithm is a layer-wise training method for CNN, and uses an alternating strategy of random convolutional filters and semi-supervised filters to combine the advantages of both approaches. On each semi-supervised layer, the CNN efficiently solves a convex optimization problem based on nonlinear random projection. It is faster and requires less human effort than BP-based training. We experimentally validated the proposed method using a well-known character and object recognition benchmark. In our experiment, the performance of our method is comparable to approaches based on deep features and has higher accuracy than other unsupervised feature-learning methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2018.12.080", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2913263636", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["198404651"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:106407173"}

Against existing imaging methods, microwave imaging method has been considered more powerful and effective method by many researchers. In this paper, comprehensive design equations and parameters of rectangular microstrip patch antenna (RMPA) are given for microwave breast cancer detection. The layered breast model with a spherical tumor that was placed into the fibro-glandular layer was created by using CST Microwave Studio Software, and it was embedded in canola oil to decrease the distorted signals between the transmitting and receiving antennas. The RMPA has a wideband performance from 3 to 18 GHz.

Several analytical methods are available to automatically identify minerals, including sulphides, e.g. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Laser Raman Spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). These methods operate at microscopic scales and require samples to be prepared prior to analysis, hence, they can be time consuming to carry out and problematic when scaled to represent mining ore and waste materials (Goodall et al., 2005; Berry et al., 2016).The use of visible and near infrared (VNIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR), and more recently thermal infrared (TIR) scanning systems for mineral identification are well established and offer rapid, cheap and non-destructive methods for characterising rock mineralogy drill core scales (Schodlok et al., 2016). Despite their advantages, VNIR (450-1100 nm), SWIR (1100\u20132500 nm) and TIR (1.1-14.5 \u03bcm) systems are only useful for the identification of minerals that are active in these portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Sulphides, which are economically and environmentally important minerals, typically do not have characteristic absorption features in VNIR, SWIR and TIR wavelengths (Bolin and Moon, 2003; Merrill et al., 2016). Nevertheless, recent research suggests that TIR wavelengths of around 7.6 \u03bcm can be used to identify sulphide minerals (Merrill et al., 2016). Furthermore, iron-sulphides have been identified from hyperspectral drill core images (across VNIR wavelengths) using supervised classification (Bolin and Moon, 2003). This approach exploited ironsulphide mineral colour and albedo to distinguish them from other minerals.In this study, red-green-blue (RGB) images of drill core in combination with hyperspectral data are used as input into a Random Forests supervised classification algorithm in order to discriminate ironsulphides from other minerals.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2943773283", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["137998822", "129978908", "134172960", "133225311"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:155209666"}

In the proposed system, Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) handles the predefined classes using low level features. To improve the accuracy of the retrieval, color and texture features of the image is extracted, which is represented as color co-occurrence matrices. In retrieval, complexity of selecting a query object in single image query is high. To avoid this problem, multi-image query is used to perform the retrieval. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to construct the classifier for pre-defined classes. However, in a large-scale image collection, some image classes may be unseen. These unseen image classes are termed as hidden classes. In order to handle the hidden classes, the unclassified images are clustered, based on color and texture feature using K-means clustering algorithm. The queries associated with the hidden classes cannot be accurately answered using a traditional CBIR system. To handle these hidden classes, a robust CBIR scheme is proposed that incorporates a novel query detection technique, which is used to identify a query as a common query or a novel query. In this work, Majority Vote Rule and Bayes Sum Rule are applied to implement the image query detection technique. For a common query, a relevant predefined image class will be predicted and within the class the relevant images are ranked. For hidden classes, during the retrieval process the features of the query image are extracted, then matched with the centroid of the each cluster. Among these clusters, features extracted from the query image that are nearest to the centroid of the cluster is selected. Then the query image is compared with the nearest images to the centroid of the selected cluster and the more relevant images are ranked.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Innovative Research in Science, Engineering and Technology", "mag_id": "2592874443", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63487950"}

The proposed algorithm simultaneously maximizes the discrimination between classes and also considers the within-class dissimilarities, which avoids some disadvantages of traditional SVM. In addition, the within-class scatter matrix of adaptive KF-SVM is updated trial by trail, which enhances the online adaptation of BCIs. Based on the EEG data recorded from seven subjects, the new approach achieved higher classification accuracies than the standard SVM, KF-SVM and adaptive linear classifier. The proposed scheme achieves the average performance improvement of 5.8%,5.2% and 3.7% respectively compared to other three schemes.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-10-6370-1_4", "venue": "LSMS/ICSEE", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2750452146", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10657930"}

In most of the state-of-the-arts of human emotion recognition, deep learning for emotion classification was used. However, deep learning is mostly effective for deep feature extraction. Therefore, in this research, we applied unsupervised deep belief network (DBN) for depth level feature extraction from fused observations of Electro-Dermal Activity (EDA), Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and Zygomaticus Electromyography (zEMG) sensors signals. Afterwards, the DBN produced features are combined with statistical features of EDA, PPG and zEMG to prepare a feature-fusion vector. The prepared feature vector is then used to classify five basic emotions namely Happy, Relaxed, Disgust, Sad and Neutral. As the emotion classes are not linearly separable from the feature-fusion vector, the Fine Gaussian Support Vector Machine (FGSVM) is used with radial basis function kernel for non-linear classification of human emotions. Our experiments on a public multimodal physiological signal dataset show that the DBN, and FGSVM based model significantly increases the accuracy of emotion recognition rate as compared to the existing state-of-the-art emotion classification techniques.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.inffus.2018.10.009", "venue": "Inf.

A DNA microarray is a high throughput technology used in molecular biology and in medicine. DNA micro arrays can be used to measure changes in expression levels or to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms. One can analyze the expression of many genes in a single reaction quickly and in an efficient manner. The main application of microarray technology is disease diagnosis. Patterned DNA microarrays are promising as a potent and cost-effective tool for large scale analysis of gene expression. Microarrays can be used to measure the relative quantities of specific mRNAs in two or more tissue samples for thousands of genes simultaneously. As the power of this technology has been recognized, many open queries remain about appropriate analysis of microarray data. One such is about the valid estimates of the relative expression for genes that are not biased by ancillary sources of variation. Be acquainted with that there is inherent noise in microarray data will the recognition system estimates the error variation associated with an estimated change in expression and construct the error bars. For the above impenetrability and to get better consequences of the system with accuracy a new learning algorithm called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used. ELM avoids problems like local minima improper learning rate and overfitting commonly faced by iterative learning methods and completes the training very fast. ELM uses the error free ANOVA methods in the preprocessing phase itself. Here it demonstrates that ANOVA methods can be used to normalize microarray data and provide estimates of changes in gene expression that are corrected for potential perplexing effects. The multicategory classification performance of ELM is evaluated on Lymphoma data set.

To address this fact the Rough Fuzzy K-Modes clustering technique has been recently developed in order to handle imperfect information, i.e. indiscernibility (coarseness) and vagueness within the dataset. However, it has been observed that the said technique suffers from the problem of local optima due to the random choice of initial cluster modes. Hence, in this paper, we have proposed an integrated clustering technique using multi-phase learning. In this regard, first, Simulated Annealing based Rough Fuzzy K-Modes and Genetic Algorithm based Rough Fuzzy K-Modes are proposed in order to perform the clustering better by considering clustering as an underlying optimization problem. These clustering methods individually produce clusters having set of central and peripheral points. Thereafter, for each case, final improved clustering results are obtained by assigning peripheral points to a particular crisp cluster using Random Forest, where central points are used as training set. Second, the varying cardinality of the training and testing sets produced by each clustering method further motivated us to propose a generalized technique called Integrated Rough Fuzzy Clustering using Random Forest, where, results of three aforementioned clustering techniques are used to compute the roughness measure. Based on this measure, three different sets namely best central points, semi-best central points and pure peripheral points are determined. Thereafter, using multi-phase learning, best central points are used to classify the semi-best central points and then using both of them, pure peripheral points are classified by Random Forest. Experimental results are reported quantitatively and visually to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in comparison with well-known state-of-the-art methods for six synthetic and five real-life datasets.

Fortunately, the National Mountain Flood Disaster Investigation Project provided a foundation to develop this proposed assessment. In this study, an index system was established from the exposure and disaster reduction capability categories, and is based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods.

Many researchers have conducted several studies using voice recordings to produce an accurate PD diagnosis system. One unique promising way to use the speech disorder as a helping factor to predict PD is by using machine learning techniques.

Epileptic seizures can occur due to transient and unexpected electrical interruptions of brain. EEG (ElectroEncephaloGram) is one of the non-invasive methods for analyzing the human brain dynamics that affords a direct evaluation of cortical behavior. Seizures are featured by short and episodic neuronal synchronous discharges with considerably enlarged amplitude. This uneven synchrony may happen in the brain accordingly i.e., partial seizures visible only in few channels of the EEG signal or generalized seizures, which are seen in every channel of the EEG signal involving the whole brain. Existing analysis of epilepsy depends on difficult visual screening by extremely trained clinicians. Data recordings create very lengthy data, and therefore the inspection and identification of epilepsy takes more time for diagnosis. At present time computerized systems are usually established to make the diagnosis simpler. This paper discusses an implementation of automated epileptic EEG detection system using neural networks. In this paper, a statistical parameter regarded as Sample Entropy (SampEn), is used as a method for feature extraction for performing the task of classifying EEG signals, which are normal, ictal and interictal. Here the value of SampleEn plays a vital role in the diagnosis of Epileptic seizures. It is been observed that the value of SampEn falls suddenly during an Epileptic Seizure, and hence this information delineates the exact occurrence of Epilepsy. Classification strategies are based on models like Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN),Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Hybrid ELM (HELM) is the classification method devised in the current paper and is the first of its kind to be implemented for EEG classification. This classification method uses the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to select the input weights and hidden biases, the ELM algorithm to analytically determine the output weights and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm to learn the network.

Most modern approaches solve this task in three steps: i) compute local features, ii) generate a pool of pose-hypotheses, iii) select and refine a pose from the pool. This work focuses on the second step. While all existing approaches generate the hypotheses pool via local reasoning, e.g. RANSAC or Hough-Voting, we are the first to show that global reasoning is beneficial at this stage.

Resultingly, non-cancerous Hurthle lesions were conventionally distinguished from Hurthle cell cancers by histopathological examination of tissue following surgical resection. Reliance on histopathological evaluation requires patients to undergo surgery to obtain a diagnosis despite most being non-cancerous. It is highly desirable to avoid surgery and to provide accurate classification of benignity versus malignancy from FNAB preoperatively. In our first-generation algorithm, Gene Expression Classifier (GEC), we achieved this goal by using machine learning (ML) on gene expression features. The classifier is sensitive, but not specific due in part to the presence of non-neoplastic benign Hurthle cells in many FNAB. We sought to overcome this low-specificity limitation by expanding the feature set for ML using next-generation whole transcriptome RNA sequencing and called the improved algorithm the Genomic Sequencing Classifier (GSC). The Hurthle identification leverages mitochondrial expression and we developed novel feature extraction mechanisms to measure chromosomal and genomic level loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) for the algorithm. Additionally, we developed a multi-layered system of cascading classifiers to sequentially triage Hurthle cell-containing FNAB, including: 1. presence of Hurthle cells, 2. presence of neoplastic Hurthle cells, and 3. presence of benign Hurthle cells. The final Hurthle cell Index utilizes 1048 nuclear and mitochondrial genes; and Hurthle cell Neoplasm Index leverages LOH features as well as 2041 genes. Both indices are Support Vector Machine (SVM) based. The third classifier, the GSC Benign/Suspicious classifier, utilizes 1115 core genes and is an ensemble classifier incorporating 12 individual models. The accurate algorithmic depiction of this complex biological system among Hurthle subtypes results in a dramatic improvement of classification performance; specificity among Hurthle cell neoplasms increases from 11.8% with the GEC to 58.8% with the GSC, while maintaining the same sensitivity of 89%.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6450053", "pubmed_id": "30952205", "doi": "10.1186/s12918-019-0693-z", "venue": "BMC Systems Biology", "journal": "BMC Systems Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2935513430", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["21823727", "40023881", "40722275", "207505367", "42286877", "32528271", "79746813", "34905363", "8539092", "207534477", "20841124", "207661103", "31588447", "21417045", "24143560", "13172931", "52002220", "52009635", "10298920", "741477", "10149213", "31508860", "6605936", "19661126", "46822889", "44088540", "1481014", "6667079", "54360208", "38257581"], "inbound_citations": ["129943025", "202747996"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:96448895"}

Convolutional neural networks have shown successful results in detecting apnea events using raw respiratory data.

We test reducing the original signals into latent space representations of a range of sizes, that are then used in conjunction with convolutional neural network classifiers.

We demonstrate that apnea and hypopnea events can be accurately detected even when the signals are reduced to a latent space representation 2\u20133% of the original size.

This thesis proposes a novel approach for the early detection of traffic congestion based on low-level image features. The possibility of predicting the evolution of the traffic situation, just based on low-level information from the underlying scene, is studied. The intention of this approach is to overcome the difficulties of existing systems where the computational cost is quite high and moving shadows and occlusion impose problems since vehicle detection is required. First, a couple of traffic-dependent parameters are computed by analyzing low-level image features and their distribution along the road. The relevance of these parameters for describing the current traffic situation is presented. In a second step, these parameters serve as input to a Relevance Vector Machine. The Relevance Vector Machine is used to learn a model for predicting the traffic-dependent parameters in the future from their past observations. Finally, experiments on two test videos show the applicability of the proposed approach for predicting the future traffic situation.

Two reviewers independently screened article titles and abstracts for eligibility. Among information abstracted from each study was number of participants, outcomes of interest (mortality/survival, symptom response, HE and change in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)). Complete response was defined by resolution of HH without further need for thoracentesis, while a partial response was defined as improvement in symptoms and/or a decrease need for thoracentesis. New onset or worsening of baseline HE within 30 days of TIPS was considered a complication of the procedure. Data were pooled using a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Outcomes are expressed as proportions. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 and Cochrane Q test. Results Seven studies, involving 203 patients were included in the analyses. The mean age of the patients was 56.3 years, with 50.7% being male. The majority of patients were Child-Pugh Class C (56.9%), while 40.7% and 0.8% were Child-Pugh Class B and A, respectively. The mean follow up period was 11.9 \u00b1 3.6 months. The mean preand post-TIPS HVPG was 20.14 mmHg (range: 17.4-26) and 7.37 mmHg (range: 5.7-10), respectively. Response to TIPS was complete in 55.8% (95% CI 44.7-66.9) and partial in 17.6% (95% CI 10.9-24.2). There was no response in 21.2% (95% CI 14.2-28.3) of patients. The incidence of post-TIPS HE was 11.7% (95% CI 6.3-17.2). The mortality within 30days of TIPS placement was 16.6% (95% CI 10.222.9), while the overall mortality was 49.1% (95% CI 38.8-59.5). The mean 1-year survival (reported by 2 studies) was 56%. Predictors of mortality included older age, severity of liver disease and non-response to TIPS.

There are intensive studies of word representation learning for question classification. As questions are typically short texts, existing techniques are often not effective for extracting discriminative representations of questions just from a limited number of words. This motivates us to exploit additional information beyond words in order to improve the representation learning of questions. On one hand, topic modeling often captures meaningful semantic structures from the question corpus. Such global topical information should be helpful for question representations. On the other hand, entities extracted from question themselves provide more auxiliary information for short texts from a local viewpoint. Together with words, topics and entities, question representations can be substantially improved.In this paper, we propose a unified neural network framework by integrating Topic modeling, Word embedding and Entity Embedding (TWEE) for question representation learning. Concretely, we introduce a novel topic sparse autoencoder to incorporate discriminative topics into the representation learning of questions.

We firstly sampled the image dataset from Han City, Shaanxi province and Jizhong, Hebei province which are two main mining areas in China. The data of Han City consists of the images of lean coal and shale, and the data of Jizhong is coking coal and sandstone. By analyzing the gray scale and the texture of the sampled data, we discover that coal and gangue vary in the parameters including the mean and peak of gray scale, contrast ratio, and entropy. Therefore, these four parameters are chosen as features. We utilize LS-SVM as the machine learning model, and the model is trained with three groups of parameters separately. The first are the mean and peak of gray scale, the second are the contrast ratio and entropy which represents texture features, and the third are the peak of gray scale and the contrast ratio which integrates gray scale and texture features. After evaluation by using our sampled dataset, the model trained by the third group outperforms others.

The ARF method incorporates the optimization ability of the artificial fish swarm algorithm and the random forest regression function to provide quality control for multiple surface air temperature stations. Surface air temperature observations were recorded at stations in mountainous and plain regions and at neighboring stations to test the performance of the method. Observations from 2005 to 2013 were used as a training set, and observations from 2014 were used as a testing set. The results indicate that the ARF method is able to identify inaccurate observations; and it has a higher rate of detection, lower rate of change for the quality control parameters, and fewer type I errors than traditional methods. Notably, the ARF method yielded low performance indexes in areas with complex terrain, where traditional methods were considerably less effective. In addition, for stations near the ocean without sufficient neighboring stations, different neighboring stations were used to test the different methods. Whereas the traditional methods were affected by station distribution, the ARF method exhibited fewer errors and higher stability.

We explore the consequences of using simulated vegetation structure and composition as well as its associated landscape configuration in models projecting global change effects on Iberian bird species distributions. Both present-day and future distributions were modelled for 168 bird species using two ensemble forecasting methods: Random Forests (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). For each species, several models were created, differing in the predictor variables used (climate, vegetation, and landscape configuration). Discrimination ability of each model in the present-day was then tested with four commonly used evaluation methods (AUC, TSS, specificity and sensitivity). The different sets of predictor variables yielded similar spatial patterns for well-modelled species, but the future projections diverged for poorly-modelled species. Models using all predictor variables were not significantly better than models fitted with climate variables alone for ca. 50% of the cases. Moreover, models fitted with climate data were always better than models fitted with landscape configuration variables, and vegetation variables were found to correlate with bird species distributions in 26\u201340% of the cases with BRT, and in 1\u201318% of the cases with RF.

Connectionist models that operate on continuous weight and activation spaces are not always appropriate for learning such tasks because their learning procedures have a propensity to produce solutions that lack symbolic interpretation. In this thesis, I demonstrate that it is possible to incorporate differentiable symbol manipulation (DSM) techniques in a connectionist system in order to overcome their nonsymbolic nature. The hypothesis underlying this methodology is that a connectionist model can benefit from exploring a subsymbolic solution space even when the final solutions have symbolic interpretations. ::: In this thesis, the idea of DSM has been applied to the domain of Language Induction. Given a finite number of examples (sentences) from a language, the goal of language induction is to induce the target language by identifying structural regularities underlying the examples. The domain of language induction is strictly symbolic, having to do with rule identification and symbol manipulation, and to learn such tasks using subsymbolic connectionist methods has always been a challenge. ::: I explore three connectionist models using DSM. The first model learns to induce finite state machines (regular languages) by inducing discrete representations of the states. It incorporates an adaptive clustering technique in a standard recurrent connectionist architecture that quantizes the state space as an integral part of learning. Simulations show that this architecture leads to a significant improvement in generalization performance over earlier connectionist approaches. In the second model, I describe an architecture that incorporates DSM for learning symbolic rewrite rules in a subclass of context-free grammars. The third model incorporates DSM for learning yet another subclass of context free languages. In contrast to the second model, it learns the dynamics of a push down automaton. Both the second and third models learn to manipulate symbol strings--a feature that distinguishes them from prior research on similar tasks. ::: While DSM has many strengths, I explore several weaknesses in the current models, most importantly scaling issues.

Molecular characterization of different biotypes may improve clinical management of EC. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project has revealed four prognostic EC subgroups: POLE, MSI; Copy Number Low (CNL) and Copy Number High (CNH). The goal of this study was to develop a method to classify tumors in any of the four EC prognostic groups using affordable molecular techniques. Ninety-six Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were sequenced following a NGS TruSeq Custom Amplicon low input (Illumina) protocol interrogating a multi-gene panel. MSI analysis was performed by fragment analysis using eight specific microsatellite markers. A Random Forest classification algorithm (RFA), considering NGS results, was developed to stratify EC patients into different prognostic groups. Our approach correctly classifies the EC patients into the four TCGA prognostic biotypes. The RFA assigned the samples to the CNH and CNL groups with an accuracy of 0.9753 (p < 0.001). The prognostic value of these groups was prospectively reproduced on our series both for Disease-Free Survival (p = 0.004) and Overall Survival (p = 0.030).Hence, with the molecular approach herein described, a precise and suitable tool that mimics the prognostic EC subtypes has been solved and validated.

Support vector machine (SVM) as a powerful tool for data classification has the potentials in spatial data mining. However, traditional SVM involves solving a quadratic optimization problem that requires considerably long computation time for large data sets. In this paper, we propose a new efficient proximal Support Vector Machine (P-SVM) using Peano tree. Peano tree (P-tree) is a vertical compressed bitwise quadrant tree that is processed horizontally through logical operations. P-SVM exploits a unique neighborhood search method, i.e., EIN-ring based neighborhood search to find the boundary sentries. The final boundary hyperplanes of test data are determined by their d-nearest boundary sentries, which are calculated from EIN-ring membership of support vector pairs. Moreover, the outliers in the training data are automatically eliminated according to their EINring membership in the step of finding region components. The candidate support vectors are selected in a way that is robust to noisy and fuzzy boundary. Experiments show that P-SVM is order of magnitude faster than traditional SVM with superior cardinality scalability and comparable accuracy for a large-scale spatial data.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CAINE", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "86135078", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "17784771", "10875129", "116426361"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18282302"}

Change-level defect prediction, which is also referred as just-in-time defect prediction, could not only ensure software quality in the development process, but also make the developers check and fix the defects in time [1]. Objective Ensemble learning becomes a hot topic in recent years. There have been several studies about applying ensemble learning to defect prediction [2\u20135]. Traditional ensemble learning approaches only have one layer, i.e., they use ensemble learning once. There are few studies that leverages ensemble learning twice or more. To bridge this research gap, we try to hybridize various ensemble learning methods to see if it will improve the performance of just-in-time defect prediction. In particular, we focus on one way to do this by hybridizing bagging and stacking together and leave other possibly hybridization strategies for future work. Method In this paper, we propose a two-layer ensemble learning approach TLEL which leverages decision tree and ensemble learning to improve the performance of just-in-time defect prediction. In the inner layer, we combine decision tree and bagging to build a Random Forest model. In the outer layer, we use random under-sampling to train many different Random Forest models and use stacking to ensemble them once more. Results To evaluate the performance of TLEL, we use two metrics, i.e., cost effectiveness and F1-score. We perform experiments on the datasets from six large open source projects, i.e., Bugzilla, Columba, JDT, Platform, Mozilla, and PostgreSQL, containing a total of 137,417 changes. Also, we compare our approach with three baselines, i.e., Deeper, the approach proposed by us [6], DNC, the approach proposed by Wang et al. [2], and MKEL, the approach proposed by Wang et al. [3]. The experimental results show that on average across the six datasets, TLEL could discover over 70% of the bugs by reviewing only 20% of the lines of code, as compared with about 50% for the baselines. In addition, the F1-scores TLEL can achieve are substantially and statistically significantly higher than those of three baselines across the six datasets. Conclusion TLEL can achieve a substantial and statistically significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods, i.e., Deeper, DNC and MKEL. Moreover, TLEL could discover over 70% of the bugs by reviewing only 20% of the lines of code.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.infsof.2017.03.007", "venue": "Inf.

Recent researches travel among classifiers techniques looking for suitable and higher classification accuracy to build strong modules. Adding extra dimensional by focusing on the reflects that data representation might have on the classification accuracy data mining predictive techniques is the ultimate goal of this research. Methods: In this research seven different data representations were performed on several classifier techniques. These representations were AS_IS representation and three from the binary section and three from normalization section. The binary section included simple binary representation, flag representation and thermometer representation while the normalization section included min max normalization, sigmoidal normalization and standard deviation normalization. These seven representations were applied on eight classifiers Neural Network, Logistic Regression, K nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Classification Tree, Naive Bayesian, Rule based and Random Forest Decision Tree. Moreover, two datasets have been used for testing the performance of classification accuracy, namely Wisconsin Breast Cancer and German Credit and these two datasets have Boolean target class. Results: The fourteen data representations were raised from two datasets Wisconsin Breast Cancer and German Credit with seven different data representations for each. These data representations were performed on several classifier techniques using Orange software.

However, like with any extractive techniques in general, these approaches have a limitation when generating a summary of fixed size. In the absence of reliable generative techniques, which can generate new concise sentences the next logical step is to eliminate redundant or less informative content from the extracted sentences. The two possible ways to achieve this is sentence compression and sentence simplification. While sentence compression solely deals with removing redundant information, sentence simplification usually looks into replacing a difficult phrase or word with a simpler alternative. In case of legal documents, usually replacing long legal phrases with more commonly used phrases also leads to sentence compression. This improves the precision of fixed-length summaries. We present a new approach for sentence compression for legal documents where we demonstrate how a phrase-based statistical machine translation system can be modified to generate meaningful sentence compressions. We compare this approach to an LSTM-based sentence compression technique.

In this paper, a novel relevance feedback mechanism, which makes use of the main idea of boosting and the component SVM, is presented and applied to the content-based 3D model retrieval. The experiments, based on the 3D model database Princeton Shape Benchmark, show that the relevance feedback algorithm can improve the retrieval performance of traditional SVM in 3D model retrieval.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "The 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering and Data Mining", "journal": "The 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering and Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1496094809", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["708531", "8166368", "14041836", "37115688", "7731442", "60916414", "6644398", "7138354", "15464063", "61291571", "40769530", "16821651", "17242145", "12384280", "1900499", "7156990"], "inbound_citations": ["17189874"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18445056"}

Computational Intelligence (CI) has been incorporated into various aspects of the smart grids, including fault detection and classification, which is a key issue in all the power systems. This paper presents two novel techniques for fault detection and classification in power Transmission Lines (TL). The proposed approaches are based on One-Class Quarter-Sphere Support Vector Machine (QSSVM). The first technique, Temporal-attribute QSSVM (TA-QSSVM), exploits the temporal and attribute correlations of the data measured in a TL for fault detection during the transient stage. The second technique is based on a novel One-Class SVM formulation, named as Attribute-QSSVM (A-QSSVM), that exploits attribute correlations only for automatic fault classification. The results indicate a detection and classification accuracy as high as 99%. Significant reduction (from O(n4) to O(n2)) in computational complexity is achieved as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques, which use Multi-Class SVM for fault classification.

Due to the nature of network intrusions the datasets available for training machine learning algorithms, i.e. classifiers, is imbalanced, due to some attacks being rare and some being frequent, in practice. For example, the most widely used network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) dataset is the KDD cup 99 dataset which is known to be an imbalanced dataset, meaning that there is a considerable imbalance amongst the number of occurrences of attacks (i.e. instances) in the different dataset classes. Thus, the resulting data complexity (e.g., irrelevant features, class imbalance) influences how effective a learning task would be when this dataset is used to train a machine learning classifier. In a typical machine learning based IDS a minimum of two pre-processing stages is utilized, i.e. data resampling and feature selection, within the system\u2019s data pre-processing pipeline. The impact of data resampling and feature selection, separately on the performance accuracy of classifiers has been investigated in detail in literature. However, the question of whether feature selection should be performed after or before resampling methods for tackling imbalanced datasets such as the KDD cup dataset, has not been investigated. Further the impact of this order of algorithms within the data pre-processing pipeline, on the performance of different classifiers has also not been studied. This paper centres on the dual utilisation of resampling techniques and feature selection approaches within a data pre-processing pipeline of an IDS, and explores which one, when implemented in what order, would achieve the superior classification results for a given classifier. Seven feature selection methods are studied alongside a most widely used resampling technique. The impact on three widely used classification algorithms are investigated; Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Stacking. The performance of classifiers is examined in detail to determine which should come first, resampling or feature selection.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-29516-5_45", "venue": "IntelliSys", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2969730382", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201761008"}

To exploit cross-frame relations, SC-GAN includes a spatial correspondence module which uses Smolyak sparse grids to efficiently match the features across adjacent frames, and an attention mechanism to learn the importance of features in different directions. Furthermore, the generator in SC-GAN learns to estimate depth from the input frames, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between the ground-truth and estimated depth map for the reference frame.

However, their strength is also their main weakness, as the generated nonlinear models are typically regarded as incomprehensible black-box models. In this paper, we propose a new active learning-based approach (ALBA) to extract comprehensible rules from opaque SVM models. Through rule extraction, some insight is provided into the logics of the SVM model. ALBA extracts rules from the trained SVM model by explicitly making use of key concepts of the SVM: the support vectors, and the observation that these are typically close to the decision boundary. Active learning implies the focus on apparent problem areas, which for rule induction techniques are the regions close to the SVM decision boundary where most of the noise is found. By generating extra data close to these support vectors that are provided with a class label by the trained SVM model, rule induction techniques are better able to discover suitable discrimination rules.

Syllables are a natural choice of linguistic unit for modeling the acoustics of languages such as Mandarin Chinese, due to the inherent nature of the syllable as an elemental pronunciation construct and the limited size of the syllable set for such languages (around 1400 syllables for Mandarin). Our models are trained with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and state-level minimum Bayes risk (sMBR) loss using asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) utilizing a parallel computation infrastructure for large-scale training. Our acoustic models operate on feature frames computed every 30ms, which makes them well suited for modeling syllables rather than phonemes, which can have a shorter duration. Additionally, when compared to wordlevel modeling, syllables have the advantage of avoiding out-of-vocabulary (OOV) model outputs. Our experiments on a Mandarin voice search task show that syllable-output models can perform better than context-independent (CI) phone-output models, and can give similar performance as our state-of-the-art context-dependent (CD) models. Additionally, decoding with syllable-output models is substantially faster than with CI models or with CD models.

We note that detection of overlapping communities is more computationally intensive than disjoint community detection, and the former presents new challenges that algorithm designers have to face. Moreover, the efficiency of many existing algorithms grows superlinearly with the network size making them unsuitable to process large datasets. We use the Speaker-Listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLPA) as the basis for our parallel overlapping community detection implementation. SLPA provides near linear time overlapping community detection and is well suited for parallelization. We explore the benefits of a multithreaded programming paradigm and show that it yields a significant performance gain over sequential execution while preserving the high quality of community detection.

However, the processing of natural languages is a challenge for automatic tools, because languages are used heterogeneously. To process a text, often taggers are used that are trained on a standardized language variety (e.g. recent newspaper articles). Unfortunately, these training data often differ from the target texts (i.e. the text on which a trained model later is applied) in terms of language variety and register, which is especially the case for historical texts. Therefore, additional, manual analyses are usually inevitable. Training tools on the target language variety, however, can improve the results of these tools so that the manual prost-processing could be avoided. Thus, the need to process large datasets of diachronic texts and to obtain accurate results in a short time-span requires an adaptable approach. The present paper suggests this adaptable approach, by training taggers on a target language variety, to improve the accuracy of the structure of historical German corpora at the level of part-of-speech-tagging (hereafter POS-tagging). We trained four taggers (Perceptron tagger [26], Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [1], Conditional Random Fields (CRF) [13], and Unigram [21]) each on data from three different literary periods: Baroque (1600-1700), Romanticism (1790-1840) and Modernism (1880-1930). Compared with pre-tagged data, we obtained a maximum accuracy in POS-tagging of 98.3% for a single period (Modernism with Perceptron trained on Modernism) and a maximum mean accuracy for all three periods of 94.3% (Perceptron trained on Romanticism). Compared with manually tagged data, we obtained a maximum accuracy for one period of 96.8% (Romanticism with CRF and HMM trained on Romanticism) and a maximum mean accuracy for all three periods of 92.3% (Perceptron trained on Romanticism). In spite of the heterogeneity of literary data, these results demonstrate a high performance of the POS-taggers if the models are trained on target language varieties.

Despite the powerful abstraction, graphs are challenging to model due to the high-dimensional, irregular and heterogeneous characteristics of many real-world graph data. An essential problem arose is how to effectively and efficiently learn the representation for objects in graphs. In this thesis, both the effectiveness as well as efficiency aspects of the graph representation learning problem are addressed. Specifically, we start by proposing an effective approach for learning heterogeneous graph embedding in an unsupervised setting. Then this is generalized to semi-supervised scenario where label guidance is leveraged. The effective graph representation learning models are followed by efficient techniques, where we propose efficient sampling strategies to improve the training efficiency for content-rich graph embedding models. Finally, to reduce storage and memory cost of the embedding table used in various models, we introduce a framework based on KD code, which can compress the embedding table in an end-to-end fashion.

The performance of band selection with Gaussian membership functions and triangular membership functions under various parameters were explored. Appropriate ranges of parameters were determined by the number of bands and mutual information of subsets relative to the decision.

In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for generating realistic image layout from textual scene graphs.

The objective is to reduce time, labour, costs, and most importantly, to increase the oil extraction rate, in order to achieve a good quality of palm oil at a more acceptable price. This research investigates the potential of flavonoids and anthocyanins as a predictor to classify the degree of oil palm FFB ripeness. This paper also discusses the relationship between these predictors and the ripeness categories period. One hundred and eighty oil palm FFB samples were collected from a private plantation in Malaysia, according to three maturity categories i.e., ripe, under-ripe, and over-ripe. Each sample was randomly scanned 10 times, both front and back using a hand-held Multiplex \u00ae 3 multi-parameter fluorescence sensor. The results show that flavonoid and anthocyanin content decreased from immature to over mature oil palm FFBs. Overall, the relationship using Pearson's correlation between flavonoids and anthocyanins was r 2 = 0.84 and the most outstanding relationship accuracy was at the over-ripe stage, at 90%. Statistical analysis using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and pair-wise testing proved that both predictors gave significance difference between under-ripe, ripe, and over-ripe maturity categories. This shows that both predictors can be good indicators to classify oil palm FFB. Classification analysis was performed by using both predictors together and separately through several methods. The highest overall classification accuracy was 87.7% using a Stochastic Gradient Boosting Trees model and with both predictors. The other classification methods used either independent or both predictors together and gave various results ranging from 50 to 85% accuracy. This research proves that flavonoids and anthocyanins can be used as predictors of oil palm maturity classification.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.indcrop.2011.10.020", "venue": null, "journal": "Industrial Crops and Products", "mag_id": "2054597342", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203929364", "14106794", "210891945", "82070346", "51907206", "136132213", "55659044", "54974427", "95725044", "90160450", "15182663"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:98379346"}

Methods: In the proposed technique, the image texture features are statistically represented using Generalized Gaussian Distribution in the wavelet domain.

While practitioners celebrate this as an economical way to obtain synthetic data for training data-hungry machine learning models, it is not clear that they recognize the perils of such an augmentation technique when applied to an already-biased dataset. Although one expects GANs to replicate the distribution of the original data, in real-world settings with limited data and finite network capacity, GANs suffer from mode collapse. Especially when this data is coming from online social media platforms or the web which are never balanced. In this paper, we show that in settings where data exhibits bias along some axes (eg. gender, race), failure modes of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) exacerbate the biases in the generated data. More often than not, this bias is unavoidable; we empirically demonstrate that given input of a dataset of headshots of engineering faculty collected from 47 online university directory webpages in the United States is biased toward white males, a state-of-the-art (unconditional variant of) GAN \"imagines\" faces of synthetic engineering professors that have masculine facial features and white skin color (inferred using human studies and a state-of-the-art gender recognition system). We also conduct a preliminary case study to highlight how Snapchat's explosively popular \"female\" filter (widely accepted to use a conditional variant of GAN), ends up consistently lightening the skin tones in women of color when trying to make face images appear more feminine.

First, C-SVM has different classification error rates on different classes if the sizes of training classes are uneven. Second, C-SVM is over-dependent on every training sample, even if the samples are duplicated. Third, C-SVM does not make a difference between training samples. According to these characteristics of C-SVM and the fact that the size of network normal data is always much larger than that of intrusion data and the fact that the importance of attack data is different from each other, an extended C-SVM, termed weighted C-SVM is proposed in this paper. Weighed C-SVM introduces two parameters, class weights and sample weights. Class weights are used to adjust false negative rate and false positive rate of each intrusion class.

Because of the complexity of the data, it is sometimes difficult to infer information about classes that are not mutually exclusive. For medical data, patients could have symptoms of multiple different diseases at the same time and it is important to develop tools that help to identify problems early. Intelligent health risk prediction models built with deep learning architectures offer a powerful tool for physicians to identify patterns in patient data that indicate risks associated with certain types of chronic diseases. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Physical examination records of 110,300 anonymous patients were used to predict diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver, a combination of these three chronic diseases, and the absence of disease (8 classes in total). The dataset was split into training (90%) and testing (10%) sub-datasets. Ten-fold cross validation was used to evaluate prediction accuracy with metrics such as precision, recall, and F-score. Deep Learning (DL) architectures were compared with standard and state-of-the-art multi-label classification methods. Preliminary results suggest that Deep Neural Networks (DNN), a DL architecture, when applied to multi-label classification of chronic diseases, produced accuracy that was comparable to that of common methods such as Support Vector Machines. We have implemented DNNs to handle both problem transformation and algorithm adaption type multi-label methods and compare both to see which is preferable. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Deep Learning architectures have the potential of inferring more information about the patterns of physical examination data than common classification methods. The advanced techniques of Deep Learning can be used to identify the significance of different features from physical examination data as well as to learn the contributions of each feature that impact a patient's risk for chronic diseases. However, accurate prediction of chronic disease risks remains a challenging problem that warrants further studies.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5751777", "pubmed_id": "29297288", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-017-1898-z", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2776922069", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["43485171", "17772075", "13880", "3767412", "11608263", "8007640", "12415435", "214878546", "1536643", "961425", "97681", "6844431", "1554582", "6628106", "207159665", "5808102"], "inbound_citations": ["174799610", "203605665", "156054122", "215539214", "209392433", "49716464", "86401142", "211684371", "52889172"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3145018"}

The co-occurrence features are learned with a hierarchical methodology, in which different levels of contextual information are aggregated gradually. Firstly point-level information of each joint is encoded independently. Then they are assembled into semantic representation in both spatial and temporal domains. Specifically, we introduce a global spatial aggregation scheme, which is able to learn superior joint co-occurrence features over local aggregation.

However, an individual diagnosis model can only acquire a limited diagnostic effect and may be insufficient for a particular application. In this paper, a Bayesian network-based probabilistic ensemble learning (PEL-BN) strategy is proposed to address the aforementioned issue. First, an ensemble index is proposed to evaluate the candidate diagnosis models in a probabilistic manner so that the diagnosis models with better diagnosis performance can be selected. Then, based on the selected classifiers, the architecture of the Bayesian network can be constructed using the proposed three types of basic topologies. Finally, the advantages of different diagnosis models are integrated using the developed Bayesian network, and thus, the fault causes of the observable anomaly can be accurately inferred. In addition, the proposed method can effectively capture the mixed fault characteristics of multifaults (MFs) by integrating decisions derived from different diagnosis models. Hence, this method can also provide a feasible solution for diagnosing MFs in real industrial processes. A simulation process and a real industrial process are adopted to verify the performance of the proposed method, and the experimental results illustrate that the proposed PEL-BN strategy improves the diagnosis performance of single faults and is a feasible solution for MF diagnosis. Note to Practitioners \u2014The focus of this paper is to develop a probabilistic ensemble learning strategy based on the Bayesian network (PEL-BN) to diagnose different kinds of faults in industrial processes.

A larger amount of sequence segments in the human genome have been computationally identified with such a 60-90 nt hairpin, however a majority of them are not miRNA hairpins. Most computational methods so far for predicting miRNA hairpins were based on a two-class classifier to distinguish between miRNA hairpins and the sequence segments with a hairpin structures. The difficulty of these methods is how to select hairpins as the negative examples of miRNA hairpins in the classifier-training datasets since only few miRNA hairpins are available. Therefore, their classifier may be mis-trained due to some false negative examples of the training dataset. In this paper, we introduce a one-class support vector machine (SVM) method to predict miRNA hairpins from the hairpin structures.

A new application in predicting the hardness performances of TiA1N coatings using a method called Support Vector Machine (SVM) is implemented. TiAlN coatings are usually used in high-speed machining due to its excellent surface hardness and wear resistance. Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) magnetron sputtering process has been used to produce the TiA1N coatings. Based on the experimental dataset of previous work, hence the SVM model is used in predicting the hardness of TiA1N coatings. The radial basis function (RBF) was selected as a kernel function with considered the C and Gamma as RBF parameter. For the process, the selected input parameters are the substrate sputtering power, bias voltage and temperature while the output parameter is the coating hardness. The results of proposed SVM model compared against the experimental result and hybrid RSM-Fuzzy model from previous work. The comparisons of SVM against hybrid RSM-Fuzzy was based on predictive performances in order to obtain the most accurate model for prediction of hardness in TiA1N coating. In terms of predictive performance evaluation, four performances matrix were applied that are percentage error, mean square error (MSE), co-efficient determination (R 2 ) and model accuracy. The result has proved that the proposed SVM model shows the better result compared to the actual data (experimental result) and hybrid RSM-fuzzy model. The SVM model result of average percentage error, MSE, R 2 and model accuracy were 0.4%, 0.076, 0.911 and 95.69% respectively.

We also compare the performance of the WTE and WPTE features when fed into multiple classifiers, namely, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forests, Extreme Learning Machines, Kernel Extreme Learning Machines, Multilayer Perceptron, and Deep Neural Networks. Key results presented indicate that, when fed into a SVM, WTE outperforms WPTE (one-tailed z-test, p<0.002). Further, WPTE can achieve a significant improvement when trained by a k-nearest neighbours classifier (one-tailed z-test, p < 0.001).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29060710", "doi": "10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037669", "venue": "2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)", "journal": "2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2755288226", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13694816", "45363420", "29053655", "23360654", "19018962", "10931339", "115694952", "8093783", "23470168", "24311774", "7999465", "7441300", "6494700", "11918873", "13924779", "21219257", "12537772", "118448307", "206787478", "89141", "116858", "18267806", "17804904", "961425", "125317919"], "inbound_citations": ["204231708", "4769777", "201067950"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30346066"}

These parameters provide a snapshot description of movement kinematics at a specific time point during reach, i.e., the maximum within a set of value, but do not allow to investigate how hand kinematics gradually conform to target properties. The present study was designed to extend the characterization of object size effects to the temporal domain. Thus, we computed the wrist velocity and the grip aperture throughout reach-to-grasp movements aimed at large versus small objects. To provide a deeper understanding of how joint movements varied over time, we also considered the time course of finger motion relative to hand motion. Results revealed that movement parameters evolved in parallel but at different rates in relation to object size. Furthermore, a classification analysis performed using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach showed that kinematic features taken as a group predicted the correct target size well before contact with the object. Interestingly, some kinematics features exhibited a higher ability to discriminate the target size than others did. These findings reinforce our knowledge about the relationship between kinematics and object properties and shed new light on the quantity and quality of information available in the kinematics of a reach-to-grasp movement over time.

Specifically, a self-attention-based generator is introduced to integrate local features with their long-range dependencies yielding better feature representations, and hence generate faces that preserve identities better, especially for larger pose angles. Moreover, a novel face-attention-based discriminator is applied to emphasize local features of face regions, and hence reinforce the realism of synthetic frontal faces. Guided by semantic segmentation, four independent discriminators are used to distinguish between different aspects of a face (\\ie skin, keypoints, hairline, and frontalized face). By introducing these two complementary attention mechanisms in generator and discriminator separately, we can learn a richer feature representation and generate identity preserving inference of frontal views with much finer details (i.e., more accurate facial appearance and textures) comparing to the state-of-the-art.

Consequently, they must have certain basic skills in order to interact with humans and the environment. One of these skills is the capacity to understand the places where they are able to move. Computer vision is one of the ways commonly used for achieving this purpose. Current technologies in this field offer outstanding solutions applied to improve data quality every day, therefore producing more accurate results in the analysis of an environment. With this in mind, the main goal of this research is to develop and validate an efficient object-based scene understanding method that will be able to help solve problems related to scene identification for mobile robotics. We seek to analyze state-of-the-art methods for finding the most suitable one for our goals, as well as to select the kind of data most convenient for dealing with this issue. Another primary goal of the research is to determine the most suitable data input for analyzing scenes in order to find an accurate representation for the scenes by meaning of semantic labels or point cloud features descriptors. As a secondary goal we will show the benefits of using semantic descriptors generated with pre-trained models for mapping and scene classification problems, as well as the use of deep learning models in conjunction with 3D features description procedures to build a 3D object classification model that is directly related with the representation goal of this work. The research described in this thesis was motivated by the need for a robust system capable of understanding the locations where a robot usually interacts. In the same way, the advent of better computational resources has allowed to implement some already defined techniques that demand high computational capacity and that offer a possible solution for dealing with scene understanding issues. One of these techniques are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These networks have the capacity of classifying an image based on their visual appearance. Then, they generate a list of lexical labels and the probability for each label, representing the likelihood of the present of an object in the scene. Labels are derived from the training sets that the networks learned to recognize. Therefore, we could use this list of labels and probabilities as an efficient representation of the environment and then assign a semantic category to the regions where a mobile robot is able to navigate, and at the same time construct a semantic or topological map based on this semantic representation of the place. After analyzing the state-of-the-art in Scene Understanding, we identified a set of approaches in order to develop a robust scene understanding procedure. Among these approaches we identified an almost unexplored gap in the topic of understanding scenes based on objects present in them. Consequently, we propose to perform an experimental study in this approach aimed at finding a way of fully describing a scene considering the objects lying in place. As the Scene Understanding task involves object detection and annotation, one of the first steps is to determine the kind of data to use as input data in our proposal. With this in mind, our proposal considers to evaluate the use of 3D data. This kind of data suffers from the presence of noise, therefore, we propose to use the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) algorithm to reduce noise effect in the object recognition procedure. GNGs have the capacity to grow and adapt their topology to represent 2D information, producing a smaller representation with a slight noise influence from the input data. Applied to 3D data, the GNG presents a good approach able to tackle with noise. However, using 3D data poses a set of problems such as the lack of a 3D object dataset with enough models to generalize methods and adapt them to real situations, as well as the fact that processing three-dimensional data is computationally expensive and requires a huge storage space. These problems led us to explore new approaches for developing object recognition tasks. Therefore, considering the outstanding results obtained by the CNNs in the latest ImageNet challenge, we propose to carry out an evaluation of the former as an object detection system. These networks were initially proposed in the 90s and are nowadays easily implementable due to hardware improvements in the recent years. CNNs have shown satisfying results when they tested in problems such as: detection of objects, pedestrians, traffic signals, sound waves classification, and for medical image processing, among others. Moreover, an aggregate value of CNNs is the semantic description capabilities produced by the categories/labels that the network is able to identify and that could be translated as a semantic explanation of the input image. Consequently, we propose using the evaluation of these semantic labels as a scene descriptor for building a supervised scene classification model. Having said that, we also propose using semantic descriptors to generate topological maps and test the description capabilities of lexical labels. In addition, semantic descriptors could be suitable for unsupervised places or environment labeling, so we propose using them to deal with this kind of problem in order to achieve a robust scene labeling method. Finally, for tackling the object recognition problem we propose to develop an experimental study for unsupervised object labeling. This will be applied to the objects present in a point cloud and labeled using a lexical labeling tool. Then, objects will be used as the training instances of a classifier mixing their 3D features with label assigned by the external tool.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2800124301", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64545548"}

The classification sensitivity of ECG classification is improved from 83.00% of single convolution network to 97.07% of class S (supraventricular abnormal beats) classification sensitivity, The classification sensitivity of Class F (Fused Rhythm) is increased from 74.48% to 97.24%, which significantly improves the classification sensitivity of small probability abnormal rhythms, and increases the universality of ECG classification algorithm in multi-class beat recognition.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-6596/1207/1/012003", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "journal": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "mag_id": "2941528611", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201847792"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:150158123"}

There can be multiple source domains, therefore, OnTL with Multiple Source Domains has been studied in recent years and algorithms have been proposed. Nevertheless, it can be noted that existing research on OnTL with Multiple Source Domains only deals with binary classification tasks. In this paper, we make the first attempt to study OnTL with Multiple Source Domains for multi-class classification (MC), and propose an algorithm, referred to as Online Multi-source Transfer Learning for Multi-class classification (OMTL-MC) algorithm. OMTL-MC algorithm is built on two-stage ensemble strategy, in this way, the knowledge extracted from different source domains can be simultaneously online transferred to improve the performance of the classifier in the target domain. In order to deeper explore the underlying structure among multiple classes, an Extended Hinge Loss (EHL) function is adopted in OMTL-MC.

To fully explore the spectral\u2013spatial information and improve the change detection performance for HSR images, this paper proposes the hybrid conditional random field (HCRF) model, which combines the traditional random field method with an object-based technique. In the proposed method, the spectral discriminative information of a single pixel is extracted by the unary potential, which is modeled using a soft clustering method to make an initial separation of changed and unchanged pixels. The pairwise potential then considers the contextual information of adjacent pixels to favor spatial smoothing. An object term is also introduced in the HCRF model to keep the homogeneity of changed objects. By the use of these approaches, the oversmoothing problem of the random field-based methods and the detection error caused by the segmentation strategy in the object-based methods can be relieved.

However, SVR parameters tuning is a vital task for performing an accurate reliability estimation. We propose variable neighborhood search (VNS) for continuous space, including some simple but efficient shaking and local search as its main operators, to tune the SVR parameters and create a novel SVR-VNS hybrid system to improve the reliability of estimation accuracy.

The dataset ACS-F1 (Appliance Consumption Signature Fribourg 1) available online and containing 100 appliances signatures in XML (Extensible Markup Language) format is used for that purpose. A new format for this dataset is created as it makes easier to implement directly machine learning algorithm such as K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors), Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron in the feature space between the test object and the training examples. In order to optimize the classification algorithm accuracy, we propose to use a moving average function for reducing the random variations in the observations.

From the latter, we accumulate mobility tracks experience. We focus on the preliminary step of characterizing the elapsed time between neuron contacts, which results from a spatial process fitting in the family of random processes with memory, where chasing neurons are stochastically driven by the goal of hitting target neurons. Thus, we add an unprecedented mobility model to the literature in the field, introducing a distribution law of the intercontact times that merges features of both negative exponential and Pareto distribution laws. We give a constructive description and implementation of our model, as well as a short analytical form whose parameters are suitably estimated in terms of confidence intervals from experimental data.

A total number of 138 cases were collected from the literature to develop and validate the BRF model. The results showed that the BAS can tune the RF effectively, and therefore, the hyperparameters of RF were obtained. The proposed BRF model can accurately predict the UCS of RC with a high correlation coefficient (0.96). Furthermore, the variable importance was determined, and the results showed that the age of RC is the most significant variable, followed by water-cement ratio, fine rubber aggregate, coarse rubber aggregate, and coarse aggregate.

The purpose of this approach is to improve the performances of the ensemble method by eliminating dynamically all the weak learners for a specific input. As of now, most of the dynamic pruning methods use information about the validation data and intermediate performances of the ensemble's classifiers on it, but none of them take the advantage of the intrinsic information given by those classifiers. In this paper we propose a new dynamic ensemble selection framework based on a tree internal supervised measure. This implies that our approach works on homogeneous ensemble methods with trees as base learners. This approach is motivated by the fact that in high dimensional datasets, usual metrics like euclidean distance suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, a similarity measure based on decision tree structure can be considered as supervised, which is well suited for supervised learning. Our framework is called ST-DES for Similarity Tree Dynamic Ensemble Selection. In this work, we use one of the best ensemble algorithm, Random Forest, as the base ensemble generator. We then compare the performance in terms of accuracy of ST-DES against the best known approaches in literature on different UCI datasets.

In this work wind integration is considered as a factor to forecast operating reserve. Increase of wind integration into power system, needs larger quantities of operating reserve. This demands an increase in the cost of generation and emissions. Forecasting the Operating Reserve Ancillary Service helps the system operators (SO) to plan scheduling of generators in advance and also in better bidding environment.

We propose a parametric transfer learning approach based on the Fisher divergence to address this challenge. This makes it possible to create patient-specific models and make predictions of self-reported well-being scores, when training is performed incrementally on sparse data becoming slowly available over time. This approach allows us to make informed predictions even in the early stages of data collection, by leveraging external information coming from other patients, in the form of a prior used within a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo process.

At the end,prediction accuracy of the model was evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic( ROC) curve and the true skill statistics( TSS) methods. Results show that the potential habitats of the three species would move gradually northwards and upwards in altitude.

To mitigate the problem of sediments from agricultural areas reaching the channel, reservoirs and other surface waters, it is important to understand hillslope-channel connectivity and catchment connectivity. To determine the functioning of hillslope-channel connectivity and the continuation of transport of these sediments in the channel, it is necessary to obtain data on sediment transport from the hillslopes to the channels. Simultaneously, the factors that influence sediment export out of the catchment need to be studied. For measuring hillslope-channel sediment connectivity, Rare-Earth Oxide (REO) tracers were applied to a hillslope in an agricultural catchment in Navarre, Spain, preceding the winter of 2014-2015. The results showed that during the winter no sediment transport from the hillslope to the channel was detected. To test the implication of the REO results at the catchment scale, two contrasting conceptual models for sediment connectivity were assessed using a Random Forest (RF) machine learning method. The RF method was applied using a 15-year period of measured sediment output at the catchment scale. One model proposes that small events provide sediment for large events, while the other proposes that only large events cause sediment detachment and small events subsequently remove these sediments from near and in the channel. For sediment yield prediction of small events, variables related to large preceding events were the most important. The model for large events underperformed and, therefore, we could not draw any immediate conclusions whether small events influence the amount of sediment exported during large events. Both REO tracers and RF method showed that low intensity events do not contribute any sediments from the hillslopes to the channel in the Latxaga catchment. Sediment dynamics are dominated by sediment mobilisation during large (high intensity) events. Sediments are for a large part exported during those events, but the system shows a memory of the occurrence of these large events, suggesting that large amounts of sediments are deposited in and near the channel after these events. These sediments are gradually removed by small events. To better understand the delivery of sediments to the channel and how large and small events influence each other more field data on hillslope-channel connectivity and within-channel sediment dynamics is necessary.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.18172/cig.3169", "venue": "Cuadernos de Investigaci\u00f3n Geogr\u00e1fica", "journal": "Cuadernos de Investigaci\u00f3n Geogr\u00e1fica", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2596021577", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["140676913", "128610917", "128906766", "89141", "130095991", "129379880", "153348089", "153445934", "129175129", "126890141", "129437885", "51827313", "15465022", "128611376", "129914462", "5030592", "140618732", "128547148", "20020173", "5027014", "128680063", "132046168", "130476661", "129187929", "40091382", "129845070", "5036350"], "inbound_citations": ["134085528", "159285327", "134486355", "121416698", "155567256", "104934013", "104277631", "90109931", "133749119", "30595288", "134197122", "53945327", "189759660", "88508015", "19097760", "104362147", "103122782"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63396942"}

One attractive viewpoint on ResNet is that it is optimizing the risk in a functional space by combining an ensemble of effective features. In this paper, we adopt this viewpoint to construct a new gradient boosting method, which is known to be very powerful in data analysis.

Humans have the ability to recognize a complex image, like for example that of a known person, and to distinguish it from other objects within half a second. While for a solution of this task the brain has access to a massive parallelism and a vast, hierarchically organized, and auto-associative memory, common computer architectures are just able to a sequential processing of information stored in a non auto-associative memory. Even modern, parallelly operating, multi-processor systems are far away from the performance of our brain. However, nowadays, it is possible to solve complex and memory extensive pattern recognition problems, like the recognition of handwritten digits or the transcription of speech, satisfactorily with a common computer by the use of modern statistical and algorithmic learning approaches. One of the most successful pattern recognition methods is the so-called Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SVM is based on the learning paradigm of structural risk minimization, which outperforms empirical approaches if only few data is available for solving the considered classification problem. Although the SVM has proven very good recognition performances in many cases, the SVM also comes up with limitations, for example if specific a priori knowledge shall be used. In particular, the increasing complexity of applications requires a high adaptivity of the classification method to the specific problem. Also concerning this point, the SVM is limited due to a restricted variety of implementable classification functions. The objective of the present thesis is the development of new learning algorithms for the classification of patterns, that on the one hand overcome the limitations of the SVM, but on the other hand are based on the same theoretical concepts facilitating the good performance of the SVM. Two new algorithms will be presented that are justified by a theoretical generalization of the SVM, and which will be utilized for the first time for a practical implementation. In contrast to the SVM, the new methods make accessible a much larger function class for constructing a classifier. This is an important prerequisite for flexible adaptation of the classifier to difficult classification tasks with particular requirements as well as for the integration of a priori knowledge about the problem at hand. In this work, the way to implementable algorithms leads across different mathematical reformulations of the original problem.

Most of these approaches are not based on measuring individual cell methylation but rather the bulk tumor sample DNA, which contains a mixture of tumor cells, infiltrating immune cells and other stromal components. This raises questions about the purity of a certain tumor sample, given the varying degrees of stromal infiltration in different entities. Previous methods to infer tumor purity require or are based on the use of matching control samples which are rarely available. Here we present a novel, reference free method to quantify tumor purity, based on two Random Forest classifiers, which were trained on ABSOLUTE as well as ESTIMATE purity values from TCGA tumor samples. We subsequently apply this method to a previously published, large dataset of brain tumors, proving that these models perform well in datasets that have not been characterized with respect to tumor purity . Using two gold standard methods to infer purity \u2013 the ABSOLUTE score based on whole genome sequencing data and the ESTIMATE score based on gene expression data- we have optimized Random Forest classifiers to predict tumor purity in entities that were contained in the TCGA project. We validated these classifiers using an independent test data set and cross-compared it to other methods which have been applied to the TCGA datasets (such as ESTIMATE and LUMP). Using Illumina methylation array data of brain tumor entities (as published in Capper et al. (Nature 555:469-474,2018)) we applied this model to estimate tumor purity and find that subgroups of brain tumors display substantial differences in tumor purity. Random forest- based tumor purity prediction is a well suited tool to extrapolate gold standard measures of purity to novel methylation array datasets.

It presents a method which uses the union mention above to relate to each contour segment a likelihood degree of being part of a human silhouette.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5220/0002845300740080", "venue": "VISAPP", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "104736819", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9148635", "206590483", "6644398", "45409538", "12797124", "52798159", "10755594", "3936594", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": ["14218002", "11292836", "33244341"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9626778"}

Recently, an increasing number of researchers have sought to improve the methods for protein fold recognition. Following the construction of a dataset consisting of 27 protein fold classes by Ding and Dubchak in 2001, prediction algorithms, parameters and the construction of new datasets have improved for the prediction of protein folds. In this study, we reorganized a dataset consisting of 76-fold classes constructed by Liu et al. and used the values of the increment of diversity, average chemical shifts of secondary structure elements and secondary structure motifs as feature parameters in the recognition of multi-class protein folds. With the combined feature vector as the input parameter for the Random Forests algorithm and ensemble classification strategy, we propose a novel method to identify the 76 protein fold classes. The overall accuracy of the test dataset using an independent test was 66.69%; when the training and test sets were combined, with 5-fold cross-validation, the overall accuracy was 73.43%. This method was further used to predict the test dataset and the corresponding structural classification of the first 27-protein fold class dataset, resulting in overall accuracies of 79.66% and 93.40%, respectively. Moreover, when the training set and test sets were combined, the accuracy using 5-fold cross-validation was 81.21%. Additionally, this approach resulted in improved prediction results using the 27-protein fold class dataset constructed by Ding and Dubchak.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4778582", "pubmed_id": "26980999", "doi": "10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.10.008", "venue": "Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences", "journal": "Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2192419461", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["35551003", "30789599", "3041302", "9160976", "43839112", "205383483", "27085948", "6823830", "21780405", "18612367", "83742032", "24967659", "22714637", "8804718", "11114746", "40287681", "21863916", "56004037", "59381694", "27405297", "16559997", "19587817", "6707359", "10376986", "17678464", "25583315", "28559876", "113308289", "1949252", "25394030", "33755287", "2191353", "580801", "9728696", "9014541", "35551003", "41130847", "473957", "10367995", "25445629", "18717146", "96379545", "111951235", "8308961", "24282116"], "inbound_citations": ["14130522", "214884826", "17743331", "56481925"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22495109"}

Even Japanese sourced words are sometimes transliterated into the Roman alphabet. As most of them are very new and idiosyncratic proper nouns, it is impractical to assume all those alphabetic words can be registered in the word dictionary of a text-to-speech system; their pronunciation must be derived automatically. As long vowel expressions are the same with short vowel or diphthong expressions in Japanese words transliterated into the alphabet, long vowel detection is necessary for generating highly accurate pronunciation. This paper proposes a method to detect long vowel positions using the Support Vector Machine. The cost of making the learning model for the detection is very low because the training data can be generated automatically from the text-to-speech word dictionary. 93.2% word accuracy was achieved which is almost the maximum accuracy possible from just spelling information.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "INTERSPEECH", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "256785915", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35800645"}
