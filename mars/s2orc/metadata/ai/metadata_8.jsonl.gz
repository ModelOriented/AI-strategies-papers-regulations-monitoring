Optimizing MSE instead of CLL may lead to a lower bias classifier and hence result in better performance on big datasets. We show that this NB preconditioning can speed-up convergence significantly.

To simplify the process, we propose an intelligent waste material classification system, which is developed by using the 50-layer residual net pre-train (ResNet-50) Convolutional Neural Network model which is a machine learning tool and serves as the extractor, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is used to classify the waste into different groups/types such as glass, metal, paper, and plastic etc. The proposed system is tested on the trash image dataset which was developed by Gary Thung and Mindy Yang, and is able to achieve an accuracy of 87% on the dataset.

Its major challenges arise with jointly exploring the complex input-output relationships and inter-target correlations. One representative approach is to build many independent single-target Support Vector Regression (SVR) models for each output target which can capture complex input-output relationships via the kernel trick. However, it does not involve inter-target correlations to improve the performance. Meanwhile, there are also many regularization-based methods which mainly explore the linear inter-target correlations, e.g., a low-rank constraint on the parameter matrix. However, in practice, it might be restrictive to assume the targets to be linearly related, and allowing for nonlinear relationships is a challenge. Motivated by Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI), we propose a novel privileged multi-target support vector regression (MT-PSVR) model which can jointly explore the complex input-output relationships and nonlinear inter-target correlations. It explicitly explores inter-target correlations by viewing other targets as privileged information when training each target model.

Given the deployment of intermittent renewable energy sources and the ever increasing consumption of electricity, the generation of accurate building-level electricity demand forecasts will be valuable to both grid operators and building energy management systems. The literature is rich with forecasting models for individual buildings. However, an ongoing challenge is the development of a broadly applicable method for demand forecasting across geographic locations, seasons, and use-types. This paper addresses the need for a generalizable approach to electricity demand forecasting through the formulation of an ensemble learning method that performs model validation and selection in real time using a gating function. By learning from electricity demand data streams, the method requires little knowledge of energy end-use, making it well suited for real deployments. While the ensemble method is capable of incorporating complex forecasters, such as Artificial Neural Networks or Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models, this work will focus on employing simpler models, such as Ordinary Least Squares and k-Nearest Neighbors. By applying our method to 32 building electricity demand data sets (8 commercial and 24 residential), we generate electricity demand forecasts with a mean absolute percent error of 7.5% and 55.8% for commercial and residential buildings, respectively.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.10.019", "venue": null, "journal": "Energy and Buildings", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2192284186", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["154067158", "16525735", "109142578", "109723040", "109659254", "205400956", "62472421", "110190796", "109153398", "109507081", "109980816", "14738811", "123110942", "111294590", "152988974", "10311460", "108710057", "70536403", "15480929", "2155243", "16036351", "61067117", "10659969", "34808155", "30874049"], "inbound_citations": ["158167687", "199423832", "214595901", "13821631", "36328114", "28195914", "13378675"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32249886"}

Yield loss accounts for even more than 70% when crops are frown under unweeded condition with severe weed infestation. Weed management is the most significant process in the agricultural applications to improve the crop productivity rate and reduce the herbicide application cost. Existing weed detection techniques does not yield better performance due to the complex background, illumination variation and crop and weed overlapping in the agricultural field image. Hence, there arises a need for the development of effective weed identification technique. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a novel Wrapping Curvelet Transformation Based Angular Texture Pattern Extraction Method (WCTATP) for weed identification. In our proposed work, Global Histogram Equalization (GHE) is used improve the quality of the image and Adaptive Median Filter (AMF) is used for filtering the impulse noise from the image. Plant image identification is performed using green pixel extraction and k-means clustering. Wrapping Curvelet transform is applied to the plant image. Feature extraction is performed to extract the angular texture pattern of the plant image. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based Differential Evolution Feature Selection (DEFS) approach is applied to select the optimal features. Then, the selected features are learned and passed through an RVM based classifier to find out the weed. Edge detection and contouring is performed to identify the weed in the plant image. The Fuzzy rule-based approach is applied to detect the low, medium and high levels of the weed patchiness. From the experimental results, it is clearly observed that the accuracy of the proposed approach is higher than the existing Support Vector Machine (SVM) based approaches.

Five different machine learning models were trained using TSQ data to predict student academic performance. In addition, student English performance is also predicted in the same way as a comparison As a result, the Linear Support Vector Machine model can predict student academic performance with 80% accuracy and English performance with 84% accuracy using TSQ data.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISRITI48646.2019.9034585", "venue": "2019 International Seminar on Research of Information Technology and Intelligent Systems (ISRITI)", "journal": "2019 International Seminar on Research of Information Technology and Intelligent Systems (ISRITI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3011740283", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["143080417", "197686769", "829105", "28988131", "52874011", "61568722", "16621299", "199058288", "201623121", "202729524", "199541695", "54071098", "143985443", "143570724", "4659079", "144819030", "10659969", "15902995", "6305137"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213177326"}

In this context, the main objective of this paper is to produce a land cover map using hyperspectral data acquired by EO-1 Hyperion instrument over one test site. Atmospheric correction on the hyperspectral data was performed using ENVI\u2019s Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hyper-cubes (FLAASH) module. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification was implemented on the dominant elements to produce a land cover map for test site. SVM is carried out in this research to deal with the multi-class issue of Hyperion data. Classification using the kernel functions in classification made the classifier robust against the outliers.

The new method combines the external linear PLS framework with the internal extreme learning machine (ELM) function. First, PLS is used as the outer framework to extract the input and output latent variables as well as eliminating the collinearity of the original variables, and then ELM is employed to describe the nonlinear relation between pairs of latent variables. Besides, the weight updating strategy based on errors minimization is also involved to improve the prediction accuracy. Then, the pH-neutralization process is taken as a benchmark to verify the validity of the new model. Finally, this method is applied to model the NOx emission of a 1000-MW coal-fired boiler, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values are 5.9541 for the training dataset and 6.8323 for the testing dataset. Compared with linear PLS and another two nonlinear PLS methods, smaller prediction errors is obtained.

This paper presents a fast pattern selection method by scanning the training data set to reduce a problem\u2019s scale. In particular, we find the k-nearest neighbors (kNNs) in a local region around each pattern\u2019s target value, and then determine to retain the pattern according to the distribution of its nearest neighbors. There is a high probability that the pattern locates outside the $\\varepsilon $ -tube. Since the kNNs of a pattern are found in a very small region, it is fast to scan the whole training data set. The proposed method deals with the year prediction Million Song Data set, which contains 463 715 patterns, within 10 s on a personal computer with an Intel Core i5\u20134690 CPU at 3.50 GHz and 8GB DRAM.

During the course of this study, the initial numbers of features were successfully reduced to two sets of 12 features specific to each dataset without a compromise to the success.

So far, only two well-known methods adversarial training and defensive distillation have provided a significant defense. In contrast to existing methods mainly based on model itself, we address the problem purely based on the adversarial examples itself.

However, due to the expensive manual process for labelling large number of images, the amount of available training data is always limited. To produce more data for training a deep network, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can be used to generate artificial sample data. However, the generated data usually does not have annotation labels. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a virtual label called Multi-pseudo Regularized Label (MpRL) and assign it to the generated data. With MpRL, the generated data will be used as the supplementary of real training data to train a deep neural network in a semi-supervised learning fashion. To build the corresponding relationship between the real data and generated data, MpRL assigns each generated data a proper virtual label which reflects the likelihood of the affiliation of the generated data to pre-defined training classes in the real data domain. Unlike the traditional label which usually is a single integral number, the virtual label proposed in this work is a set of weight-based values each individual of which is a number in (0,1] called multi-pseudo label and reflects the degree of relation between each generated data to every pre-defined class of real data. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out by adopting two state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in our experiments to verify the effectiveness of MpRL. Experiments demonstrate that by assigning MpRL to generated data, we can further improve the person re-ID performance on five re-ID datasets, i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, CUHK03, VIPeR, and CUHK01.

It proposes an approach that represents a novel, linguistically motivated perspective in the area of terminological processing. The hypothesis of this work is that terms tend to perform certain types of syntactic functions more prominently than others. This syntactic behaviour of terms can be captured as termhood by estimating term probabilities from their occurrences in different syntactic paths. Based on a large corpus of parse trees, this feature allows for highly reliable statistics on properties of term occurrences. In essence, this method is a weighting scheme that measures probabilistic relations between term occurring patterns and syntactic paths, which is discussed in this thesis as Syntactic Function Value (SF-Value) and implemented in a term extraction system. Experiments conducted in this study begin by building up an automatic term extraction system that integrates such a weighting scheme. The purpose of these experiments is not to design a term extraction system with the best performance but to investigate the contributions of syntactic information to term extraction, including single-word terms, multi-word terms, and new terms. Specifically, these experiments are aimed at answering several research questions, including the following: whether linguistic knowledge as term rates in syntactic paths is useful for recognising candidate terms in medical texts; to what extent singleword terms can be extracted by this linguistic indicator; and subsequently how this linguistically based metric can be used to improve the ranking of multi-word terms, and whether term rates in syntactic paths can be used effectively for new term extraction. Finally, with the aim of investigating whether this linguistic metric can be used as an effective feature within a machine learning framework, a series of experiments are conducted on general term extraction and new term extraction using the method of Conditional Random Fields (CRF).", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "168891940", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16678297", "61810250"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59891806"}

PredGPI reaches a lower rate of false positive predictions with respect to other available methods and it is therefore a costless, rapid and accurate method for screening whole proteomes.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2571997", "pubmed_id": "18811934", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-9-392", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2141816565", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["701796", "23721246", "31835818", "36331404", "36620718", "34631441", "12304148", "28459773", "17243420", "40764472", "1456277", "8143645", "36865566", "13751855", "7744621", "20113942", "52817411", "16273213", "52874011", "6945799", "6923178", "44766411"], "inbound_citations": ["214869991", "28457603", "106411802", "472636", "16690912", "14051273", "212651008", "44148188", "202568762", "14006859", "54459139", "215304360", "199634512", "14108274", "52958835", "3227925", "15844367", "584880", "52059103", "5045030", "196635049", "195660201", "6159965", "1208404", "73663963", "26661564", "51920757", "209409786", "207893530", "215012192", "204811483", "46896148", "209573642", "13370239", "155762789", "25923241", "215062226", "17758564", "209591286", "3178289", "14984495", "73444548", "16797872", "1141907", "13179623", "17955597", "14350767", "196812019", "13354071", "15549882", "2028792", "7204624", "215503518", "215443142", "3833196", "90697494", "22824193", "88179020", "11314203", "22999732", "52853226", "91322945", "21024571", "49562683", "25488122", "32931661", "215216383", "3600699", "213349996", "53833434", "15763585", "214994021", "215218853", "199601777", "215557612", "18480522", "214894766", "2519979", "5045375", "2809867", "53670253", "195764721", "53952527", "4472131", "1261827", "763464", "213413996", "8295260", "15833476", "7738488", "11749345", "8283900", "215478403", "5239388", "13748530", "3840456", "4598573", "9712852", "172137856", "10796242", "14574786", "20633627", "2968347", "13123805", "7184755", "4118153", "13811632", "196635863", "24350336", "25949994", "208767411", "205843909", "1159046", "19315534", "19025857", "131776311", "86938617", "14034630", "12555681", "14180999", "52965263", "3657268", "92183697", "6551380", "4435238", "199548920", "49564660", "2909411", "17130885", "15652755", "1942404", "195825701", "207936038", "15280002", "30186839", "21688014", "17677199", "3307592", "15216512", "2576424", "209441378", "13913125", "208176794", "16699072", "53105130", "10581389", "10717414", "13761089", "214956724", "5026656", "131778235", "3969878", "59618330", "143423347", "198242088", "214910954", "559348", "29720894", "14945375", "206200725", "171092451", "30679554"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5265066"}

To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel way to exploit the unique geometry of the real data, especially the manifold information. More specifically, we design a method to regularize GAN training by adding an additional regularization term referred to as manifold regularizer. The manifold regularizer forces the generator to respect the unique geometry of the real data manifold and generate high quality data. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that the addition of this regularization term in any class of GANs including DCGAN and Wasserstein GAN leads to improved performance in terms of generalization, existence of equilibrium, and stability. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed manifold regularization helps in avoiding mode collapse and leads to stable training.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1811.10427", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2900866154", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18828233", "2057420", "16902615", "13002849", "1033682", "326772", "46933230", "3619830", "2220097", "211227", "459456", "2349418", "6610705", "8424807", "7645673", "3587082", "195345925", "10014283", "11758569", "23519254", "19173163", "1687220", "4475365"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53766176"}

Medical diagnosis helps to obtain different features representing the different variations of the disease. With the help of different diagnostic procedures, it is likely to have relevant, irrelevant and redundant features to represent a disease. Redundant features contribute to the wrong classification of the disease. Therefore, removing the redundant features reduces the size of the data and computation complexity. Identifying a good feature subset for effective classification is a non-trivial task. This requires an exhaustive search over the sample space of the dataset. The main objective of this paper is to use a metaheuristic algorithm to determine the optimal feature subset with improved classification accuracy in cardiovascular disease diagnosis. Swarm intelligence based Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is used to find the best features in the disease identification. To evaluate the fitness of ABC, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification is used. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated against the Cleveland Heart disease dataset taken from the UCI machine learning repository.

A method for the classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained breast biopsy images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is proposed.

The architecture of the network is designed to retrieve information at different scales, including both nuclei and overall tissue organization. This design allows the extension of the proposed system to whole-slide histology images. The features extracted by the CNN are also used for training a Support Vector Machine classifier.

Within the object categorization domain, the visual learning community has actively declined this paradigm in the transfer learning setting. Almost all proposed methods focus on category detection problems, addressing how to learn a new target class from few samples by leveraging over the known source. But if one thinks of learning over multiple tasks, there is a need for multiclass transfer learning algorithms able to exploit previous source knowledge when learning a new class, while at the same time optimizing their overall performance. This is an open challenge for existing transfer learning algorithms. The contribution of this paper is a discriminative method that addresses this issue, based on a Least-Squares Support Vector Machine formulation.

The algorithms were tested based on local geometrical and radiometric descriptors. In this study, local descriptors such as linearity, planarity, intensity, etc. are initially extracted for each point by observing their neighbor points. These features are then imported to a classification algorithm to automatically label each point.

State-of-the-art approaches accomplish this in two steps: firstly, regressing for every pixel in the image its 3D scene coordinate and subsequently, using these coordinates to estimate the final 6D camera pose via RANSAC. To solve the first step, Random Forests (RFs) are typically used. On the other hand, Neural Networks (NNs) reign in many dense regression tasks, but are not test-time efficient. We ask the question: which of the two is best for camera localization? To address this, we make two method contributions: (1) a test-time efficient NN architecture which we term a ForestNet that is derived and initialized from a RF, and (2) a new fully-differentiable robust averaging technique for regression ensembles which can be trained end-to-end with a NN. Our experimental findings show that for scene coordinate regression, traditional NN architectures are superior to test-time efficient RFs and ForestNets, however, this does not translate to final 6D camera pose accuracy where RFs and ForestNets perform slightly better.

In this study, we present an agricultural monitoring system to obtain annual land use maps of grass- cropland distributions on the agricultural area in Switzerland. Furthermore, we aim to detect impacts on soil organic carbon stocks due to inter-annual land use dynamics within a 15-year period. We used the Landsat archive, terrain and climate variables to set up a Random Forest land use classifier across multiple years. We applied the model for each year from 2000 to 2015 and stacked the classification grids to obtain a map of spatially explicit land use sequences. Finally, we grouped the sequences in six classes of prevailing management practices and attributed soil organic carbon observations, which were recently collected across Switzerland.

In this context, a new Figure of Merit (FoM) parameter which combines both electrical and reliability characteristics is proposed. Moreover, the impact of Gaussian channel doping profile (GCD) in enhancing the DG JL MOSFET reliability against the self-heating effects (SHEs) is presented. The proposed design thermal stability and electrical characteristics are investigated and compared with those of the conventional structure in order to reveal the device performance including SHEs. It is found that the amended channel doping has a profound implication in improving both the device electrical performance and the reliability against the undesired self-heating and short channel effects (SCEs). Furthermore, the transistor thermal behavior analysis involves classification of the device performance by taking into account the device reliability. For this purpose, SVMs are adopted for supervised classification in order to identify the most favorable design configurations associated with suppressed SHEs and improved electrical performance.

Our strategy is to detect text regions which we define as part of text lines containing a whole character or transitions between two adjacent characters. We observe that, if we scale text regions to a small and fixed size, their image gradients exhibit certain patterns irrespective of text shapes and language types. Based on this observation, we propose simple features which consist of means and standard deviations of image gradients to train a Random Forest so as to detect text regions over multiple image scales and color channels. Text regions are then merged into text line candidates which are ranked based on the Random Forest responses combined with the shapes of the candidates, e.g., horizontally elongated candidates are given higher scores, because they are more likely to contain texts.

That a key phrase is extracted means that it is present verbatim in the sentence to which it is assigned. Accurate key phrase extraction is fundamental to the success of many recent digital library applications, clustering, and semantic information retrieval techniques. The present research discusses a support vector machines (SVMs) approach for Vietnamese key phrase extraction and presents a number of experiments in which performance is incrementally improved. In general, the Vietnamese key phrase extracting process consists of three steps: word segmentation for identifying lexical units in an input sentence, part-of-speech tagging for words, and key phrase extraction for phrases. The performance of Vietnamese key phras extraction systems is generally measured by the precision rate attained. This depends strongly on the nature and the size of a training set of key phrases. Most results are superior to 70.30% with a training set of 9,000 Vietnamese key phrases with of 2,000 sentences which was selected from the corpus of Vietnamese Lexicography Center (www.vietlex.com.vn). I. INTRODUCTION Key phrases, which can be single keywords or multiword key terms, are linguistic descriptors of documents. They are often sufficiently informative to help human readers get a feel for the essential topics and main contents included in the source documents. Key phrases have also been used as features in many text-related applications such as text clustering, document similarity analysis, and document summarization. Manually extracting key phrases from a number of documents is quite expensive. Automatic key phrase extraction is a maturing technology that can serve as an efficient and practical alternative. Key phrase extraction may be viewed as a classification problem. A document can be seen as a bag of phrases wherein each phrase belongs to one of the two possible classes: either it is a key phrase or it is a non-key phrase. We approach this problem from the perspective of machine learning research and treat it as a problem of supervised learning from examples. We divide our documents into two sets: training documents and testing documents. The training documents are used to tune the key phrase extraction algorithms, in order to attempt to maximize their performance. That is, the training documents are used to teach the supervised learning algorithms how to distinguish key phrases from non-key phrases. The testing documents are used to evaluate the tuned algorithms. The motivation for this work is to establish the range of applications for key phrases. There are at least five general application areas for key phrases: Text summarization, human- readable index, interactive query refinement, machine-readable index, and feature extraction as preprocessing for further machine analysis. SVMs is an extraordeinary phenomenon in machine learning methodology. Research that applies this method has achieved good results, and has proven to be more effective than research that uses other learning methods, especially when applied to problems of natural language processing (3, 6, 7), pattern classification, or pattern recognition (8). In this paper, we present the application of SVMs to build a Vietnamese key phrase extraction system for Vietnamese text. In this section a Support Vector Machines model is introduced for Vietnamese key phrase extraction. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces a Support Vector Machines approach; Section 3 proposes a methodology of Vietnamese key phrase extraction model; Section 4 evaluates our approach on many Vietnamese query sentences with different styles of texts; and finally the conclusion is presented in Section 5.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/RIVF.2009.5174613", "venue": "2009 IEEE-RIVF International Conference on Computing and Communication Technologies", "journal": "2009 IEEE-RIVF International Conference on Computing and Communication Technologies", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2167864494", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16511973", "577580", "2427083", "3446853", "58377815", "7007323", "117643475"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16069641"}

A key problem of these methods is how to choose an optimal kernel and how to optimise its parameters. The real-world applications have also emphasised the need to consider a combination of kernels--a multiple kernel--in order to boost the classification accuracy by adapting the kernel to the characteristics of heterogeneous data. This combination could be linear or non-linear, weighted or un-weighted. Several approaches have been already proposed to find a linear weighted kernel combination and to optimise its parameters together with the SVM parameters, but no approach has tried to optimise a non-linear weighted combination. Therefore, our goal is to automatically generate and adapt a kernel combination (linear or non-linear, weighted or un-weighted, according to the data) and to optimise both the kernel parameters and SVM parameters by evolutionary means in a unified framework.

GANs have been widely studied since 2014, and a large number of algorithms have been proposed. However, there is few comprehensive study explaining the connections among different GANs variants, and how they have evolved. In this paper, we attempt to provide a review on various GANs methods from the perspectives of algorithms, theory, and applications. Firstly, the motivations, mathematical representations, and structure of most GANs algorithms are introduced in details. Furthermore, GANs have been combined with other machine learning algorithms for specific applications, such as semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning. This paper compares the commonalities and differences of these GANs methods. Secondly, theoretical issues related to GANs are investigated. Thirdly, typical applications of GANs in image processing and computer vision, natural language processing, music, speech and audio, medical field, and data science are illustrated. Finally, the future open research problems for GANs are pointed out.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2001.06937", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv",

Satellite derived pre- and post-fire differenced severity indices (\u2206FSI), such as the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (\u2206NBR), are widely used to map the severity of large wildfires. Fire severity classification is commonly undertaken through the identification of severity class thresholds in \u2206FSI. However, several shortcomings have been identified with severity classifications using \u2206FSI, including poor delineation of low fire severity classes, and unsatisfactory performance when \u2206FSI classification thresholds are applied to new landscapes. Our study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. We collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using \u2206NBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Results of the bootstrapping validation show that the RF classifier had very high classification accuracy (>95%) for unburnt (UB), crown scorch (CS) and crown consumption (CC) severity classes, and high classification accuracy (>74%) for low severity classes (crown unburnt, CU; partial crown scorch, PCS). The RF classification outperformed the \u2206NBR classification for all severity classes, increasing classification accuracy by between 6%\u201321%. Cross validation using independent fires produced similar median classification accuracy as the bootstrapping validation, though the RF classification of CU was substantially reduced to ~55%. \u2206NBR, \u2206NDWI and \u2206NDVI were the three most important variables in the RF model. The Landsat satellite platform used to derive the indices had little effect on classification accuracy. Maps produced using the RF classifier in GEE had similar spatial patterns in fire severity classes as maps produced using time-consuming hand digitisation of aerial images. GEE was found to be a highly efficient platform for image acquisition, processing and production of severity maps. Our study shows that fire severity mapping using RF classifiers provides a robust method for broad scale mapping of fire severity across heterogeneous landscapes. Furthermore, the GEE-based classification framework supports the operational application of this approach in a land management agency context for the rapid production of fire severity maps.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2018.07.005", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2884851559", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["214763847", "208224932", "210130671"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134209629"}

Different from the reported traffic sign detection techniques, a novel saliency estimation approach is first proposed, where a new saliency model is built based on the traffic sign-specific color, shape, and spatial information. By incorporating the saliency information, enhanced feature pyramids are built to learn an AdaBoost model that detects a set of traffic sign candidates from images. A novel iterative codeword selection algorithm is then designed to generate a discriminative codebook for the representation of sign candidates, as detected by the AdaBoost, and an SVR model is learned to identify the real traffic signs from the detected sign candidates.

An empirical study was performed on nine classifiers with twenty benchmark datasets. First, two groups of datasets (those with few variables and those with numerous variables) were prepared. Then we progressively increased the class imbalance of each dataset in each group by under-sampling both classes so that we could clarify to what extent the predictive power of each classifier was adversely affected. Kappa coefficient (kappa) was chosen as the performance metric, and nemenyi post hoc test was used to find significant differences between classifiers.

The results indicated that (1) Naive bayes, logistic regression and logit leaf model are less susceptible to class imbalance; (2) It was assumed that using datasets with balanced class distribution and sufficient instances would be the ideal condition to maximize the performance of classifiers; (3) Increasing the number of instances is more effective than using variables for improving the predictive performance of Random Forest.

Remote sensing has paved the way for periodic monitoring and conservation of such floristic resources, compared to labour intensive in-situ observations. With the laboratory quality image spectra obtained from hyperspectral image data, species level discrimination in habitats and ecosystems is attainable. One of the essential steps before classification of hyperspectral image data is band selection. It is important to eliminate the redundant bands to mitigate the problems of Hughes effect that are likely to affect further image analysis and classification accuracy. This paper presents a methodology for the selection of appropriate hyperspectral bands from the EO-1 Hyperion image for the identification and mapping of mangrove species and coastal landcover types in the Bhitarkanika coastal forest region, eastern India. Band selection procedure follows class based elimination procedure and the separability of the classes are tested in the band selection process. Individual bands are de-correlated and redundant bands are removed from the bandwise correlation matrix. The percent contribution of class variance in each band is analysed from the factors of PCA component ranking. Spectral bands are selected from the wavelength groups and statistically tested. Further, the band selection procedure is compared with similar techniques (Band Index and Mutual information) for validation. The number of bands in the Hyperion image was reduced from 196 to 88 by the Factor-based ranking approach. Classification was performed by Support Vector Machine approach. It is observed that the proposed Factor-based ranking approach performed well in discriminating the mangrove species and other landcover units compared to the other statistical approaches. The predominant mangrove species Heritiera fomes, Excoecaria agallocha and Cynometra ramiflora are spectral identified and the health status of these species are assessed by the selected band. Further, the performance of this band selection approaches are evaluated in multi-sensor image fusion for better mapping of mangrove ecosystems, wherein spatial resolution is enhanced while retaining the optimal number of hyperspectral bands.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2067483", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1971094728", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["36119878", "26493060", "121686639", "132233448", "128883461", "128422425", "1522015", "123148978", "252810", "129554031", "9993730", "53403983", "16410150", "128991716", "131116765", "11055443", "194951", "62612802"], "inbound_citations": ["207990869"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:128547427"}

While identifying and analyzing named entities in a given natural language is a challenging research problem by itself, the phenomenal growth in the Internet user population, especially among the non-English speaking parts of the world, has extended this problem to the crosslingual arena. This is the specific research focus for the Named Entities WorkShop (NEWS), being held as a part of ACL-IJCNLP 2009 conference. ::: ::: The purpose of the NEWS workshop is to bring together researchers across the world interested in identification, analysis, extraction, mining and transformation of named entities in monolingual or multilingual natural language text. Under such broad scope as above, many interesting specific research areas pertaining to the named entities are identified, such as, orthographic and phonetic characteristics, corpus analysis, unsupervised and supervised named entities extraction in monolingual or multilingual corpus, transliteration modelling, and evaluation methodologies, to name a few. 17 research papers were submitted, each of which was reviewed by at least 3 reviewers from the program committee. Finally, 9 papers were chosen for publication, covering main research areas, from named entities tagging and extraction, to computational phonology to machine transliteration of named entities. All accepted research papers are published in the workshop proceedings. ::: ::: An important part of the NEWS workshop is the shared task on Machine Transliteration of named entities. Machine transliteration is a vibrant research area as witnessed by increasing number of publications over the last decade in the Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing (ACL, EACL, NAACL, IJCNLP, COLING, HLT, EMNLP, etc.), and Information Retrieval (SIGIR, ECIR, AIRS, etc.) conferences, and primarily in languages that use non-Latin based scripts. However, in spite of its popularity, no meaningful comparison could be possible between the research approaches, as the publications tended to be on different language pairs and different datasets, and on a variety of different metrics. For the first time, we organize a shared task as part of the NEWS workshop to provide a common evaluation platform for benchmarking and calibration of transliteration technologies. ::: ::: We collected significantly large, hand-crafted parallel named entities corpora in 7 different languages from 6 language families, and made available as common dataset for the shared task. We defined 6 metrics that are language-independent, intuitive and computationally easy to compute. We published the details of the shared task and the training and development data six months ahead of the conference that attracted an overwhelming response from the research community. Totally 31 teams participated from around the world, including industry, government laboratories and academia. The approaches ranged from traditional unsupervised learning methods (such as, naive-Bayes, Phrasal SMT-based, Conditional Random Fields, etc.) to somewhat unique approaches (such as, sequence prediction models, to Minimum Description Length-based methods, etc.), combined with several model combinations for results re-ranking. While every team submitted standard runs that use only the data provided by the NEWS organizers, many teams also submitted non-standard runs where they were allowed to use any additional data or language specific modules. In total, about 190 task runs were submitted, covering most approaches comprehensively. A report of the shared task that summarizes all submissions and the original whitepaper are also included in the proceedings, and will be presented in the workshop. The participants in the shared task were asked to submit short system papers (4 pages each) describing their approach, and each of such papers was reviewed by at least two members of the program committee; 27 of them were finally are accepted to publish in the workshop proceedings. ::: ::: NEWS 2009 is the first workshop that specifically addresses comprehensively all research avenues concerned with named entities, to the best of our knowledge. Also, the transliteration shared task is the first of its kind, to calibrate such large number of systems using common metrics on common language-specific datasets in a comprehensive set of language pairs.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": "W09-3500", "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "NEWS@IJCNLP", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2242740303,2913810666", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["11529003"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:42742818"}

Few molecular prognostic markers for Wilms tumor are currently defined, though previous studies have linked allele loss on 1p or 16q, genomic gain of 1q, and overexpression from 1q with an increased risk of relapse. To identify specific patterns of gene expression that are predictive of relapse, we used high-density (30 k) cDNA microarrays to analyze RNA samples from 27 favorable histology Wilms tumors taken from primary nephrectomies at the time of initial diagnosis. Thirteen of these tumors relapsed within 2 years. Genes differentially expressed between the relapsing and nonrelapsing tumor classes were identified by statistical scoring (t test). These genes encode proteins with diverse molecular functions, including transcription factors, developmental regulators, apoptotic factors, and signaling molecules. Use of a support vector machine classifier, feature selection, and test evaluation using cross-validation led to identification of a generalizable expression signature, a small subset of genes whose expression potentially can be used to predict tumor outcome in new samples. Similar methods were used to identify genes that are differentially expressed between tumors with and without genomic 1q gain.

Most studies have used raw time series data or extracted features from process measurement data as input vectors for time series data pattern recognition.

Sentiment analysis techniques are widely applicable to both government and private sector problems. On the government side, textual sentiment analysis in blogs could help identify terrorists, terrorist supporters, and potential suicide victims. These techniques can also be used to influence people around the world, and to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Textual sentiment analysis can be used for market research, financial investments, and politics. ::: To support these kinds of applications on blogs, news, and other text messages, I developed and evaluated techniques to identify and rank transferable discriminative sentimental terms, and used them on other domains of interest to classify the author's sentiment about the topic of his writing. This is a four step process. The first step is to determine the sentimental orientation of terms and score their strength in a set of known domains using Delta IDF. The second step is to determine and score how well these terms should transfer to the target domain using my Domain Independence Verification Algorithm (DIVA). The third step is to create a weight vector for the target domain using the Delta IDF weights and the DIVA scores. The final step is to transform documents into term frequency weighted document vectors and then classify them using the result of their dot product with the target domain's weight vector. ::: Delta IDF works well because I designed it to correct certain problems with the existing best practice. Term frequency times inverse document frequency (TFIDF) is a very successful mainstream practice in the field of Information Retrieval (IR). It was designed to reduce the importance of common English words while simultaneously boosting the importance of context-specific words. It is effective at identifying topical words for a document, but it was not designed to identify discriminative vocabulary for specific classification tasks. Nevertheless, many sentiment analysis researchers still use TFIDF scores as their initial term frequency weights for machine learning algorithms. I designed Delta IDF to correct this mismatch between design goals. Classifying documents by their dot product with an in-domain Delta IDF weight vector produces statistically better results than using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). ::: DIVA is an effective technique for identifying and scoring terms that will transfer well to a target domain because it relies upon my newly developed concept of sentimental domain independence. Sentimental domain independence is the degree to which a term's sentimental bias remains unchanged in multiple domains. This definition is useful because it exposes a statistical or counting problem. Before this dissertation, researchers lacked a clear, concrete definition of domain independence, a measure of domain independence, and statistics about domain independence. This definition is an important part of my solution. While it is hard to determine what effects an increase or decrease in document level frequency counts will have on a given term's sentimental bias, it is much easier to determine if a term's sentimental bias will remain largely unchanged in the target domain if we can verify that it changes little in other domains. The definition, statistics, and algorithm for sentimental domain-independent terms are some of my major contributions to the field of domain adaptation and sentiment analysis. ::: My research made both algorithmic and theoretical contributions to the fields of domain adaptation and sentiment analysis. First, I provided algorithms to discover and weight discriminative classification task specific features within a domain. Second, I produced algorithms to score how well these features transfer to a new target domain. Third, I laid out a general theory for the kinds of information and the types of noise they produce in text classification problems. Fourth, I defined sentimental domain independence and statistically described it. This dissertation gives future readers a firm theoretical foundation and practical algorithms to build on top of for a wide array of identified classification problems and for future research in the field.

On the other hand, while some researches can synthesize compelling real-world images given a class label or caption, they cannot condition on arbitrary shapes or structures, which largely limits their application scenarios and interpretive capability of model results. In this work, we focus on a more challenging semantic manipulation task, aiming at modifying the semantic meaning of an object while preserving its own characteristics (e.g. viewpoints and shapes), such as cow\\(\\rightarrow \\)sheep, motor\\(\\rightarrow \\)bicycle, cat\\(\\rightarrow \\)dog. To tackle such large semantic changes, we introduce a contrasting GAN (contrast-GAN) with a novel adversarial contrasting objective which is able to perform all types of semantic translations with one category-conditional generator. Instead of directly making the synthesized samples close to target data as previous GANs did, our adversarial contrasting objective optimizes over the distance comparisons between samples, that is, enforcing the manipulated data be semantically closer to the real data with target category than the input data. Equipped with the new contrasting objective, a novel mask-conditional contrast-GAN architecture is proposed to enable disentangle image background with object semantic changes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on several semantic manipulation tasks on ImageNet and MSCOCO dataset show considerable performance gain by our contrast-GAN over other conditional GANs.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-01261-8_34", "venue": "ECCV", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2739540493", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3429309", "502946", "5767685", "206597351", "36011704", "84591", "6104263", "1033682", "1930231", "16818788", "6200260", "980236", "6628106", "6704804", "5916438", "8432557", "7886345", "3974866", "3568946", "14113767", "3783306", "10627900", "56507745", "2198869", "12803511", "2202933", "35563", "11758569", "1563370", "1515901", "1687220", "1925189", "206592766", "8229065", "5568914", "6793190", "7577075", "195347176", "1082740", "1277217", "14924561", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["202583281", "53757566", "168170189", "104292792", "209315529", "54447831", "209377041", "210839653", "53093005", "202639948", "153312731", "201058400"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52840724"}

The work in this paper is part of the methodology for monitoring the web that we currently develop for the French epidemic intelligence team in animal health. We focus on the new and exotic infectious animal diseases that occur worldwide and that are of potential threat to the animal health in France.In order to detect relevant information on the web, we present an innovative approach that retrieves documents using queries based on terms automatically extracted from a corpus of relevant documents and validated with a consensus of domain experts (Delphi method).

To categorise documents retrieved from the web we use Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.We evaluated our approach on documents on African swine fever (ASF) outbreaks for the period from 2011 to 2014, retrieved from the Google search engine and the PubMed database. From 2400 terms extracted from two corpora of relevant ASF documents, 135 terms were relevant to characterise ASF emergence. The domain experts identified as highly specific to characterise ASF emergence the terms which describe mortality, fever and haemorrhagic clinical signs in Suidae.The new ranking measure correctly ranked the ASF relevant terms until position 161 and fairly until position 227, with areas under ROC curves (AUCs) of 0.802 and 0.709 respectively.Both classifiers were accurate to classify a set of 545 ASF documents (NB of 0.747 and SVM of 0.725) into appropriate categories of relevant (disease outbreak) and irrelevant (economic and general) documents.Our results show that relevant documents can serve as a source of terms to detect infectious animal disease emergence on the web.Our method is generic and can be used both in animal and public health domain.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compag.2016.02.010", "venue": "Comput.

These improvements have shown promising results when the test data is similar to the training data. However, the trained models often fail to produce reliable distances on the ambiguous test pairs due to the distribution bias between training set and test set. To address this problem, the Adversarial Metric Learning (AML) is proposed in this paper, which automatically generates adversarial pairs to remedy the distribution bias and facilitate robust metric learning. Specifically, AML consists of two adversarial stages, i.e. confusion and distinguishment. In confusion stage, the ambiguous but critical adversarial data pairs are adaptively generated to mislead the learned metric. In distinguishment stage, a metric is exhaustively learned to try its best to distinguish both the adversarial pairs and the original training pairs. Thanks to the challenges posed by the confusion stage in such competing process, the AML model is able to grasp plentiful difficult knowledge that has not been contained by the original training pairs, so the discriminability of AML can be significantly improved. The entire model is formulated into optimization framework, of which the global convergence is theoretically proved. The experimental results on toy data and practical datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of AML to the representative state-of-the-art metric learning methodologies.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1802.03170", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.24963/ijcai.2018/279", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2787637945,2964172727,2952467951", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11507055", "56587969", "1217966", "19135671", "11478292", "331261", "47325215", "401761"], "inbound_citations": ["202786734", "211297681", "209405475", "199488287", "195510985"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3606040"}

In this paper we show how one can use string kernels to construct two alternatives to Parikh matrices, that overcome some of the limitations of the Parikh matrix construction.

In this paper, I present an extensive review on cloud computing with the main focus on gaps and security concerns. We identify the top security threats and their existing solutions. We also investigate the challenges/obstacles in implementing threat remediation. To address these issues, we propose a proactive threat detection model by adopting three main goals: (i) detect an attack when it happens, (ii) alert related parties (system admin, data owner) about the attack type and take combating action, and (iii) generate information on the type of attack by analysing the pattern (even if the cloud provider attempts subsection). To emphasize the importance of monitoring cyber-attacks we provide a brief overview of existing literature on cloud computing security. Then I generate some real cyber-attacks that can be detected from performance data in a hypervisor and its guest operating systems. I employ modern machine learning techniques as the core of our model and accumulate a large database by considering the top threats. A variety of model performance measurement tools are applied to verify the model attack prediction capability. I observed that the Support Vector Machine technique from statistical machine learning theory is able to identify the top attacks with an accuracy of 97.13%. I have detected the activities using performance data (CPU, disk, network and memory performance) from the hypervisor and its guest operating systems, which can be generated by any cloud customer using built-in or third party software.

The effect of the different predictors on the response variables was assessed with partial dependence plots and partial correlation analysis. Results indicated that land-uses were important predictors in defining the spatial and seasonal patterns of these three variables. Water temperature was positively related with air temperature and the upstream drainage area, whereas increases in forest cover decreased water temperature. Nitrate concentration was mainly related to the area covered by agricultural land-uses, increasing in winter, probably because of catchment run-off processes. On the other hand, phosphate concentration was highly related to the area covered by urban land-uses in the upstream catchment and to the proximity of the closest upstream effluent. Phosphate concentration increased notably during the low flow period (summer), probably due to the reduction of the dilution capacity.

First, a least square version of Nonparallel Hyperplane Support Vector Machine (NHSVM) is developed for binary classification problems. Solution of the primal problem corresponding to the proposed NHSVM reduces to a system of linear equations as opposed to a quadratic programming problem in NHSVM. This formulation results in a much simpler and faster approach for constructing a nonparallel hyperplane binary classifier, termed as Least Squares Nonparallel Hyperplane Support Vector Machine (LSNHSVM). Further, LSNHSVM is generalized to solve multi- category classification problems. This multi-class classifier is the named as Multicategory Least Squares Nonparallel Hyperplane Support Vector Machine (MLSNHSVM). Unlike most of the previous methods that usually cast a multi-category classification problem into a series of multiple independent binary classification problem, MLSNHSVM constructs a direct multi-category classifier by solving a system of linear equations. The proposed MLSNHSVM is in close accordance with the principle of solving multi-category problems directly .

Due to the small sample problem, statistical methods and intelligent machine learning methods have been unable to obtain a convergent gene set when prioritizing biomarkers. Furthermore, mathematical models designed for prioritizing biomarkers perform differently on different datasets. However, the architecture of the generative adversarial network (GAN) can address this bottleneck problem. Through the game between the generator and the discriminator, samples with similar distributions to that of samples in the training set can be generated by the generator, and the prediction accuracy and robustness of the discriminator could be significantly improved. Therefore, in this study, we designed a new generative adversarial network model with a denoising auto-encoder (DAE) as the generator and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the discriminator. The prediction residual error was backpropagated to the decoder part of the DAE, modifying the captured probability distribution.

During speech production, the vocal tract is closed for voiced bars and open for low vowels. For high vowels, semivowels, laterals, voiced fricatives and other sounds the vocal tract is in the intermediate position of the closed and open cases. Music signal, in particular the instrumental and non-vocal music, is produced in a completely different manner compared to speech and varies according to different instruments. The differences in the production of speech and music is exploited in this work for deriving a vocal tract constriction feature which is purely based on the concept of speech production and the behavior of this feature is expected to be different in the music regions thus achieving a kind of discrimination between speech and music. This feature called the Vocal Tract Constriction (VTC) feature is classified initially using a threshold based approach and also using classifiers like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The effectiveness of this feature is tested either individually or in combination with other existing state of the art features for the speech / music classification task, where it is observed that when this feature is used in combination with the existing features, an additional improvement is obtained.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/INDICON.2015.7443365", "venue": "2015 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)", "journal": "2015 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2547319470", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["951613", "9369146", "38451527", "14557009", "12331395", "10020925", "5327591", "15165424", "18721591", "11500746", "36549010"], "inbound_citations": ["53220009"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26226413"}

Previous studies heuristically fixed the number of negative examples used based on available development data for performance evaluation; nevertheless, in real applications this does not guarantee sustained performance for unseen data, as will be shown. In the proposed model selection framework, a novel ranking method is first exploited to rank order the negative examples for selecting a set of background datasets with various population sizes. Next, an error estimation and model-selection criterion are proposed and employed to select the most suitable target model among the model candidates. The experimental validation, conducted on the NIST SRE-2008 and SRE-2010 data, demonstrates that the proposed background data selection slightly but consistently outperforms the fixed-size background data selection, and achieves a relative improvement of +6 % over the non-selection background framework in terms of minDCF.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10772-013-9219-z", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Speech Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1984164833", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["194951", "10080746", "207163577", "41754", "1753032", "52869628", "59824026", "207605508", "8648451", "12431511", "8297996", "9760419", "1871891"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5604223"}

As deep learning is mastering computer vision tasks, its application to digital pathology is natural, with the promise of aiding in routine reporting and standardizing results across trials. Deep learning features inferred from digital pathology scans can improve validity and robustness of current clinico-pathological features, up to identifying novel histological patterns, e.g. from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In this study, we examine the issue of evaluating accuracy of predictive models from deep learning features in digital pathology, as an hallmark of reproducibility. We introduce the DAPPER framework for validation based on a rigorous Data Analysis Plan derived from the FDA\u2019s MAQC project, designed to analyse causes of variability in predictive biomarkers. We apply the framework on models that identify tissue of origin on 787 Whole Slide Images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We test 3 different deep learning architectures (VGG, ResNet, Inception) as feature extractors and three classifiers (a fully connected multilayer, Support Vector Machine and Random Forests) and work with 4 datasets (5, 10, 20 or 30 classes), for a total 53000 tiles at 512 \u00d7 512 resolution. We analyze accuracy and feature stability of the machine learning classifiers, also demonstrating the need for random features and random labels diagnostic tests to identify selection bias and risks for reproducibility. Further, we use the deep features from the VGG model from GTEx on the KIMIA24 dataset for identification of slide of origin (24 classes) to train a classifier on 1060 annotated tiles and validated on 265 unseen ones.

The feature spaces of the source and target domains are completely different, thus the source data cannot be used directly to assist the learning task in the target domain. To address this issue, we take advantage of unlabeled co-occurrence instances as intermediate supplementary data to connect the source and target domains, and perform knowledge transition from the source domain into the target domain. We propose a novel online heterogeneous transfer learning algorithm called Online Heterogeneous Knowledge Transition (OHKT) for this purpose. In OHKT, we first seek to generate pseudo labels for the co-occurrence data based on the labeled source data, and then develop an online learning algorithm to classify the target sequence by leveraging the co-occurrence data with pseudo labels.

Within current computational models of word recognition, there are a number of different approaches to the representation of lexical knowledge. Structural lexical representations, found in original theories of word recognition, have been instantiated in modern localist models. However, such a representational scheme lacks neural plausibility in terms of economy and flexibility. Connectionist models have therefore adopted distributed representations of form and meaning. Semantic representations in connectionist models necessarily encode lexical knowledge. Yet when equipped with recurrent connections, connectionist models can also develop attractors for familiar forms that function as lexical representations. Current behavioural, neuropsychological and neuroimaging evidence shows a clear role for semantic information, but also suggests some modality- and task-specific lexical representations. A variety of connectionist architectures could implement these distributed functional representations, and further experimental and simulation work is required to discriminate between these alternatives. Future conceptualisations of lexical representations will therefore emerge from a synergy between modelling and neuroscience.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4396497", "pubmed_id": "25893204", "doi": "10.1080/23273798.2015.1005637", "venue": "Language, cognition and neuroscience", "journal": "Language, cognition and neuroscience", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2049526469", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["54337217", "144742042", "144729262", "19498751", "16583417", "24076165", "6958314", "53182457", "563079", "3663090", "13166008", "41394630", "24913927", "24273935", "5587008", "2731330", "15469315", "9458203", "17573184", "12175555", "29284758", "14030641", "145304308", "144647753", "7285729", "14340223", "16230349", "33566241", "18602349", "147308", "10301716", "3712075", "11840997", "17367093", "19010004", "144275111", "408750", "6041633", "146248822", "143835900", "2447015", "1632597", "60718488", "7099792", "152230066", "29439337", "32663038", "51772446", "283793", "197651520", "7428866", "144497014", "18040273", "16855570", "121656606", "5810367", "17703056", "18095758", "22049544", "145372829", "17740763", "14614026", "3083444", "14769856", "14448198", "160997", "12338547", "557347", "143537260", "14140266", "2612172", "29783028", "11809903", "1349064", "37773892", "144738637", "30165868", "23541690", "7623123", "318732", "2927773", "41089024", "210791166", "6046421", "42968418", "3337047", "13120538", "14026787", "8870165", "2361742", "15187242", "13628480", "144551134", "2303940", "25925565", "27374612", "24242150", "11206801", "14087428", "24432496", "6342913", "15892341"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13348553"}

In this article, we propose a novel deep feature learning paradigm based on social collective intelligence, which can be acquired from the inexhaustible social multimedia content on the Web, in particular, largely social images and tags. Differing from existing feature learning approaches that rely on high-quality image-label supervision, our weak supervision is acquired by mining the visual-semantic embeddings from noisy, sparse, and diverse social image collections. The resultant image-word embedding space can be used to (1) fine-tune deep visual models for low-level feature extractions and (2) seek sparse representations as high-level cross-modal features for both image and text. We offer an easy-to-use implementation for the proposed paradigm, which is fast and compatible with any state-of-the-art deep architectures.

However, the real-world datasets are extremely sparse and most rating-based algorithms are still suffering from the data sparsity problem. Along with integer-valued ratings, we consider that the user-generated review is also an important user feedback. Furthermore, compared with the traditional recommendation algorithms which have the limited ability to learn the distributions of ratings and reviews simultaneously, the generative adversarial networks can learn better representations for data. In this paper, we propose Rating and Review Generative Adversarial Networks (RRGAN), an innovative framework for recommendation, in which the generative model and discriminative model play a minimax game. Specifically, the generative model predicts the ratings of top-N list for users or items based on reviews, while the discriminative model aims to distinguish the predicted ratings from real ratings. With the competition between these two models, RRGAN improves the ability of understanding users and items based on ratings and reviews. We introduce the user profiles, item representations and ratings into a matrix factorization model to predict the top-N list for the users. In addition, we study three different architectures to learn reasonable user profiles and item representations based on ratings and reviews to achieve better recommendations. To evaluate the performance of our model, we conduct the extensive experiments on three real-world amazon datasets in three parts, which are top-N recommendation analysis, case study and long-tail users analysis.

When blending, the problem of local color inconsistency is more challenging; thus, it often requires manual tuning to avoid image artifacts. To address this problem, we present an adaptive coarse-to-fine searching approach to find the optimal fusion weights. In the coarse-tuning stage, fuzzy logic is used to efficiently decide the initial weights. In the fine-tuning stage, the multivariate normal conditional random field model is used to adjust the fuzzy-based initial weights which allows us to consider both intra- and inter-image information in the data.

Based on the fault section identified, rapid and corrective restoration procedures can thus be taken to minimize the power interruption and limit the impact of outage on the system. The approach is particularly important for post-fault diagnosis of any mal-operation of relays following a disturbance in the neighboring line connected to the same substation.

This paper presents a multibiometric system that integrates the iris and face features based on the fusion at the feature level. The proposed multibiometric system has three novelties as compared to the previous works. First, distance regularized level-set evolution (DRLSE) technique is utilized to localize the iris and pupil boundary from an iris image. The DRLSE maintains the regularity of the level set function intrinsically during the curve evolution process and increases the numerical accuracy substantially. The proposed iris localization scheme is robust against poor localization and weak iris/sclera boundaries. Second, a modified local binary pattern (MLBP), which combines both the sign and magnitude features for the improvement of recognition performance, is applied. Third, to select the optimal subset of features from the fused feature vector, a feature subset selection scheme based on random forest (RF) is proposed. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, the facial images of Yale Extended B Face database are fused with the iris images of CASIA V4 interval dataset to construct an iris\u2013face multimodal biometric dataset.

The other two stages have been used to improve the wind power forecast value obtained at the end of the first stage. In the second stage, the forecast values found in the first stage have been applied to the same forecast methods, and wind power forecast value has been updated. In the third stage, a correction process is applied, and the final forecast value is obtained. While four-year data are selected as train data, two-year data are tested. SWD-ANFIS has given the best results in the first stage while ANN has given the best result in the second stage. Finally, the ensemble result has been found by taking the weighted average of the results of the three methods. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values found at each stage are the 0.333, 0.294 and 0.278, respectively. The obtained results have been compared with literature studies.

However, contextual information is critical to the correct prediction of intents and slots in a conversation.

CASA-NLU outperforms a recurrent contextual NLU baseline on two conversational datasets, yielding a gain of up to 7% on the IC task for one of the datasets.

However, the high-dimensional space of this imagery poses two important challenges in the classification process: the Hughes phenomena and the existence of relevant and redundant features. The robustness of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in high-dimensional space makes them an efficient tool for classifying hyperspectral imagery. However, optimum SVM parameter determination and optimum feature selection are the two optimization issues that strongly effect SVM performance. Traditional optimization algorithms can discover optimum solutions in a limited search space with one local optimum. Nevertheless, in high-dimensional space traditional optimization algorithms usually get trapped in a local optimum, therefore it is necessary to apply meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to obtain near-global optimum solutions.

A changing context can induce changes in the target concepts, producing what is known as concept drift. We describe a family of learning algorithms that flexibly react to concept drift and can take advantage of situations where contexts reappear. The general approach underlying all these algorithms consists of (1) keeping only a window of currently trusted examples and hypotheses; (2) storing concept descriptions and re-using them when a previous context re-appears; and (3) controlling both of these functions by a heuristic that constantly monitors the system's behavior. The paper reports on experiments that test the systems' performance under various conditions such as different levels of noise and different extent and rate of concept drift.", "year": 2005,

An important cue toward determining social interactions is the head pose of interacting members. While most automated social interaction analysis methods have focused on round-table meetings where head pose estimation (HPE) is easier given the high resolution of captured faces and the analyzed targets are static (seated), recent works have examined unstructured meeting scenes such as cocktail parties. While unstructured meeting scenes, where targets are free to move, provide additional cues such as proxemics for behavior analysis, they are also challenging to analyze owing to (i) the need to use distant, large field-of-view cameras which can only capture low-resolution faces of targets, and (ii) the variations in targets' facial appearance as they move, owing to changing camera perspective and scale. This chapter reviews recent works addressing HPE under target motion. In particular, we examine the use of transfer learning and multitask learning for HPE. Transfer learning is particularly useful when the training and the test data have different attributes (e.g., training data contains pose annotations for static targets, but test data involves moving targets), while multitask learning can be explicitly designed to address facial appearance variations under motion. Exhaustive experiments performed using both methodologies are presented.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-12-809276-7.00005-9", "venue": "Group and Crowd Behavior for Computer Vision", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2606796047", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21721348"}

This paper presents a comparative analysis among meta-learning approaches and individual classifiers to classify network traffic.

To address these problems, the proposed MS-GAN combines a multiscale convolutional neural network (generator) and an adversarial network (discriminator) to generate a high-quality density map and accurately estimate the crowd count in complex crowd scenes. The multiscale generator utilizes the fusion features from multiple hierarchical layers to detect people with large-scale variation.

Information was examined at the beginning of the study (first event), three months later (second event), and six months later (third event). Sarcopenia is defined as the loss of muscle mass quality and strength. The study was conducted with 166 patients. A total of 65% were women and 35% were men. The mean age of the enrolled patients was 77.24 years. The research included 99 variables that consider medical history, pharmacology, psychological tests, comorbidity (Charlson), functional capacity (Barthel and Lawton), undernourishment (mini nutritional assessment (MNA) validated test), as well as biochemical and socio-demographic data. Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of the level of sarcopenia in a population of chronically ill patients assessed at the Tijuana General Hospital. We used machine learning techniques to assess and identify the determining variables to focus on the patients' evolution. The following classifiers were used: Support Vector Machines, Linear Support Vector Machines, Radial Basis Function, Gaussian process, Decision Tree, Random Forest, multilayer perceptron, AdaBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. In order of importance, we found that the following variables determine the level of sarcopenia: Age, Systolic arterial hypertension, mini nutritional assessment (MNA), Number of chronic diseases, and Sodium. They are therefore considered relevant in the decision-making process of choosing treatment or prevention. Analysis of the relationship between the presence of the variables and the classifiers used to measure sarcopenia revealed that the Decision Tree classifier, with the Age, Systolic arterial hypertension, MNA, Number of chronic diseases, and Sodium variables, showed a precision of 0.864, accuracy of 0.831, and an F1 score of 0.900 in the first and second events. Precision of 0.867, accuracy of 0.825, and an F1 score of 0.867 were obtained in event three with the same variables. We can therefore conclude that the Decision Tree classifier yields the best results for the assessment of the determining variables and suggests that the study population's sarcopenia did not change from moderate to severe.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7143671", "pubmed_id": "32183494", "doi": "10.3390/ijerph17061917", "venue": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "journal": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "mag_id": "3011019387", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212751219"}

To date, many attempts have been made to reveal the underlying mechanisms of humans\u2019 gait. However, decoding cortical processes associated with different walking conditions using EEG signals for gait-pattern classification is a less-explored research area. In this paper, we design an EEG-based experiment with four walking conditions (i.e., free walking, and exoskeleton-assisted walking at zero, low, and high assistive forces by the use of a unilateral exoskeleton to right lower limb). We proposed spatio-spectral representation learning (SSRL), a deep neural network topology with shared weights to learn the spatial and spectral representations of multi-channel EEG signals during walking. Adoption of weight sharing reduces the number of free parameters, while learning spatial and spectral equivariant features. SSRL outperformed state-of-the-art methods in decoding gait patterns, achieving a classification accuracy of 77.8%.

Most appearance-based head pose estimation works typically extract the low-dimensional face appearance features in some statistic subspaces, where the subspaces represent the underlying geometry structure of the pose space. However, there is an open problem, namely, how to effectively represent appearance-based subspace face for the head pose estimation problem. To address the problem, this paper proposes a head pose estimation approach based on the Lie Algebrized Gaussians (LAG) feature to model the pose characteristic. LAG is built on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), which actually not only models the distribution of local appearance features, but also captures the Lie group manifold structure of the feature space. Moreover, to keep multi-resolution structure information, LAG is operated on many subregions of the image. As a result, these properties of LAG enable it to effectively model the structure of subspace face which can lead to powerful discriminative ability for head pose estimation. After representing subspace face using the LAG, we treat the head pose estimation as a classification problem. The within-class covariance normalization (WCCN) based Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is employed to achieve robust performance as WCCN could reduce the within-class variabilities of the same pose.

Attempts to improve robot control systems through a better understanding of animal motor control systems have been defeated by the complexity of the structure of animal control systems. We suggest that difficulties with current models of animal motor control systems are due to the lumped nature of most current approaches and the little isomorphism between model and anatomy. We propose the use of connectionist modeling, a highly parallel, distributed computational framework, to model the fine structure of animal motor control systems. ::: Connectionist techniques have been used in the recent past to model several intelligent processes. These processes have all been Recognition Processes that do not require continuous interaction with a changing environment. There have been no previous connectionist models of Control Processes that require the system to interact continuously with its environment. ::: The primary objective of this research is to examine the effectiveness of connectionist modeling as a framework for simulating neural control processes. We wish to see if connectionist simulations of neural control systems give us computational insights that are difficult to derive from conventional models. A secondary objective to this research is to see if connectionist models of neural motor control systems lead to connectionist controllers for robot systems. ::: In order to so examine the utility of connectionist modeling, we build a model of a part of the Oculomotor (OM) system of the primate. The purpose of the exercise is to see if the connectionist model of the OM system is useful to those wishing to understand the fine structure of the OM system. ::: The connectionist model is successful in that it closely approximates animal behaviour in a wide variety of situations. The model makes specific predictions about the fine structure of the OM system. For example, the model shows how neurons might be interconnected to produce the extended time constant behaviour of the Vestibuloocular Reflex (VOR) and the Optokinetic (OKS) subsystems of the OM system. The model also shows how neurons might be connected to generate the correct interactions between the VOR and pursuit subsystems of the OM system. The model points out anomalies in the gain behaviour of the OM system and also shows neural interconnections that might lead to the adaptive behaviour of the VOR and OKS. ::: The study of the OM system leads to the concept of channel structured control systems in which several identical control systems act in parallel, each computing a small part of the total dynamic range, to effect the final behaviour. . . .

In a broader perspective, the techniques used to investigate common representation learning falls under the categories of canonical correlation-based approaches and autoencoder based approaches. In this paper, we investigate the performance of deep autoencoder based methods on multi-view data. We propose a novel step-based correlation multi-modal CNN (CorrMCNN) which reconstructs one view of the data given the other while increasing the interaction between the representations at each hidden layer or every intermediate step. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed model on two benchmark datasets - MNIST and XRMB.

It has been observed that the degree of connectivity among voxels provide important information for modeling cognitive activities. Moreover, spatially close voxels act together to generate similar BOLD responses to the same stimuli. In this study, we propose a local mesh model, called Local Mesh Model with Temporal Measurements (LMM-TM), to first estimate spatial relationship among a set of voxels using spatial and temporal data measured at each voxel, and then employ the relationship for the construction of a connectivity model for brain decoding. For this purpose, we first construct a local mesh around each voxel (called seed voxel) by connecting it to its spatially nearest neighbors. Then, we represent the BOLD response of each seed voxel in terms of linear combination of the BOLD responses of its p-nearest neighbors. The relationship between a seed voxel and its neighbors is estimated by solving a linear regression problem. The estimated mesh arc weights are used to model local connectivity among the voxels that reside in a spatial neighborhood. Using these weights as features, we train Support Vector Machines and k-Nearest Neighbor classifiers. We test our model on a visual object recognition experiment. In the experimental analysis, we observe that classifiers that employ our features perform better than classifiers that employ raw voxel intensity values, local mesh model weights and features extracted using distance metrics such as Euclidean distance, cosine similarity and Pearson correlation.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/PRNI.2015.26", "venue": "2015 International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in NeuroImaging", "journal": "2015 International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in NeuroImaging", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1498593709", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4277928", "1909790", "10675761", "17638165", "122956", "17010318", "7614243", "3251762", "12999010", "15957330", "7063378", "14280098", "1260521", "141035126", "43895463"], "inbound_citations": ["37430069", "35373232", "52965221", "21023929", "10657444", "8978836", "15563114", "44065199", "49902132", "18260665", "9166261", "14887752", "4028095"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7542583"}

In this paper, we aim to learn a single universal human parsing model that can tackle all kinds of human parsing needs by unifying label annotations from different domains or at various levels of granularity. This poses many fundamental learning challenges, e.g. discovering underlying semantic structures among different label granularity, performing proper transfer learning across different image domains, and identifying and utilizing label redundancies across related tasks. ::: To address these challenges, we propose a new universal human parsing agent, named \"Graphonomy\", which incorporates hierarchical graph transfer learning upon the conventional parsing network to encode the underlying label semantic structures and propagate relevant semantic information. In particular, Graphonomy first learns and propagates compact high-level graph representation among the labels within one dataset via Intra-Graph Reasoning, and then transfers semantic information across multiple datasets via Inter-Graph Transfer. Various graph transfer dependencies (\\eg, similarity, linguistic knowledge) between different datasets are analyzed and encoded to enhance graph transfer capability. By distilling universal semantic graph representation to each specific task, Graphonomy is able to predict all levels of parsing labels in one system without piling up the complexity. Experimental results show Graphonomy effectively achieves the state-of-the-art results on three human parsing benchmarks as well as advantageous universal human parsing performance.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1904.04536", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2019.00763", "venue": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2937863878,2964072977", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52399382", "3429309", "3638670", "1700940", "4408847", "2256682", "2375110", "8510667", "11304066", "4246903", "21679317", "51895124", "9324149", "206594692", "14260314", "4308965", "3144218", "8168187", "1816336", "13116458", "4689189", "6361694", "7886345", "8543144", "11618478", "5696978", "40027675", "1957433", "4703853", "2524528", "50781105", "17127188"], "inbound_citations": ["212645805", "204798762", "208310042", "198985893", "211003921", "214728128", "211837354", "209439536"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:104292104"}

An important dimension of event detection is location estimation for detected events. Social media provides a variety of clues for location, such as geographical annotation from smart devices, location field in the user profileand the content of the message. Among these clues, message content needs more effort for processing, yet it is generally more informative. In this paper, we focus on extraction of location names, i.e., toponym recognition, from social media messages. We propose a a hybrid system, which uses both rule based and machine learning based techniques to extract toponymsfrom tweets.

One of the simplest ways to reduce energy usage is by making current buildings less wasteful. By improving energy efficiency, this method of lowering our carbon footprint is particularly worthwhile because it reduces energy costs of operating the building, unlike many environmental initiatives that require large monetary investments. In order to improve the efficiency of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system of a Manhattan skyscraper, 345 Park Avenue, a predictive computer model was designed to forecast the amount of energy the building will consume. This model uses Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR), a method that builds a regression based purely on historical data of the building, requiring no knowledge of its size, heating and cooling methods, or any other physical properties. SVMR employs time-delay coordinates as a representation of the past to create the feature vectors for SVM training. This pure dependence on historical data makes the model very easily applicable to different types of buildings with few model adjustments. The SVM regression model was built to predict a week of future energy usage based on past energy, temperature, and dew point temperature data.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.7916/D85D90X7", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1558927261", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["58028766", "16081078", "53617143", "202785771", "13274391", "169860238", "18845811"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14223746"}

Mainstream hashing methods adopt a two-stage hashing framework to realize hashing learning. That is, obtain low dimensional embedding and encode binary codes respectively.

Hence, we propose a local topology preserving hashing (LTPH) method to reduce the dimensional reduction error and binary encoding loss simultaneously. To clearly reveal the original data structure, Local Topology Preserving Embedding (LTPE) algorithm is proposed in this paper.

In this paper, in order to make full use of the input fraction image and alleviate the effect of fraction errors, a sub-pixel mapping algorithm based on conditional random fields (CRFSM) is proposed for hyperspectral remote sensing imagery.

The local spatial prior models the local spatial structure to obtain the local land-cover features at the fine scale. The downscaled coarse fraction considers the fraction values to maintain the holistic land-cover features at the coarse scale. In addition, the abundance constraint is considered as a soft constraint by the probability class determination strategy in the CRFSM algorithm, to help with the class label determination of sub-pixels and alleviate the effect of the fraction errors and noise.

Financial institutions are the front line in the war against financial crime and accordingly, must devote substantial human and technology resources to this effort. Current processes to detect financial misconduct have limitations in their ability to effectively differentiate between malicious behavior and ordinary financial activity. These limitations tend to result in gross over-reporting of suspicious activity that necessitate time-intensive and costly manual review. Advances in technology used in this domain, including machine learning based approaches, can improve upon the effectiveness of financial institutions' existing processes, however, a key challenge that most financial institutions continue to face is that they address financial crimes in isolation without any insight from other firms. Where financial institutions address financial crimes through the lens of their own firm, perpetrators may devise sophisticated strategies that may span across institutions and geographies. Financial institutions continue to work relentlessly to advance their capabilities, forming partnerships across institutions to share insights, patterns and capabilities. These public-private partnerships are subject to stringent regulatory and data privacy requirements, thereby making it difficult to rely on traditional technology solutions. In this paper, we propose a methodology to share key information across institutions by using a federated graph learning platform that enables us to build more accurate machine learning models by leveraging federated learning and also graph learning approaches.

A total of 4,202,974 units of variables (student behaviours and MOOC features) were analysed using Semi-Supervised Extreme Learning Machine (SSELM) and Global Sensitivity Analysis. In this study, the use of SSELM was compared to the state-of-art models (e.g. ELM, KELM, OP-ELM, PCA-ELM), and SSELM yielded 97.24% accuracy.

In analyzing and detecting vocal fatigue, we focused our investigations on three main experiments: a prosodic analysis that can be compared to the results found in related work, a two-class Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier into Fatigue and Non-Fatigue states using a large set of audio features and a comparison function that estimates the difference in fatigue level between two speech segments using a combination of multiple phoneme-based comparison functions. The experiments on prosodic analysis showed that vocal fatigue was not associated with an increase in fundamental frequency and voice intensity. A two-class SVM classifier using the Paralinguistic Challenge 2010 audio feature set gave an unweighted accuracy of 94.1% for the training set (10-fold cross-validation) and 68.2% for the test set. These results show that the phenomenon of vocal fatigue can be modeled and detected. The comparison function was assessed by detecting increased fatigue levels between two speech segments. The fatigue level detection performance in Equal Error Rate (EER) was 31% using all phonetic segments and yielded EER of 21% after filtering phonetic segments and 19% after filtering phonetic segments and cepstral features.

The proposed algorithms are validated with real time remote sensing satellite image datasets. The CSCA was first tested with benchmark dataset, which yields good results. Inspired by the results, it was applied on two real time remote sensing satellite image datasets for extraction of the water body, which itself is a quite complex problem. A new method for the generation of new cuckoos has been proposed, which is used in the algorithms. The resulting algorithm is conceptually simpler, takes less parameter than other nature inspired algorithms, and, after some parameter tuning, yields very good results. The extended algorithm BCSCA is also tested on the same satellite image for identifying different land covers by classifying the image in various classes. The algorithm was successful in classifying other land cover regions like rocky, barren, urban and vegetation. We strongly feel that results can be further improved by finer tuning of the parameters. Both the algorithms use Davies-Bouldin index DBI as fitness function.

Manual assessment of the corresponding parameters of human sperm morphology is a time-consuming, reader subjective and error-prone process. Therefore, developing the automatic methods is necessary to achieve the more accurate diagnosis. In this paper, we presented a learning-based framework for the automatic segmentation of the human sperm head particles, i.e., Acrosome and Nucleus. First, the homomorphic filtering is employed to correct uneven illumination and highlight each sperm from the background of an image. In the second step, sperm's heads are segmented using an introduced deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, a filling holes operation and geometric constraints are utilized to improve head segments. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify each pixel of segmented heads to nucleus and acrosome regions. Finally, segmented acrosomes and nucleus are modified using opening and closing operations followed by isolated objects removing. The proposed method is validated on the expert delineated dataset with 20 images of human semen smears and obtains 0.94, 0.87, and 0.88 of Dice Similarity Coefficient for the head, the acrosome, and the nucleus segments, respectively.

The current state-of-art methods applied in time-series classification rely on detecting similar instances through neighboring algorithms. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a similarity measure that can identify the similarity of two time-series, through the computation of the optimal warping alignment of time point pairs, therefore DTW is immune towards patterns shifted in time or distorted in size/shape. Unfortunately the classification time complexity of computing the DTW distance of two series is quadratic, subsequently DTW based nearest neighbor classification deteriorates to quartic order of time complexity per test set. The high time complexity order causes the classification of long time series to be practically infeasible. In this study we propose a fast linear classification complexity method. Our method projects the original data to a reduced latent dimensionality using matrix factorization, while the factorization is learned efficiently via stochastic gradient descent with fast convergence rates and early stopping. The latent data dimensionality is set to be as low as the cardinality of the label variable. Finally, Support Vector Machines with polynomial kernels are applied to classify the reduced dimensionality data.

A disk failure could lead to serious data loss and thus system unavailability or even catastrophic consequences if the lost data cannot be recovered. While replication and erasure coding techniques have been widely deployed to guarantee storage availability and reliability, disk failure prediction is gaining popularity as it has the potential to prevent disk failures from occurring in the first place. Recent trends have turned toward applying machine learning approaches based on disk SMART attributes for disk failure predictions. However, traditional machine learning (ML) approaches require a large set of training data in order to deliver good predictive performance. In large-scale storage systems, new disks enter gradually to augment the storage capacity or to replace failed disks, leading storage systems to consist of small amounts of new disks from different vendors and/or different models from the same vendor as time goes on. We refer to this relatively small amount of disks as minority disks. Due to the lack of sufficient training data, traditional ML approaches fail to deliver satisfactory predictive performance in evolving storage systems which consist of heterogeneous minority disks. To address this challenge and improve the predictive performance for minority disks in large data centers, we propose a minority disk failure prediction model named TLDFP based on a transfer learning approach. Our evaluation results on two realistic datasets have demonstrated that TLDFP can deliver much more precise results, compared to four popular prediction models based on traditional ML algorithms and two state-of-the-art transfer learning methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3337821.3337881", "venue": "ICPP 2019", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2962735633", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198963354"}

A double-loop Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm has been introduced to the ME architecture for adjusting the parameters and the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm is used to perform maximization in the inner loop [Jordan, M.I., Jacobs, R.A. (1994). Hierarchical mixture of experts and the EM algorithm, Neural Computation, 6(2), 181-214]. However, it is reported in literature that the IRLS algorithm is of instability and the ME architecture trained by the EM algorithm, where IRLS algorithm is used in the inner loop, often produces the poor performance in multiclass classification. In this paper, the reason of this instability is explored. We find out that due to an implicitly imposed incorrect assumption on parameter independence in multiclass classification, an incomplete Hessian matrix is used in that IRLS algorithm. Based on this finding, we apply the Newton-Raphson method to the inner loop of the EM algorithm in the case of multiclass classification, where the exact Hessian matrix is adopted. To tackle the expensive computation of the Hessian matrix and its inverse, we propose an approximation to the Newton-Raphson algorithm based on a so-called generalized Bernoulli density. The Newton-Raphson algorithm and its approximation have been applied to synthetic data, benchmark, and real-world multiclass classification tasks. For comparison, the IRLS algorithm and a quasi-Newton algorithm called BFGS have also been applied to the same tasks. Simulation results have shown that the use of the proposed learning algorithms avoids the instability problem and makes the ME architecture produce good performance in multiclass classification. In particular, our approximation algorithm leads to fast learning. In addition, the limitation of our approximation algorithm is also empirically investigated in this paper.", "year": 1999, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "12662629", "doi": "10.1016/S0893-6080(99)00043-X", "venue": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "journal": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2083291282", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["59651615", "16430409", "117794930", "60993494", "59636530", "53666480", "1602082", "59656256", "20201029", "17055297", "4193919", "62730865", "122301549", "123487779", "21267583", "790344", "20913544", "59099297", "16982933", "18902765", "59823170", "59905714", "13151580", "56584974", "207714252", "60565534", "14298205", "3182057", "465165"], "inbound_citations": ["12262408", "6827776", "1814201", "13993656", "12886691", "11423091", "53785919", "174800680", "6709034", "16236833", "15381679", "9877808", "49563917", "18332038", "14901675", "15901419", "10424719", "14648904", "9434264", "13987342", "42059707", "7296115", "15289343", "733320", "12624760", "54900236", "3185688", "4658546", "207117855", "12136471", "47124965", "20540091", "2728335", "1182989", "201689235", "484417", "203588544", "13234192", "17686415", "15076580", "14167210", "49301452", "15005627", "195069433", "202124712", "10483211", "11393566", "24277177", "3892129", "15347639", "29939550", "28244022", "16664813", "3171144", "9922492", "24254694", "12317090"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6083596"}

Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the posterior segment eye disease affecting elderly people and may lead to loss of vision. AMD is diagnosed using clinical features like drusen, Geographic Atrophy (GA) and Choroidal NeoVascularization (CNV) present in the fundus image. It is mainly classified into dry and wet type. Dry AMD is most common among elderly people. At present there is no treatment available for dry AMD. Early diagnosis and treatment to the affected eye may reduce the progression of disease. Manual screening of fundus images is time consuming and subjective. Hence in this study we are proposing an Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)-based nonlinear feature extraction to characterize and classify normal and AMD fundus images. EMD is performed on 1D Radon Transform (RT) projections to generate different Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF). Various nonlinear features are extracted from the IMFs.

Then the reduced LSDA features are ranked using minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) and Chernoff Bound and Bhattacharyya Distance (CBBD) techniques.

Acoustic signals were utilized for CWD because this signaling technology offers minimum health and privacy risks paired with maximum utility and cost-effectiveness. Acoustic signatures generated from the reflections of acoustic signals have been shown to vary based on target composition and shape. A library of acoustic signatures was compiled in order to identify concealed weapons. This was accomplished by projecting sound at frequencies 10 kilohertz through 16 kilohertz in 1 kilohertz increments at objects commonly found in school environments. A Fast Fourier Transform was then applied to the reflected waveform to extract a scalar feature from each acoustic signature.

A major challenge in microbiome research is the classification of microbial communities of different environments or host phenotypes. The most common and cost-effective approach for such studies to date is 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Recent falls in sequencing costs have increased the demand for simple, efficient, and accurate methods for rapid detection or diagnosis with proved applications in medicine, agriculture, and forensic science. We describe a reference- and alignment-free approach for predicting environments and host phenotypes from 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on k-mer representations that benefits from a bootstrapping framework for investigating the sufficiency of shallow sub-samples. Deep learning methods as well as classical approaches were explored for predicting environments and host phenotypes. Results k-mer distribution of shallow sub-samples outperformed the computationally costly Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) features in the tasks of body-site identification and Crohn's disease prediction. Aside from being more accurate, using k-mer features in shallow sub-samples allows (i) skipping computationally costly sequence alignments required in OTU-picking, and (ii) provided a proof of concept for the sufficiency of shallow and short-length 16S rRNA sequencing for phenotype prediction. In addition, k-mer features predicted representative 16S rRNA gene sequences of 18 ecological environments, and 5 organismal environments with high macro-F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.87.

The attention constraint aims to restrict the significant areas in the attention map to be consistent before and after image transformation. The identity constraint focuses on keeping the identity of the generated pedestrian image to be the same as that of the real one. After generating pedestrian images using SCGAN, we combine them with the real pedestrian images to train the person Re-ID model. Since the proposed SCGAN increases the diversity of training samples, the generalization of Re-ID model is enhanced.

Then, independent base classifiers are learned to face each problem, whose outputs are combined to predict a single class label. This way, the accuracy of the baseline classifiers without decomposition is usually enhanced, aside from enabling the usage of binary classifiers, i.e., Support Vector Machines, to solve multi-class problems. This paper analyzes the fact that existing aggregations favor easily recognizable classes; hence, the accuracy enhancement mainly comes from the higher correct classification rates over these classes. Using other evaluation criteria, the significant improvements of One-vs-One are diminished, showing a weakness due to the presence of difficult classes. Difficult classes can be defined as those obtaining a lower correct classification rate than that obtained by the other classes in the problem. After studying the problem of difficult classes in this framework and aiming to empower these classes, a novel similarity-based aggregation is presented, which generalizes the well-known weighted voting. The experimental analysis shows that the new methodology is able to increase the recognition of difficult classes, obtaining a more balanced performance over all classes, which is a desirable behavior. The methodology is tested within several Machine Learning paradigms and is compared with the state-of-the-art on aggregations for One-vs-One strategy.

A mixture model of continuous and categorical variables is proposed to construct a probability density function (PDF) that is the key part for the PNN. The proposed PNN has two advantages compared to conventional algorithms such as the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network. One is that the PNN can produce better results compared to the MLP neural network when the input data set includes both continuous and categorical data types, even using the normalised input variables. Normally, the normalised input variables generate a better result than the non-normalised input variables for the MLP neural network. The second advantage is that the PNN does not need the cross-validation data set and does not produce over-training like the MLP neural network. These advantages have been proven in our experimental study. The proposed PNN can also be used to perform unsupervised cluster analysis.

This construction avoids the blindness of parameter setting. Based on the affinity matrix, we propose a co-segmentation approach via an unsupervised extreme learning machine to train a transform network for feature representation. This representation learning could attain good performance in lower embedding dimension. Therefore, co-segmentation can be implemented by clustering on lower dimensions embedding space. So the execution is more efficient. Moreover, once the transform network is trained, it can be applied to the data representation acquisition process without re-computing the affinity matrix.

Numerous studies have been conducted to identify predictors for extubation outcome; however, the rate of infants failing extubation attempts has not declined. Objective: To develop a decision-support tool for the prediction of extubation outcome in premature infants using a set of machine learning algorithms. Methods: A dataset assembled from 486 premature infants on mechanical ventilation was used to develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayesian Classifier (NBC), Boosted Decision Trees (BDT), and Multivariable Logistic Regression (MLR). Performance of all models was evaluated using Area Under the Curve (AUC).

Currently, estimates of RSG range from 68 to 98 Pg C year-1 , causing considerable uncertainty in the global carbon budget. We argue the source of this variability lies in the upscaling assumptions regarding the model format, data timescales, and precipitation component. To quantify the variability and constrain RSG , we developed RSG models using Random Forest and exponential models, and used different timescales (daily, monthly, and annual) of soil respiration (RS ) and climate data to predict RSG . From the resulting RSG estimates (range = 66.62-100.72 Pg), we calculated variability associated with each assumption. Among model formats, using monthly RS data rather than annual data decreased RSG by 7.43-9.46 Pg; however, RSG calculated from daily RS data was only 1.83 Pg lower than the RSG from monthly data. Using mean annual precipitation and temperature data instead of monthly data caused +4.84 and -4.36 Pg C differences, respectively. If the timescale of RS data is constant, RSG estimated by the first-order exponential (93.2 Pg) was greater than the Random Forest (78.76 Pg) or second-order exponential (76.18 Pg) estimates. These results highlight the importance of variation at subannual timescales for upscaling to RSG . The results indicated RSG is lower than in recent papers and the current benchmark for land models (98 Pg C year-1 ), and thus may change the predicted rates of terrestrial carbon turnover and the carbon to climate feedback as global temperatures rise.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29749095", "doi": "10.1111/gcb.14301", "venue": null, "journal": "Global Change Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2801948551", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["85932366", "23277524", "135460505", "4412623", "130238501", "43955196", "2764681", "128948685", "129395484", "84726940", "55497495", "35830789", "53021791", "4404915", "55521332", "42683060", "131050157", "23465182", "17928997", "14391809", "97053543", "133615691", "25638073", "85989305", "83801462", "55612631", "89640005", "85166774", "41874930", "129031639", "133788840", "121610374", "134121314", "84138539", "85441000", "97251461", "83262243", "129456289", "130552872", "86572084", "55417276", "86750534", "84741991", "55671176", "84236903", "128949340", "7965968", "84313742", "2367747", "11592463", "14405883", "155037308", "129876338", "133749659"], "inbound_citations": ["215363066", "134663013", "197548304", "148573317"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13684942"}

Modeling more spatial information usually leads to exponential or polynomial increase of the computational cost. Therefore, the spatial modeling of prior work is limited to neighboring or weak geometry relationships of local features, or is not viewpoint invariant. ::: In this thesis, we propose algorithms that model rich geometry information with little sacrifice of the computational cost.

In particular, we took into account three variables' preprocessing strategies (no-preprocessing, normalization, and logarithmic), in combination with two different dependent variables (effort and inverse effort). As a result, SVR was applied using six different data configurations. Moreover, to understand the suitability of kernel functions to handle non-linear problems, SVR was applied without a kernel, and in combination with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) and the Polynomial kernels, thus obtaining 18 different SVR configurations. To identify, for each configuration, which were the best values for each of the parameters we defined a procedure based on a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. The dataset employed was the Tukutuku database, which has been adopted in many previous Web effort estimation studies. Three different training and test set splits were used, including respectively 130 and 65 projects. The SVR-based predictions were also benchmarked against predictions obtained using Manual StepWise Regression and Case-Based Reasoning. Our results showed that the configuration corresponding to the logarithmic features' preprocessing, in combination with the RBF kernel provided the best results for all three data splits.

The subjectivity factor of the radiologist can be overcome by the computer aided diagnosis system. This paper proposed a TB detection system on CXR images using optimized Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features as the input. GLCM is optimized using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and then classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this paper, CXR images were classified as normal, primary TB (PTB) and secondary TB (STB). The results of this paper indicate that the classification system with optimized GLCM as input has better performance than the classification system with regular GLCM as input. The classification system with optimized GLCM as input in the 8-fold cross validation test has an accuracy of 100% for the normal class, 98.72% for the PTB class and 98.72% for the STB class.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/icoiact46704.2019.8938584", "venue": "2019 International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT)", "journal": "2019 International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2997888743", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["215215495", "27137039", "3413560", "14910852", "24215976"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209458799"}

To address these problems, a two-phase framework for semantic entity identification with relationship integration in large scale text data is proposed in this paper. In the first semantic entities identification phase, we propose a novel strategy to extract unknown text semantic entities by integrating statistical features, Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Compared with traditional approaches, our strategy is more effective in detecting semantic entities and more sensitive to new entities that just appear in the fresh data. After extracting the semantic entities, the second phase of our framework is for the integration of Semantic Entities Relationships (SER) which can help to cluster the semantic entities. A novel classification method using features such as similarity measures and co-occurrence probabilities is applied to tackle the clustering problem and discover the relationships among semantic entities.

However, when scenes contain high-level semantic actions with many interacting parts, these mid-level features are not sufficient to capture high level structures as well as high order causal relationships between moving objects resulting into a clear drop in performances. In this paper, we address this issue and we propose an alternative action recognition method based on a novel graph kernel. In the main contributions of this work, we first describe actions in videos using directed a cyclic graphs (DAGs), that naturally encode pair wise interactions between moving object parts, and then we compare these DAGs by analyzing the spectrum of their sub-patterns that capture complex higher order interactions. This extraction and comparison process is computationally tractable, resulting from the a cyclic property of DAGs, and it also defines a positive semi-definite kernel. When plugging the latter into support vector machines, we obtain an action recognition algorithm that overtakes related work, including graph-based methods, on a standard evaluation dataset.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCV.2013.393", "venue": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision", "journal": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1992208818", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5388357", "1458096", "8618770", "2664004", "10856944", "9874020", "5909264", "13895636", "7677665", "966135", "8790929", "78173", "12365014", "6006618", "62491016", "77451", "16065617", "83721", "8777811", "17557614", "15680694", "13537104", "6367640", "3395407", "14751"], "inbound_citations": ["4726043", "195355785", "209324179", "155100195", "196179158", "207910511", "59248757", "45359795", "5038999", "25247555", "10280804", "204575815", "3426597", "204805390", "145964483", "14926564", "15327336", "49863333", "56657830", "13740839", "22911688", "2026495", "1969813", "15800242", "10941695", "143423089", "209515665"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6293032"}

Based on an assumption that feature points originated from the same objects shows similar motion as the object moves, the proposed method detects moving objects by clustering trajectories of similar motions. For this purpose an energy function based on spatial proximity, motion coherence, and temporal continuity is defined to measure the similarity between two trajectories and the clustering is achieved by minimizing the energy function in CRFs (conditional random fields). Compared to previous methods, which are unable to separate falsely merged trajectories during the clustering process, the proposed method is able to rearrange the falsely merged trajectories during iteration because the clustering is solved my energy minimization in CRFs.

The characteristics of a mammogram at different resolution levels are represented by computing wavelet entropy and used as features for the corresponding mammogram. Then, ensemble classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed to classify the abnormalities as benign/ malignant. The experiments show promising results with the high level of sensitivity and hence it is feasible for mammogram classification.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Biomedical Research-tokyo", "mag_id": "2605522195", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:80341569"}

For example, gaze recordings may be directly used to study attention allocation towards the areas and objects of interest. Furthermore, segmenting the raw gaze traces into their constituent eye movements has applications in the assessment of subjective quality and mental load, and may improve computational saliency prediction of the content as well. Currently, eye trackers are beginning to be integrated into commodity virtual and augmented reality set-ups that allow for more diverse stimuli to be presented, including 360-degree content. However, because of the more complex eye-head coordination patterns that emerge, the definitions and the well-established methods that were developed for monitor-based eye tracking are often no longer directly applicable. The main contributions of this work to the field of 360-degree content analysis are threefold: First, we collect and partially annotate a new eye tracking data set for naturalistic 360-degree videos. Second, we propose a new two-stage pipeline for reliable manual annotation of both \"traditional\" (fixations and saccades) and more complex eye movement types that is implemented in a flexible user interface. Lastly, we develop and test a proof-of-concept algorithm for automatic classification of all the eye movement types in our data set.

However, limited data due to the difficulty of field collection has led to research to better understand the ecological status within a catchment and develop a targeted planning strategy for river restoration. To address this need, coupling hydrological and machine learning models were constructed to identify priority zones for river restoration based on a dataset of aquatic organisms (i.e., algae, macroinvertebrates, and fish) and physicochemical indicators that were collected from 130 sites in September 2014 in the Taizi River, northern China. A process-based model soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) was developed to model the temporal-spatial variations in environmental indicators. A support vector machine (SVM) model was applied to explore the relationships between aquatic organisms and environmental indicators. Biological indices among different hydrological periods were simulated by coupling SWAT and SVM models. Results indicated that aquatic biological indices and physicochemical indicators exhibited apparent temporal and spatial patterns, and those patterns were more evident in the upper reaches compared to the lower reaches.

We identify the most relevant variables for predicting the dividend payout of the firms in an emerging market, Iran, using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The advantages of the LASSO include: enhancing the prediction accuracy of the dividend model, improving interpretation of the results, and applicability to high-dimensional data. We obtain several results. First, some fundamental determinants of dividends in the industrialized economies such as market-to-book ratio and current ratio, do not play a role in deciding dividends in Iran. Second, LASSO-selected variables outperform the variables commonly used in the literature in terms of model fit and prediction accuracy. Third, business risk, leverage, return on assets and effective tax rate are the most important predictors of dividend propensity of the Iranian firms. Fourth, if the support vector machine algorithm, an often-used classification method, is combined with LASSO-selected variables, it can better discriminate between dividend-paying and dividend non-paying firms than other methods such as logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis.Abbreviations: LASSO: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator; TSE: Tehran Stock Exchange; RMSE: Root Mean Squared Errors; MAE: Mean Absolute Errors; ROC: Receiver Operating Characteristics; GMM: Generalized Method of Moments; MENA: Middle East and North Africa region; AIC: Akaike Information Criterion; BIC: Bayesian Information Criterion; LARS: Least Angel Regression; OLS: Ordinary Least Squares; AUC: Area Under Curve; BS: Brier Score ; OA: Overall Accuracy; LDA: Linear Discriminant Analysis; SVM: Support Vector Machine algorithm; LR: Logistic Regression.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/00036846.2019.1593315", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Economics", "mag_id": "2940796383", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:159151925"}

In this paper, we introduce a new approach called safe sample screening that enables us to identify a subset of the non-SVs and screen them out prior to the training phase. Our approach is different from existing heuristic approaches in the sense that the screened samples are guaranteed to be non-SVs at the optimal solution. We investigate the advantage of the safe sample screening approach through intensive numerical experiments, and demonstrate that it can substantially decrease the computational cost of the state-of-the-art SVM solvers such as LIBSVM.

In the RNFS-MEO, the RNFS is incorporated into a typical multiobjective continuous ant colony optimization algorithm to improve its learning efficiency. The RNFS estimates the accumulated multiobjective function values of the FCs in a colony without applying them to control a process, which helps reduce the number of control trials. The RNFS is trained online through structure and parameter learning based on the reinforcement signals from controlling a process. Considering the influence of the current control signals on the future states of a controlled process, the temporal difference technique is used in the RNFS training so that it estimates not only the current but also the future objective function values. The colony of FCs in the RNFS-MEO is repeatedly evolved based on the RNFS estimated values or the objective function values from real evaluations until a colony of successful FCs is found.

In this article the authors apply an autoassociative connectionist model originally developed by J. L. McClelland and D. E. Rumelhart (1986) to reproduce several well-replicated and theoretically important phenomena related to person perception and stereotyping. These phenomena are exemplar-based inference, group-based stereotyping, the simultaneous application of several stereotypes to generate emergent characteristics, and the effects of recency and frequency of prior exposures on accessibility (the probability of a representation's use). Though many of these phenomena are explained by current theories in social psychology, the simulation contributes to parsimony and theoretical integration by showing that a single, very simple mechanism can generate them all. The model also predicts a new phenomenon--rapid recovery of accessibility after it has declined to zero. In recent years, and particularly following the publication of the influential two-volume work by McClelland, Rumelhart, and their colleagues (McClelland, Rumelhart, & the PDP Research Group, 1986; Rumelhart, McClelland, & the PDP Research Group, 1986), parallel distributed processing or connectionist models have had a strong and growing influence in many areas of cognitive psychology. Connectionist models have been developed for phenomena ranging from low-level visual and auditory perception to higher level processes like language processing, categorization, schema use, memory, and decision making. Many of these high-level processes are also prominent in theoretical accounts of social psychological phenomena such as person perception and stereotyping. In this article we argue that connectionist models can shed new light on important social psychological phenomena, as they have on various areas of nonsocial cognition. The models traditionally used in social psychology vary widely on a number of dimensions.

A common approach to restoring consistency is removing a minimal set of triples from the KG, called a diagnosis of the KB. However, there can be a large number of diagnoses. It is hard to manually select the best one among these diagnoses to restore consistency. To alleviate the selection burden, this paper studies automatic methods for ranking diagnoses so that people can merely focus on top diagnoses when seeking the best one. An approach to ranking diagnoses through representation learning aka knowledge graph embedding is proposed. Given a set of diagnoses, the approach first learns the embedding of the complement set of the union of all diagnoses, then for every diagnosis, incrementally learns an embedding of the complement set of the diagnosis and employs the embedding to estimate the removal cost of the diagnosis, and finally ranks diagnoses by removal costs. To evaluate the approach, four knowledge graphs with logical theories are constructed from the four great classical masterpieces of Chinese literature.

As the hand can move freely in 3D, measuring proprioceptive drift in only one dimension is not sufficient for the estimation of the drift in real life situations.

K.", "middle": [], "last": "Ghosh", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Abstract. Mapping of the crop using satellite images is a challenging task due to complexities within field, and having the similar spectral properties with other crops in the region. Recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite has thirteen spectral bands, fast revisit time and resolution at three different level (10 m, 20 m, 60 m), as well as the free availability of data, makes it a good choice for vegetation mapping. This study aims to classify crop using single date Sentinel-2 imagery in the Roorkee, district Haridwar, Uttarakhand, India. Classification is performed by using two most popular and efficient machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this study, four spectral bands, i.e., Near Infrared, Red, Green, and Blue of Sentinel-2 satellite are stacked for the classification. Results show that overall accuracy of the classification achieved by RF and SVM using Sentinel-2 imagery are 84.22% and 81.85% respectively. This study demonstrates that both classifiers performed well by setting an optimal value of tuning parameters, but RF achieved 2.37% higher overall accuracy over SVM. Analysis of the results states that the class specific accuracies of High-Density Forest attain the highest accuracy whereas Fodder class reports the lowest accuracy. Fodder achieve lowest accuracy because there is an intermixing of pixels among Wheat and Fodder crops.

This work focuses on sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining. It is a way of automatically extracting and analyzing the emotions and opinions, and not facts, of messages and posts. A multi-tier classification architecture is proposed, which consists of major modules such as data cleaning and pre-processing, feature selection, and classifier training that includes a multi-tier prediction model. The architecture and its components are carefully described. Four classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and SGD) are used in the experiments, which evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-tier architecture by analyzing the sentiments and opinions of 150,000 movie reviews. Results have shown that the multi-tier model is able to significantly improve prediction accuracy over the single-tier model by more than 10%, the improvement is significant when customized dictionary is used.

We employed Random Forests models to identify predictor variables for metabolism rates and benthic macroinvertebrate density and biomass, and calculated Spearman correlations between in-stream nutrient levels and metabolism rates. Models indicated that discharge and length of time between high water events were the most important factors measured for predicting metabolism rates. Discharge was the most important variable for predicting benthic macroinvertebrate density and biomass. Primary production rate peaked at intermediate discharge, respiration rate was lowest at the greatest time since last high water event, and benthic macroinvertebrate density was lowest at high discharge rates.

The objective is to acquire information on sentiment of foreign tourists in order to improve and foster tourism industry of Bangkok. This paper has retrieved 10,000 datasets from Twitter in 2017. Such datasets were tokenized and filtered in order to obtain sentiment English words. Subsequently, the sentiment English words were purposely classified into five categories of visiting Bangkok, involving (i) Traveling, (ii) Business, (iii) Visiting Family, (iv) Education, and (v) Health and Treatments. It has revealed that the traveling purpose has the highest percentage of 71.93% followed by business and visiting family. Therefore, the sentiment of foreign tourists to traveling in Bangkok was analyzed through four approaches, i.e. (i) Decision Tree, (ii) Naive Bayes, (iii) Support Vector Machine (SVM), and (iv) Artificial Neural Network (ANN), using RapidMiner Studio7.4. The results have shown that the foreign tourists visit in Bangkok mostly for nightlife activity, Thai culture, and shopping with percentages of 65.54%, 16.07%, and 13.61%, respectively, meanwhile temple and historical sites, Thai cuisine, and nature are not significant. The accuracy of sentiment analysis approaches of Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, SVM, and ANN are 79.83%, 55.66%, 80.11%, and 80.33%, respectively. Based upon ANN approach that provides the highest accuracy, the positive sentiments were found to be a visit for nightlife activity, temple and historical sites, Thai cuisine, and nature.

Recent advances in object-based image analysis (OBIA) and machine-learning algorithms offer new image classification tools; however, few comparisons of different approaches have been discussed to date. We applied OBIA to delineate wetland plant functional types (PFTs) for Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China and Ramsar wetland conservation site, from a spring 2008 Landsat TM image. We targeted major PFTs that represent dominant vegetation groups along wetland inundation gradients and affect ecosystem biogeochemical cycles and ecological habitats. Classification results were compared among: a) several \u201csmall\u201d object segmentation scales (with average object sizes 1350\u20139000 m 2 ); b) algorithms from six families of statistical machine-learning classifiers (Bayesian, Logistic, Neural Network, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines) and c) two hierarchical levels of vegetation classification, a generalized 3-class set and a more specific 6-class set. We also examined the response of classification accuracy to four basic object-level texture metrics. The highest accuracies (> 85\u201390%) and best agreement among algorithms occurred at coarser object scales rather than close-to-pixel scales. No single machine-learning algorithm was consistently superior at all scales, although support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor and artificial neural network most frequently provided the highest overall and PFT-specific accuracies. Including texture metrics had both positive and negative low-magnitude effects on classification accuracy that were not consistent among scale values, algorithms or PFT classes. Individual PFTs differed in scales at which they were best discriminated from others, reflecting their unique landscape positions, ecology of dominant species and disturbance agents. There was a 29\u201335% disagreement between mapped areas of generalized PFTs and their respective subclasses, suggesting potential mismatches between the ecological classification scheme and PFT landscape patch structure, and raising concern on error propagation in multi-scale classifications.

Aiming at the vibration signals of rolling bearing which are non-stationary and easy to be disturbed by noise, a novel fault diagnosis method based on curvelet transform and metric learning is proposed.

The first one is feature engineering which includes reshaping the original timing features of rolling bearings, employing curvelet transform to transform reshaped features and making its coefficients as the new features. Curvelet transform can analyse the original signal from many angles. The second one is employing metric learning to map these new features into special embedding space. The last one is applying KNN classifier to detect the rolling bearing faults. Metric learning can effectively improve the performance of KNN by learning a mapping matrix to modify the distribution of samples.

As in classification, support vector regression (SVR) is characterized by the use of kernels, sparse solution, and VC control of the margin and the number of support vectors. Although less popular than SVM, SVR has been proven to be an effective tool in real-value function estimation. As a supervised-learning approach, SVR trains using a symmetrical loss function, which equally penalizes high and low misestimates. Using Vapnik\u2019s -insensitive approach, a flexible tube of minimal radius is formed symmetrically around the estimated function, such that the absolute values of errors less than a certain threshold are ignored both above and below the estimate. In this manner, points outside the tube are penalized, but those within the tube, either above or below the function, receive no penalty. One of the main advantages of SVR is that its computational complexity does not depend on the dimensionality of the input space.

In the present paper the standard SVR method is extended to cover regression in complex numbers and quaternions.

We have developed a SVM-based classifier to predict domain swapping events using a set of features derived from sequence and structural data. The SVM classifier was trained on features derived from 150 proteins reported to be involved in 3D domain swapping and 150 proteins not known to be involved in swapped conformation or related to proteins involved in swapping phenomenon. The testing was performed using 63 proteins from the positive dataset and 63 proteins from the negative dataset. We obtained 76.33% accuracy from training and 73.81% accuracy from testing. Due to high diversity in the sequence, structure and functions of proteins involved in domain swapping, availability of such an algorithm to predict swapping events from sequence and structure-derived features will be an initial step towards identification of more putative proteins that may be involved in swapping or proteins involved in deposition disease. Further, the top features emerging in our feature selection method may be analysed further to understand their roles in the mechanism of domain swapping.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2901629", "pubmed_id": "20634983", "doi": "10.4137/BBI.S4464", "venue": null, "journal": "Bioinformatics and Biology Insights", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2111737093", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["38788278", "42586727", "24683699", "37462794", "12381622", "30081467", "16174563", "45917766", "42647401", "21916758", "38877259", "14328477", "24190524", "20708845", "16382064", "2940867", "21384507", "60136037", "7021521", "7350994", "10937572", "37375962", "7935407", "206340350", "7230712", "25290238", "2133044", "16947591", "5586408", "7138354", "5674389", "11464998", "23879636", "6669059", "6980336", "42334075", "1405662", "24258902", "42378587", "45824934", "22259122", "16348995", "2281381", "42628266", "42884558", "43081173", "10871628", "20436507", "25050960", "31192499", "25011066", "27439276", "26634930", "9265433"], "inbound_citations": ["4316610", "11078775", "11078775", "3888714", "15443673", "142504", "52824126", "8255235", "1240672"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1741143"}

In this paper, Random Forest, as a kind of ensemble method, is employed to address this problem. The Random Forest, is a recently introduced method based on bagging algorithm that trains a group of base classifiers by randomly selecting sets of features and then, combining results obtained from base classifiers by majority voting. To investigate the effectiveness of the number of base learners to the performance of the Random Forest, twelve different numbers of base classifiers (between 30 and 600) are applied for this classifier.

With this motivation, we developed two high-throughput workflows for the classification of tequila and mezcal spirits. Both strategies are based on chemical fingerprinting by mass spectrometry (MS). The first method uses direct-injection electrospray ionisation (DIESI) with automated sampling, the second method employs low-temperature plasma (LTP) ionisation. For the ambient sampling with LTP we used a 3D-printed probe, as well as a home-build robot based on RepRap (3D printer) technology. Both methods are fully automated. With DIESI-MS, a sample analysis takes 6 min, with LTP-MS only 20 seconds. The data of both methods permit the discrimination between tequila and mezcal products, and thus are suitable for the quick screening of spirits for authenticity. We also found that pre-processing the raw spectra data with Random Forest models greatly supports the separation of informative signals from noise.

Specifically, the multi-view canonical correlation analysis scheme is utilized to extract multiple correlation subspaces that are useful for joint representations for data association across domains. This scheme makes homogeneous domain adaption algorithms suitable for heterogeneous domain adaptation problems. Additionally, inspired by fusion methods such as Ensemble Learning (EL), this work proposes a weighted voting scheme based on canonical correlation coefficients to combine classification results in multiple correlation subspaces. Finally, the semi-supervised MVCCAE extends the original procedure by incorporating multiple speed-up spectral regression kernel discriminant analysis (SRKDA). To validate the performances of the proposed supervised procedure, a single-view canonical analysis (SVCCA) with the same base classifier (Random Forests) is used. Similarly, to evaluate the performance of the semi-supervised approach, a comparison is made with other techniques such as Logistic label propagation (LLP) and the Laplacian support vector machine (LapSVM). All of the approaches are tested on two real hyperspectral images, which are considered the target domain, with a classifier trained from synthetic low-dimensional multispectral images, which are considered the original source domain. The experimental results confirm that multi-view canonical correlation can overcome the limitations of SVCCA. Both of the proposed procedures outperform the ones used in the comparison with respect to not only the classification accuracy but also the computational efficiency. Moreover, this research shows that canonical correlation weighted voting (CCWV) is a valid option with respect to other ensemble schemes and that because of their ability to balance diversity and accuracy, canonical views extracted using partially joint random view generation are more effective than those obtained by exploiting disjoint random view generation.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs9040337", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2604836770", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["128818929", "36525836", "7984231", "2777306", "9286850", "129915143", "17482472", "18447432", "9046902", "9178606", "14739721", "740063", "5950396", "7799581", "9466011", "775493", "3036015", "4553188", "918513", "17429744", "15036406", "9133542", "9903670", "2464198", "6953522", "1990988", "788838", "11943552", "13828880", "10337178", "16940094", "4962044", "13172299", "8063506", "7879207", "44364760", "7419723", "12789480", "15778895", "16197334", "196536", "11000812", "34590277", "6742009", "15044501", "15260040", "202473", "46633631", "972201", "15824234", "7036341", "119175787", "5709930", "27478592", "15106876", "89141", "120219784", "7443466", "26985497", "17001630", "28020"], "inbound_citations": ["52116206", "201256028", "52164135", "10092092", "208037820", "52116775", "59617028", "57759348"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10193228"}

Matching footwear features to a functional group can possibly enhance footwear-related comfort, improve running performance, and decrease the risk of movement-related injuries. To match footwear features to a functional group, one has to first define the different groups using their distinctive movement patterns. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to propose and apply a methodological approach to define functional groups with different movement patterns using Self-Organizing Maps and Support Vector Machines. Further study objectives were to identify differences in age, gender and footwear-related comfort preferences between the functional groups. Kinematic data and subjective comfort preferences of 88 subjects (16\u201376 years; 45 m/43 f) were analysed. Eight functional groups with distinctive movement patterns were defined. The findings revealed that most of the groups differed in age or gender. Certain functional groups differed in their comfort preferences and, therefore, had group-specific footwear requirements to enhance footwear-related comfort. Some of the groups, which had group-specific footwear requirements, did not show any differences in age or gender. This is important because when defining functional groups simply using common grouping criteria like age or gender, certain functional groups with group-specific movement patterns and footwear requirements might not be detected. This emphasises the power of the proposed pattern recognition approach to automatically define groups by their distinctive movement patterns in order to be able to address their group-specific product requirements.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25869722", "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.03.017", "venue": "Journal of biomechanics", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "mag_id": "2106114319", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["126006426", "215061372", "199441655", "54459000", "4899951", "58651729", "56387636", "46776985", "55729307"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:41078390"}

This paper presents a system which enables a miniature quadcopter with a frontal monocular camera to autonomously navigate and explore the unknown indoor environment. Initially, the system estimates dense depth map of the environment from a single video frame using our proposed novel supervised Hierarchical Structured Learning (hsl) technique, which yields both high accuracy levels and better generalization. The proposed hsl approach discretizes the overall depth range into multiple sets. It structures these sets hierarchically and recursively through partitioning the set of classes into two subsets with subsets representing apportioned depth range of the parent set, forming a binary tree. The binary classification method is applied to each internal node of binary tree separately using Support Vector Machine (svm). Whereas, the depth estimation of each pixel of the image starts from the root node in top-down approach, classifying repetitively till it reaches any of the leaf node representing its estimated depth. The generated depth map is provided as an input to Convolutional Neural Network (cnn), which generates flight planning commands. Finally, trajectory planning and control module employs a convex programming technique to generate collision-free minimum time trajectory which follows these flight planning commands and produces appropriate control inputs for the quadcopter. The results convey unequivocally the advantages of depth perception by hsl, while repeatable flights of successful nature in typical indoor corridors confirm the efficacy of the pipeline.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3009977.3009990", "venue": "ICVGIP '16", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2562127556", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10323617", "6654131", "206986664", "1336659", "10748875", "15920385", "6574473", "206775100", "13153", "102496818", "27615", "479635", "10634567", "14606897", "17766075", "16747659", "206451779", "6766152", "52998092", "3116168", "1793896"], "inbound_citations": ["211041290", "57189390", "56517016"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13952981"}

High-sensitivity accelerometers mounted under the floors provide a robust alternative for occupant classification. The authors take advantage of the highly-instrumented Goodwin Hall on the Virginia Tech campus to measure vibrations of the walking surface caused by individual walkers. A machine learning technique known as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is used to classify gender. In this study, the gait (i.e. walking) of 15 individual walkers (eight male and seven female) was recorded as they, alone, walked down the instrumented hallway, in multiple trials. The trials were recorded via 14 accelerometers which were mounted underneath the walking surface with the placement of the sensors unknown to the walker.

The impact of machine learning and text mining technologies is significant in any area of the business or the public sector, including education. Specifically, in education, one of the most interesting applications of these technologies is in the evaluation of students' tests' results that come out of open-question-based examination processes. This thesis responds to the trend to employ machine learning and text mining techniques in evaluation of students' responses to open questions. The present research is focused on the identification of the best approach to automate the grading of students' answers in open-question-based examination. To this end, we conducted a comparative study of a set of alternative methods. ::: ::: In open-question-based examination, there are several types of open questions, however previous researches have been done for the essay and short answer only. This study explores the grading process as supported by machine learning and text mining techniques, regarding two types of open questions: (1) \"mention and explain a couple of examples for different categories,\" and (2) \"give a concise and valid argument about a given statement.\" Additionally, the present study focuses on finding better approaches for the small dataset (less than 50) in contrast to previously published literature which tends to investigate their method in a big dataset. ::: ::: Therefore, current research provides several contributions to the theory. This study examines other open question types that have not been explored in previous works. This research also proposes techniques for automated grading system using combinations of text mining and machine learning for an automated grading system for the small dataset. Then, this study demonstrates the use of RapidMiner for automated grading implementation. ::: ::: This study uses text mining and machine learning techniques to assess each question type. Unlike related works in this area, the present study does not aim to give a score to a student's answer, but to examine those characteristics of an open question that can be advantageous for automated grading. Therefore, this research provides several suggestions for lecturers about how to create a question that can be easily graded by an automated system and to determine the performance of the implemented technique for two types of question. ::: ::: Current research evaluates the proposed method in two ways: (1) by doing an experiment, and (2) by conducting an evaluation survey from three lecturers in the University of Twente. The first type of open questions is examined by counting the number of examples mentioned in the answer and by employing a classification technique using Support Vector Machine. The related experiment findings show the acceptable result to identify the number of examples within a category, with the accuracy of more than 70%. Moreover, the produced classifier model identifies the examples to its category with the accuracy of more than 85% and correlation value more than 0.700. These values signify high likelihood that students' answers are similar and related to each other. ::: ::: For the second type, this study implements sentiment analysis and clustering with X-Means algorithm. The Davies-Bouldin (DB) index and Silhouette index are applied to measure the performance of the clustering. The optimal number of clusters is 7, using Manhattan Distance with DB index, which is 0.334, and Silhouette index which is 1.332. Our analysis found that answer length is the most dominant factor in determining the clusters, and Term Document Matrix influences the results of the clustering. ::: ::: This master thesis project used RapidMiner for the purpose of experimentation. All answer files are written in text files. ::: ::: In addition to the experiment results, an evaluation survey based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by Venkatesh et al. (2003) was performed. From the evaluation results, performance expectancy becomes the strong determinant of the behavioral intention to use the proposed method.

We particularly interested in the classification and counting of the five main types of white blood cells (leukocytes) in a clinical setting where the quality of microscopic imagery may be poor. A critical first step in the medical analysis of cytological images of thin blood smears is the segmentation of individual cells. The quality of the segmentation has a great influence on the cell type identification, but for poor quality, noisy, and/or low resolution images, segmentation is correspondingly less reliable. In this paper, we compensate for less accurate segmentation by extracting features based on wavelets using the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) which is based on multi-resolution characteristics of the image. These features then form the basis of classification of white blood cells into their five primary types with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that performs classification by constructing hyper-planes in a high multi-dimensional space that separates cases of different classes.

Because the rain rate depended on the precipitation type: convective or stratiform, the RF technique is divided into two stages. The first is the classification of rainfall into three classes (no-rain, convective and stratiform) using RF classification and the second consists in assigning rain rate to the pixels belonging to the two classes (convective and stratiform) using RF regression. In classification step, spectral, textural and temporal features of clouds are used as predictor variables and the results are validated against co-located rainfall classes observed by radar. The statistical parameters score shows stronger rainfall classification performance for RF compared to the ANN and SVM. The RF regression model is validated by comparison with against co-located rainfall rates measured by a rain gauge.

Fracture-zone prediction based on bone's microstructure has been recently proposed as an alternative prediction method of fracture risk. In this paper, a classification system (CS) for the automatic fracture-zone prediction based on an Ensemble of Imbalanced Learning methods is proposed, following the observation that the percentage of the actual fractured bone area is significantly smaller than the intact bone in the case of a fracture event. The sample is divided into Volumes of Interest (VOIs) of specific size and 29 morphometrical parameters are calculated from each VOI, which serve as input features for the CS in order for it to separate the input patterns in to two classes: fractured and nonfractured. To this end, two well-established Imbalanced Learning methods, namely Random Undersampling and Synthetic Minority Oversampling, and two popular classification algorithms, namely Multilayer Perceptrons and Support Vector Machines, are tested and combined accordingly, to provide the best possible performance on a dataset that contains 45 specimens\u2019 pre- and postfailure scans. The best combination is then compared with three well-established Ensembles of Imbalanced Learning methods, namely RUSBoost, UnderBagging and SMOTEBagging. The experimental results clearly show that the proposed CS outperforms the competition, scoring in some occasions more than 90% in G-Mean and Area under Curve metrics.

In this paper, we first identify the major parameters using real cloud services' workload and power consumption data. An important observation is that the parameters are strongly interdependent and the importance of individual parameters varies in different cloud services. Nevertheless, existing power consumption models are unable to fully capture this feature and thus lack generalization. To address this gap, we propose Lapem that adopts a Long Short-term Memory network for power consumption estimation. Lapem further uses an attention mechanism to achieve stable performance and improve generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that Lapem estimates power consumption with a relative error of as low as 2%-5%.

Use of SVMs for clustering (unsupervised learning) is now being considered in a number of different ways.ResultsAn SVM-based clustering algorithm is introduced that clusters data with no a priori knowledge of input classes. The algorithm initializes by first running a binary SVM classifier against a data set with each vector in the set randomly labelled, this is repeated until an initial convergence occurs. Once this initialization step is complete, the SVM confidence parameters for classification on each of the training instances can be accessed. The lowest confidence data (e.g., the worst of the mislabelled data) then has its' labels switched to the other class label. The SVM is then re-run on the data set (with partly re-labelled data) and is guaranteed to converge in this situation since it converged previously, and now it has fewer data points to carry with mislabelling penalties. This approach appears to limit exposure to the local minima traps that can occur with other approaches. Thus, the algorithm then improves on its weakly convergent result by SVM re-training after each re-labeling on the worst of the misclassified vectors \u2013 i.e., those feature vectors with confidence factor values beyond some threshold. The repetition of the above process improves the accuracy, here a measure of separability, until there are no misclassifications.

For example, binary classification is dominant in many of these data sets, with the positive class denoting the existence of a particular disease in medical diagnosis applications. Such labelling does not depict the reality of having different categories of the same disease; a fact evidenced in the continuous research in root causes and variations of symptoms in a number of diseases. In a quest to enhance such diagnosis, data sets were decomposed using clustering of each class to reveal hidden categories. We then apply the widely adopted ensemble classification technique Random Forests. Such class decomposition has two advantages: (1) diversification of the input that enhances the ensemble classification; and (2) improving class separability, easing the follow-up classification process. However, to be able to apply Random Forests on such class decomposed data, three main parameters need to be set: number of trees forming the ensemble, number of features to split on at each node, and a vector representing the number of clusters in each class. The large search space for tuning these parameters has motivated the use of Genetic Algorithm to optimise the solution. A thorough experimental study on 22 real data sets was conducted, predominantly in a variety of life science applications. To prove the applicability of the method to other areas of application, the proposed method was tested on a number of data sets from other domains. Three variations of Random Forests including the proposed method as well as a boosting ensemble classifier were used in the experimental study. The results prove the superiority of the proposed method in boosting up the accuracy.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2016.08.007", "venue": "Inf.

ADC and IVIM parameters were determined in lesions. The early malignant cases are used as advanced malignant and benign tumors, respectively, so as to assess the effectiveness on the result. A predictive model was constructed using Support Vector Machine Binary Classification (SVMBC, also known Support Vector Machine Discriminant Analysis (SVMDA)) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA) and compared the difference between them both. The value and ADC provide accurate identification of malignant lesions with , if early malignant tumor was considered as advanced malignant (cancer). The classification accuracy is 93.5% for cross-validation using SVMBC with ADC and tissue diffusivity only.

This paper proposes to tackle this task by jointly learning feature representation and distance metric in an end-to-end manner. Existing deep metric learning-based re-ID methods usually encounter the following two weaknesses: 1) most works based on pairwise or triplet constraints often suffer from slow convergence and poor local optima, partially because they use very limited samples for each update and 2) hard negative sample mining has been widely applied in existing works. However, hard positive samples, which also contribute to the training of network, have not received enough attention. To alleviate these problems, we develop a novel structural metric learning objective for person re-ID, in which each positive pair is allowed to be compared against all negative pairs in a minibatch and each positive pair is adaptively assigned a hardness-aware weight to modulate its contribution. The introduced positive pair weighting strategy enables the algorithm to focus more on the hard positive samples. Furthermore, we propose to enhance the proposed loss function by adding a global loss term to reduce the variances of positive/negative pair distances, which is able to improve the generalization capability of the network model. By this approach, person images can be nonlinearly mapped into a low-dimensional embedding space where similar samples are kept closer and dissimilar samples are pushed farther apart.

Identifying the suspect through the CCTV video footage is a very challenging task for them as it involves tedious rounds of processes to match the facial information in the video footage to a set of suspect\u2019s images. The biggest problem faced by digital forensic analysis is modeling 2D model extracted from CCTV video as the model does not provide enough information to carry out the identification process. Problems occur when a suspect in the video is not facing the camera, the image extracted is the side image of the suspect and it is difficult to make a matching with portrait image in the database. There are also many factors that contribute to the process of extracting facial information from a video to be difficult, such as low-quality video. Through 2D to 3D image model mapping, any partial face information that is incomplete can be matched more efficiently with 3D data by rotating it to matched position. The first methodology in this research is data collection; any data obtained through video recorder. Then, the video will be converted into an image. Images are used to develop the Active Appearance Model (the 2D face model is AAM) 2D and AAM 3D. AAM is used as an input for learning and testing process involving three classifiers, which are Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks classifier. The experimental results show that the 3D model is more suitable for use in face recognition as the percentage of the recognition is higher compared with the 2D model.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.11113/jt.v78.6939", "venue": "Jurnal Teknologi", "journal": "Jurnal Teknologi", "mag_id": "2273704436", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:112114026"}

However, linear prediction models were developed using linear regression techniques, which may not be able to find precisely the underlying nonlinearity in correlating LC to atomic parameters of perovskites. This causes a reduction in the prediction accuracy of linear model. To address this problem, in this work, support vector regression (SVR) technique is proposed to design and develop LC prediction model for cubic perovskites. To investigate the generalization of SVR model, we collected data for new cubic and pseudocubic compounds from the current literature of material science.

Also the Norwegian laws state that the patient has the right to read his or her own EPR. A master thesis executed in 2006, and a specialization project in 2007 addressed this subject and developed a prototype for adapting EPRs to a patient presentation. This thesis continues this work and aims to extend the system with more functionality and improve the translation of the EPRs. The main issues discussed in the thesis are how disambiguating between Norwegian words and medical terms, provide summaries of EPRs, and supply the patient with external information about his or her health condition. In addition the refined user interface from the specialization project was implemented. The conclusion of this thesis is that the Support Vector Machine classifier with character bigrams provides good and accurate disambiguation between Norwegian words and medical terms. The external information functionality provides correct and quality assured information from the patient hand book.

Therefore, it is still unclear how to identify cis-regulatory driver mutations, particularly when chromatin data from the same patient is not available, thus relying only on sequence and expression information. Here we use machine-learning methods to predict functional regulatory regions using sequence information alone, and compare the predicted activity of the mutated region with the reference sequence. This way we define the Predicted Regulatory Impact of a Mutation in an Enhancer (PRIME). We find that the recently identified driver mutation in the TAL1 enhancer has a high PRIME score, representing a \"gain-of-target\" for MYB, whereas the highly recurrent TERT promoter mutation has a surprisingly low PRIME score. We trained Random Forest models for 45 cancer-related transcription factors, and used these to score variations in the HeLa genome and somatic mutations across more than five hundred cancer genomes. Each model predicts only a small fraction of non-coding mutations with a potential impact on the function of the encompassing regulatory region.

In this circumstance, indoor wireless local area network (WLAN) personnel intrusion detection is one of the most promising approaches by considering its advantages of the handy accessibility of WLAN signal and convenient use of WLAN devices. Many existing studies rely on only the offline WLAN received signal strength (RSS) data to train a heuristic model, which is, then, used for online intrusion detection without considering the time-variant RSS property in the actual indoor environment. To address this problem, we propose a new maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) minimization based transfer learning approach for indoor WLAN personnel intrusion detection. Specifically, first of all, the source and target domains are constructed from offline labeled and online unlabeled RSS data, respectively. Second, the MMD of marginal distributions of the RSS data in source and target domains are calculated as the difference of these two domains. Third, the optimal transfer matrix corresponding to the minimum difference of source and target domains (or called minimum MMD) is constructed to transfer the RSS data in these two domains into the data in a same subspace.

However, very few previous works in the literature put their focus on predicting personality from Chinese texts. As Chinese texts are much more difficult to delimit than English texts, it poses more challenges in recognizing personality from Chinese texts. In this paper, we attempt to classify the personality traits from Chinese texts. We collected a dataset with posts and personality scores of 222 Facebook users who use Chinese as their main written language. Then, we used Jieba, a Chinese text segmentation tool, as the tokenizer for the task of text segmentation, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the learning algorithm for personality classification. Our experimental results show that the performance in precision and recall can be significantly improved with the help of text segmentation. Moreover, exploiting side information, such as the number of friends, could improve the performance further. One interesting finding from our experiments is that extraverts seem to write more sentences and use more common words than introverts.

Here we aimed to establish a protocol for soil mapping using legacy data, magnetic signature and soil attributes evaluation. A total of 493 soil samples were collected at 0\u20130.20 m in the geological domain of Western Plateau of Sao Paulo State. This work has three parts: First, we performed a classification analysis using soil mapping units (SMU) extracted from conventional soil map and Support Vector Machines algorithm (SVM). As covariates, we used categorical information, such as geology, dissection and landform maps. Second, we used soil attributes to perform a cluster analysis using k-means as partitioning method. To choose the optimal number of clusters, the same number of SMU showed in the conventional soil map (e.g. 34 clusters) were used. The last step was to compare soil and clusters maps predicted by SVM with the conventional soil map. Results showed good performance of SVM for both classifications (clusters and SMU), with overall accuracy of 0.60 and 0.90 respectively. In addition, the distribution of soil attributes within each cluster was more homogeneous and well distributed than within SMU, showing that is very possible to use numerical classification for soil mapping.

Extracting discriminative visual representations for vehicle re-identification is a challenging task due to the low-variance among the vehicles that share same model, brand, type, and color. Recently, several methods have been proposed for vehicle re-identification, that either use feature learning or metric learning approach. However, designing an efficient and cost-effective model is significantly demanded. In this paper, we propose multi-label-based similarity learning (MLSL) for vehicle re-identification obtaining an efficient deep-learning-based model that derives robust vehicle representations. Overall, our model features two main parts. First, a multi-label-based similarity learner that employs Siamese network on three different attributes of the vehicles: vehicle ID, color, and type. The second part is a regular CNN-based feature learner that employed to learn feature representations with vehicle ID attribute. The model is trained jointly with both parts. In order to validate the effectiveness of our model, a set of extensive experiments has been conducted on three of the largest well-known datasets VeRi-776, VehicleID, and VERI-Wild datasets. Furthermore, the parts of the proposed model are validated by exploring the influence of each part on the entire model performance.

The objective of feature selection algorithms is to choose a near-optimal subset of features from the original feature space to improve the performance of the decoding algorithm. The aim of our study was to compare the effects of four feature selection techniques, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Relative Importance, Principal Component Analysis, and Mutual Information Maximization on SVM classification performance for a dexterous decoding task. Approach A nonhuman primate (NHP) was trained to perform small coordinated movements \u2013 similar to typing. An array of microelectrodes was implanted in the hand area of the motor cortex of the NHP and used to record action potentials during finger movements. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to classify which finger movement the NHP was making based upon action potential firing rates. We used the SVM classification to examine the functional parameters of (i) robustness to simulated failure and (ii) longevity of classification. We also compared the effect of using isolated-neuron and multi-unit firing rates as the feature vector supplied to the SVM. Main results The average decoding accuracy for multi-unit features and single-unit features using Mutual Information Maximization (MIM) across 47 sessions was 96.74 \u00b1 3.5 % and 97.65 \u00b1 3.36 % respectively. The reduction in decoding accuracy between using 100% of the features and 10% of features based on MIM was 45.56 % (from 93.7 % to 51.09%) and 4.75% (from 95.32 % to 90.79%) for multi-unit and single-unit features respectively. MIM had best performance compared to other feature selection methods. Significance These results suggest improved decoding performance can be achieved by using optimally selected features. The results based on clinically relevant performance metrics also suggest that the decoding algorithm can be made robust by using optimal features and feature selection algorithms. We believe that even a few percent increase in performance is important and improves the decoding accuracy of the machine learning algorithm potentially increasing the ease of use of a brain machine interface.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5807908", "pubmed_id": "29467602", "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2018.00022", "venue": "Front.

This concept is applied to the existing algorithms, i.e., the Decision Directed Acyclic Graph (DDAG), the Adaptive Directed Acyclic Graph (ADAG), and Max Wins. Although there have been many previous attempts to use information such as the margin size and number of support vectors as the performance estimators for binary SVMs, this type of information may not accurately reflect the actual performance of the binary SVMs. We demonstrate that the generalization ability that is evaluated using a cross-validation mechanism is more suitable for directly extracting the actual performance of binary SVMs than the previous methods. Our methods are built around this performance measure, and each of them is crafted to overcome the weakness of the previous algorithms. The proposed methods include the Modified Reordering Adaptive Directed Acyclic Graph (MRADAG), Strong Elimination of the classifiers (SE), Weak Elimination of the classifiers (WE), and Voting-based Candidate Filtering (VCF). The experimental results demonstrate that our methods are more accurate than traditional methods.

Previous approaches utilize a two-step procedure (visible feature estimation and visible image reconstruction) to synthesize the visible image given the corresponding polarimetric thermal image. However, these are regarded as two disjoint steps and hence may hinder the performance of visible face reconstruction. We argue that joint optimization would be a better way to reconstruct more photo-realistic images for both computer vision algorithms and human-examiners to examine. To this end, this paper proposes a Generative Adversarial Network-based Visible Face Synthesis (GAN-VFS) method to synthesize more photo-realistic visible face images from their corresponding polarimetric images.

Previous texture classification methods mainly used the template matching based methods such as Support Vector Machine and k-Nearest-Neighbour for classification. Given enough training images the state-of-the-art texture classification methods could achieve very high classification accuracies on some benchmark databases. However, when the number of training images is limited, which usually happens in real-world applications because of the high cost of obtaining labelled data, the classification accuracies of those state-of-the-art methods would deteriorate due to the overfitting effect. In this paper we aim to develop a novel framework that could correctly classify textural images with only a small number of training images. By taking into account the repetition and sparsity property of textures we propose a sparse representation based multi-manifold analysis framework for texture classification from few training images. A set of new training samples are generated from each training image by a scale and spatial pyramid, and then the training samples belonging to each class are modelled by a manifold based on sparse representation. We learn a dictionary of sparse representation and a projection matrix for each class and classify the test images based on the projected reconstruction errors. The framework provides a more compact model than the template matching based texture classification methods, and mitigates the overfitting effect. Experimental results show that the proposed method could achieve reasonably high generalization capability even with as few as 3 training images, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art texture classification approaches on three benchmark datasets.

Our key idea is to adopt class signatures that keep track of feature embedding online with minor additional cost during training, and identify hard negative example candidates using the signatures. Given an anchor instance, our algorithm first selects a few hard negative classes based on the class-to-sample distances and then performs a refined search in an instance-level only from the selected classes. As most of the classes are discarded at the first step, it is much more efficient than exhaustive search while effectively mining a large number of hard examples.

Three transfer learning networks were trained and compared with a conventionally trained convolutional neural network. The first conclusion is that training, as expected, is considerably quicker when using transfer learning. More specifically, transfer learning utilizes pretrained networks and does not require the entire network to be trained, rather just parts of it. This results in faster training since less weights have to be updated per epoch of training. Here, training was approximately twice as fast per epoch compared to training a non-transfer learning network. The pretrained network used in this thesis was in fact also trained, something that in a practical transfer learning setting would already have been done. The data used to train the so called pretrained network originates from a different, although similar, domain. ::: ::: By keeping a varying number of convolutional layers from the pretrained network fixed, three networks were trained using transfer learning. This way, knowledge is said to be transferred from a previously solved problem to the current problem. The network called fine-tuning network 2 performed better than the two other transfer learning networks when tested in the simulator. After only 7 epochs of training, this network could drive around the entire track without going off-road, even at higher speeds. This is to be compared with the so called conventional network, trained under a classic machine learning setting. Not until having been trained for 18 epochs did the performance of the conventional network match the performance of the fine-tuning network 2, trained for merely 7 epochs.

In particular, the trend of fashion color is highly volatile. Without advanced methods, it is very hard to make fashion color trend forecasting with reasonably high accuracy, and it is a handicap for development of the intelligent expert systems in fashion industry. As a result, many prior works have employed traditional regression models like ARIMA or intelligent models such as artificial neural network (ANN) and grey model (GM) for conducting color trend forecasting. However, the reported accuracies of these forecasting methods vary a lot, and there are controversies in the literature on these models' performances. As a result, in this paper, we systematically compare the performances of ARIMA, ANN and GM models and their extended family methods. With real data analysis, our results show that the ANN family models, especially for Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), outperform the other models for forecasting fashion color trend.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2011.09.153", "venue": "Expert Syst.

To combat the problem of too few data points (not just in medicine but in deep learning in general), there have been multiple methods suggested for data augmentation from the simplest ones like random cropping and flipping to the more complicated ones like generating new images from white noise with Generative Adversarial Networks.

As the number of studies investigating these associations increases and the number of subjects in each study increases, a meta-analysis to identify the associations that are the most predictive of disease progression is warranted. We analyzed previously published 16S rRNA gene sequencing data collected from feces and colon tissue. We quantified the odds ratios (ORs) for individual bacterial taxa that were associated with an individual having tumors relative to a normal colon. Among the fecal samples, there were no taxa that had significant ORs associated with adenoma and there were 8 taxa with significant ORs associated with carcinoma. Similarly, among the tissue samples, there were no taxa that had a significant OR associated with adenoma and there were 3 taxa with significant ORs associated with carcinoma. Among the significant ORs, the association between individual taxa and tumor diagnosis was equal to or below 7.11. Because individual taxa had limited association with tumor diagnosis, we trained Random Forest classification models using only the taxa that had significant ORs, using the entire collection of taxa found in each study, and using operational taxonomic units defined based on a 97% similarity threshold. All training approaches yielded similar classification success as measured using the area under the curve. The ability to correctly classify individuals with adenomas was poor, and the ability to classify individuals with carcinomas was considerably better using sequences from feces or tissue.IMPORTANCE Colorectal cancer is a significant and growing health problem in which animal models and epidemiological data suggest that the colonic microbiota have a role in tumorigenesis. These observations indicate that the colonic microbiota is a reservoir of biomarkers that may improve our ability to detect colonic tumors using noninvasive approaches. This meta-analysis identifies and validates a set of 8 bacterial taxa that can be used within a Random Forest modeling framework to differentiate individuals as having normal colons or carcinomas. When models trained using one data set were tested on other data sets, the models performed well. These results lend support to the use of fecal biomarkers for the detection of tumors. Furthermore, these biomarkers are plausible candidates for further mechanistic studies into the role of the gut microbiota in tumorigenesis.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5989068", "pubmed_id": "29871916", "doi": "10.1128/mBio.00630-18", "venue": "mBio", "journal": "mBio", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2791942296", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["215262178", "162180509", "55594218", "71144786", "58768020", "167211144"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46943628"}

Constructing an accurate classifier from imbalanced data is a challenging task. Traditional classifiers that aim to maximize the overall prediction accuracy tend to classify all data into the majority class. In this paper, we study an ensemble system of feature selection and data sampling for the class imbalance problem. We systematically analyze various sampling techniques by examining the efficacy of different rates and types of undersampling, oversampling, and a combination of over and undersampling approaches. We thoroughly examine six widely used feature selection algorithms to identify significant biomarkers and thereby reduce the complexity of the data. The efficacy of the ensemble techniques is evaluated using two different classifiers including Random Forest and Support Vector Machines based on classification accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity measures. Our extensive experimental results show that for various problem settings in ADNI, (1) a balanced training set obtained with K-Medoids technique based undersampling gives the best overall performance among different data sampling techniques and no sampling approach; and (2) sparse logistic regression with stability selection achieves competitive performance among various feature selection algorithms.

Predicting PPIs is thus critical in making new discoveries in the biological domains. Traditionally, new PPIs are identified through biochemical experiments but such methods are labor-intensive, expensive, time-consuming and technically ineffective due to high false positive rates. Computational docking is an alternative but requires the three-dimensional structures of the target proteins which are not always accessible. Sequence-based prediction is the most readily applicable and cost-effective method. It exploits known PPI Databases to construct classifiers for predicting unknown PPIs based only on sequence data. However, existing methods, adopting features that fix the pattern length and use exact patterns, are biologically unrealistic. Also, those based on SVM and String Kernel are hardly biologically interpretable since they do not compute the features. Recently, we have developed a new method for predicting PPI known as WeMine-P2P based on our WeMine Aligned Pattern Clustering algorithm which discovers and identifies the localized and co-occurring conserved patterns and regions allowing variable length and pattern variations. As our first attempt, under 40 independent experiments, we showed that (1) WeMine-P2P outperforms the well-known algorithm, PIPE2 which also utilizes co-occurring amino acid sequence segments but does not allow variable lengths and pattern variations; (2) Unlike SVM-based methods, WeMine-P2P renders interpretable biological features; (3) WeMine-P2P achieves satisfactory PPI prediction performance, comparable to the SVM-based methods particularly in unseen protein sequences, with a potential reduction of feature dimension of 1280x.

However, both numerical methods (like MoM) and approximation methods (like PO) have obvious shortcomings: low efficiency of the former and poor accuracy of the latter. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid approach of uniform design (UD) and support vector regression (SVR) to assist analysis of electromagnetic monostatic scattering from complex targets. The core idea of this approach is to establish an efficient and reliable regression model through effective sampling. Uniform design is adopted to guide sampling backscattering data for its capability of producing samples with high representativeness. For the sake of efficiency, good lattice point with power generator is selected to construct large uniform designs, which can ensure that the obtained uniform design tables have considerable uniformity while greatly reducing the computational complexity. Afterward, with the aid of multilevel fast multipole method (MLFMM), the required datasets are established on the simulation data of a SLICY model and then are utilized to train the support vector regression (SVR) model so as to obtain an efficient and accurate nonlinear regressor. Finally, comparison of the two approaches, one of which is the support vector regression (SVR) combined with uniform design (UD) and the other is that combined with centrally located sampling (CLS), is taken into account, and the result shows that the proposed method can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of regression model and the analysis efficiency of target electromagnetic scattering characteristics.

Connectionism contrasts with the older tradition, that of explaining intelligent behaviour in terms of the manipulation of complex symbol structures. Without expecting either style of research to be exclusively correct, it is still important to seek out the relative strenghts and weaknesses of each. The partisans of the two camps have taken-up the challenge; the controversy has been fierce, as befits the prize-acceptance as the best technique for understanding people and building intelligent systems. Language, the quintessential human activity, is often used as a touchstone for the two approaches. The traditional approach views language as composed of symbols and language use as the manipulatoin of symbol structures. Connectionists have largely conceded to this, accepting the idea of structure as an essential component of language. This text calls into question this common assumption, that \"structure is necessary for language modelling\", by presenting a generator which produces appropriate natural language utterances without building structures along the way.

This challenge is particularly difficult when attempting to detect H/ACA molecules which are involved in converting uridine to pseudouridine on rRNA in trypanosomes, because these organisms have unique H/ACA molecules (termed H/ACA-like) that lack several of the features that characterize H/ACA molecules in most other organisms.ResultsWe present here a computational tool called Psiscan, which was designed to detect H/ACA-like molecules in trypanosomes. We started by analyzing known H/ACA-like molecules and characterized their crucial elements both computationally and experimentally.Next, we set up constraints based on this analysis and additional phylogenic and functional data to rapidly scan three trypanosome genomes (T. brucei, T. cruzi and L. major) for sequences that observe these constraints and are conserved among the species. In the next step, we used minimal energy calculation to select the molecules that are predicted to fold into a lowest energy structure that is consistent with the constraints. In the final computational step, we used a Support Vector Machine that was trained on known H/ACA-like molecules as positive examples and on negative examples of molecules that were identified by the computational analyses but were shown experimentally not to be H/ACA-like molecules. The leading candidate molecules predicted by the SVM model were then subjected to experimental validation.ConclusionThe experimental validation showed 11 molecules to be expressed (4 out of 25 in the intermediate stage and 7 out of 19 in the final validation after the machine learning stage). Five of these 11 molecules were further shown to be bona fide H/ACA-like molecules. As snoRNA in trypanosomes are organized in clusters, the new H/ACA-like molecules could be used as starting points to manually search for additional molecules in their neighbourhood. All together this study increased our repertoire by fourteen H/ACA-like and six C/D snoRNAs molecules from T. brucei and L. Major. In addition the experimental analysis revealed that six ncRNA molecules that are expressed are not downregulated in CBF5 silenced cells, suggesting that they have structural features of H/ACA-like molecules but do not have their standard function. We termed this novel class of molecules AGA-like, and we are exploring their function.This study demonstrates the power of tight collaboration between computational and experimental approaches in a combined effort to reveal the repertoire of ncRNA molecles.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2613932", "pubmed_id": "18986541", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-9-471", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2113436992", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["23952829", "15552500", "24914627", "8968788", "20531692", "6444114", "14077025", "10418885", "8146169", "42119953", "11680329", "44527461", "22440783", "5514004", "35522140", "5983679", "16668970", "15635314", "33590178", "4386715", "25902425", "12743245", "4659872", "24234596", "19232906", "26115862", "20652280", "14214185", "31101823", "39832974", "20922309", "34251428", "34120982", "6957467", "30083552", "2231549", "24604370", "8084145", "24520927", "24838854", "24860413", "6322611", "8739473", "1288507", "1288507", "216463", "14658506", "25920814", "18649858", "14441902", "13494853", "7138354", "44258160", "9231289", "8043436", "23281754", "12506541", "8712839", "13047538", "4399576"], "inbound_citations": ["205896312", "8688667", "215532541", "28901951", "14364675", "15545018", "16183380", "15071316", "33920895", "11496056", "7872590"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7671840"}

Classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data for imagined motor movements has been a challenge in the design and development of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs). There are two principle challenges. The first is the variability in the recorded EEG data, which manifests across trials as well as across individuals. Consequently, features that are more discriminative need to be identified before any pattern recognition technique can be applied. The second challenge is in the pattern recognition domain. The number of data samples in a class of interest, e.g. a specific action, is a small fraction of the total data, which is composed of samples corresponding to all actions of all users. Building a robust classifier when learning from a highly unbalanced dataset is very difficult; minimizing the classification error typically causes the larger class to overwhelm the smaller one. We show that the combination of 'classifiability' for selecting the optimal frequency band and the use of the Twin Support Vector Machine (Twin SVM) for classification, yields significantly improved generalization. On benchmark BCI Competition datasets, the proposed approach often yields up to 20% improvement over the state-of-the-art.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2015.01.018", "venue": "Appl.

Most existing group recommendation employed the predefined static aggregation strategies to aggregate the preferences of different group members, but these static strategies cannot simulate the dynamic group decision-making. Meanwhile, most of these methods depend on intuitions or assumptions to analyze the influence of group members and lack of convincing theoretical support. We argue that the influence of group members plays a particularly important role in group decision-making and it can better assist group profile modeling and perform more accurate group recommendation. To tackle the issue of preference aggregation for group recommendation, we propose a novel attentive aggregation representation learning method based on sociological theory for group recommendation, namely SIAGR (short for \"Social Influence-based Attentive Group Recommendation\"), which takes attention mechanisms and the popular method (BERT) as the aggregation representation for group profile modeling. Specifically, we analyze the influence of group members based on social identity theory and two-step flow theory and exploit an attentive mavens mining method.

This paper illustrates a methodology to accomplish such tasks. The main idea of the proposed procedure follows the supervised classification paradigm. The first step is to layer the available data for the same region in different time periods. Then evaluate a number of predefined cues for the whole region and use some manually collected positive and negative samples to train a classifier. Finally this classifier can be used to assert change in the remaining data. The base data chosen are very high resolution orthoimages and digital surface models (DSMs) because they offer both the radiometric and geometric information needed for robust change detection. The classifier selected is the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm because it offers some significant advantages over alternative methods. These advantages include convergence to a global maximum, requirement of a small number of training samples and the availability of good open source implementations. In the paper, emphasis is given in testing the proposed strategy with simulated data, to access its validity and performance aspects. The simulated data were produced automatically with a program developed especially for this purpose. Noise is gradually imported to the testing data to make them more realistic. Noise can be a combination of random radiometric noise for the images, geometric noise for the buildings depicted in the images and finally height noise for the DSMs. Different setups were planned and implemented in all of which the results indicate that the proposed methodology has good performance.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2183942256", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["130861770", "207165665", "194951", "129084128", "961425", "8267639", "12860239", "5471175", "115205884", "195902579"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61866814"}

Specifically, we address the issues in constructing a kernel for matching sequences of feature vectors extracted from the speech signal data of utterances. The codebook based IMK and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based IMK have been proposed earlier for matching the varying length patterns represented as sets of features vectors for tasks such as image classification and speaker recognition. These methods consider the centers of clusters and the components of GMM as the virtual feature vectors used in the design of IMK. As these methods do not use sequence information in matching the patterns, these methods are not suitable for matching sequential patterns. We propose the hidden Markov model (HMM) based IMK for matching sequential patterns of varying length. We consider two approaches to design the HMM-based IMK. In the first approach, each of the two sequences to be matched is segmented into subsequences with each subsequence aligned to a state of the HMM. Then the HMM-based IMK is constructed as a combination of state-specific GMM-based IMKs that match the subsequences aligned with the particular states of the HMM. In the second approach, the HMM-based IMK is constructed without segmenting sequences, and by matching the local feature vectors selected using the responsibility terms that account for being in a state and generating the feature vectors by a component of the GMM of that state.

Thirty private car drivers were enrolled to perform field experiments on a busy route selected in Wuhan, China, where drivers\u2019 anger could be induced by the elicitation events within limited time. Meanwhile, three types of data sets including driver physiology, driving behaviors and vehicle motions, were collected by multiple sensors. The results indicate that 13 selected features including skin conductance, relative energy spectrum of \u03b2 band of electroencephalogram, standard deviation (SD) of pedaling speed of gas pedal, SD of steering wheel angle rate, vehicle speed, SD of speed, SD of forward acceleration and SD of lateral acceleration have significant impact on driving anger states. The IAMB-LSSVM model achieves an accuracy with 82.20% which is 2.03%, 3.15%, 4.34%, 7.84% and 8.36% higher than IAMB using C4.5, NBC, SVM, KNN and BPNN, respectively. The results are beneficial to design driving anger detecting or intervening devices in intelligent human-machine systems.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2019/2745381", "venue": null, "journal": "Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2923762039", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["110396568", "35471878", "31936810", "3690270", "6258457", "142736613", "112628057", "15060022", "27909510", "111277305", "39998443", "58368164", "17724812", "35682622", "6198122", "18222600", "35067298", "5359376", "16049793", "108944060", "9364589", "16479281", "15229888", "17105064", "214858144", "25890052", "16700749", "114636123", "111200122", "1455429", "1138399", "16011294", "6301398", "1930258", "117866550", "52874011", "207579947", "17054045", "7367791", "28663487", "40901995", "24812054", "143265955", "143929672", "144492123", "52220398", "205177513"], "inbound_citations": ["212667134"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127039359"}

The second level is based on bag-of-word (BOW) model using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with close-ups detected in the first level. In training part, codebook is generated without close-ups according to the annotation; while in the testing part, the scores of close-ups pre-detected in the first level are calculated in low weights to make late fusion.

As sodium boiling induces acoustic emission, the method consists in real time analysis of acoustic signals measured through wave guides. Auto Regressive (AR) models are estimated on sliding windows and are classified in boiling or non-boiling models using Support Vector Machines (SVM). One of the difficulties to cope with is disturbances due to the influence of some environment noises like the liquid coolant cavitation, vortex flow, shaft vibration and mechanical pump noise. These disturbances can generate false alarms or mask the boiling. The proposed method is designed to be robust toward these disturbances. Furthermore, the SVM are designed to be robust toward the operating mode changing. The application for online monitoring is made on data obtained from French nuclear power plant Phenix and boiling sound signals generated from laboratory experiments. Different acoustic boiling sound levels are used and the effectiveness of the method is shown by the good detection rate and its low false alarm rate even for low acoustic boiling sound level.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3182/20140824-6-ZA-1003.01154", "venue": null, "journal": "IFAC Proceedings Volumes", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1980783447", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["138428210", "60167398", "109518209", "120255030", "117796071", "136769157", "118443675", "17749612", "57009570", "109204253"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56367076"}

In this paper, a deep and bidirectional representation learning model is proposed to address the issue of image\u2013text cross-modal retrieval. Owing to the solid progress of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing, it is reliable to extract semantic representations from both raw image and text data by using deep neural networks. Therefore, in the proposed model, two convolution-based networks are adopted to accomplish representation learning for images and texts. By passing the networks, images and texts are mapped to a common space, in which the cross-modal similarity is measured by cosine distance. Subsequently, a bidirectional network architecture is designed to capture the property of the cross-modal retrieval\u2014the bidirectional search. Such architecture is characterized by simultaneously involving the matched and unmatched image\u2013text pairs for training. Accordingly, a learning framework with maximum likelihood criterion is finally developed. The network parameters are optimized via backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. A great deal of experiments are conducted to sufficiently evaluate the proposed method on three publicly released datasets: IAPRTC-12, Flickr30k, and Flickr8k.

In this paper, we propose a Clustered Support Vector Machine (CSVM), which tackles the data in a divide and conquer manner. More specifically, CSVM groups the data into several clusters, followed which it trains a linear support vector machine in each cluster to separate the data locally. Meanwhile, CSVM has an additional global regularization, which requires the weight vector of each local linear SVM aligning with a global weight vector. The global regularization leverages the information from one cluster to another, and avoids over-fitting in each cluster. We derive a data-dependent generalization error bound for CSVM, which explains the advantage of CSVM over linear SVM. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms linear SVM and some other related locally linear classifiers.

Pull requests are a common practice for contributing and reviewing contributions, and are employed both in open-source and industrial contexts. One of the main goals of code reviews is to find defects in the code, allowing project maintainers to easily integrate external contributions into a project and discuss the code contributions. Objective. The goal of this paper is to understand whether code quality is actually considered when pull requests are accepted. Specifically, we aim at understanding whether code quality issues such as code smells, antipatterns, and coding style violations in the pull request code affect the chance of its acceptance when reviewed by a maintainer of the project. Method. We conducted a case study among 28 Java open-source projects, analyzing the presence of 4.7 M code quality issues in 36 K pull requests. We analyzed further correlations by applying Logistic Regression and seven machine learning techniques (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost). Results. Unexpectedly, code quality turned out not to affect the acceptance of a pull request at all. As suggested by other works, other factors such as the reputation of the maintainer and the importance of the feature delivered might be more important than code quality in terms of pull request acceptance. Conclusions. Researchers already investigated the influence of the developers' reputation and the pull request acceptance. This is the first work investigating if quality of the code in pull requests affects the acceptance of the pull request or not.

These techniques solve two cardinal problems: learning from experimental data by neural networks and support vector based techniques and embedding existing structured human knowledge into fuzzy models. Support vector based models are one of the most commonly used soft computing techniques. Support vector based models are strong in feature selection and to achieve robust models and fuzzy logic helps to improve the interpretability of models. This paper deals with combining these existing soft computing techniques to get interpretable but accurate models for industrial purposes. The paper describes that trained support vector based models can be used for the construction of fuzzy rule-based classifier or regression models. However, the transformed support vector model does not automatically result in an interpretable fuzzy model because the support vector model results in a complex rulebase, where the number of rules is approximately 40-60% of the number of the training data. Hence, reduction of the support model-initialized fuzzy model is an essential task. For this purpose, a three-step reduction algorithm is used on the combination of previously published model reduction techniques. In the first step, the identification of the SV model is followed by the application of the Reduced Set method to decrease the number of kernel functions. The reduced SV model is then transformed into a fuzzy rule-based model. The interpretability of a fuzzy model highly depends on the distribution of the membership functions. Hence, the second reduction step is achieved by merging similar fuzzy sets based on a similarity measure. Finally, in the third step, an orthogonal least-squares method is used to reduce the number of rules and re-estimate the consequent parameters of the fuzzy rule-based model. The proposed approach is applied for classification problems and applied for Hammerstein system identification to illustrate the effectiveness of the technique.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1515/126", "venue": null, "journal": "Hungarian Journal of Industrial Chemistry", "mag_id": "2264869581", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6436919"}

We show here that these approximations are learnable by proving the consistency of a class of connectionist nonparametric regression estimators for arbitrary (square integrable) regression functions. The consistency property ensures that as network \u201cexperience\u201d accumulates (as indexed by the size of the training set), the probability of network approximation error exceeding any specified level tends to zero. A key feature of the demonstration of consistency is the proper control of the growth of network complexity as a function of network experience. We give specific growth rates for network complexity compatible with consistency. We also consider automatic and semi-automatic data-driven methods for determining network complexity in applications, based on minimization of a cross-validated average squared error measure of network performance. We recommend cross-validated average squared error as a generally applicable criterion for comparing relative performance of differing network architectures and configurations.", "year": 1990, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/0893-6080(90)90004-5", "venue": "Neural Networks", "journal": "Neural Networks", "mag_id": "2108959409", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["2755829", "1356803", "59432396", "15811228", "15563522", "775282", "17711308", "158118880", "155596001", "708461", "9426606", "1333479", "22935660", "59043114", "10524521", "8635657", "16639813", "25875085", "15799500", "7390920", "59144546", "13917175", "2667075", "14694137", "9806025", "153346406", "17115680", "4033249", "42627655", "1953974", "14033895", "32039777", "17224356", "912058", "3974377", "13926044", "5860393", "16021403", "125445833", "8777588", "14289662", "61976671", "18789328", "9158019", "10391331", "14281012", "201662886", "13923011", "13302522", "1840310", "14407279", "16738918", "10790318", "17511302", "62841405", "6623676", "2959708", "1964734", "11014114", "18567753", "9112257", "32637473", "60255118", "8765914", "521464", "109412164", "1585539", "18861613", "44188678", "11930318", "158184844", "37258674", "9764826", "16130385", "119880166", "54907481", "3951151", "9872883", "45258750", "207632205", "19891149", "18852935", "14767959", "14677042", "18228486", "1830249", "9041841", "14689936", "16843489", "16569773", "10248156", "8548972", "15588599", "62959231", "41609476", "422553", "26375859", "60871653", "2960896", "5737352", "16685256", "13246246", "15388955", "60871875", "15682422", "8779482", "33078768", "11825398", "33807579", "10739264", "55989649", "10627564", "30169091", "154756264", "18748004", "40558308", "8926225", "110356180", "15197865", "174777162", "17410031", "5395660", "126276620", "3039405", "61206849", "31454716", "61487570", "8784842", "14111206", "17199850", "11370244", "55804243", "15459104", "6317612", "14047190", "14540447", "12680851", "4006567", "15457746", "13208205", "2292050", "112432056", "214774839", "30317336", "18536901", "13899477", "110775578", "54534859", "118258036", "18983706", "206458141", "18890934", "14862874", "7746941", "19034064", "15890674", "3938145", "56052809", "109222421", "8263038", "199751", "14862043", "16659145", "172129945", "64731894", "8956913", "16584565", "173990470", "7669909", "2839784", "17889860", "12116190", "17023161", "15765644", "54063254", "49324001", "15846628", "3989562", "15491350", "195838494", "1680224", "16207180", "18521581", "17647677", "60784562", "195716247", "8041143", "18864932", "11833396", "18264234", "18358419", "15270277", "18290114", "2347812", "2715760", "6844886", "18631011", "15697919", "54724577", "3217669", "208041551", "14328787", "2101439", "31146700", "5623722", "1119517", "48201742", "6484366", "54041781", "55101470", "11509671", "56028373", "14520562", "61286855", "206459021", "36108598", "10930597", "15485349", "10226604", "55399358", "124320776", "30427317", "5228733", "53383491", "113687", "10204371", "117002842", "54545147", "4067479", "2326805", "207018228", "16950903", "10796151", "26780830", "9397418", "1942898", "7742196", "26517551", "17318847", "16462078", "60993246", "7665617", "4097174", "1539097", "28814206", "17450563", "8972544", "11306228", "3644317", "15131313", "60106964", "4109479", "16571491"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:205119351"}

We propose a novel framework for generating synthetic data that closely approximates the joint distribution of variables in an original EHR dataset, providing a readily accessible, legally and ethically appropriate solution to support more open data sharing, enabling the development of AI solutions. In order to address issues around lack of clarity in defining sufficient anonymization, we created a quantifiable, mathematical definition for \"identifiability\". We used a conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN) framework to generate synthetic data while minimize patient identifiability that is defined based on the probability of re-identification given the combination of all data on any individual patient. We compared models fitted to our synthetically generated data to those fitted to the real data across four independent datasets to evaluate similarity in model performance, while assessing the extent to which original observations can be identified from the synthetic data.

Learning from imbalanced data (two or more classes) creates additional complexities. Studies suggest that ensemble methods can produce more accurate results than regular Imbalance learning techniques (sampling and cost-sensitive learning). To deal with the problem, we propose a new hybrid under sampling based ensemble approach (HUSBoost) to handle imbalanced data which includes three basic steps- data cleaning, data balancing and classification steps. At first, we remove the noisy data using Tomek-Links. After that we create several balanced subsets by applying random under sampling (RUS) method to the majority class instances. These under sampled majority class instances and the minority class instances constitute the subsets of the imbalanced data-set. Having the same number of majority and minority class instances, they become balanced subsets of data. Then in each balanced subset, random forest (RF), AdaBoost with decision tree (CART) and AdaBoost with Support Vector Machine (SVM) are implemented in parallel where we use soft voting approach to get the combined result. From these ensemble classifiers we get the average result from all the balanced subsets.

We found that imputation accuracy was robust to increasing missing rates, and consistently higher in rice than in alfalfa. Accuracy was as high as 90\u2013100 % for the major (most frequent) homozygous genotype, but dropped to 80\u201390 % (rice) and below 30 % (alfalfa) in the minor homozygous genotype. Beagle was the best performing method, both accuracy- and time-wise, in rice.

Analytical expressions for the spectrum of the output point process are used to evaluate transfer function estimation procedures. The detectability of the spectral peak at the modulation frequency depends on the record length and upon the bias and variance contributed by the underlying point process. Detectability is found to increase with regularity of the underlying point process when stimulus frequency is much lower than spike rate, decreases with regularity when the stimulus frequency is about equal to spike rate, and be nearly independent of regularity at high frequencies. These results suggest certain procedures for evaluating the transfer function: 1) at low stimulus frequencies direct estimate of the spectrum is appropriate, 2) at middle frequencies, close to the spike rate, an estimate of the period point density may improve the detectabiity of the spectral peak, and 3) at middle frequencies, broad-band noise added to the sinusoidal stimulus may improve the estimate by decreasing the regularity of the underlying point process. Evaluation of the transfer function using broad-band rather than sinusoidal stimulus may have the advantage of decreasing bias and variance due to regularity of the underlying process, but may introduce a bias of unknown spectral character due to the response of the linear system itself and contribute a nonuniform spectral density at high frequencies.", "year": 1980, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "6244222", "doi": "10.1109/TBME.1980.326612", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2055610492", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13382961", "31704361", "189027239", "24944571", "2930842", "118551075", "10457172", "125997195", "6684918", "37609495", "30989532", "119789719", "1112399", "13445409", "33000165"], "inbound_citations": ["6529772", "41521594", "11398396", "2050038", "11223046", "21800669", "44231455", "62628335", "30247065", "9828341", "22488979", "14309556", "123646924", "62487757"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20988324"}

The first phase identifies and quantifies abnormalities at certain heights in a flight. The second phase ranks all flights to identify the most abnormal; each phase using a one class classifier.

However, several relevant research topics have demonstrated that such condition may not always describe the real scenarios. One particular case is that the patterns are equipped with diverse and changeable style information. In this paper, a novel classification framework named Style Neutralization Generative Adversarial Classifier (SN-GAC), based on an upgraded U-Net architecture, and trained adversarially with the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, is introduced to accomplish the classification in such disparate and inconsistent data information case. The generative model in SN-GAC neutralizes style information from the original style-discriminative patterns (style-source) by building the mapping function from them to their style-free counterparts (corresponding standard examples, standard-target). A well-learned generator in the SN-GAC framework is capable of producing the targeted style-neutralized data (generated-target), satisfying the i.i.d. condition. Additionally, SN-GAC is trained adversarially, where an independent discriminator is used to surveil and supervise the training progress of the above-mentioned generator by distinguishing between the real and the generated. Simultaneously, an auxiliary classifier is also embedded in the discriminator to assign the correct class label of both the real and generated data. This process proves effective to aid the generator to produce high-quality human-readable style-neutralized patterns. It will then be further fine-tuned for the sake of promoting the final classification performance.

Then it proposes an automated diagnosis system for the identification of heart valve diseases based on the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification of heart sounds. This system performs a highly difficult diagnostic task (even for experienced physicians), much more difficult than the basic diagnosis of the existence or not of a heart valve disease (i.e. the classification of a heart sound as 'healthy' or 'having a heart valve disease'): it identifies the particular heart valve disease. The system was applied in a representative global dataset of 198 heart sound signals, which come both from healthy medical cases and from cases suffering from the four most usual heart valve diseases: aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation (AR), mitral stenosis (MS) and mitral regurgitation (MR). Initially the heart sounds were successfully categorized using a SVM classifier as normal or disease-related and then the corresponding murmurs in the unhealthy cases were classified as systolic or diastolic. For the heart sounds diagnosed as having systolic murmur we used a SVM classifier for performing a more detailed classification of them as having aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation. Similarly for the heart sounds diagnosed as having diastolic murmur we used a SVM classifier for classifying them as having aortic regurgitation or mitral stenosis.

Specifically, CILDC integrates base classifiers through the double subspaces strategy and the random under-sampling preprocessing. Further, one simple but effective confidence disturbance technique is introduced to CILDC to tune the threshold deviation for imbalanced samples. In detail, the disturbance coefficients are multiplied to various confidence vectors before interpolating in each level of CILDC, and the ideal threshold can be adaptively learned through the cascade structure. Furthermore, both the Random Forest and the Naive Bayes are suitable to be the base classifier for CILDC.

This leads to false detections when the camera moves. While this can sometimes be addressed by online image registration, this approach is prone to dramatic failures and long-term drift. We present a novel background subtraction algorithm designed for pan-tilt-zoom cameras that overcomes this challenge without the need for explicit image registration. The proposed algorithm automatically trains a discriminative background model, which is global in the sense that it is the same regardless of image location. Our approach first extracts multiple features from across the image and uses principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. The extracted features are then grouped to form a Bag of Features. A global background model is then learned from the bagged features using Support Vector Machine. The proposed approach is fast and accurate. Having a single global model makes it computationally inexpensive in comparison to traditional pixel-wise models. It outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms on the CDnet 2014 pan-tilt-zoom and baseline categories and Hopkins155 dataset. In particular, it achieves an F-Measure of 75.41% on the CDnet dataset PTZ category, significantly better than the previously reported best score of 62.07%.

However, f-MMD has serious challenges in facing datasets with large number of samples and features. Moreover, f-MMD ignores the feature-label relation in finding the reduced representation of dataset. In this paper, we exploit jointly transfer learning and class discrimination to cope with domain shift problem on which the distribution difference is considerably large.

Specifically, ROWA reduces the distribution difference across domains in an unsupervised manner where no label is available in the test set. Moreover, ROWA exploits feature-label relation to separate various classes alongside the domain transfer, and augments the relation of selected features and source domain labels. In this work, we employ disjoint/overlapping small-sized samplesets to iteratively converge to final solution.

Firstly, Physical differences of the 5 litchi varieties were compared in this study. Secondly, the response curves from the electronic nose (PEN3) were recorded for all the samples of the five litchi varieties. Variance Analysis (VA) was used for best characteristic value selection. Finally, via different pattern recognition techniques, including the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA), the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the loading analysis (Loadings), it is found that PCA and LDA have a poor performance in classifying litchi varieties. The classification accuracy of the PNN model with training set and test set were 100 and 84%, respectively. As to the SVM model, the classification accuracy of training set and test set were 100 and 92%, respectively. According to the Loadings results, the sensors R3, R5, R8 and R1 can be chosen for developing special and simple instruments for the detection of litchi volatiles.

However, in most cases, labeled data are expensive or even impossible to obtain, while unlabeled data are readily available from numerous free on-line resources and have been exploited to improve the performance of deep neural networks. To better exploit the power of unlabeled data for image recognition, in this paper, we propose a semi-supervised and generative approach, namely the semi-supervised self-growing generative adversarial network (SGGAN). Label inference is a key step for the success of semi-supervised learning approaches. There are two main problems in label inference: how to measure the confidence of the unlabeled data and how to generalize the classifier. We address these two problems via the generative framework and a novel convolution-block-transformation technique, respectively. To stabilize and speed up the training process of SGGAN, we employ the metric Maximum Mean Discrepancy as the feature matching objective function and achieve larger gain than the standard semi-supervised GANs (SSGANs), narrowing the gap to the supervised methods. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed SGGAN on image recognition and facial attribute recognition tasks. By using the training data with only 4% labeled facial attributes, the SGGAN approach can achieve comparable accuracy with leading supervised deep learning methods with all labeled facial attributes.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1908.03850", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2968706510", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52839547", "18828233", "2057420", "14125992", "6980765", "5039517", "6702706", "11700226", "13180190", "7138078", "206597351", "84591", "9127770", "4497821", "5523629", "1033682", "5216145", "10742222", "4399014", "206594692", "189927954", "5017487", "5808102", "289401", "18268744", "207763512", "945967", "1151924", "3136364", "14542261", "4685015", "4789479", "52840145", "3093707", "4957033", "1773932", "459456", "1972072", "16489696", "9398766", "23178661", "16852518", "14838925", "11758569", "9530176", "1687220", "14124313", "6230637", "206592484", "11530562", "206726827", "201070350", "14083350", "189928435", "4715123", "49665770", "26598341", "7620274", "48358665", "189928290", "150088786", "50780591", "6943286", "15876696", "40097546", "23848396"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199543700"}

The protocol utilizes the concentric ring mechanism to guide the route researching direction and adopts the optimal routing selection to maintain the data delivery route in mobile sink WSN.

Classifiers deployed in the real world operate in a dynamic environment, where the data distribution can change over time. These changes, referred to as concept drift, can cause the predictive performance of the classifier to drop over time, thereby making it obsolete. To be of any real use, these classifiers need to detect drifts and be able to adapt to them, over time. Detecting drifts has traditionally been approached as a supervised task, with labeled data constantly being used for validating the learned model. Although effective in detecting drifts, these techniques are impractical, as labeling is a difficult, costly and time consuming activity. On the other hand, unsupervised change detection techniques are unreliable, as they produce a large number of false alarms. The inefficacy of the unsupervised techniques stems from the exclusion of the characteristics of the learned classifier, from the detection process. In this paper, we propose the Margin Density Drift Detection (MD3) algorithm, which tracks the number of samples in the uncertainty region of a classifier, as a metric to detect drift. The MD3 algorithm is a distribution independent, application independent, model independent, unsupervised and incremental algorithm for reliably detecting drifts from data streams. Experimental evaluation on 6 drift induced datasets and 4 additional datasets from the cybersecurity domain demonstrates that the MD3 approach can reliably detect drifts, with significantly fewer false alarms compared to unsupervised feature based drift detectors. At the same time, it produces performance comparable to that of a fully labeled drift detector. The reduced false alarms enables the signaling of drifts only when they are most likely to affect classification performance. As such, the MD3 approach leads to a detection scheme which is credible, label efficient and general in its applicability.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1704.00023", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2017.04.008", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2951607121,2605253252", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15482227", "2263623", "15672006", "2304759", "2279539", "15280483", "1006989", "1062269", "15506682", "961425", "319585", "5246200", "6737690", "7553535", "56776745", "1249503", "868339", "17329633", "16674684", "16115682", "2606652", "7062460", "10752012", "7782821", "21857", "7194768", "19277476", "2702042", "6006612", "53605988", "10651142", "1190181", "14821438", "13137869", "7235926", "7553359", "23207009", "121530032", "10659969", "8902334", "58541221", "14823702", "38148514", "1554031", "32525815", "16176206", "16773074", "207319017", "14615065", "10740822", "11815171", "11006612", "4528546", "30906511", "14644827", "9350679", "14687075"], "inbound_citations": ["52988978", "68031879", "203626542", "4787489", "49486772", "208611288", "211817832", "52926030", "52160882", "167220747", "211506808", "203606027", "207757814", "182314372", "51613833", "203640800", "59231750", "203952120", "202749919", "210931035", "4370300", "59236253", "57754369", "203181934"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5809989"}

Both of them have their own advantages and limitations. For instance, although classification algorithms are more powerful than clustering methods in predicting class labels of objects, they do not perform well when there is a lack of sufficient manually labeled reliable data. On the other hand, although clustering algorithms do not produce label information for objects, they provide supplementary constraints (e.g., if two objects are clustered together, it is more likely that the same label is assigned to both of them) that one can leverage for label prediction of a set of unknown objects. Therefore, systematic utilization of both these types of algorithms together can lead to better prediction performance. In this paper, We propose a novel algorithm, called EC3 that merges classification and clustering together in order to support both binary and multi-class classification. EC3 is based on a principled combination of multiple classification and multiple clustering methods using an optimization function. We theoretically show the convexity and optimality of the problem and solve it by block coordinate descent method. We additionally propose iEC3, a variant of EC3 that handles imbalanced training data. We perform an extensive experimental analysis by comparing EC3 and iEC3 with 14 baseline methods (7 well-known standalone classifiers, 5 ensemble classifiers, and 2 existing methods that merge classification and clustering) on 13 standard benchmark datasets. We show that our methods outperform other baselines for every single dataset, achieving at most 10% higher AUC.

Therefore, users cannot access the other models explicitly. In contrast to this, multiple model enumeration attracts increasing interests in non-standard machine learning applications where other criteria, e.g., interpretability or fairness, than accuracy are main concern and a user may want to access more than one non-optimal, but suitable models. In this paper, we propose a K-best model enumeration algorithm for Support Vector Machines (SVM) that given a dataset S and an integer K>0, enumerates the K-best models on S with distinct support vectors in the descending order of the objective function values in the dual SVM problem.

The shadow detection part executes a Binary conversion supervised by Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and a Canny Edge Detector followed by Image Imposing. The pixel restoration part has two phases. An examplebased learning phase and a conclusion phase. In the example-based learning phase, the positions of the shadow and non-shadow pixels are observed and stored in different libraries named as shadow and non-shadow library. By exploiting their Markov Property, the samples are connected by Markov Random Field (MRF). In the conclusion part, the relationship learnt from MRF is used for Decision Making by Bayesian Belief Propagation algorithm. In the end, the restored image is evaluated by comparing the Image Enhancement Factors (IEF) of the images which are shadow detected by image imposing and by morphological filtering.

Conventional methods often study these two steps separately, e.g., learning hash functions from a predefined hand-crafted feature space. Meanwhile, the bit lengths of output hashing codes are preset in the most previous methods, neglecting the significance level of different bits and restricting their practical flexibility. To address these issues, we propose a supervised learning framework to generate compact and bit-scalable hashing codes directly from raw images. We pose hashing learning as a problem of regularized similarity learning. In particular, we organize the training images into a batch of triplet samples, each sample containing two images with the same label and one with a different label. With these triplet samples, we maximize the margin between the matched pairs and the mismatched pairs in the Hamming space. In addition, a regularization term is introduced to enforce the adjacency consistency, i.e., images of similar appearances should have similar codes. The deep convolutional neural network is utilized to train the model in an end-to-end fashion, where discriminative image features and hash functions are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore, each bit of our hashing codes is unequally weighted, so that we can manipulate the code lengths by truncating the insignificant bits. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-arts on public benchmarks of similar image search and also achieves promising results in the application of person re-identification in surveillance.

This study does not seek to once again define features to predict and detect SCD, as there already has been adequate discussion addressing feature extraction in our previous works and other recent studies. What seems to be lacking attention is the need for an appropriate strategy to manage the extracted features to such an extent that the best classification is presented. To this end, deploying a suitable tactic to select extracted features could bring about outstanding results compared to other works in the literature. Methods This research has accordingly applied a novel and automated approach to Local Feature Subset Selection through the most rigorous methodologies, which have formerly been developed in previous works of this team, for extracting features from nonlinear, time-frequency and classical processes. We are therefore enabled to select features that differ from one another in each minute before the incident through the agency of optimal feature selection in each one-minute interval of the signal. Results Using the proposed algorithm, SCD can be predicted 13 min before the onset, thus, better results are achieved compared to other techniques proposed in this field. Additionally, through defining a Utility Function and employing statistical analysis the alarm threshold has been effectively determined as 84% for the prediction accuracy. Having selected the best combination of features, based on their ability to generate the highest classification accuracy, the two classes are classified by means of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K- Nearest Neighbor (KNN) the Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the Mixture of Expert (ME) classifier. The Mixture of Experts classification yielded more precise class discrimination than other well-known classifiers. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using the MIT-BIH database which led to sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 84.24%, 85.71%, and 82.85%, respectively for thirteen one-minute. Conclusions The outcome of the obtained prediction would be analyzed and compared to other results. The most applicable and effective features would subsequently be presented according to the number of times they have been chosen. Finally, principal features in each time interval are discussed and the importance of each type of processing will be drawn into focus. The results indicate the significant capacity of the proposed method for predicting SCD from Electrocardoigram (ECG) signals as well as selecting the appropriate processing method at any time before the incident.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30638589", "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.12.001", "venue": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "mag_id": "2904585607", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199020477", "211260391"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58568339"}

In the context of document images, many large scale digitization projects have called for reliable and scalable triage methods for enhancement, segmentation, grouping and categorization of captured images. Current approaches, however, are typically limited to a specific class of documents such as scanned books, newspapers, journal articles or forms for example, and analysis and processing of more unconstrained and noisy heterogeneous document collections has not been as widely addressed. Additionally, existing machine-learning based approaches for document processing need to be carefully applied to handle the challenges associated with large and imbalanced training data. ::: In this thesis, we address these challenges in three primary applications of document image analysis\u2014low-level document enhancement, mid-level handwritten line segmentation, and high-level classification and retrieval. We first present a data selection method for training Support Vector Machines (SVM) on large-scale data sets. We apply the proposed approach to pixel-level document image enhancement, and show promising results with a relatively small number of training samples. Second, we present a graph-based method for segmentation of handwritten document images into text-lines which is more efficient and adaptive than previous approaches. Our approach demonstrates that combining results from local and global methods enhances the final performance of text-line segmentation. Third, we present an approach to compute structural similarities between images for classification and retrieval. Results on real-world data sets show that the approach is more effective than earlier approaches when the labeled data is limited. We extend our classification approach to a completely unsupervised setting, where both the number of classes and representative samples from each class is assumed to be unknown. We present a method for computing similarities based on learned structural patterns and correlations from the given data. Experiments with four different data sets show that our approach can estimate number of classes in large document collections and group structurally similar images with a high-accuracy.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2269057325", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61708208"}

In this paper, we propose to study the motion trajectory oriented LbD, in which we emphasize that free form 3-D motion trajectories are informative and compact to characterize most long-term human motions. In our view, the demonstrations need to be well modeled in a form that is convenient and effective to be learned and understood by robots. To this end, we introduce a novel signature descriptor to describe the space motion trajectories extracted from human motions. The signature has rich descriptive invariants that enable a robot to learn generalized task knowledge.

The treatment of human diseases often requires the intake of several drugs, which can lead to undesirable drug-drug interactions (DDIs), thus causing an increase in the frequency and severity of ADEs. An evaluation of DDI-induced ADEs is a nontrivial task and requires numerous experimental and clinical studies. Therefore, we developed a computational approach to assess the cardiovascular ADEs of DDIs. This approach is based on the combined analysis of spontaneous reports (SRs) and predicted drug-target interactions to estimate the five cardiovascular ADEs that are induced by DDIs, namely, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac failure, and arterial hypertension. We applied a method based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression to SRs for the identification of interacting pairs of drugs causing corresponding ADEs, as well as noninteracting pairs of drugs. As a result, five datasets containing, on average, 3100 ADE-causing and non-ADE-causing drug pairs were created. The obtained data, along with information on the interaction of drugs with 1553 human targets predicted by PASS Targets software, were used to create five classification models using the Random Forest method. The average area under the ROC curve of the obtained models, sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy were 0.838, 0.764, 0.754 and 0.759, respectively. The predicted drug targets were also used to hypothesize the potential mechanisms of DDI-induced ventricular tachycardia for the top-scoring drug pairs. The created five classification models can be used for the identification of drug combinations that are potentially the most or least dangerous for the cardiovascular system. Author summary Assessment of adverse drug effects as well as the influence of drug-drug interactions on their manifestation is a nontrivial task that requires numerous experimental and clinical studies. We developed a computational approach for the prediction of adverse effects that are induced by drug-drug interactions, which are based on a combined analysis of spontaneous reports and predicted drug-target interactions. Importantly, the approach requires only structural formulas to predict adverse effects, and, therefore, may be applied for new, insufficiently studied drugs. We applied the approach to predict five of the most important cardiovascular adverse effects, because they are the most dangerous and widespread. These effects are myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, ventricular tachycardia, arterial hypertension and cardiac failure. The accuracies of predictive models were relatively high, in the range of 73-81%; therefore, we performed a prediction of the five cardiovascular adverse effects for the large number of drug pairs and revealed the combinations that are the most dangerous for the cardiovascular system.

In this paper we present the results of two Monte-Carlo studies comparing the effectiveness of two methods for determining relative importance of predictors under conditions of multicollinearity: Johnson's Relative Weights (JRW) and Breiman's Rand om Forests (RF). The following factors were systematically varied: number of predictors, correlations among predictors in population, regression model R 2 in population, number of observations per predictor, relia bility of measurement, and standard deviation of regression coefficients across predictors in population. T o serve as a benchmark measure of the relative importance of predictors, General Dominance Weights (GDW) method was used (also known as Shapley Value of the predictors in a regression), which defines predictor importance as an average increase in R 2 associated with that predictor across all possible regress ion submodels. Sample-based predictor importances determined by JRW and RF were compared to GDW importances in population.

Of the 30 training samples, 6 were randomly chosen for the creation of a microbial profile. In all of the acquired image samples, image segmentation was performed and the RGB, HSV, Lab, and statistical texture features were extracted. These were inputted in 15 different SVM configurations. SVM classification yielded an accuracy rate of 93.33 %. Results from the microbial profile revealed considerable microbial activity at the 5th and 6th intervals (10th and 12th hour) with 2 and 3 colonies formed, respectively. With the ability of the SVM to distinguish between samples with respect to the hour interval and with the supplementation of the microbial profile, an objective artificial intelligence mechanism for freshness detection was successfully created.
