Using historical patient information stored in clinical datasets, data mining and machine learning approaches can be applied to predict the survival of breast cancer patients. A common drawback is the absence of information, i.e., missing data, in certain clinical trials. However, most standard prediction methods are not able to handle incomplete samples and, then, missing data imputation is a widely applied approach for solving this inconvenience. Therefore, and taking into account the characteristics of each breast cancer dataset, it is required to perform a detailed analysis to determine the most appropriate imputation and prediction methods in each clinical environment. This research work analyzes a real breast cancer dataset from Institute Portuguese of Oncology of Porto with a high percentage of unknown categorical information (most clinical data of the patients are incomplete), which is a challenge in terms of complexity. Four scenarios are evaluated: (I) 5-year survival prediction without imputation and 5-year survival prediction from cleaned dataset with (II) Mode imputation, (III) Expectation-Maximization imputation and (IV) K-Nearest Neighbors imputation. Prediction models for breast cancer survivability are constructed using four different methods: K-Nearest Neighbors, Classification Trees, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. Experiments are performed in a nested ten-fold cross-validation procedure and, according to the obtained results, the best results are provided by the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm: more than 81% of accuracy and more than 0.78 of area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve, which constitutes very good results in this complex scenario.

Three active lines of research have independently explored transfer learning using neural networks. In weight transfer, a model trained on the source domain is used as an initialization point for a network to be trained on the target domain. In deep metric learning, the source domain is used to construct an embedding that captures class structure in both the source and target domains. In few-shot learning, the focus is on generalizing well in the target domain based on a limited number of labeled examples. We compare state-of-the-art methods from these three paradigms and also explore hybrid adapted-embedding methods that use limited target-domain data to fine tune embeddings constructed from source-domain data. We conduct a systematic comparison of methods in a variety of domains, varying the number of labeled instances available in the target domain ($k$), as well as the number of target-domain classes. We reach three principal conclusions: (1) Deep embeddings are far superior, compared to weight transfer, as a starting point for inter-domain transfer or model re-use (2) Our hybrid methods robustly outperform every few-shot learning and every deep metric learning method previously proposed, with a mean error reduction of 34% over state-of-the-art.

The third contribution is a general taxonomy of tree-based classifiers, which facilitates theoretical and experimental comparisons of several known classification algorithms, as well as spawning new ones. Diverse visual cues such as motion, motion context, colour, contrast and spatial priors are fused together by means of a conditional random field (CRF) model.

The challenge is that the kappa score cannot be used to validate the type systems nor to identify any incorrect annotations. Thus, we proposed an application of formal logic for validating type systems and annotations against expert rules. Experiments have been done by using four different type systems and annotation sets created by an expert and three novices. Our proposed formal logic model was used to validate the novice type systems and annotations against the expert rules. The results show that the technique could help identifying inconsistencies between expert and novice annotations, by using a model checker.

However, the statistics-based approach to language,which tends to ignore or deemphasize structural issues of language, has shown its own limitations. The approach in its strictest form, for example, fails to treat the systematic mapping between syntax and semantics of language (i.e. the compositional aspect of meaning).An increasing number of researchers have become interested in combining linguistic theories, which treat the compositional aspect of meaning, with statistical modeling of language. On the other hand, the community of knowledge-mining and semantic search has constructed large knowledge bases such as Freebase, Yago and Wikipedia. Although these knowledge-bases have been constructed independently of the interests in the NLP research community, they provide essential resources for research on Natural Language Understanding, which aims to develop a system which understands language as human being does. The first step of such an understanding system is to relate surface forms of language with corresponding units in knowledge-bases. Once text is mapped to representation in the knowledge domain, one can perform inferences of various sorts by combining it with knowledge in the knowledge base. Inferences, which combine information embedded within text with human knowledge which is external to text, are deemed essential in text understanding. The two streams of research in the above seem to be tackling the same problem of how surface expressions in text can be linked with extra-linguistic representation in the knowledge domain, and what roles the structure of language plays in such a linking process. With this broad perspective in mind, I will address the following research topics which I have been involved in: (1) Parsing and Semantics: While the performance of a syntactic parser has been improved substantially of late, it still fails to treat semantically crucial constructions. In order to resolve the difficulties which remain in parsing, we have to treat semantics of language more systematically than the current state of the arts parsers do. I would argue that we cannot resolve the difficulties without referring PACLIC-27", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2417911157", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63816273"}

This research describes the methods involved in the mapping of different high value crops in Agusan del Norte Philippines using LiDAR. This project is part of the Phil-LiDAR 2 Program which aims to conduct a nationwide resource assessment using LiDAR. Because of the high resolution data involved, the methodology described here utilizes object-based image analysis and the use of optimal features from LiDAR data and Orthophoto. Object-based classification was primarily done by developing rule-sets in eCognition. Several features from the LiDAR data and Orthophotos were used in the development of rule-sets for classification. Generally, classes of objects can't be separated by simple thresholds from different features making it difficult to develop a rule-set. To resolve this problem, the image-objects were subjected to Support Vector Machine learning. SVMs have gained popularity because of their ability to generalize well given a limited number of training samples. However, SVMs also suffer from parameter assignment issues that can significantly affect the classification results. More specifically, the regularization parameter C in linear SVM has to be optimized through cross validation to increase the overall accuracy. After performing the segmentation in eCognition, the optimization procedure as well as the extraction of the equations of the hyper-planes was done in Matlab. The learned hyper-planes separating one class from another in the multi-dimensional feature-space can be thought of as super-features which were then used in developing the classifier rule set in eCognition.

The reliability of the classification algorithm was examined with kappa coefficients. Results. A total of 123 patients participated (mean age 37.7 [\u00b110.7] years, 44% female), 60 (49%) remained stable between examinations. Reliability of range of motion, centralization/peripheralization judgments with flexion and extension, and the instability test were moderate to excellent. Reliability of centralization/peripheralization judgments with repeated or sustained extension or aberrant movement judgments were fair to poor. Overall agreement on classification decisions was 76% (kappa = 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.56, 0.64), with no significant differences based on level of experience. Conclusion. Reliability of the classification algorithm was good.

Large scale afforestation and reforestation projects have occurred or planned in Asia\u2013Pacific region; however, the direct impact of climate change has not been widely considered. This has been at least partially due to the lack of availability of robust inventory data on forest vegetation and lack of access to appropriate climate data. In this study, we used our recently developed model, ClimateAP, to generate a large number of climate variables for point locations and used an ensemble modeling approach with Random Forest to overcome some limitations that exist with vegetation data. Uncertainty in future climates was incorporated into the analysis through consensus based projections using 12 climate change scenarios. We modeled the climatic niches for four economically and ecologically important forest tree species in the region and projected their shift in geographical distribution under climate change. Unusual patterns in the shift of geographic distributions of climatic niches were found in two species in Southern China.

Then the injury can be located in the actual conveyor belt to maintenance and repair. And the joint is an important part of the conveyor belt, for it is easy to recognize in the practical application, so as the benchmark to joint reference point positioning fault is a good choice. Therefore, the accurate identification of joint is very important to conveyor belt injury locational. At present there are some algorithms applying the method of detecting domain gray level or horizontal gradient change frequency in the identification of joint. These algorithms can be accurate to single image of joint without considering the practical complex and changeable X-ray image for the different thickness of the conveyor belt outer rubber.

SVM presents many own advantages in solving machine learning problems such as small samples, nonlinearity and high dimension. In this paper, the image texture SVM classification method construct feature vectors through the extraction of image gray level co-occurrence matrix texture information. classified feature vectors using the SVM classification method to determine whether the image contains joint and provide the joint location information. The mentioned texture information include gray-level co-occurrence matrix energy, contrast and entropy. And the gray level co-occurrence matrix reflects the image direction, adjacent interval and the change in value of integrated information.

The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate mitochondria-nuclear cross-talk in terms of SNP-SNP interactions associated with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk, which may play an important role in unveiling the underlying mechanism of this complex lethal disease. ::: ::: Methods: Our analyses were based on 1,938 invasive EOC cases and 2,009 controls with greater than 80% European ancestry from five case-control studies genotyped using the Illumina 610quad chip. We evaluated 2,488 SNPs in over 1,500 genes in eight mitochondria-related pathways (apoptosis, oxidation-reduction, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, immunomoduation, transmembrane transport, small GTPases, BRCA1-interactors and circadian rhythm). SNPs with strong linkage disequilibrium of r2 > 0.8 were excluded. We examined 2-way SNP-SNP interactions associated with invasive EOC risk using the two-stage Random Forests plus Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (TRM) approach. Bootstrapping was further performed to select important variables and reduce false positive findings. Based on the scree plot using 1,000 bootstrap samples, the factors with more than 4% of bootstrap frequency were defined as significant factors. We then included each identified factors separately in model adjusting for study site and first principal component representing European ancestry. ::: ::: Results: Five significant SNP-SNP interactions were observed: (rs2270799 in IQSEC3 (12p13.33) + [rs933305][1] in CUX2 (12q24.3), (p= 6.3x10\u22125); rs6063251 in PREX1 (20q13.3) + rs9705 in SLC39A8 (4q22-q24), (p= 3.5x10\u22125); [rs933305][1] in CUX2 (12q24.3) + rs1712957 in ARHGAP15 (2q22.2-q22.3), (p=4.2x10\u22127), rs2861828 in SLIT1 (10q23.3-q24) + rs6063251 in PREX1 (20q13.3), (p=2.5x10\u22127); rs10954593 in SEMA3C (7q21-q31) + [rs933305][1] in CUX2 (12q24.3), (p=2.8x10\u22123). Four of the five interactions involved SNPs from genes in the small GTPases pathway (IQSEC3; PREX1 (twice) and ARHGAP15). In addition, three of the five interaction pairs involved the CUX2 gene. This gene encodes a protein which contains three CUT domains and a homeodomain, which are DNA-binding motifs. The main mitochondrial SNP-SNP interaction involved the nuclear mitochondria gene SLC39A8. ::: ::: Conclusions: ::: ::: Our results suggest that genetic variation in mitochondrial-related pathways may be associated with invasive EOC risk. These findings highlight important genes/pathways that may interact as a network to influence invasive EOC risk and may generate novel therapeutic targets. External validation will be done using other independent studies for future analyses. ::: ::: Citation Format: Hui-Yi Lin, Ya-Yu Tsai, Y. Ann Chen, Zhihua Chen, Xiaotao Qu, Ellen L.

Machine learning tools such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) and Fisher\u2019s Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) are widely used in the areas of prediction and classification. The main objective of these competing classification strategies is to predict a dichotomous outcome (e.g. disease/healthy) based on several features. Like any of the well-known statistical inferential models; machine learning tools are faced with a problem known as \u201cclass imbalance\u201d. A data set is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. When learning from highly imbalanced data, most classifiers are affected by the majority class leading to an increase in the false negative rate. Increased interests in applying machine learning techniques to \"realworld\" problems, whose data are characterized by severe imbalance, have emerged as can be seen in numerous publications in medicine and biology. Predictive accuracy, a popular choice for evaluating performance of a classifier, might not be appropriate when the data is imbalanced and/or when the costs of different errors vary markedly. In this paper, we use the T-Link algorithm in the preprocessing phase as a method of data cleaning in order to remove noise. We combine T-Link with other sampling method such as RUS, ROS and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) in order to maintain a balanced class distribution. Classification was then utilized using several ML algorithms such as ANN, RF and LR. Classifiers performance was evaluated using several performance measures deemed more appropriate for classifying data with sever imbalance. These methods are applied to arterial blood pressures data and Ecoli2 data set.

To explore its capability to detect change, we applied it in the Zhoushan Islands, Zhejiang, China. First, images were classified by SRC, and change detection was performed by two separate methods. One was the comparison of the merged categories obtained by reclassifying the pre-classification types of SRC. The other was comparing bi-temporal pre-classification types directly. The classification accuracy of the merged categories based on SRC was compared to the Maximum Likelihood Classifier and Support Vector Machine. The accuracy of the change detection was assessed and compared to results processed by the common post-classification comparison and change vector analysis methods. Results show that the change detection by directly comparing pre-classification types of SRC had the highest accuracy (overall accuracy was 90%, kappa coefficient was 0.81) among these methods and that the method of comparing merged categories was the worst (overall accuracy was 73%, kappa coefficient was only 0.46).", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2222749", "venue": "Asia-Pacific Remote Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2342657737", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["7738974", "9299147", "129917020", "130008576", "129158528", "128761738", "129007944", "54596260", "128948629", "40736847", "128940882", "129923008", "140177230", "129551973", "129510855", "16727598", "123516421", "129535957", "122814719", "1010758", "129747242", "23696474", "130727577", "130383837", "17790515", "27835707", "129423187", "10225796", "20077728", "124255", "17639787", "35363977", "8209299", "140549893", "2357415", "62564176", "4877264", "40766086", "206787478", "17883484", "16203715"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131587438"}

MuTGAN consists of generator and discriminator modules and is implemented by three seamless connected networks: spatio-temporal feature extraction network comprehensively learns the morphology and kinematic abnormalities of the left ventricle through a novel three-dimensional successive convolution; joint feature learning network learns the complementarity between segmentation and quantification through innovative inter- and intra-skip connection; task relatedness network learns the intrinsic pattern between tasks to increase the accuracy of estimations through creatively utilized adversarial learning. MuTGAN minimizes a generalized divergence to directly optimize the distribution of estimations by using the competition process, which achieves pixel segmentation and full quantification of MIs.

Therefore, an accurate and up to date classification of forest cover is essential for conservation planning, including efforts that prioritize areas for conservation activities. We used object-based image analysis with Random Forest classification to quickly and accurately classify forest cover. We used Landsat band, band ratio, and band index statistics to identify and define similar objects as our training sets instead of selecting individual training points. This provided a single rule-set that was used to classify each of the 11 Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper scenes that encompassed the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. We classified 3,307,910\u00b185,344 ha (32% of this region) as forest. Our overall classification accuracy was 96.9% with Kappa statistic of 0.96.

To enhance the ability of the generative model to tackle discriminative computer vision tasks (e.g. image classification), we propose a hierarchical deconvolutional network with two biologically inspired properties incorporated, i.e., non-negative sparsity and selectivity. First, we propose a single layer deconvolutional model with a raw image as input, attempting to decompose the input as a weighted sum of feature maps convolving with filters. Here, the filters are the model parameters common to all the inputs, while the feature maps and the summing weights are specific to the input. The non-negative sparsity is formulated as the /i-norm regularizer on the feature map, which is used to generate feature representations for image classification. And the selectivity is forced on the filters to make different filters active different inputs, through requiring the sparsity on the summing weights specifically. The two properties are summarized into an overall cost function, which can be solved with an alternatively iterative algorithm. Then, we build multiple layer deconvolutional network by stacking the single models, where the next-layer inputs are the results of a 3D max-pooling operation on the inferred feature maps of the front layer, and train the network in a greedy layer wise scheme. Finally, we explore the feature maps of each layer to generate the image representations and input them to a SVM classifier for the classification task.

This study evaluated the potential of a new machine learning algorithm using gradient boosting on decision trees with categorical features support (i.e., CatBoost) for accurately estimating daily ET0 with limited meteorological data in humid regions of China. Two other commonly used machine learning algorithms, Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were also assessed for comparison. Eight input combinations of daily meteorological data [including both complete and incomplete combinations of solar radiation (Rs), maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmax and Tmin), relative humidity (Hr) and wind speed (U)] from five weather stations during 2001\u20132015 in South China were applied for model training and testing. The results showed that all the three algorithms could achieve satisfactory accuracy for ET0 estimation in subtropical China using Rs, Tmax and Tmin, or U, Hr, Tmax and Tmin as inputs, under the circumstances of lacking complete meteorological parameters. The increases in testing RMSE and MAPE over training RMSE and MAPE showed positive correlations with the number of input parameters to the machine learning models. For the local models, among the three algorithms, SVM offered the best prediction accuracy and stability with incomplete combinations of meteorological parameters as inputs, while CatBoost performed best with the complete combination of parameters. Patterns of the generalized models were almost the same as the local models, but the former ones showed less than 10% decreases in RMSE or MAPE in comparison with the latter ones. In addition, the computing time and memory usage for data processing of CatBoost were much less than those of RF and SVM. Overall, as a tree-based algorithm, CatBoost made significant improvements in accuracy, stability and computational cost when compared to RF.

In addition, tourism has been highly valued recently all over the world, and consequently, tourism market has been developed very fast. After quick development, it gradually becomes a saturated marketplace. Previous studies indicated that maintaining existing customers costs less than exploring new customers. Repeat visitors can not only reduce the cost but gain the long-term profits for the destinations. Thus, a method that can accurately predict repeat visitation intention is greatly needed. In this paper, we apply Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict the repeat visitation. To evaluate the effectiveness of SVM, data are collected from tourists who visited Sun Moon Lake, which is the most famous destination in Taiwan and is the only place in Taiwan among the 50 best places to visit in China. Factor analysis (FA) is also employed to reduce variables and combined FA/SVM results are compared with those predicted from SVM only. The experimental results show that SVM can provide high accuracy rates than FA/SVM.

Advances in sequencing technologies produce multiple time-point whole-genome data, which enable potential interactions between these alleles to be investigated empirically. To investigate these interactions, we represent alleles as distributed vectors that encode for relationships with other alleles in the course of evolution and apply artificial neural networks to time-sampled whole-genome datasets for feature learning. We build this platform using methods and algorithms derived from natural language processing (NLP), and we denote it as the nucleotide skip-gram neural network. We learn distributed vectors of alleles using the changes in allele frequency of echovirus 11 in the presence or absence of the disinfectant (ClO2) from the experimental evolution data. Results from the training using a new open-source software TensorFlow show that the learned distributed vectors can be clustered using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering to reveal a list of non-synonymous mutations that arise on the structural protein VP1 in connection to the candidate mutation for ClO2 adaptation.

Prior to its first clinical manifestation, it is evident that the brain damaging process has already been commenced much earlier in life. This asymptomatic period could have spanned as long as a decade or more. Although there is not yet ultimate cure for the disease, the sooner it is diagnosed, the more chance that available therapeutic measures could improve patient\u2019s quality of life. Standard medical questionnaire and medical imaging are the most prevailing means of identifying early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Despite a great effort having been made in analyzing structural atrophy in human brain by using CT and MRI, the recent attempts have reached high accuracy and precision but relatively poor sensitivity. Functional imaging such as PET is of much lower spatial resolution but promising modality taken to elevate this limitation. This paper presents a classification method for early detection of the disease from PET scans drawn from Thai population. However, instead of conventional structural analysis, this study performed clustering on unwrapped signals, transformed from imaging data by using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), by a generic Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

Background and objectiveInduction of labor (IOL) is a medical procedure used to initiate uterine contractions to achieve delivery. IOL entails medical risks and has a significant impact on both the mother's and newborn's well-being. The assistance provided by an automatic system to help distinguish patients that will achieve labor spontaneously from those that will need late-term IOL would help clinicians and mothers to take an informed decision about prolonging pregnancy. With this aim, we developed and evaluated predictive models using not only traditional obstetrical data but also electrophysiological parameters derived from the electrohysterogram (EHG). MethodsEHG recordings were made on singleton term pregnancies. A set of 10 temporal and spectral parameters was calculated to characterize EHG bursts and a further set of 6 common obstetrical parameters was also considered in the predictive models design. Different models were implemented based on single layer Support Vector Machines (SVM) and with aggregation of majority voting of SVM (double layer), to distinguish between the two groups: term spontaneous labor (41 weeks of gestation) and IOL late-term labor. The areas under the curve (AUC) of the models were compared. ResultsThe obstetrical and EHG parameters of the two groups did not show statistically significant differences. The best results of non-contextualized single input parameter SVM models were achieved by the Bishop Score (AUC=0.65) and GA at recording time (AUC=0.68) obstetrical parameters. The EHG parameter median frequency, when contextualized with the two obstetrical parameters improved these results, reaching AUC=0.76. Multiple input SVM obtained AUC=0.70 for all EHG parameters. Aggregation of majority voting of SVM models using contextualized EHG parameters achieved the best result AUC=0.93. ConclusionsMeasuring the electrophysiological uterine condition by means of electrohysterographic recordings yielded a promising clinical decision support system for distinguishing patients that will spontaneously achieve active labor before the end of full term from those who will require late term IOL. The importance of considering these EHG measurements in the patient's individual context was also shown by combining EHG parameters with obstetrical parameters.

To solve this problem, in this paper, we analyze and identify what knowledge is useful during transfer learning process, and develop a method, called Cosine Similarity Regularization (CosSimReg), to transfer only useful information from social domain.

To overcome this problem, we use a hierarchical tracking method for each body part based on the blown body part. By using a hierarchical tracking method, we can reduce the number of samples for robust tracking in the cluttered environment.

This is achieved by an Over-Complete Wavelet Transform that finds optimally sparse approximations of the Support Set Vectors. The wavelet-based approach provides an upper bound on the distance between the decision function of the Support Vector Machine and our classifier. The obtained classifier is fast since the used Haar wavelet approximations of the Support Set Vectors allow efficient Integral Image-based kernel evaluations. This provides a set of double-cascaded classifiers of increasing accuracy for an early rejection. The algorithm yields an excellent runtime performance that is achieved by hierarchically discriminating with respect to the number and approximation accuracy of incorporated Reduced Set Vectors. The proposed algorithm is applied to the problem of face and facial feature detection, but it can also be used for other image-based classifications. The algorithm presented, provides a 530-fold speed-up over the Support Vector Machine, enabling face detection at more than 25 fps on a standard PC.

Our proposed approach for Neuro fuzzy using 3 membership functions i.e. Gaussian MF (GMF), Triangular MF (Tri MF) and Trapezoidal MF (Trap MF) is compared with neural network models and the results show that values of various relative error parameters for Neurofuzzy is lower than the values of parameters applying neural network.

In the long-term use of AR systems for collaborative human-robot perception, one of the biggest challenges is to perform place and scene matching under long-term environmental changes, such as dramatic variations in lighting, weather and vegetation across different times of the day, months, and seasons. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel representation learning approach that learns a scalable long-term representation model that can be used for place and scene matching in various long-term conditions. Our approach is formulated as a regularized optimization problem, which selects the most representative scene templates in different scenarios to construct a scalable representation of the same place that can exhibit significant long-term environment changes. Our approach adaptively learns to select a small subset of the templates to construct the representation model, based on a user-defined representativeness threshold, which makes the learned model highly scalable to the long-term variations in real-world applications. To solve the formulated optimization problem, a new algorithmic solver is designed, which is theoretically guaranteed to converge to the global optima. Experiments are conducted using two large-scale benchmark datasets, which have demonstrated the superior performance of our approach for long-term place and scene matching.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-21565-1_4", "venue": "HCI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2962424965", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195878195"}

The purpose of this study is to introduce a hybrid model that combines support vector regression (SVR) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to be applied in crime rates forecasting. SVR is very robust with small training data and high-dimensional problem. Meanwhile, ARIMA has the ability to model several types of time series. However, the accuracy of the SVR model depends on values of its parameters, while ARIMA is not robust to be applied to small data sets. Therefore, to overcome this problem, particle swarm optimization is used to estimate the parameters of the SVR and ARIMA models.

Prognostics of PEMFC has attracted increasing attention nowadays, which aims at predicting the health degradation of PEMFC and estimating the residual useful life (RUL) for better management. However, majority existing prognostic methods for PEMFC are restricted for real applications due to the following reasons: 1) accurate models which rely on complex underlying mechanism are hard to obtain; 2) data-driven methods usually depend on large amounts of data; 3) the prediction results are usually an estimated value rather than a probability distribution of RUL.

As an intelligent prognostic method, LSSVR can achieve a good performance with limited training samples. The predicted values of LSSVR act as new observations of PF to obtain a probability distribution of the RUL.

Since informa- tion contained within the structure of the data set should no tb e neglected, our method considers the whole data set during the learning process. In di!erence to known methods our approach uses neighborhood co opera- tiveness for stable prototype learning known from Neural Gas. Further improvement of the classification accuracy is achieved by including class border sensitivity inspired by Support Vector Machines agai ni mproved by neighborhood learning. 1M otivation Supervised classification based on labeled data and unsupervised clustering based on unlabeled data are common tasks in the field of machin el earning. There exist a variety of algorithms for either paradigm. Som ef amous clustering methods are c-Means, Self Organizing Maps (SOM), Neural Gas (NG), A! nity Propagation, and variants thereof to improve the performance, consider overlap- ping data (fuzziness), incorporate neighborhood relation so r to attend to sparsity to name just a few. On the other hand there are classifiers like Learning Vector Quantizers (LVQ, GLVQ, RSLVQ etc.) or Nearest Prototype Classifiers (NPC, SNPC, FSNPC etc.) to solve classification problems. Obtaining labeled data sets often is a di! cult and costly procedure requiring expert knowledge and - especially if the labelling has to be done manually - a considerable amount of time. Therefore, sometimes only a fraction of a data set is labeled impeding complete classification learning. To utilize the above mentioned methods for this kind of data, either the labels are neglecte dt o do unsupervised clustering or the data set itself is reduced considering onl yl abeled data samples for the classification. In either case, information is lost. For this reason several semi-supervised classification methods namely FLSOM and FLNG (1) have been developed for crisp data. These methods closely follow the standard SOM and NG procedures yet also take labeled data into consideration. Pedrycz proposed an alternative semi-supervised vector quantization schem eb ased on Fuzzy c- Means (FCM) (2), but also pays attention to the labeled data samples. For this partially supervised clustering the original FCM cost function is extended by an additional term expressing a level of coincidence between the FCM membership degrees and the expert provided class information (3, 4). This way the class information as well as the structure of the data inherent in the whole data set is taken into consideration. Further, special interest frequently is given to the knowledge about decision borders between classes. This problem is explicitly addressed in Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning, which determines so-called suppor tv ectors approxi- mating and indicating the borders between the classes (5, 6) .R ecently, the idea", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ESANN", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2295770254", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["21072393", "11698213", "22511023", "14108376", "53889166", "13149771", "13637832", "29799509", "14573148", "15395694", "6027267"], "inbound_citations": ["15511567"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17658815"}

Here we propose a multi-stage discriminative segmentation model, where every stage is a binary classifier based on the random forest algorithm.

The framework was tested on the evaluation images from BraTS 2018. One of the most important results is the determination of the tumor ROI with a sensitivity of approximately 0.99 in stage I by considering only 16% of the brain in the subsequent stages.

Semantic inpainting, a technique for image processing using deep generative models, has been recently applied for this purpose, demonstrating its effectiveness in dealing with complex spatial patterns.

To overcome this limitation, here we propose a physics-informed semantic inpainting framework, employing the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and jointly incorporating the direct and indirect measurements by exploiting the underlying physical laws.

Since the source and the target domains are usually from different distributions, existing methods mainly focus on adapting the cross-domain marginal or conditional distributions. However, in real applications, the marginal and conditional distributions usually have different contributions to the domain discrepancy. Existing methods fail to quantitatively evaluate the different importance of these two distributions, which will result in unsatisfactory transfer performance. In this paper, we propose a novel concept called Dynamic Distribution Adaptation (DDA), which is capable of quantitatively evaluating the relative importance of each distribution. DDA can be easily incorporated into the framework of structural risk minimization to solve transfer learning problems. On the basis of DDA, we propose two novel learning algorithms: (1) Manifold Dynamic Distribution Adaptation (MDDA) for traditional transfer learning, and (2) Dynamic Distribution Adaptation Network (DDAN) for deep transfer learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDDA and DDAN significantly improve the transfer learning performance and setup a strong baseline over the latest deep and adversarial methods on digits recognition, sentiment analysis, and image classification. More importantly, it is shown that marginal and conditional distributions have different contributions to the domain divergence, and our DDA is able to provide good quantitative evaluation of their relative importance which leads to better performance.

Firstly, a novel feature \u2013 pattern readjustment \u2013 was extracted and tested. Clinical data were used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect pattern readjustment. Then, the association of pattern readjustment and adverse labour outcome was investigated. The validation results with clinical experts show that the pattern readjustment can be accurately detected, while the study on labour outcome shows that the feature is related to fetal acidemia at birth. Secondly, Genetic Algorithms were employed as a feature selection method to select a best subset of FHR features and to use them to predict fetal acidemia with linear and nonlinear SVM. The diagnostic power of the classifier output using selected features was tested on the total set of 7,568 cases. As the classifier output increases, there is a consistent increase of the risk of fetal acidemia. Thirdly, an important influencing factor on FHR features - signal loss \u2013 was investigated. A bivariate model was built to estimate error based on signal loss. Validation results show that the bivariate model can accurately predict the error generated by signal loss. The influence of signal loss on labour outcome classification was also investigated. Finally, a computerised decision support system to estimate the risk of fetal acidemia was set up based on the above studies. The system was validated using new retrospective data. Validation results show that the system is capable of predicting adverse labour outcome and providing timely decision support.

This procedure increases the margin as long as the margin is smaller than half of the shortest distance between any pair of data points from the two different classes. We provide an algorithm for the general case with n-dimensional data points. A small experiment with three folding iterations on 3-dimensional data points with non-linear relations shows that the margin does indeed increase and that the accuracy improves with a larger margin. The method can use any standard SVM implementation plus some basic manipulation of the data points, i.e., splitting, rotating and merging. Hyperplane folding also increases the interpretability of the data.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3318299.3318319", "venue": "ICMLC '19", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2944968625", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["27824921", "148574140", "206787478", "13981982", "33356605", "23089665", "4947869", "2759396", "36112428", "7138354", "15759462", "12027213"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:160010336"}

Patients and methods: In this neoadjuvant phase-II-study of totally 40 eligible patients with histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer Human Genome Survey Microarray (HGSM) expression profiling is preformed on jet-biopsy sample basis. The protocol was elaborated for the treatment of breast cancer patients suffering from a primary tumour greater than 1.5cm or inflammatory breast cancer with 6 cycles of Docetaxel / Epirubicin / Cyclophosphamide (TEC, 3-weekly) prior to the surgical treatment. The selection and validation of predictor genes was done with BRB-ArrayTools Version 3.3 using a model based the Compound Covariate Predictor, Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis, Nearest Neighbor Classification, and Support Vector Machines with linear kernel. The models incorporated genes that were differentially expressed among genes at the 0.001 significance level as assessed by the random variance t-test. We estimated the prediction error of each model using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) as described by Simon R et al. 2000 random permutations were used. Clustering was done using Cluster 3.0 and Java TreeView 1.0.12. Results:Tumour response (pCR, pPR) of more than 70% can be achieved using neoadjuvant TEC-regimen. 22% of pCR (pT0; pN0) in this ongoing study is comparable with data of other published neoadjuvant trails.The rate of breast conserving therapy of more than 90% is high. The preliminary expression profiling results shown here indicate a subset of 148 genes that classifies all patients with a complete remission (pCR, no detectable tumor at the end of chemotherapy), in one cluster with a very closely related gene expression pattern (n=5; PPV=100%). Furthermore the 10 patients indicated as responders due to the selected Mib1-expression based criteria (expressing cells in the residual tumor \u22645% and a \u0394 Mib1-expression \u226520%) were correctly classified in 9 of 10 cases. A comparable separation of the groups could not achieved by established tumor factors, e.g. ER, PgR, HER2, uPA etc. which are measured simultaneously on the HGSM and also statistically evaluated. Conclusion: HGSM semi-quantitative expression profiling is promising to have the potential to figure out genes that are related to cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance, especially in primary systemic chemotherapy.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1055/s-2006-944442", "venue": null, "journal": "Zentralblatt Fur Gynakologie", "mag_id": "2591980754", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:79415221"}

In this paper, we develop quantitative and scalable tools for assessing the diversity of GAN distributions. Specifically, we take a classification-based perspective and view loss of diversity as a form of covariate shift introduced by GANs. We examine two specific forms of such shift: mode collapse and boundary distortion.

A filter-tree corresponding to a filter in k^{th} convolu- tional layer of a CNN is a subnetwork consisting of the filter along with all its connections to filters in all preceding layers. An ensemble of such filter-trees created from the k^{th} layers of many CNNs learnt on different but related tasks, forms the BFT.

However, Grid resource allocation is still a challenging problem for which a Grid scheduler has to be operating in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Conventional scheduling algorithms will fail due to the static rules used and much user intervention required. We suggest that learning with neural networks is promising to solve this problem. In this paper we propose a fast and intelligent resource selection algorithm based on neural networks.

Modern algorithms for linear classification can train reasonably good models while going through the data in only tens of rounds.

In this paper, rather than optimizing algorithms on a single machine, we propose and implement distributed algorithms that achieve parallel disk loading and access the disk only once. Our large-scale learning algorithms are based on the framework of alternating direction methods of multipliers. The framework derives a subproblem that remains to be solved eciently for which we propose using dual coordinate descent and trust region Newton method. Our experimental evaluations on large datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve significant speedup over the classifier proposed by Yu et al. running on a single machine.

The mass of data naturally prohibits manual analysis, though, and life scientists thus have to rely more and more on automated cell tracking methods. However, automated cell tracking involves intricacies that are not commonly found in traditional tracking applications. For instance, cells may undergo mitosis, which results in variable numbers of tracking targets across successive frames. These difficulties have been addressed by tracking-by-assignment models in the past, which dissect the task into two stages, detection and tracking. However, as with every two-stage framework, the approach hinges on the quality of the first stage, and errors propagate partially irrevocably from the detection to the tracking phase. ::: ::: The research in this thesis thus focuses on methods to advance tracking-by-assignment models in order to avoid these errors by exploiting synergy effects between the two (previously) separate stages. We propose two approaches, both in terms of probabilistic graphical models, which allow for information exchange between the detection and the tracking step to different degrees. The first algorithm, termed Conservation tracking, models both possible over- and undersegmentation errors and implements global consistency constraints in order to reidentify target identities even across occlusion or erroneous detections. Wrong detections from the first step can hence be corrected in the second stage. The second method goes one step further and optimizes the two stages completely jointly in one holistic model. In this way, the detection and tracking step can maximally benefit from each other and reach the overall most likely interpretation of the data. Both algorithms yield notable results which are state-of-the-art. ::: ::: In spite of the distinguished results achieved with these methods, automated cell tracking methods are still error-prone and manual proof-reading is often unavoidable for life scientists. To avoid the time-consuming manual identification of errors on very large datasets, most ambiguous predictions ought to be detected automatically so that these can be corrected by a human expert with minimal effort. In response, we propose two easy-to-use methods to sample multiple solutions from a tracking-by-assignment graphical model and derive uncertainty measures from the variations across the samples. We showcase the usefulness for guided proof-reading on the cell tracking model proposed in this work. ::: ::: Finally, the successful application of structured output learning algorithms to cell tracking in previous work inspired us to advance the state-of-the-art by an algorithm called Coulomb Structured Support Vector Machine (CSSVM). The CSSVM improves the expected generalization error for unseen test data by the training of multiple concurrent graphical models. Through the novel diversity encouraging term, motivated from experimental design, the ensemble of graphical models is learned to yield diverse predictions for test data. The best prediction amongst these models may then be selected by an oracle or with respect to a more complex loss.

Monitoring global biodiversity is critical for understanding responses to anthropogenic change, but biodiversity monitoring is often biased away from tropical, megadiverse areas that are experiencing more rapid environmental change. Acoustic surveys are increasingly used to monitor biodiversity change, especially for bats as they are important indicator species and most use sound to detect, localise and classify objects. However, using bat acoustic surveys for monitoring poses several challenges, particularly in mega-diverse regions. Many species lack reference recordings, some species have high call similarity or differ in call detectability, and quantitative classification tools, such as machine learning algorithms, have rarely been applied to data from these areas. 2. Here, we collate a reference call library for bat species that occur in a megadiverse country, Mexico. We use 4,685 search-phase calls from 1,378 individual sequences of 59 bat species to create automatic species identification tools generated by machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). We evaluate the improvement in species-level classification rates gained by using hierarchical classifications, reflecting either taxonomic or ecological constraints (guilds) on call design, and examine how classification rate accuracy changes at different hierarchical levels (family, genus, and guild). 3. Species-level classification of calls had a mean accuracy of 66% and the use of hierarchies improved mean species-level classification accuracy by up to 6% (species within families 72%, species within genera 71.2% and species within guilds 69.1%). Classification accuracy to family, genus and guild-level was 91.7%, 77.8% and 82.5%, respectively. 4. The bioacoustic identification tools we have developed are accurate for rapid biodiversity assessments in a megadiverse region and can also be used effectively to classify species at broader taxonomic or ecological levels.

A set of 105 ion chromatograms obtained by anti-doping control laboratories was used in this study. The quality of the ion chromatograms was evaluated qualitatively by nine independent experts (associating a score from 0 to 4) and also more objectively taking into account chromatographic parameters (peak width, asymmetry, resolution and S/N ratio). Results obtained showed a high degree of variability among experts when judging ion chromatograms. Experts applying extremely outlying evaluation criteria were identified and excluded from the data used to develop the SVM. This machine was built providing the system with qualitative information (scores assigned by experts) and with objective data (parameters) of the ion chromatograms. A seven-fold cross-validation approach was used to train and to evaluate the predictive ability of the machine. According to the results obtained, the SVM developed was found to be close to the reasoning process followed by the homogeneous human expert group.

In this paper, we propose an enhanced RFC (ERFC) algorithm, in which a hash-based aggregated bit vector scheme is exploited to speed up its preprocessing procedure. A compressed and cacheable data structure is also introduced to decrease total memory requirement and improve its searching performance.

High resolution X-ray computer tomography (XCT) is a well-established, long-standing experimental approach used in the rock physics community to study transport of the energy\u2015momentum relationship inside porous- matrix domain. The accuracy and the appropriateness of the continuum based or topology based model prediction relies extensively on the resolution and phase segmentation of the XCT images. The current technology, used in nano tomography and micro tomography is able to generate high resolution image compared to the last decade, but new adaptive and flexible algorithm are urgently needed for accurate image analysis. ::: ::: Within the framework of this thesis different categories (supervised, unsupervised and ensemble classifiers) of machine learning (ML) techniques in combination with different image filtering techniques were investigated and tested for accurate XCT image segmentation and analysis. This lead to the investigation of seven different ML algorithm K-means, Fuzzy C-means (FCM), Self-Organized Map (SOM), Feed Forward Artificial Neural Networks (FFANN), Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), Bragging type ensemble classification tree (Bragging) and Boost (Boosting) type ensemble classification tree. Their respective clustering and classification performance and accuracy was compared and cross-validated. Thereafter, a robust workflow was developed to predict geometrical parameters such as porosity, volume fraction of different phases (pore, matrix, mineral) and pore size distribution. ::: ::: Further, a (standalone) grapical user interface (GUI) \u201cCobWeb\u201d was developed. The current version of CobWeb is capable to read and process (reconstructed) XCT files in tiff and raw format. Tools to zoom in, zoom out, cropping, color and scale, assist in the visualization and interpretation of XCT 2D and 3D stack data. Noise filters such as non-local means, anisotropic diffusion, median and contrast adjustments are implemented to increase signal to noise ratio. The user can chose from five segmentation algorithms, namely K-means, Fuzzy C-means (unsupervised), Support Vector Machine (supervised), Bragging and Boosting (enable classifiers) for accurate segmentation and cross-validation. Material properties like relative porosities, pore size distribution, volume fraction (pore, matrix, mineral phases) can be quantified and visualized. The data can be exported into different file formats such as Microsoft\u00ae Excel (xlsx), MATLAB\u00ae (mat), ParaView (vkt) and DSI studio (fib). The current version is supported for Micosoft\u00ae Windows and runs stable on Windows\u00ae 7 to Windows\u00ae 10. ::: ::: As ML techniques offer us high quality and accuracy w.r.t XCT segmentation. The future research should focus on comparing numerical simulation based on analytical modelling and molecular level approaches, such as pore network modelling and Lattice-Gas or Boltzmann methods respectively.

However, all traffic micro-simulation models require a suitable car-following model to show the real situation in the best way possible. Several car-following models have been proposed. An obvious disadvantage of the former models is the great number of parameters which are difficult to calibrate. Moreover, any change in these parameters creates considerable disturbances. In this paper, a car-following model was proposed using the Epsilon-Support Vector Regression (e-SVR) method whose output is the acceleration of the following car. Radial Basis Function was used as the kernel of the e-SVR method, and the model parameters were tuned using the Grid Search method. The best values for the parameters were obtained. Furthermore, linear scaling in the interval [\u22121, 1] was used for both the training and testing input data, and the method was proven to more accurate than the case where no scaling was used. Accordingly, a car-following model with the mean squared error equal to 0.005 and the squared correlation coefficient equal to 0.98 was proposed using the function estimation method through the e-SVR method. Finally, the e-SVR output was compared with the results of the well-known car-following models, including Helly linear model, the GHR model, and the Gipps model. It was shown that, when using the scaling and parameters tuning techniques, the proposed method was more accurate compared to all three models mentioned above. Moreover, a function fitting Artificial Neural Network was run for this purpose and the outputs showed that the result of the e-SVR method is better than that of the function fitting method by the proposed ANN.

Two major problems are of interest when analyzing behavior. First, we wish to automatically categorize observed behaviors into a discrete set of classes (i.e., classification). For example, to determine word production from video sequences in sign language. Second, we wish to understand the relevance of each behavioral feature in achieving this classification (i.e., decoding). For instance, to know which behavior variables are used to discriminate between the words apple and onion in American Sign Language (ASL). The present paper proposes to model behavior using a labeled graph, where the nodes define behavioral features and the edges are labels specifying their order (e.g., before, overlaps, start). In this approach, classification reduces to a simple labeled graph matching. Unfortunately, the complexity of labeled graph matching grows exponentially with the number of categories we wish to represent. Here, we derive a graph kernel to quickly and accurately compute this graph similarity. This approach is very general and can be plugged into any kernel-based classifier. Specifically, we derive a Labeled Graph Support Vector Machine (LGSVM) and a Labeled Graph Logistic Regressor (LGLR) that can be readily employed to discriminate between many actions (e.g., sign language concepts). The derived approach can be readily used for decoding too, yielding invaluable information for the understanding of a problem (e.g., to know how to teach a sign language).

To solve these problems, a robust detection method for bearings early fault is proposed based on deep transfer learning. The method includes offline stage and online stage. In the offline stage, by introducing a deep auto-encoder network with domain adaptation, the distribution inconsistency of normal state data among different bearings can be weakened, then the common feature representation of the normal state is obtained. With the extracted common features, a new state assessment method based on the robust deep auto-encoder network is proposed to evaluate the boundary between normal state and early fault state in the low-rank feature space. By training a support vector machine classifier, the detection model is established. In the online stage, along with the data batch arriving sequentially, the features of target bearing are extracted using the common representation learnt in the offline stage, and online detection is conducted by feeding them into the SVM model.

The Naive Bayes Classifier treats features independently while ILP combines structural fragments, and then creates new features with higher predictive power. SVILP is a very recently presented method which adds a support vector machine after common ILP procedures. The performance of the methods is evaluated via a number of statistical measures, namely recall, specificity, precision, F-measure, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and enrichment factor (EF). According to the F-measure, which takes both recall and precision into account, SVILP is for seven out of the 11 classes the superior method. The results show that the Bayes Classifier gives the best recall performance for eight of the 11 targets, but has a much lower precision, specificity and F-measure. The SVILP model on the other hand has the highest recall for only three of the 11 classes, but generally far superior specificity and precision.

Different approaches like grid search or genetic algorithms are frequently employed to find suitable parameter values for a given dataset. Grid search has the advantage of finding more accurate solutions in general at the cost of higher computation time. Genetic algorithms, on the other hand, are able to find good solutions in less time, but the accuracy of these solutions is usually lower than those of grid search. ::: ::: This paper uses ideas from meta-learning and case-based reasoning to provide good starting points to the genetic algorithm. The presented approach reaches the accuracy of grid search at a significantly lower computational cost. We performed extensive experiments for optimizing learning parameters of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Random Forest classifiers on over 100 datasets from UCI and StatLib repositories. For the SVM classifier, grid search achieved an average accuracy of 81 % and took six hours for training, whereas the standard genetic algorithm obtained 74 % accuracy in close to one hour of training. Our method was able to achieve an average accuracy of 81 % in only about 45 minutes. Similar results were achieved for the Random Forest classifier. Besides a standard genetic algorithm, we also compared the presented method with three state-of-the-art optimization algorithms: Generating Set Search, Dividing Rectangles, and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy. Experimental results show that our method achieved the highest average accuracy for both classifiers. Our approach can be particularly useful when training classifiers on large datasets where grid search is not feasible.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10994-012-5286-7", "venue": "Machine Learning", "journal": "Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2165607334", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["205699441", "59849738", "14005549", "11665967", "17832858", "2307715", "7294959", "36698128", "2449067", "89141", "961425", "14607075", "52874011", "7553535", "120540807", "5366603", "13104477", "12512548", "14695997", "16018371", "14561315", "123674634", "3003326", "40727357", "2560098", "197458985", "12575623", "14154922", "17506186", "7700416", "44945", "17857546", "15073425", "17063820", "14357226", "1526774", "2369955", "207107909"], "inbound_citations": ["32800889", "168170126", "201141665", "207462632", "198953486", "160011452", "12359893", "3800517", "16443599", "13446727", "23059565", "3934212", "16512076", "1722467", "7782275", "113397476", "8283795", "54012359", "16039740", "67265534", "52883908", "10765617", "18123349", "7277001", "35927769", "16981640", "215679433", "14909316", "14863760", "8829519", "13548623", "54448334", "52938664", "20025704", "22057273", "17040657", "856717", "119190", "14930279", "6937805", "174799520", "16341965", "14709546", "56422201", "26878950", "53109768", "81977668", "43367612", "4820475", "18014762", "58008019", "23589308", "15310643", "28185631", "15992194", "208881499"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3248302"}

In contrast, generating a training dataset via a computer simulation can significantly simplify the development stage and allow tremendous saving in time and costs.

In this work, we identified different graph features to detect BGP anomalies, which are arguably more robust than traditional features. We evaluate such features through an extensive comparison of different ML algorithms, i.e., Naive Bayes classifier (NB), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), to specifically detect BGP path leaks. We show that SVM offers a good trade-off between precision and recall. Finally, we provide insights into the graph features' characteristics during the anomalous and non-anomalous interval and provide an interpretation of the ML classifier results.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3359992.3366640", "venue": "Big-DAMA '19", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2990923974", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208157521"}

Non-negative matrix factorization is a popular tool for multi-view learning, which can be employed to represent and learn heterogeneous law features comprehensively. However, current NMF-based techniques generally use clean multi-view datasets to generate common subspace, while in practice, they often contain some noises or unrelated items so that the performance of the algorithms may be severely degraded. In this paper, we propose to develop a novel subspace learning model, called Adaptive Dual Graph-regularized Multi-View Non-Negative Feature Learning (ADMFL), for multi-view data representation. We utilize the geometric structures of both data and feature manifold to model the distribution of data points in the common subspace. Meanwhile, we lift the effect of unrelated features down through separating the view-specific features for each view. Moreover, we introduce a weight factor for all views and maintain the sparsity of the latent common representation. An effective objective function is thus designed and iteratively updated until convergence. Experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed ADMFL method outperforms other compared methods in the paper.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.future.2019.05.055", "venue": "Future Gener.

A number of previous works have shown that it performs well in measuring the similarities of individuals given a set of correctly labeled pairwise data by domain experts. These important and precisely-labeled pairwise data are often highly sensitive in real world (e.g., patients similarity). This paper studies, for the first time, how pairwise information can be leaked to attackers during distance metric learning, and develops differential pairwise privacy (DPP), generalizing the definition of standard differential privacy, for secure metric learning. Unlike traditional differential privacy which only applies to independent samples, thus cannot be used for pairwise data, DPP successfully deals with this problem by reformulating the worst case. Specifically, given the pairwise data, we reveal all the involved correlations among pairs in the constructed undirected graph. DPP is then formalized that defines what kind of DML algorithm is private to preserve pairwise data. After that, a case study employing the contrastive loss is exhibited to clarify the details of implementing a DPP-DML algorithm. Particularly, the sensitivity reduction technique is proposed to enhance the utility of the output distance metric.

In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning theory has provided a technical approach for solving medical image classification tasks. However, deep learning has the following problems in medical image classification. First, it is impossible to construct a deep learning model hierarchy for medical image properties; second, the network initialization weights of deep learning models are not well optimized. Therefore, this paper starts from the perspective of network optimization and improves the nonlinear modeling ability of the network through optimization methods. A new network weight initialization method is proposed, which alleviates the problem that existing deep learning model initialization is limited by the type of the nonlinear unit adopted and increases the potential of the neural network to handle different visual tasks. Moreover, through an in-depth study of the multicolumn convolutional neural network framework, this paper finds that the number of features and the convolution kernel size at different levels of the convolutional neural network are different. In contrast, the proposed method can construct different convolutional neural network models that adapt better to the characteristics of the medical images of interest and thus can better train the resulting heterogeneous multicolumn convolutional neural networks. Finally, using the adaptive sliding window fusion mechanism proposed in this paper, both methods jointly complete the classification task of medical images. Based on the above ideas, this paper proposes a medical classification algorithm based on a weight initialization/sliding window fusion for multilevel convolutional neural networks. The methods proposed in this study were applied to breast mass, brain tumor tissue, and medical image database classification experiments. The results show that the proposed method not only achieves a higher average accuracy than that of traditional machine learning and other deep learning methods but also is more stable and more robust.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2019/9151670", "venue": "Complexity", "journal": "Complexity", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2981188034", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3824255", "64586614", "125548692", "152978", "1412315", "3767412", "10843336", "206359952", "10848380", "17147775", "2018752", "4944746", "15257120", "14910852", "17606900", "16225739", "2922664", "2324186", "1861903", "5394579", "123076974", "1927050", "211238437", "1658773", "2505895", "8753857", "1331231", "6700794", "6394568", "215660025", "2678735", "32710", "12007299", "4705764", "4303794", "4653066", "6180880", "27575429", "13740328", "5575601", "13713980", "6099034", "4852647", "9198110", "17880211", "46875403", "19102192", "7523372", "10840552", "899238", "24746605", "207190844", "215151345", "4234660", "53094515", "50776046"], "inbound_citations": ["211545235"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207796551"}

In particular, we exploit an iterative STN warping scheme and propose a sequential training strategy that achieves better results compared to naive training of a single generator. One of the key advantages of ST-GAN is its applicability to high-resolution images indirectly since the predicted warp parameters are transferable between reference frames.

Text mining method was adopted to screen suicidal behaviors. The performances of different combinations of six algorithms and two term weighting factors were compared under various training set sizes, which were assessed by precision, recall, F1-value and accuracy. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: A total of 3600 psychiatric inpatients (1800 with suicidal behaviors and 1800 without suicidal behaviors) were included in this study. In chief complaints of suicidal inpatients, \"suicide\", \"notion\" and \"suspicion\" were the commonest statements, appearing 1228, 705 and 638 times respectively. In contrast, \"excitement\", \"instability\" and \"impulsion\" appeared more frequently in chief complaints of patients without suicidal behaviors (599, 599, 534 times respectively). The performance of each algorithm was generally improved with the increasing training set sizes and tended to be stable when the number of training cases reached 1000, where most of them could achieve satisfactory accuracy values (>0.95). Results of testing set showed that SVM, Random Forest and AdaBoost weighted by TF had better generalization ability. The F1 values were 0.9889 for SVM, 0.9838 for random forest and 0.9828 for AdaBoost, respectively. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: This study confirmed the feasibility of filtering suicidal inpatients with small amounts of representative terms.

Then, a parameter sharing multi-agent gradient-descent Sarsa( $\\lambda$ ) algorithm is proposed to train the units. The learning policy is shared among our units to encourage cooperative behaviors.

However, in text, users can have a strong intuition about the relevance of features, that is, words that are indicative of a topic. In this work we show that user prior knowledge on features is useful for text classification, a domain with many irrelevant and redundant features. The benefit of feature selection is more pronounced when the objective is to learn a classifier with as few training examples as possible. We will demonstrate the role of feature feedback in training a classifier to suitable performance quickly. We find that aggressive feature feedback is necessary to focus the classifier during the early stages of active learning by mitigating the Hughes phenomenon. We will describe an algorithm for tandem learning that begins with a couple of labeled instances, and then at each iteration recommends features and instances for a user to label. The algorithm contains methods to incorporate feature feedback into Support Vector Machines. We design an oracle to estimate an upper bound on tandem learning performance. Tandem learning using an oracle results in much better performance than learning on only features or only instances. We find that humans can emulate the oracle to an extent that results in performance (accuracy) comparable to that of the oracle. Our unique experimental design helps factor out system error from human error, leading to a better understanding of when and why interactive feature selection works from a user perspective. We also design a set of difficulty measures that capture the inherent instance and feature complexity of a problem. We verify the robustness of our measures by showing how instance and feature complexity are highly correlated. Our complexity measures serve as a tool to understand when tandem learning is beneficial for text classification.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2153152620", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30496082"}

Many recent trackers utilize appearance samples in previous frames to form the bases upon which the object appearance model is built. This approach has the following limitations: 1) The bases are data driven, so they can be easily corrupted, and 2) it is difficult to robustly update the bases in challenging situations. In this paper, we construct an appearance model using the 3D discrete cosine transform (3D-DCT). The 3D-DCT is based on a set of cosine basis functions which are determined by the dimensions of the 3D signal and thus independent of the input video data. In addition, the 3D-DCT can generate a compact energy spectrum whose high-frequency coefficients are sparse if the appearance samples are similar. By discarding these high-frequency coefficients, we simultaneously obtain a compact 3D-DCT-based object representation and a signal reconstruction-based similarity measure (reflecting the information loss from signal reconstruction). To efficiently update the object representation, we propose an incremental 3D-DCT algorithm which decomposes the 3D-DCT into successive operations of the 2D discrete cosine transform (2D-DCT) and 1D discrete cosine transform (1D-DCT) on the input video data. As a result, the incremental 3D-DCT algorithm only needs to compute the 2D-DCT for newly added frames as well as the 1D-DCT along the third dimension, which significantly reduces the computational complexity.

Compared with other ensemble techniques, it has proved its accuracy and superiority. Many researchers, however, believe that there is still room for enhancing and improving its performance in terms of predictive accuracy. This explains why, over the past decade, there have been many extensions of RF where each extension employed a variety of techniques and strategies to improve certain aspect(s) of RF. Since it has been proven empirically that ensembles tend to yield better results when there is a significant diversity among the constituent models, the objective of this paper is twofolds. First, it investigates how an unsupervised learning technique, namely, Local Outlier Factor (LOF) can be used to identify diverse trees in the RF. Second, trees with the highest LOF scores are then used to produce an extension of RF termed LOFB-DRF that is much smaller in size than RF, and yet performs at least as good as RF, but mostly exhibits higher performance in terms of accuracy. The latter refers to a known technique called ensemble pruning. Experimental results on 10 real datasets prove the superiority of our proposed extension over the traditional RF. Unprecedented pruning levels reaching 99% have been achieved at the time of boosting the predictive accuracy of the ensemble. The notably high pruning level makes the technique a good candidate for real-time applications.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1503.05187", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1717382153", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11149239", "14317314", "667135", "2594813", "6644398", "207738357", "89141", "5895004", "27026167", "16006860", "1097238", "4881681", "2976898", "6977096", "1107076", "10225272", "539863", "16135270", "14255964", "1829111", "31039418", "12470146", "15564115", "121630981", "15209254", "41739913", "14262721", "12354159", "13861754", "2702042"], "inbound_citations": ["210172011", "14971817", "28266981"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18678530"}

Their death toll and economic impact are shocking, with 9 out of 10 deaths occurring in low or middle-income countries; and road traffic crashes representing 3% of their gross domestic product. One way to mitigate these issues is to develop technology to effectively assist the driver, perhaps making him more aware about how her (his) decisions influence safety. Following this idea, in this paper we evaluate computational models that can score the behavior of a driver based on a risky-safety scale. Potential applications of these models include car rental agencies, insurance companies or transportation service providers. In a previous work, we showed that Genetic Programming (GP) was a successful methodology to evolve mathematical functions with the ability to learn how people subjectively score a road trip. The input to this model was a vector of frequencies of risky maneuvers, which were supposed to be detected in a sensor layer. Moreover, GP was shown, even with statistical significance, to be better than six other Machine Learning strategies, including Neural Networks, Support Vector Regression and a Fuzzy Inference system, among others. A pending task, since then, was to evaluate if a more detailed comparison of different strategies based on GP could improve upon the best GP model. In this work, we evaluate, side by side, scoring functions evolved by three different variants of GP. In the end, the results suggest that two of these strategies are very competitive in terms of accuracy and simplicity, both generating models that could be implemented in current technology that seeks to assist the driver in real-world scenarios.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/mca23020019", "venue": null, "journal": "Mathematical & Computational Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2795395500", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["30225878", "9166094", "23312161", "36813345", "5156932", "10826583", "337825", "115113710", "12468103", "671735", "2957414", "6525234", "3332288", "18165463", "498161", "5583023", "124479573", "7553535"], "inbound_citations": ["52008146"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52846755"}

However, because EPC compensates for the effects of underlying disturbances, the disturbance patterns are embedded and hard to be recognized. Effective recognition of disturbance patterns is a very important issue for process improvement since disturbance patterns would be associated with certain assignable causes which affect the process.

Motivated by the superior structural information content in tensors over vectors, we investigate the usefulness of the tensor extension of SVM, termed the Support Tensor Machine (STM), in the financial application of forecasting the daily direction of movement of price of the S&P 500 financial index.

Next, a method to allow kernel usage in LS-STM is also introduced. The LS-STM based results are interpreted probabilistically via Platt scaling, while performance is evaluated comprehensively in terms of accuracy rate, annualized Sharpe ratio, and annualized volatility.

Statistical modeling techniques, such as the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), have been widely exploited because of their capability of reconstructing a plausible model grounding on the prior knowledge of the facial shape. However, most of these techniques derive an approximated and smooth reconstruction of the face, without accounting for fine-grained details. In this work, we propose an approach based on a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) for refining the coarse reconstruction provided by a 3DMM. The latter is represented as a three channels image, where the pixel intensities represent the depth, curvature and elevation values of the 3D vertices. The architecture is an encoder\u2013decoder, which is trained progressively, starting from the lower-resolution layers; this technique allows a more stable training, which leads to the generation of high quality outputs even when high-resolution images are fed during the training. Experimental results show that our method is able to produce reconstructions with fine-grained realistic details and lower reconstruction errors with respect to the 3DMM.

Our idea is inspired by adversarial learning method originated from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We propose a GAN-style approach, where a generator is designed to produce uncertain or conflicting voices, complicating the original conversational threads in order to pressurize the discriminator to learn stronger rumor indicative representations from the augmented, more challenging examples.

Despite the powerful ability of PCA-subspace method for network-wide traffic detection, it cannot be effectively used for detection on a single link. In this paper, different from most works focusing on detection on flow-level traffic, based on observations of six traffic features for packet-level traffic, we propose a new approach B6-SVM to detect anomalies for packet-level traffic on a single link. The basic idea of B6-SVM is to diagnose anomalies in a multi-dimensional view of traffic features using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Through two-phase classification, B6-SVM can detect anomalies with high detection rate and low false alarm rate. The test results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our technique in diagnosing anomalies. Further, compared to previous feature-based anomaly detection approaches, B6-SVM provides a framework to automatically identify possible anomalous types.

Although transfer learning has been widely researched in the last decade, existing research still has two restrictions: 1) the feature spaces of the domains must be homogeneous; and 2) the target domain must have at least a few labeled instances. These restrictions significantly limit transfer learning models when transferring knowledge across domains, especially in the big data era. To completely break through both of these bottlenecks, a theorem for reliable unsupervised knowledge transfer is proposed to avoid negative transfers, and a Grassmann manifold is applied to measure the distance between heterogeneous feature spaces. Based on this theorem and the Grassmann manifold, this study proposes two heterogeneous unsupervised knowledge transfer (HeUKT) models - known as RLG and GLG. The RLG uses a linear monotonic map (LMM) to reliably project two heterogeneous feature spaces onto a latent feature space and applies geodesic flow kernel (GFK) model to transfers knowledge between two the projected domains. The GLG optimizes the LMM to achieve the highest possible accuracy and guarantees that the geometric properties of the domains remain unchanged during the transfer process. To test the overall effectiveness of two models, this paper reorganizes five public datasets into ten heterogeneous cross-domain tasks across three application fields: credit assessment, text classification, and cancer detection.

Threat assessment algorithms must be capable of predicting the future movement of other vehicles. Many algorithms, however, predict future trajectories based only on the model of the dynamics and the environment, which implies that they sometimes make too conservative predictions. This work reduces this conservativeness by capturing the driver intention of other vehicles using a random-forests classifier. Then, the algorithm computes possible future trajectories with a sequential Monte Carlo method, which biases the predicted trajectory by the recognized intention. Lastly, the algorithm calculates the potential threat to the ego vehicle. To evaluate the performance, we conduct numerical simulations and show that the proposed algorithm can accurately capture driver intentions and prevent motion predictions that are too conservative.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.2231", "venue": null, "journal": "IFAC-PapersOnLine", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2765222405", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["9663461", "14232244", "16317020", "526370", "18511805", "14990169", "12299776", "16823757", "14171346", "15337592", "18860855", "17463807", "2513460", "62782924", "17513949", "18452717", "17981472", "14866766"], "inbound_citations": ["199585116", "52022272", "56170547", "211684891", "212636279", "197468187"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28920011"}

The deep learning technique has been verified to be effective for this task and achieved state-of-the-art performance.

To this issue, this paper firstly proposes a semi-supervised learning paradigm toward this task. Different from traditional deep learning methods which only use supervised image pairs with/without synthesized rains, we further put real rainy images, without need of their clean ones, into the network training process. This is realized by elaborately formulating the residual between an input rainy image and its expected network output (clear image without rain) as a concise mixture of Gaussians distribution. The network is therefore trained to transfer to adapting the real rain pattern domain instead of only the synthesis rain domain, and thus both the short-of-training-sample and bias-to-supervised-sample issues can be evidently alleviated.

One of the promising tools is Raman micro-spectroscopy, also known as Raman microscopy, a nondestructive and label-free imaging technique based on light scattered after reflection. Our group has recently developed a rapid standardized protocol for the preparation of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) diagnostic tissues suitable for Raman microscopy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of Raman microscopy to assess the prognosis of prostate cancer patients with FFPE tissues from radical prostatectomy. Methods: Patients treated by first-line radical prostatectomy between 1994 and 2004 at Centre hospitalier de l\u2019Universite de Montreal (CHUM) were included in this study. FFPE prostate cancer tissues from surgery were used for the construction of tissue microarrays (TMAs). To enable Raman microscopy, TMA sections of 4 \u00b5m were placed on low-cost aluminum slides. The rapid dewaxing protocol of the hospital was used (8 minutes), followed by 20 minutes of vacuum drying. All Raman spectra were acquired with the Renishaw inVia confocal Raman microscope equipped with a 785-nm line focus laser. After removing background contributions (e.g., autofluorescence) for each spectrum with Wire 4.4 software, a custom toolbox in MATLAB was used to predict biochemical recurrence. Chemometric methods and calculated ratios were used for the analysis of Raman microscopy images. Results: A total of 320 Raman spectra from 80 patients were analyzed from prostate cancer TMAs, representing 25 patients with biochemical recurrence within 18 months after radical prostatectomy and 55 without. Using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique and correlation feature selection for classification, our results with Raman microscopy identified biochemical recurrence with an accuracy of 83.7%, a sensitivity of 84.0% and a specificity of 83.6%. Raman peak assignment of features was used to investigate the molecular differences between these two patient groups. We found that the molecular constituents of RNA and phosphorylated proteins were more important in prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence. In contrast, Raman peaks of the phospholipid head of cell membranes, DNA, and collagen were more intense in prostate cancer without biochemical recurrence. For the visualization of these different molecular constituents of prostate cancer, we developed two methods of Raman microscopy imaging. The first method involved analysis of chemometric data (i.e., extraction of chemical information) to identify the whole tissue (phenylalanine), nuclei (DNA), and red blood cells (hemoglobin), followed by background removal. The images of our chemometric analysis created a virtual staining of hematoxylin and eosin (HE 2017 Dec 2-5; Orlando, Florida.

In general, GSVM works in 3 steps. Step 1 is granulation to build a sequence of information granules from the original dataset or from the original feature space. Step 2 is modeling Support Vector Machines (SVM) in some of these information granules when necessary.

Although the 121 loci ( 1 / 16 square degrees) from which the 445 samples of B. trapezoidea were collected are much fewer than the number reported for B. capensis , the range of its geographical distribution is almost as widespread as that of B. capensis . The limited distribution of B. trapezoidea in the Limpopo, Northern Cape and Western Cape Provinces can most probably be attributed to the paucity of perennial water bodies in these areas and the fact that Burnupia spp. in general have poor abilities to overcome conditions of desiccation prevalent in these areas. It is therefore not surprising that the majority of samples were collected in perennial rivers and streams. A Random Forest statistical analysis selected water bodies, the presence or absence of marginal and aquatic vegetation, and type of substratum as the most important variables that played a significant role in determining the presence and numbers of specimens of B. trapezoidea in a specific area. In this respect, temperature and turbidity, respectively, played a moderate and minor role. Little is known regarding the conservation status of Burnupia spp, in general, but habitat degradation and climatic warming could be reasons for concern. However, in extensive on-going biodiversity surveys in two rivers and selected tributaries in the North-West Province, many new distribution records of B. trapezoidea are still being created and therefore this species could probably be considered for listing as not endangered. In view of its wide distribution, largely sessile, benthic lifestyle, and ability to bioaccumulate various substances, the feasibility to utilise it as indicator of river ecosystem health in South Africa should be explored.

Theoretical network models that feature heterogeneous cell populations or partially random connectivity also give rise to diverse tuning curves. Empirical tuning curve distributions can thus be utilized to make model-based inferences about the statistics of single-cell parameters and network connectivity. However, a general framework for such an inference or fitting procedure is lacking. We address this problem by proposing to view mechanistic network models as implicit generative models whose parameters can be optimized to fit the distribution of experimentally measured tuning curves. A major obstacle for fitting such models is that their likelihood function is not explicitly available or is highly intractable. Recent advances in machine learning provide ways for fitting implicit generative models without the need to evaluate the likelihood and its gradient. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide one such framework which has been successful in traditional machine learning tasks. We apply this approach in two separate experiments, showing how GANs can be used to fit commonly used mechanistic circuit models in theoretical neuroscience to datasets of tuning curves. This fitting procedure avoids the computationally expensive step of inferring latent variables, such as the biophysical parameters of, or synaptic connections between, particular recorded cells. Instead, it directly learns generalizable model parameters characterizing the network\u2019s statistical structure such as the statistics of strength and spatial range of connections between different cell types. Another strength of this approach is that it fits the joint high-dimensional distribution of tuning curves, instead of matching a few summary statistics picked a priori by the user, resulting in a more accurate inference of circuit properties. More generally, this framework opens the door to direct model-based inference of circuit structure from data beyond single-cell tuning curves, such as simultaneous population recordings.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6493775", "pubmed_id": "31002660", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006816", "venue": "PLoS Computational Biology", "journal": "PLoS Computational Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2939061197", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["18118831", "96252", "1146461", "5937602", "2186283", "14522621", "2396188", "2789786", "4334294", "10087537", "16677359", "18445500", "3069046", "1546069", "1184273", "40304979", "27391140", "12209503", "13803015", "10894094", "16967637", "946870", "11758569", "118347220", "536962", "15876696", "119340172", "5575601", "8236317", "3312944", "8993325"], "inbound_citations": ["202766930", "204161428"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124144979"}

Such a large amount of information may lead us to a deeper investigation of the materials on Earth's surface, and thus, a more precise interpretation of them. In this work, we aim to produce a thematic map that is more accurate by combining multiple classification methods. Three feature representations based on spectral and spatial data and two learning algorithms (Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP)) were used to produce six different classification methods to perform the combination. Our combining approach is based on Weighted Linear Combination (WLC), in which weights are found using a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-WLC-GA. Experiments were carried out with two well-known datasets: Indian Pines and Pavia University. In order to evaluate the robustness of the proposed combiner, experiments using different training sizes were conducted.

The proposed pattern classifier is compared with MLP (multi-layered perceptron) using back propagation (BP) learning algorithm. The ECG signals taken from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database are used in training to classify 6 different arrhythmia, plus normal ECG. The MLP and SVM training and testing stages were carried out twice. They were first trained only with one ECG lead signal and then a second ECG lead signal was added to the training and testing datasets. The aim was to investigate its influence on training and testing performance (generalization ability) plus time of training for both classifiers. Implementation of these three criteria for evaluation of ECG signals classification will ease the problem of structural comparisons, which has not been given attention in previous research works. The results indicate that SVM in comparison to MLP is much faster in training stage and nearly seven times higher in performance, but MLP generalization ability in terms of mean square error is more than three times less.

The feature selection stage characterises the landmark using the Opponent SIFT, a color-based variant of the SIFT descriptor. To reduce the dimensionality of this descriptor, an incremental non-parametric discriminant analysis is conducted to seek directions for efficient discrimination (incremental eigenspace learning). On the other hand, the classification stage uses the incremental envolving clustering method (ECM) to group feature vectors into a set of clusters (incremental prototype learning). Then, the final classification is conducted based on the k-nearest neighbor approach, whose prototypes were updated by the ECM. This global scheme enables a classifier to learn incrementally, on-line, and in one pass. Besides, the ECM allows to reduce the memory and computation expenses.

While improving detection and diminishing the false alarm rates, performance accelerates in IDS. Based on this, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approaches employed newly to project features space to principal feature space and equivalent to the highest eigenvalue, it chooses the features. However, these selected features may not have the optimal sensitivity due as they ignore many sensitive features. Objective: Developing an anomaly network intrusion detection system based on Principal Component Analysis and Genetic Algorithm feature selection process and applying modified artificial bee colony (mABC) to optimize the Multiple Correlation based Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (MCKELM). Results: Highest detection rate and requiring much less computational cost and its performance is superior to existing methods.

However, only a handful of reports have examined the recognition content beyond this dichotomous simplification. To address this, we collected participants' written justifications in support of ordinary old/new recognition decisions accompanied by confidence ratings using a 3-point scale (high/medium/low). Unlike prior research, we did not provide the participants with any descriptions of Remembering or Knowing and thus, if the justifications mapped well onto theory, they would do so spontaneously. Word frequency analysis (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams), independent ratings, and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machine [SVM]) converged in demonstrating that the linguistic content of high and medium confidence recognition differs in a manner consistent with dual process theories of recognition. For example, the use of \"I remember,\" particularly when combined with temporal or perceptual information (e.g., \"when,\" \"saw,\" \"distinctly\"), was heavily associated with high confidence recognition. Conversely, participants also used the absence of remembering for personally distinctive materials as support for high confidence new reports (\"would have remembered\"). Thus, participants afford a special status to the presence or absence of remembering and use this actively as a basis for high confidence during recognition judgments. Additionally, the pattern of classification successes and failures of a SVM was well anticipated by the dual process signal detection model of recognition and inconsistent with a single process, strictly unidimensional approach.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4049202", "pubmed_id": "23957366", "doi": "10.1037/a0034059", "venue": "Journal of experimental psychology.

Correct character recognition is the premise of text recognition and affects the overall performance to large extent. This paper proposes a novel character representation for scene text recognition.

The relativity is measured by the distance of vector that is generated by a trained Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) between the target key point and other key points in each context bin. In order to recognize each individual character, we adopt a bag-of-words approach, in which the rotation-invariant context features are densely extracted from an individual character. All key points' context features are prone to build a vocabulary of visual words by using k-means clustering. Then we train a set of two-class linear Support Vector Machines in a one-vs-all schema for each category character. By using densely extracted context features that are rotation-invariant and efficient, our method is capable of recognizing perspective texts of arbitrary orientations.

Years of research on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have made it possible to merge multiple RGB-D images into a single point cloud and provide a 3D model for a complete indoor scene. However, these reconstructed models only have geometry information, not including semantic knowledge. The advancements in robot autonomy and capabilities for carrying out more complex tasks in unstructured environments can be greatly enhanced by endowing environment models with semantic knowledge. Towards this goal, we propose a novel approach to generate 3D semantic maps for an indoor scene. Our approach creates a 3D reconstructed map from a RGB-D image sequence firstly, then we jointly infer the semantic object category and structural class for each point of the global map. 12 object categories (e.g. walls, tables, chairs) and 4 structural classes (ground, structure, furniture and props) are labeled in the global map. In this way, we can totally understand both the object and structure information. In order to get semantic information, we compute semantic segmentation for each RGB-D image and merge the labeling results by a Dense Conditional Random Field. Different from previous techniques, we use temporal information and higher-order cliques to enforce the label consistency for each image labeling result. Our experiments demonstrate that temporal information and higher-order cliques are significant for the semantic mapping procedure and can improve the precision of the semantic mapping results.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11370-016-0201-x", "venue": null, "journal": "Intelligent Service Robotics", "mag_id": "2470820246", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211068850", "2053482", "202542412", "204817008", "19702055", "7618954", "52290097", "199582404", "3731974", "211057381"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3701230"}

In this paper, we attempt to alleviate two limitations of IGML: (A) the time complexity of IGML increases rapidly for high dimensional data, (B) IGML has to transform the input low rank kernel into a full-rank one since it is undefined for singular matrices. To this end, two novel algorithms, referred to as Efficient Information Geometry Metric Learning (EIGML) and Scalable Information Geometry Metric Learning (SIGML), are proposed. EIGML scales linearly with the dimensionality, resulting in significantly reduced computational complexity. As for SIGML, it is proven to have a range-space preserving property.

To address this issue, in this paper we propose an online algorithm by combining Incremental Learning (IL) and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) based on local sparse representation for tracking an object in a video system. First, the target location is estimated using the online updated IL. Then, to decrease the visual drift due to the accumulation of errors while updating IL subspace with the first step results, a two-step object tracking method combining a static IL model with a dynamical MIL model is proposed. We utilize information of the static IL model involving the singular values, the Eigen template to avoid visual drift if there is no significant appearance change in the tracked objects. Otherwise, we use the dynamical MIL model to discriminate the target from the background when there is significant appearance change in the tracked objects.

Evidence has suggested that land-based nutrient runoff has accelerated recent outbreaks of COTS requiring extensive use of divers to manually inject biological agents into the starfish in an attempt to control population numbers. Facilitating this control program using robotics is the goal of our research. In this paper we introduce a vision-based COTS detection and tracking system based on a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) trained on images from underwater footage. To track COTS with a moving camera, we embed the RFC in a particle filter detector and tracker where the predicted class probability of the RFC is used as an observation probability to weight the particles, and we use a sparse optical flow estimation for the prediction step of the filter.

However, machine learning based methods have a significant overhead in preparing training data and effective features. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer neural network based architecture for API extraction. Our architecture automatically learns character-, word- and sentence-level features from the input texts, thus removing the need for manual feature engineering and the dependence on advanced features (e.g., API gazzetter) beyond the input texts. We also propose to adopt transfer learning to adapt a source-library-trained model to a target-library, thus reducing the overhead of manual training-data labeling when the software text of multiple programming languages and libraries need to be processed. We conduct extensive experiments with six libraries of four programming languages which support diverse functionalities and have different API-naming and API-mention characteristics. Our experiments investigate the performance of our neural architecture for API extraction in informal software texts, the importance of different features, the effectiveness of transfer learning.

Second, since these algorithms generally select their training examples at random, they can be inefficient if labeling effort is limited.

Standard support vector machines (SVMs), which minimize the L2 norm for the primal variables, only lead to sparse solutions for the dual variables. L1 based SVMs, directly minimizing the L1 norm, have been used for feature selection with omics data. However, most current methods directly solve the primal formulations of the problem, which are not computationally scalable. The computational complexity increases with the number of features. In addition, L1 norm is known to be asymptotically biased and not consistent for feature selection. In this paper, we develop an efficient method for sparse support vector machines with L0 norm approximation. The proposed method approximates the L0 minimization through solving a series of L2 optimization problems, which can be formulated with dual variables. It finds the optimal solution for p primal variables through estimating n dual variables, which is more efficient as long as the sample size is small. L0 approximation leads to sparsity in both dual and primal variables, and can be used for both feature and sample selections. The proposed method identifies much less number of features and achieves similar performances in simulations.

As a result, the global performances of ELMs are slightly improved and the probability outputs are seen to be accurate and useful in practice.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-19222-2_13", "venue": "IWANN", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "579920800", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3344003", "18763212", "206741418", "2158569", "5516512", "116858", "43412237", "16024065", "11124791", "15897183", "17854427", "15058346", "18017528", "7117611", "10941293", "8850586", "14110601", "125113539", "10983227", "4193919", "123722079", "64599091"], "inbound_citations": ["133606075", "21050318", "42520928"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22964287"}

The micrographs have been processed in a simple way using segmentation and object recognition to identify the cross-section tracheids belonging to earlywood of 7 different timber species: Fagus sylvatica , Castanea sativa , Juglans regia , Eucalyptus globulus , Hymenaea courbaril , Pinus silvestris and Pinus radiata .

Feature selection and imbalance correction methods were tested and best approaches identified for application to organ transplant data. Then, we used 2011 liver match-run data to compare classifiers based on logistic regression, support vector machines, boosting, classification and regression trees, and Random Forests. Finally, because the accept-or-decline module will be embedded in a simulation model, we also developed an evaluation tool for comparing performance of predictors, which we call sample-path accuracy. The Random Forest method resulted in the smallest overall error rate, and boosting techniques had greater accuracy when both sensitivity and specificity were simultaneously considered important. Our comparisons show that no method dominates all others on all performance measures of interest. A logistic regression-based classifier is easy to implement and allows for pinpointing the contribution of each feature toward the probability of acceptance.

By applying this mathematical model, in addition to the confirmation of ATR-IR (a time and energy-saving method) as a replacement of Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy to produce the same results, chemometrical model was used to evaluate the output data in a faster and easier method. At first, ATR-IR spectra data converted to normal matrix by SNV preprocessing approach. Then, a relationship between iron concentrations achieved by AAS and ATR-IR data was established using PLS-LS-SVM. Consequently, model was able to predict ~99% of the samples with low error-values (root mean square-error of cross-validation equal to 0.98). Y-permutation test performed to confirm that the model was not assessed accidentally. Although, chemometric methods for detection of some heavy metals have been reported in the literature, combination of PLS-LS-SVM with ATR-IR was not cited.

The training of VGAN takes a two step procedure: given $p(\\mathbf{x})$, $q(\\mathbf{x})$ is updated to maximize the lower bound; $p(\\mathbf{x})$ is then updated one step with samples drawn from $q(\\mathbf{x})$ to decrease the lower bound. VGAN is inspired by the generative adversarial networks (GANs), where $p(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the discriminator and $q(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the generator, but with several notable differences. We hence name our model variational GANs (VGANs). VGAN provides a practical solution to training deep EBMs in high dimensional space, by eliminating the need of MCMC sampling.

In this paper, we use natural language processing and a deception-detection discourse to build hybrid models for detecting these forms of text-based cybercrime. Since we have four datasets each of which contains deceptive text messages representing a specific type of cybercrime and truthful text messages, we combine 2 datasets and 3 datasets together to generate training sets for the hybrid models with more than one type of cybercrime.

The models are then evaluated on test sets containing instances that were not part of the training sets. The results for model performance of NB, kNN and SVM classifiers are compared against those of ANN. Most the models generalize well in detecting cybercrime.

This is why the government enforced reforestation and afforestation measures and supported the conversion of agriculture from annual crops to permanent crops. High spatial resolution mapping of vegetation and in particular of forest cover is required for the implementation of spatially-explicit geo-hazards models. ::: The presented work is set in the framework of the YangtzeGeo project, an interdisciplinary cooperation involving German and Chinese research institutions. Our outcomes provide input to the models developed by our partners. ::: ::: The study site is the catchment of the Xiangxi River (~3,000 km2), a tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir. The area is topographically rugged, has a wide elevation range (300-3000 m a.sl.) and is mostly covered by woody vegetation. The natural formations, in the upper catchment, are evergreen broadleaf, deciduous broadleaf, coniferous and mixed forests. Semi-natural, mixed formations occur next to more populated areas. Shrubland occupies marginal or impervious areas whereas shrub-type crops (orange, tea) have rapidly expanded in the last two decades. ::: ::: We aim to map current forest cover and to assess the change occurred in the period before and after the realization of the Three Gorges Dam.

Though many algorithms have been developed, the Support Vector Machine - Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm is one of the best gene feature selection algorithms. It assumes that a smaller \"filter-out\" factor in the SVM-RFE, which results in a smaller number of gene features eliminated in each recursion, should lead to extraction of a better gene subset. Because the SVM-RFE is highly sensitive to the \"filter-out\" factor, our simulations have shown that this assumption is not always correct and that the SVM-RFE is an unstable algorithm. To select a set of key gene features for reliable prediction of cancer types or subtypes and other applications, a new two-stage SVM-RFE algorithm has been developed. It is designed to effectively eliminate most of the irrelevant, redundant and noisy genes while keeping information loss small at the first stage. A fine selection for the final gene subset is then performed at the second stage. The two-stage SVM-RFE overcomes the instability problem of the SVM-RFE to achieve better algorithm utility. We have demonstrated that the two-stage SVM-RFE is significantly more accurate and more reliable than the SVM-RFE and three correlation-based methods based on our analysis of three publicly available microarray expression datasets. Furthermore, the two-stage SVM-RFE is computationally efficient because its time complexity is O(d*log(2)d}, where d is the size of the original gene set.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17666757", "doi": "10.1145/1299023.1299028", "venue": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics", "journal": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["601814", "206742234", "19826992", "14617292", "9061359", "6736504", "2914506", "28637672", "194951", "17534825", "14727192", "61649919", "10039376", "18581098", "7785881", "18268475", "62571477", "12501049", "11625473", "4382833", "29753440", "87603416", "24127407", "41922148", "37893737", "41141517", "37745376", "12929471", "14665021", "5365891", "1664941", "29794450", "13242746", "16657940", "37970840", "2511790", "12373187", "14929117", "12678557", "15432928", "81873020"], "inbound_citations": ["17843768", "3817245", "195878486", "3273387", "14803820", "11498334", "18955683", "18244572", "6078908", "211227729", "6046964", "15180749", "1357002", "15850506", "3989653", "18976038", "15916723", "13821085", "212444603", "9156324", "698533", "15566151", "207946390", "17478468", "125771256", "11785806", "472254", "19108138", "16603592", "6971166", "35544662", "46965511", "29140743", "54787730", "27829244", "9840320"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5309921"}

It is a 21 m diameter dish and 25 m focal length Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) located at an altitude of 4270 m, highest for any existing IACT. In this paper, we estimate 4 performance characteristics of the MACE telescope, namely the trigger rate, the integral flux sensitivity, the angular resolution and the energy resolution in the dynamic energy range of \u223c 30 GeV - 10 TeV in the low zenith angle range ( 30\u00b0). We observe that the integral rate of the MACE telescope for the 4 closed clusters nearest neighbor (CCNN) trigger with single-channel photoelectron threshold of 9.0 photoelectrons is 1.03 kHz. The integral flux sensitivity of the telescope is expected to be 2.4 % with the threshold energy of 31 GeV. We employ the Random Forest method (RFM) and show that the MACE telescope is estimated to have an angular resolution, defined as the \u03c3 of a 2-dimensional Gaussian distribution, of \u223c 0 . 21 \u00b0 in the energy range of 30.0 - 47.0 GeV. The angular resolution improves with increasing \u03b3 -ray energy and reaches to a value of \u223c 0 . 06 \u00b0 in the energy range of 1.8 TeV - 3 TeV. We also evaluate 68% containment radius ( \u03c3 0 . 68 ) for the distribution of reconstructed arrival directions as an alternative estimate of angular resolution. We find \u03c3 0 . 68 to steadily improve from a value of 0.36\u00b0in the energy range of 30.0 - 47 GeV to a value of \u223c 0 . 09 \u00b0 in the energy range of 1.8 - 3 TeV. We also reconstructed \u03b3 -ray energies using the regressive RFM and estimated the energy resolution, defined as the \u03c3 of the 1-D Gaussian fitted to distribution of fractional difference between the true and estimated energy, as a function of \u03b3 -ray energy. The MACE telescope is estimated to have energy resolution of \u223c 40 % in the energy range (30 - 47) GeV (close to the analysis energy threshold of the MACE telescope), which improves to \u223c 19 . 8 % in the energy bin of 1.8 - 3 TeV.

The previous semisupervised methods were usually based on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces with a single kernel. In this paper, we propose a novel Laplacian least squares support vector machine in sum space (Lap-LSSVM-SS) for semisupervised HIC with multiscale kernels, which can simultaneously deal with the high and low frequency components of the target classification function with small and large scale kernels, respectively. Furthermore, due to its representation theorem, a noniterative algorithm based on the closed-form classification function of Lap-LSSVM-SS is provided to make a rapid semisupervised HIC possible in the multiple kernel learning framework. The proposed method can solve the multiclass problem of hyperspectral dataset directly. We further reduce the storage and computation cost of the proposed Lap-LSSVM-SS method with the random sampling strategy, i.e., Lap-LSSVM-SS-RS. We also show that the Lap-LSSVM-SS-RS method has near-optimal classification performance when the number of local Lap-LSSVM-SS machines is not too large. The experimental results on two real hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that Lap-LSSVM-SS-RS yields superior classification performance over the conventional semisupervised classifiers (e.g., LapSVM, S4VM, and BagSVMs, etc.) in challenging small training labeled samples and a large amount of unlabeled samples.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2873051", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2895826127", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16008390", "64543020", "8587614", "24743199", "10125108", "8714672", "60624922", "20035430", "16902615", "35205007", "19750558", "28020", "123004626", "63708941", "4862210", "8909227", "25566901", "12546795", "2133158", "252993", "12003790", "12108653", "118021014", "14832724", "46084530", "60633363", "44208366", "206765358", "26608307"], "inbound_citations": ["199669259", "38811161"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54454192"}

We extend the random forest approach to model a multivariate response as represented, for example, by time-course gene expression measures. An analysis of the multivariate random forest output reveals complex regulatory networks, which consist of cohesive, condition-dependent regulatory cliques.

In addition, we present evidence of the existence of an alternative MCB-binding pathway, which we confirm using data from two independent cell cycle studies and two other physioloigical processes.

Motivated by this, the paper explores the field of Triage, a relatively new branch of Digital Forensics intended to provide investigators with actionable intelligence through digital media inspection, and describes a new interdisciplinary approach that merges Digital Forensics techniques and Machine Learning principles. The proposed Triage methodology aims at automating the categorization of digital media on the basis of plausible connections between traces retrieved (i.e. digital evidence) and crimes under investigation. As an application of the proposed method, two case studies about copyright infringement and child pornography exchange are then presented to actually prove that the idea is viable. The term ''feature'' will be regarded in the paper as a quantitative measure of a ''plausible digital evidence'', according to the Machine Learning terminology. In this regard, we (a) define a list of crime-related features, (b) identify and extract them from available devices and forensic copies, (c) populate an input matrix and (d) process it with different Machine Learning mining schemes to come up with a device classification. We perform a benchmark study about the most popular mining algorithms (i.e. Bayes Networks, Decision Trees, Locally Weighted Learning and Support Vector Machines) to find the ones that best fit the case in question. Obtained results are encouraging as we will show that, triaging a dataset of 13 digital media and 45 copyright infringement-related features, it is possible to obtain more than 93% of correctly classified digital media using Bayes Networks or Support Vector Machines while, concerning child pornography exchange, with a dataset of 23 cell phones and 23 crime-related features it is possible to classify correctly 100% of the phones. In this regards, methods to reduce the number of linearly independent features are explored and classification results presented.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.diin.2013.01.001", "venue": "Digital Investigation", "journal": "Digital Investigation", "mag_id": "1972958568", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["8110286", "9218641", "61315462", "31486535", "8886766", "16662342", "199014218", "195776564", "8120832", "4803606", "53287461", "51994577", "3543076", "44095728", "21494186"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23047143"}

One solution would be to endow the systems with powerful learning procedures which could discover appropriate behaviors by observing an expert in action. A promising source of such learning procedures can be found in recent work on connectionist networks, that is, massively parallel networks of simple processing elements. This paper discusses a connectionist expert system that learns to play a simple video game by observing a human player. The game, Robots, is played on a two-dimensional board containing the player and a number of computer-controlled robots. The object of the game is for the player to move around the board in a manner that will force all of the robots to collide with one another before any robot is able to catch the player. The connectionist system learns to associate observed situations on the board with observed moves. It is capable not only of the human player, but of learning generalizations that apply to novel situations.

However, individual patient characteristics associated with treatment response are unknown. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: This integrated clinical data mining analysis was designed to identify factors associated with a clinically meaningful response to placebo or tadalafil 5mg once daily in an individual patient with LUTS-BPH. Analyses were performed on pooled data from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical studies, including about 1,500 patients, from which 107 baseline characteristics were selected and 8 response criteria. The split set evaluation method (1,000 repeats) was used to estimate prediction accuracy, with the database randomly split into training and test subsets. Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models were then generated on the training subset and used to predict response in the test subset. Prediction models were generated for placebo and tadalafil 5mg once daily Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis was used to select optimal prediction models lying on the ROC surface. ::: ::: ::: FINDINGS ::: International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) baseline group (mild/moderate vs. severe) for active treatment and placebo achieved the highest combined sensitivity and specificity of 70% and ~50% for all analyses, respectively. This was below the sensitivity and specificity threshold of 80% that would enable reliable allocation of an individual patient to either the responder or non-responder group. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: This extensive clinical data mining study in LUTS-BPH did not identify baseline clinical or demographic characteristics that were sufficiently predictive of an individual patient response to placebo or once daily tadalafil 5mg. However, the study reaffirms the efficacy of tadalalfil 5mg once daily in the treatment of LUTS-BPH in the majority of patients and the importance of evaluating individual patient need in selecting the most appropriate treatment.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4540425", "pubmed_id": "26284523", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0135484", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1819137214", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["21621665", "3184980", "2775629", "3188261", "24298825", "3848611", "10732570", "207670701", "40002866", "9582911", "42813823", "38001018", "23089689", "11472082", "208433716", "3952176", "41386776", "9935553", "60993494", "46492308", "2402240", "206787478", "89141", "31220083", "19265112", "44832984", "23754655", "25989061", "44606219", "72956724", "14834518", "33263989"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11008148"}

These neurons are a part of the interaural time difference (ITD) pathway. Recently, we have constructed a minimal biophysical model of these neurons that demonstrates some of the phase-locking and coincedence detection properties of these cells for stimulus frequency up to 2 kHz (Soc.Neurosci.Abstr.22,402). This point-neuron model failed to demontrate coincidence detection when many inputs arrived from both ears at the cell. In the present work, we have solved this problem by adding two simple dendritic structures to the point-neuron model. We have found that the contrast between the maximal spiking rate and the minimal spiking rate in the ITD curve was large when the inputs were located on the dendrites. Moreover, segregation of the inputs, i.e., putting all the inputs from each ear on the same dendrite (as is the case anatomically), further increased this contrast. Active dendrites also led to large improvements in ITD coding. On the other hand, when the dendrites were too long and the inputs were located far from the soma, the somatic response was very small. For higher best frequencies, the inputs must be closer to get similar somatic responses. Hence, there is an optimal dendritic length that is frequency dependent. We propose that the gradient of dendritic length found in the chick nucleus laminaris is related to these constraints. For stimulus frequencies above 2 kHz, the dendrites were not helpful, and the model which was constructed with data from low frequency cells failed to act as a coincidence detector. Thus the mystery of coincidence detection at higher frequencies remains to be solved.", "year": 1998, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4615-5351-9_22", "venue": "Central Auditory Processing and Neural Modeling", "journal": "Central Auditory Processing and Neural Modeling", "mag_id": "390809321", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56951668"}

It can be useful for various tasks, such as code reuse, code theft detection, and malware detection. Code similarity metrics, on the basis of features extracted from syntax and semantics, have been used to classify programs. Such features, however, often need manual selection effort and are specific to individual programming languages, limiting the classifiers to programs in the same language.To recognize the similarities and differences among algorithms implemented in different languages, this paper describes a framework of Bilateral Neural Networks (Bi-NN) that builds a neural network on top of two underlying sub-networks, each of which encodes syntax and semantics of code in one language. A whole Bi-NN can be trained with bilateral programs that implement the same algorithms and/or data structures in different languages and then be applied to recognize algorithm classes across languages.We have instantiated the framework with several kinds of token-, tree- and graph-based neural networks that encode and learn various kinds of information in code. We have applied the instances of the framework to a code corpus collected from GitHub containing thousands of Java and C++ programs implementing 50 different algorithms and data structures. Our evaluation results show that the use of Bi-NN indeed produces promising algorithm classification results both within one language and across languages, and the encoding of dependencies from code into the underlying neural networks helps improve algorithm classification accuracy further. In particular, our custom-built dependency trees with tree-based convolutional neural networks achieve the highest classification accuracy among the different instances of the framework that we have evaluated.

Real-time vehicle classification system using computer vision is relatively cheaper and easy to install. As traffic is heterogeneous in India, road planning and traffic management is challenging. So an automated vehicle detection and classification system is useful for traffic survey, planning, signal time optimization and surveillance. In this work, traffic video data is collected using a camera placed on the top of a vehicle parking on the side of a road at an angle of approximately 45\u00b0. Both audio and video are used for vehicle detection. The presence of a vehicle is detected from frames corresponding to the peaks in the short time energy of audio. The process of adaptive background subtraction is performed on the selected frames to separate the vehicle from the background. After background subtraction, morphological processes such as erosion, dilation and closing are applied to get the region of interest. There may be mulitiple frames with the same vehicle are detected at this stage. To reduce the multiple occurrences of the same vehicle in selected frames, Speeded-Up Robust Feature (SURF) matching algorithm is used. Different features like Histogram Oriented Gradient (HOG), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), KAZE, Binary Robust Invariant Scale Keypoint (BRISK) features of selected frames are extracted and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are developed. Vehicle classification accuracy of various features are compared using a 20 minutes traffic video.

How can we discover new attribute values that we have never seen before? Can we do this with limited human annotation or supervision? We study this problem in the context of product catalogs that often have missing values for many attributes of interest. In this work, we leverage product profile information such as titles and descriptions to discover missing values of product attributes. We develop a novel deep tagging model OpenTag for this extraction problem with the following contributions: (1) we formalize the problem as a sequence tagging task, and propose a joint model exploiting recurrent neural networks (specifically, bidirectional LSTM) to capture context and semantics, and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to enforce tagging consistency; (2) we develop a novel attention mechanism to provide interpretable explanation for our model's decisions; (3) we propose a novel sampling strategy exploring active learning to reduce the burden of human annotation. OpenTag does not use any dictionary or hand-crafted features as in prior works.

WML have been consistently related to vascular risk factors and they could have predictive value for future stroke, dementia and functional decline in activities of daily living.Although, there is an important body of evidence regarding the importance of WML, the segmentation of these changes on different MRI modalities is not yet, validated and standardized.The aim of this thesis was to segment the WML using multispectral MRIs based on a fully automated method.A new method using a cascade of support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with active learning is proposed for the segmentation of the WML. It has been shown that this training method not only increase the speed of classification, but also helps to boost the accuracy of classification in biased datasets.The classification method is put together with preprocessing and post-processing to form a general segmentation framework. To validate the method, a model was trained using two subjects and tested against the remaining 100 subjects.

Early detection allows institutions to intervene, addressing problems and retaining students. Prior research into the early detection of at-risk students has opted for the use of predictive models, but a comprehensive assessment of the suitability of different algorithms and approaches is complicated by the large number of variable features that constitute a student's educational experience. Predictive models vary in terms of their amplitude, temporality and the learning algorithms employed. While amplitude refers to the ability of the model to operate on multiple degrees, temporality is often considered due to the natural temporal aspect of the data. In the absence of a comparative framework of learning algorithms, the aim of this paper has been to provide such an analysis, based on a proposed classification of strategies for predicting dropouts in Higher Education Institutions. Three different student representations are implemented (namely Global Feature-Based, Local Feature-Based, and Time Series) in conjunction with the appropriate learning algorithms for each of them. A description of each approach, as well as its implementation process, are presented in this paper as technical contributions. An experiment based on a dataset of student information from two degrees, namely Business Administration and Architecture, acquired through an automated management system from a university in Brazil is used. Our findings can be summarized as: (i) of the three proposed student representations, the Local Feature-Based was the most suitable approach for predicting dropout. In addition to providing high quality results, the Local Feature-Based representations are simple to build, and the construction of the model is less expensive when compared to more complex ones; (ii) as a conclusion of the results obtained via Local Feature-Based, dropout can be said to be accurately predicted using grades of a few core courses, so there is no need for a complex features extraction process; (iii) considering temporal aspects of the data does not seem to contribute to the prediction performance although it increases computational costs as the model complexity increases.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3303772.3303800", "venue": "LAK19", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2917759141", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["866844", "3328658", "1554582", "1067171", "2102424", "2615628", "145413939", "9959163", "52004087", "4858287", "6421841", "55828828", "16728287", "53921755", "14625459", "15641166", "29961172", "3410880", "26406576", "2250390", "26125592", "196036525", "14618601"], "inbound_citations": ["208116950", "195891561", "210116700"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67868777"}

These two problems become even more challenging for a distributed DSA network where there is no centralized controllers for SUs. In this paper, we investigate communication strategies of a distributive DSA network under the presence of spectrum sensing errors. To be specific, we apply the powerful machine learning tool, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), for SUs to learn \u201cappropriate\u201d spectrum access strategies in a distributed fashion assuming NO knowledge of the underlying system statistics. Furthermore, a special type of recurrent neural network, called the reservoir computing (RC), is utilized to realize DRL by taking advantage of the underlying temporal correlation of the DSA network. Using the introduced machine learning-based strategy, SUs could make spectrum access decisions distributedly relying only on their own current and past spectrum sensing outcomes. Through extensive experiments, our results suggest that the RC-based spectrum access strategy can help the SU to significantly reduce the chances of collision with PUs and other SUs. We also show that our scheme outperforms the myopic method which assumes the knowledge of system statistics, and converges faster than the Q -learning method when the number of channels is large.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1810.11758", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JIOT.2018.2872441", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952328383,2894110571", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["39127766", "9526424", "15230411", "59689783", "5833278", "7008834", "13574151", "28377138", "15619643", "3443271", "6249258", "14650762", "6263878", "51616075", "205242740", "208910339", "15238391", "17048224", "206457500", "3629526", "34472727", "19820055", "7622872", "61862930", "3029429", "6427813", "25038246", "7636891"], "inbound_citations": ["204401823", "208910145", "201873918", "67016045", "211733475", "211204789", "189898176", "202729458", "53113396", "209080142", "210697969", "212648208", "204825291", "214641018", "208208587", "211688816", "209495792", "197544966", "211728791"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53103851"}

In their tweets, users often reveal their location information and short-term visiting histories or plans. Capturing user's short-term activities could benefit many applications for providing the right context at the right time and location. In this paper we are interested in extracting locations mentioned in tweets at fine-grained granularity, with temporal awareness. Specifically, we recognize the points-of-interest (POIs) mentioned in a tweet and predict whether the user has visited, is currently at, or will soon visit the mentioned POIs. A POI can be a restaurant, a shopping mall, a bookstore, or any other fine-grained location. Our proposed framework, named TS-Petar (Two-Stage POI Extractor with Temporal Awareness), consists of two main components: a POI inventory and a two-stage time-aware POI tagger. The POI inventory is built by exploiting the crowd wisdom of the Foursquare community. It contains both POIs' formal names and their informal abbreviations, commonly observed in Foursquare check-ins. The time-aware POI tagger, based on the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, is devised to disambiguate the POI mentions and to resolve their associated temporal awareness accordingly. Three sets of contextual features (linguistic, temporal, and inventory features) and two labeling schema features (OP and BILOU schemas) are explored for the time-aware POI extraction task. Our empirical study shows that the subtask of POI disambiguation and the subtask of temporal awareness resolution call for different feature settings for best performance.

For mental health therapies and treatments, detecting rapidly changing emotions of individuals can be useful to know whether the patients are showing appropriate emotional response or not.

We combine these affective features with the deep features and classify them using a Random Forest Classifier.

Transfer learning (TL) has drawn increasing attention in the field of EEG signal mining in recent years. The TL leverages existing data collected from other people to build a model for a new individual with little calibration data. However, brute-force transfer to an individual (i.e., blindly leveraged the labeled data from others) may lead to a negative transfer that degrades performance rather than improves it. This study thus proposed a conditional transfer learning (cTL) framework to facilitate a positive transfer (improving subject-specific performance without increasing the labeled data) for each individual. The cTL first assesses an individual\u2019s transferability for positive transfer and then selectively leverage the data from others with comparable feature spaces. The empirical results showed that among 26 individuals, the proposed cTL framework identified 16 and 14 transferable individuals who could benefit from the data from others for emotion valence and arousal classification, respectively. These transferable individuals could then leverage the data from 18 and 12 individuals who had similar EEG signatures to attain maximal TL improvements in valence- and arousal-classification accuracy. The cTL improved the overall classification performance of 26 individuals by ~15% for valence categorization and ~12% for arousal counterpart, as compared to their default performance based solely on the subject-specific data. This study evidently demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed cTL framework for improving an individual\u2019s default emotion-classification performance given a data repository. The cTL framework may shed light on the development of a robust emotion-classification model using fewer labeled subject-specific data toward a real-life affective brain-computer interface (ABCI).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5486154", "pubmed_id": "28701938", "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2017.00334", "venue": "Front.

Specifically, the protein amino acids sequence is transformed into Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) containing biological evolution information, and then the feature vector is extracted to present protein evolutionary information using DCT algorithm; finally, the ensemble rotation forest model is used to predict whether a given protein pair is interacting or not.

In this work, we propose a solution to this problem by using a multi-task objective based on the idea of distillation and a mechanism that directly penalizes forgetting at the shared representation layer during the knowledge integration phase of training. We demonstrate our approach on a Twitter domain sentiment analysis task with sequential knowledge transfer from four related tasks. We show that our technique outperforms networks fine-tuned to the target task. Additionally, we show both through empirical evidence and examples that it does not forget useful knowledge from the source task that is forgotten during standard fine-tuning.

The emergence of the Internet of Things has aggregated this growth. Lack of security in an IoT world makes these devices hot targets for cyber criminals to perform their malicious actions. One of these actions is the Botnet attack, which is one of the main destructive threats that has been evolving since 2003 into different forms. This attack is a serious threat to the security and privacy of information. Its scalability, structure, strength, and strategy are also under successive development, and that it has survived for decades. A bot is defined as a software application that executes a number of automated tasks (simple but structurally repetitive) over the Internet. Several bots make a botnet that infects a number of devices and communicates with their controller called the botmaster to get their instructions. A botnet executes tasks with a rate that would be impossible to be done by a human being. Nowadays, the activities of bots are concealed in between the normal web flows and occupy more than half of all web traffic. The largest use of bots is in web spidering (web crawler), in which an automated script fetches, analyzes, and files information from web servers. They also contribute to other attacks, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS), SPAM, identity theft, phishing, and espionage. A number of botnet detection techniques have been proposed, such as honeynet-based and Intrusion Detection System (IDS)-based. These techniques are not effective anymore due to the constant update of the bots and their evasion mechanisms. Recently, botnet detection techniques based upon machine/deep learning have been proposed that are more capable in comparison to their previously mentioned counterparts. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based engine for botnet detection to be utilized in the IoT and the wearable devices. In this system, the normal and botnet network traffic data are transformed into image before being given into a deep convolutional neural network, named DenseNet with and without considering transfer learning. The system is implemented using Python programming language and the CTU-13 Dataset is used for evaluation in one study. According to our simulation results, using transfer learning can improve the accuracy from 33.41% up to 99.98%. In addition, two other classifiers of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and logistic regression have been used. They showed an accuracy of 83.15% and 78.56%, respectively. In another study, we evaluate our system by an in-house live normal dataset and a solely botnet dataset. Similarly, the system performed very well in data classification in these studies. To examine the capability of our system for real-time applications, we measure the system training and testing times. According to our examination, it takes 0.004868 milliseconds to process each packet from the network traffic data during testing.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/bdcc2040037", "venue": "Big Data and Cognitive Computing", "journal": "Big Data and Cognitive Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2902830044", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2042515", "14888459", "42554764", "794312", "13302792", "12952387", "28123189", "1502263", "31616725", "16406348", "11692541", "14131220", "52984569", "6370088", "7577068", "3917973", "3340317", "8517394", "6825689", "38806634", "3725747", "15623481", "52159708", "3500655", "46920761", "33539704", "10747554", "11328286", "15599732", "16815075"], "inbound_citations": ["214743087"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69929802"}

Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the joint learning of tasks in multi-auxiliary domains and the target domain, and propose a novel Multi-Domain Transfer Learning (MDTL) framework for early diagnosis of AD. Specifically, the proposed MDTL framework consists of two key components: 1) a multi-domain transfer feature selection (MDTFS) model that selects the most informative feature subset from multi-domain data, and 2) a multi-domain transfer classification (MDTC) model that can identify disease status for early AD detection. We evaluate our method on 807 subjects from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database using baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.

In this paper, we propose content-enhanced network embedding (CENE), which is capable of jointly leveraging the network structure and the content information. Our approach integrates text modeling and structure modeling in a general framework by treating the content information as a special kind of node. Experiments on several real world net- works with application to node classification show that our models outperform all existing network embedding methods, demonstrating the merits of content information and joint learning.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1610.02906", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2530041791", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17572432", "5590763", "207238980", "1915014", "15173994", "2407601", "61440772", "16447573", "26901423", "4957091", "10659969", "3051291", "18375389", "2317858", "3348552", "8399404", "35493", "31698643", "207238964", "17519375", "2452205", "207209998"], "inbound_citations": ["209481469", "57362081", "208016230", "202729474", "85518880", "51940456", "52116003", "3951790", "215723340", "196199434", "52973346", "44071773", "52974608", "189898173", "215480977", "91182289", "6157828", "77393679", "202782240", "56170591", "126299639", "4630420", "85510285", "201671261", "53669669", "54449143", "208280545", "49266467", "50768012", "56598901", "201879789", "211507033", "86697693", "52930287", "59528420"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14679478"}

However, the Web of Data is also characterized by various forms of uncertainty, owing to its inherent incompleteness (missing information, uneven data distributions) and noise, which may affect open and distributed architectures. In this paper, we focus on the inductive instance retrieval task regarded as a classification problem. The proposed solution is a framework for learning Terminological Decision Trees from examples described in an ontological knowledge base, to be used for performing instance classifications. For the purpose, suitable pruning strategies and a new prediction procedure are proposed. Furthermore, in order to tackle the class-imbalance distribution problem, the framework is extended to ensembles of Terminological Decision Trees called Terminological Random Forests. The proposed framework has been evaluated, in comparative experiments, with the main state of the art solutions grounded on a similar approach, showing that: (1) the employment of the formalized pruning strategies can improve the model predictiveness; (2) Terminological Random Forests outperform the usage of a single Terminological Decision Tree, particularly when the knowledge base is endowed with a large number of concepts and roles; (3) the framework can be exploited for solving related problems, such as predicting the values of given properties with finite ranges.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.websem.2017.05.001", "venue": "J.

The backfat thickness is estimated from the profile of distances between two curves that limit the steak and the rib eye, previously detected. A model base in Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained to estimate the intramuscular fat percentage. A series of features extracted on a region of interest, previously detected in both ultrasound and color images, were proposed. In all cases, a complete evaluation was performed with different databases including: color and ultrasound images acquired by a beef industry expert, intramuscular fat estimation obtained by an expert using a commercial software, and chemical analysis.ConclusionsThe proposed algorithms show good results to calculate the rib eye area and the backfat thickness measure and profile.

Data Mining and Machine Learning (DM-ML) approaches are widely used for network anomaly detection during the past few years. Machine learning based intrusive activity detector is getting popular. However, they produce a high volume of false alarms. One of the main reasons for generating false signals is redundancy in the datasets. To resolve this problem, an efficient feature selection is necessary to improve the intrusion detection system performance. For this purpose, here we use Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The three abovementioned algorithms are used to select the most relevant feature set for identifying network attacks, KNN and SVM algorithms are used as classifiers to evaluate the performance of these feature selection algorithms. The standard NSL-KDD dataset is used for training and testing in this study. We used different metrics to determine which of these algorithms provide a better overall performance when they are used for feature selection in intrusion detection. Our experiments show that PSO, ACO and ABC algorithms perform better than other approaches in feature selection. Feature selection based on ABC provides 98.9% of accuracy rate and 0.78% false alarm with KNN algorithm as the classifier, which is the best result among the examined algorithms.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Advance Research, Ideas and Innovations in Technology", "mag_id": "2788698698", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204069112"}

With this solution concept we aim at compensating for the deficiencies of LSTM-based video captioning methods that generally show potential to effectively handle temporal nature of video data when generating captions, but that also typically suffer from exponential error accumulation. Specifically, we adopt a standard Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, characterized by an interplay of two competing processes: a \"generator\", which generates textual sentences given the visual content of a video, and a \"discriminator\" which controls the accuracy of the generated sentences. The discriminator acts as an \"adversary\" towards the generator and with its controlling mechanism helps the generator to become more accurate. For the generator module, we take an existing video captioning concept using LSTM network. For the discriminator, we propose a novel realization specifically tuned for the video captioning problem and taking both the sentences and video features as input. This leads to our proposed LSTM-GAN system architecture, for which we show experimentally to significantly outperform the existing methods on standard public datasets.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30010568", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2018.2855422", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2887712318", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["623318", "59605920", "4228546", "7512406", "4520179", "1055111", "1169492", "15244044", "215717103", "14432549", "215513848", "16584394", "1116289", "7189592", "521368", "2744581", "7263355", "42725306", "1033682", "3439214", "15807234", "17206794", "5706227", "29797603", "351666", "8740928", "11418612", "51615798", "11045175", "25497516", "23414983", "206594905", "8042718", "2642134", "98180", "20610732", "665667", "144707025", "1915014", "18470994", "6138149", "14289383", "14924561", "748227", "7961699", "14124313", "19115634", "14307651", "1957433", "2827512", "16756501", "14257320", "1687220", "3120635", "206594535", "8447479", "15184723", "11080756", "964287", "5923323", "9254582", "59606130", "2210455", "10267078"], "inbound_citations": ["204801166", "211836304", "203836952", "57189218", "57024396", "199064257", "149469311", "52048315", "198318847", "53282179", "51628379", "53959293", "211838979", "204088550", "184487465", "52273949", "133604687", "204837282", "201622498", "51905732", "184487531", "51986387", "209957178", "61806147", "210695521", "215411721", "86488524", "169032532", "52918138", "53040504", "148574271", "203606111", "204425236"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51629981"}

One of the main challenges is the uncertainty in their output power due to fluctuating meteorological conditions like sunshine intensity, cloud cover and humidity. In desert areas, another parameter that has a significant impact on solar irradiance is dust, which has been neglected in many studies. In this work, an hour-ahead solar irradiance forecasting model is proposed, this model utilizes both Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and the Angstrom Exponent data observed from a ground station at the previous hour. The proposed model was tested under different widely used data driven forecasting models, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and decision tree regression. Applying the MLP model using data from Saudi Arabia shows a root mean square average error of under 4% and forecast skill of over 42% for one-hour ahead forecast. The proposed forecasting model demonstrates a superior accuracy compared to other models when tested and verified under different feature selection schemes. The MLP model is especially applicable for desert areas under clear sky conditions, where dust storms are frequent and AOD in the air is high (>0.4).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.solener.2018.05.089", "venue": null, "journal": "Solar Energy", "mag_id": "2808902576", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204700617", "145910134", "172137874", "211209444", "119309518", "86772363"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125508650"}

Here we introduce an approach where the metric is tuned for a particular neural decoding task. Neural spike train metrics have been used to quantify the information content carried by the timing of action potentials. While a number of metrics for individual neurons exist, a method to optimally combine single-neuron metrics into multineuron, or population-based, metrics is lacking. We pose the problem of optimizing multineuron metrics and other metrics using centered alignment, a kernel-based dependence measure. The approach is demonstrated on invasively recorded neural data consisting of both spike trains and local field potentials. The experimental paradigm consists of decoding the location of tactile stimulation on the forepaws of anesthetized rats.

Information on the proportion of broadleaf and conifer trees improves timber volume models obtained from 3D photogrammetric point clouds. However, the broadleaf-conifer information cannot be obtained from photogrammetric point clouds alone. Furthermore, spectral information of aerial images is too inconsistent to be used for automatic broadleaf-conifer classification over larger areas. In this study we combined multi-temporal Sentinel 2 optical satellite images, 3D photogrammetric point clouds from digital aerial stereo photographs, and forest inventory plots representing an area of 35,751 km2 in south-west Germany for (1) modelling the percentage of broadleaf tree volume (BL%) using Sentinel 2 time series and (2) modelling timber volume per hectare using 3D photogrammetric point clouds. Forest inventory plots were surveyed in the same years and regions as stereo photographs were acquired (2013\u20132017), resulting in 11,554 plots. Sentinel 2 images from 2016 and 2017 were corrected for topographic and atmospheric influences and combined with the same forest inventory plots. Spectral variables from corrected multi-temporal Sentinel 2 images were calculated, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) regressions were fitted for each Sentinel 2 scene estimating the BL% for corresponding inventory plots. Variables from the photogrammetric point clouds were calculated for each inventory plot and a non-linear regression model predicting timber volume per hectare was fitted. Each SVM regression and the timber volume model were evaluated using ten-fold cross-validation (CV). The SVM regression models estimating the BL% per Sentinel 2 scene achieved overall accuracies of 68%\u201375% and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 21.5\u201326.1. The timber volume model showed a RMSE% of 31.7%, a mean bias of 0.2%, and a pseudo-R2 of 0.64. Application of the SVM regressions on Sentinel 2 scenes covering the state of Baden-Wurttemberg resulted in predictions of broadleaf tree percentages for the entire state. These predicted values were used as additional predictor in the timber volume model, allowing for predictions of timber volume for the same area. Spatially high-resolution information about growing stock is of great practical relevance for forest management planning, especially when the timber volume of a smaller unit is of interest, for example of a forest stand or a forest district where not enough terrestrial inventory plots are available to make reliable estimations.

On the other hand, centroid-based classification algorithms are very fast, because only as many distance/similarity computations as the number of centroids (i.e. classes) needs to be done. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of centroid-based classification algorithm and compare it to nearest mean and nearest neighbor algorithms on 9 data sets.

Proposed algorithm starts from the centroids of each class and increases the weight of misclassified training data points on the centroid computation until the validation error starts increasing. The weight increase is done based on the training confusion matrix entries for misclassified points. Vie proposed algorithm results in smaller test error than centroid-based classification algorithm in 7 out of 9 data sets. It is also better than 10-nearest neighbor algorithm in 8 out of 9 data sets. We also evaluate different similarity metrics together with centroid and nearest neighbor algorithms.

In both experiments, multiple classifiers are trained on the same training set. This training set consists of Dutch posts retrieved from two public Belgian social media pages which are likely to attract racist reactions. The posts were labeled as racist or non-racist by multiple annotators, who reached an acceptable agreement score. The different classification models all use the Support Vector Machine algorithm, but use different (sets of) linguistic features, which can be lexical, stylistic or dictionary-based. In the first experiment, the models are evaluated on a test set containing unseen comments retrieved from the same pages as the training set (and thus also skewed towards racism). In the second experiment, the same models from Experiment 1 are tested on an alternative test set, containing more neutral comments, retrieved from the social media page of a Belgian newspaper. In both experiments, the best performing model relies on a dictionary containing different word categories specifically related to racist discourse. It reaches an F-score of 0.47 (exp. 1) and 0.40 (exp. 2) for the racist class and ROC Area Under Curve scores of 0.64 (exp. 1) and 0.73 (exp. 2).

We propose to fill the blank positions in the collection of training kernel matrices via a variant of the Neutral Point Substitution (NPS) method, where the term \"neutral point\" stands for the locus of points defined by the \"neutral hyperplane\" in the hypothetical linear space produced by the respective kernel. The current method crucially differs from the previously developed neutral point approach in that it is capable of treating missing data in the training set on the same basis as missing data in the test set. It is therefore of potentially much wider applicability.

For this reason, against this cyber crime, last two decades have witnessed a variety of combatting methodologies like HTML content based similarity analysis, URL based classification and recently visual similarity based matching since phishing web pages visually mimic to their legitimate counterparts in order to create an illusion to deceive innocent users. To this end, in this study, we propose a computer vision and machine learning based approach in order to classify whether a suspicious web page is phishing and further recognize its original brand name. In this regard, we have utilized and investigated two different local image descriptors namely Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and DAISY. Apart from their common properties such as scale invariance, the aforementioned descriptors have apparent differences such that in addition to rotational invariance, SIFT employs key-point based sampling whereas DAISY applies dense sampling by default. Therefore, we first aimed to investigate the feasibility of these two local image descriptors in addition to revealing the effects of sampling strategy and rotational invariance in problem domain. Furthermore, in order to create a discriminative representation of a web page, we followed the bag of visual words (BOVW) approach having different vocabulary sizes such as 50, 100, 200 and 400. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we have utilized a publicly available phishing dataset including snapshots of webpages sampled from both 14 different highly phished brands and ordinary legitimate web pages yielding a challenging open-set problem. The aforementioned dataset involves 1313 training and 1539 testing image samples in total. The visual features extracted via SIFT and DAISY were first transformed to a BOVW histogram and fed to three different machine learning methods such as SVM, Random Forest and XGBoost. According to the conducted experiments, based on a 400-D visual vocabulary, SIFT descriptor along with XGBoost has been found as the best descriptor-learner configuration having reached up to 89.34% validation accuracy with 0.76% false positive rate. Moreover, SIFT has outperformed DAISY descriptor in all settings. As a result, it has been shown that SIFT descriptors equipped with BOVW representation can be effectively used for brand identification of phishing web pages.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.31590/ejosat.638404", "venue": "European Journal of Science and Technology", "journal": "European Journal of Science and Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2981434909", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["38535261", "29200880", "54461688", "21557417", "16800743", "363051", "18026547", "117339939", "14751578", "14523997", "26531170", "67787950", "130535382", "3832964", "49569601", "206787478", "4650265"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208093496"}

In this study, this inverse ECG problem is treated as a regression problem with multi-inputs (BSPs) and multioutputs (TMPs), which will be solved by the Maximum Margin Clustering- (MMC-) Support Vector Regression (SVR) method. First, the MMC approach is adopted to cluster the training samples (a series of time instant BSPs), and the individual SVR model for each cluster is then constructed. For each testing sample, we find its matched cluster and then use the corresponding SVR model to reconstruct the TMPs. Using testing samples, it is found that the reconstructed TMPs results with the MMC-SVR method are more accurate than those of the single SVR method. In addition to the improved accuracy in solving the inverse ECG problem, the MMC-SVR method divides the training samples into clusters of small sample sizes, which can enhance the computation efficiency of training the SVR model.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3502838", "pubmed_id": "23197992", "doi": "10.1155/2012/436281", "venue": "Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine", "journal": "Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2080514086", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["22765684", "6799998", "1972486", "5756096", "23541600", "28753040", "38483108", "1733135", "22474078", "23911136", "24938110", "34065094", "9149220", "206013196", "15480929", "21916888", "207637879", "44718072", "1311917", "1123993", "2198368", "27921216", "27921216", "13487995", "28637672", "961425"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6723265"}

The classification is based on the differentiation between olives that have been picked up from the ground or from the tree. Two full setups have been installed and tested in real production conditions in the reception of the mill: before and after the olive washing process. The suggested approach uses a feature vector that concatenates the olive image histograms from different colour spaces and the texture values of three algorithms (image entropy, grey level co-occurrence matrix and statistics like Contrast, Correlation, Energy and Homogeneity). As classifiers, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used.

Quantification of these pathological markers on histological sections is widely performed to study the disease and to evaluate new therapies. However, segmentation of neuropathology images presents difficulties inherent to histology (presence of debris, tissue folding, non-specific staining) as well as specific challenges (sparse staining, irregular shape of the lesions). Here, we present a supervised classification approach for the robust pixel-level classification of large neuropathology whole slide images. We propose a weighted form of Random Forest in order to fit nonlinear decision boundaries that take into account class imbalance. Both color and texture descriptors were used as predictors and model selection was performed via a leave-one-image-out cross-validation scheme. Our method showed superior results compared to the current state of the art method when applied to the segmentation of A\u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in a human brain sample. Furthermore, using parallel computing, our approach easily scales-up to large gigabyte-sized images.

While research efforts along this line have shown promising results, a remaining challenge is to deal with the high sparsity of image data. Indeed, the centroids may contain many zero-value features that create a dilemma in assigning objects to centroids during the iterative process of Info-Kmeans. To meet this challenge, we propose a Summation-bAsed Incremental Learning (SAIL) algorithm for Info-Kmeans clustering in this paper. Specifically, SAIL can avoid the zero-feature dilemma by replacing the computation of KL-divergence between instances and centroids, by the computation of centroid entropies only. To further improve the clustering quality, we also introduce the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) meta-heuristic and propose the V-SAIL algorithm. Experimental results on various benchmark data sets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of SAIL and V-SAIL.

Although gesture recognition technologies have been successfully applied to real-world applications, there are still several problems that need to be addressed for wider application of HCI systems: Firstly, gesture-recognition systems require a robust tracking of relevant body parts, which is challenging, since the human body is capable of an enormous range of poses. Therefore, a pose estimation approach that identifies body parts based on geodetic distances is proposed. Further, the generation of synthetic data, which is essential for training and evaluation purposes, is presented. A second problem is that gestures are spatio-temporal patterns that can vary in shape, trajectory or duration, even for the same person. Static patterns are recognized using geometrical and statistical features which are invariant to translation, rotation and scaling. Moreover, stochastical models like Hidden Markov Models and Conditional Random Fields applied to quantized trajectories are employed to classify dynamic patterns.

Tagging questions with their purpose can add a new dimension to the identification of discussed topics in posts on SO. In this paper, we aim at automating the classification of SO question posts into seven question categories. As a first step, we harmonized existing taxonomies of question categories and then, we manually classified 1,000 SO questions according to our new taxonomy. Additionally to the question category, we marked the phrases that indicate a question category for each of the posts. We then use this data set to automate the classification of posts using two approaches. For the first approach, we manually analyzed the phrases to find patterns. Based on regular expressions, we implemented a classifier, for each of the categories, that determines whether a post belongs to a category. These regular expressions are derived by analyzing patterns in the phrases. In the second approach, we use the curated data set to train classification models of supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Support Vector Machines). For the machine learning algorithms, we experimented with 1,312 different configurations regarding the preprocessing of the text and the representation of the input data. Then, we compared the performance of the regex approach with the performance of the best configuration that uses machine learning algorithms on a validation set of 110 posts. The results show that using the regular expression approach, we can classify posts into the correct question category with an average precision and recall of 0.90, and an MCC of 0.68. Additionally, we applied the regex approach on all questions of SO that deal with Android app development and investigated the co-occurrence of question categories in posts. We found that the categories API usage, Conceptual, and Discrepancy are the most frequently assigned question categories and that they also occur together frequently.

In this paper, we address the image-to-video person re-id, in which the probe is an image and the gallery is consists of videos captured by nonoverlapping cameras. Compared with image, video sequence contains more temporal information that can be explored to improve the performance of re-identification system. However, it is challenging to model temporal information in the matching process of image-to-video person re-id. In this paper, we proposed a novel temporally memorized similarity learning neural network for this problem. In specific, the proposed network mainly consisted of two parts, including feature representation sub-network and similarity sub-network. In the first part, we adopted a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the input image. Given a video sequence of a person, features were first extracted from each its frame by using CNN and further forward to a long shot term memory (LSTM) network to encode the temporal information of video sequence. The outputs of LSTM were concatenated together as the feature vector of video sequences. Finally, the feature vectors of probe image and the video sequence were further forward to the similarity sub-network for distance metric learning. In the proposed framework, the feature representation and the similarity metric learning can be learned and optimized simultaneously. We evaluated the proposed framework on three public person re-id data sets, and the experimental results showed that the proposed approach is effective for the image-to-video person re-id.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2723429", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2730844222", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14252751", "15304039", "6471474", "47325215", "195671660", "9085386", "14909631", "3961724", "425268", "13536642", "16224222", "9022685", "10140593", "1447136", "564273", "8558863", "14124239", "14991802", "59605992", "3332134", "13417115", "10070153", "13262103", "207763512", "10328909", "996788", "195673213", "15158546", "8666084", "2304733", "11493780", "1449366", "206593071", "17569238", "3198903", "14997888", "938105", "207323040", "206592766", "4648384", "5231143", "15172651", "2057858", "29184859", "2214158", "90264", "9006435", "10400917", "2463643", "206741496", "1217966", "3385678", "15005943", "7973738", "5607238", "765267", "11864530", "3043202"], "inbound_citations": ["209336262", "202613384", "24277137", "119117052", "3798760", "11669787", "174821037", "145957153", "195693996", "199543474", "54439906", "81988275", "199010996", "32990886"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53082028"}

Applicable to several fields, it has the potential to strongly influence people\u2019s lives. \u201cThings\u201d are mostly embedded machines, and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications are used to exchange information. The main aspect of this type of communication is that a \u201cthing\u201d needs a mechanism to uniquely identify other \u201cthings\u201d without human intervention. For this purpose, trust plays a key role. Trust can be incorporated in the smartness of \u201cthings\u201d by using mobile \u201cagents\u201d. From the study of the IoT ecosystem, a new threat against M2M communications has been identified. This relates to the opportunity for an attacker to employ several forged IoT-embedded machines that can be used to launch attacks. Two \u201cthings-aware\u201d detection mechanisms have been proposed and evaluated in this work for incorporation into IoT mobile trust agents. These new mechanisms are based on observing specific thing-related behaviour obtained by using a characterisation algorithm. The first mechanism uses a range of behaviours obtained from real embedded machines, such as threshold values, to detect whether a target machine is forged. This detection mechanism is called machine emulation detection algorithm (MEDA). MEDA takes around 3 minutes to achieve a detection accuracy of 79.21%, with 44.55% of real embedded machines labelled as belonging to forged embedded machines. These results indicated a need to develop a more accurate and faster detection method. Therefore, a second mechanism was created and evaluated. A dataset composed of behaviours from real, virtual and emulated embedded systems that can be part of the IoT was created. This was used for both training and testing classification methods. The results identified Random Forest (RF) as the most efficient method, recognising forged embedded machines in only 5 seconds with a detection rate of around 99.5%. It follows that this solution can be applied in real IoT scenarios with critical conditions. In the final part of this thesis, an attack against these new mechanisms has been proposed. This consists of using a modified kernel of a powerful machine to mimic the behaviour of a real IoT-embedded machine, referred to as a fake timing attack (FTA). Two metrics, mode and median from ping response time, have been found to effectively detect this attack. The final detection method involves combining RF and k-Nearest Neighbour to successfully detect forged embedded machines and FTA in only 40 seconds, with an overall detection performance (ODP) of 99.9% and 93.70% respectively. This method also was evaluated using behaviours from embedded machines that were not present in the training set. The results from that evaluation demonstrate that the proposed solution can detect embedded machines unknown to the method, both real and virtual, with an ODP of 99.96% and 99.92% respectively. In summary, a new algorithm able to detect forged embedded machines easily, quickly and with very high accuracy has been developed. The proposed method addresses the challenge of securing present and future M2M-embedded machines with power-constrained resources and can be applied to real IoT scenarios.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2920215517", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86750827"}

Alternative mathematical models have been developed so that the users\u2019 tasks can be facilitated and an actual assistance can be provided for decision-making processes in case of every encountered incident which requires critical decision-making. Within this framework, financial systems can be regarded as complex systems with their volatile and vulnerable nature along with various parameters and interactions involved. Forecasting shifts in stock indices is crucial to validate the potential strategies of monetary mechanisms. Therefore, forecasting is an essential step in financial decision-making to manage data selection and attain robust prediction. Our purpose is to optimize the stock indices\u2019 forecasting model in the stock indices dataset, constructed from the daily values. The following steps were applied to demonstrate the critical significance of Hurst exponent (HE) computed by Rescaled Range (R/S) fractal analysis when used as indicator in conjunction with Shannon entropy (SE) and Renyi entropy (RE) for the future forecasting ability of the stock indices. With this aim, the following stages were performed with indicators obtained from the applications and added into the dataset in the respective order. The first stage consists of: i) HE indicator, ii) Entropy based SE and RE indicators, iii) HE, SE and RE indicators. As the second stage, stock indices day-to-day valuation was evaluated using Multi Layer Regression (MLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Feed Forward Back Propagation (FFBP) algorithms, applied for each indicator for comparative analysis. When compared with earlier works, no relevant work exists in the literature in which the algorithms and above-mentioned indicators have been used in conjunction with one another. This paper, through the multistage methodology and proposed model, demonstrates that HE is obviously a significant and critical determining indicator compared to RE and SE indicators for forecasting purposes.

Therefore, the development of portable ultrasound devices has become a popular research topic. However, the limited size of portable ultrasound devices usually degrades the imaging quality, which reduces the diagnostic reliability. To overcome hardware limitations and improve the image quality of portable ultrasound devices, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) model to achieve mapping between low-quality ultrasound images and corresponding high-quality images. In contrast to the traditional GAN method, our two-stage GAN that cascades a U-Net network prior to the generator as a front end is built to reconstruct the tissue structure, details, and speckle of the reconstructed image. In the training process, an ultrasound plane-wave imaging (PWI) data-based transfer learning method is introduced to facilitate convergence and to eliminate the influence of deformation caused by respiratory activities during data pair acquisition. A gradual tuning strategy is adopted to obtain better results by the PWI transfer learning process. In addition, a comprehensive loss function is presented to combine texture, structure, and perceptual features. Experiments are conducted using simulated, phantom, and clinical data. Our proposed method is compared to four other algorithms, including traditional gray-level-based methods and learning-based methods.

Today, MR images are used to determine the type of brain tumor. Manual diagnosis of brain tumor type depends on the experience and sensitivity of radiologists.

In this study, two different feature extraction (nLBP and \u03b1LBP) approaches were used to classify the most common brain tumor types; Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary brain tumors. nLBP is formed based on the relationship for each pixel around the neighbors. The nLBP method has a d parameter that specifies the distance between consecutive neighbors for comparison. Different patterns are obtained for different d parameter values.

Statistical predictive analytic techniques can be used to analyze or to determine risk levels involved in loans. This study contributes to the credit risk evaluation literature in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. We make a comparative analysis of two different statistical methods of classification (artificial neural network and Support Vector Machine).

However, such formulations seem poorly suited to the highly non-Euclidean deep feature space. Our first contribution is in specifying the N-pair loss in terms of manifold similarities between deep features. We introduce a new time- and memory-efficient method for estimating the manifold similarities by using a closed-form convergence solution of the Random Walk algorithm. Our efficiency comes, in part, from following the recent work that randomly partitions the deep feature space, and expresses image distances via representatives of the resulting subspaces, a.k.a. proxies.

Hyperspectral Images are worthwhile data for many processing algorithms (e.g. Dimensionality Reduction, Target Detection, Change Detection, Classification and Unmixing). Classification is a key issue in processing hyperspectral images. Spectral-identification-based algorithms are sensitive to spectral variability and noise in acquisition. There are many algorithms for classification. This paper describes a new framework for classification of hyperspectral images, based on both spectral and spatial information. The spatial information is obtained by an enhanced Marker-based Hierarchical Segmentation (MHS) algorithm. The hyperspectral data is first fed into the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network classification algorithm. Then, the MHS algorithm is applied in order to increase the accuracy of less-accurately classified land-cover types. In the proposed approach, the markers are extracted from the classification maps obtained by MLP and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers. Experimental results on Quebec City hyperspectral dataset, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves approximately 9% and 5% better overall accuracy than the MLP and the original MHS algorithms respectively.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W18-41-2019", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2964989080", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["119754470", "23702320", "14495716", "60633363", "128838662", "13801828", "12241480", "130936610", "62635710", "33542843", "18485838", "63046180", "6546550", "133185316", "7664224"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201138440"}

Sensitivity of PCVA versus hospital-assigned COD varied widely by cause, but showed consistently high specificity. PCVA and CCVA methods had an overall chance-corrected concordance of about 50% or lower, across all ages and CODs. At the population level, the relative CSMF error between PCVA and hospital-based deaths indicated good performance for most CODs.

The proposed method aims at selecting a subset of the original features that are both 1) relevant (discriminant) for the considered classification problem, i.e., preserve the functional relationship between input and output variables, and 2) invariant (stable) across different domains, i.e., minimize the data-set shift between the source and the target domains. Domains can be associated with hyperspectral images collected either on different geographical areas or on the same area at different times. We propose a novel measure of data-set shift for evaluating the domain stability, which computes the distance of the conditional distributions between the source and target domains in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Such a measure is defined on the basis of the kernel embeddings of the conditional distributions resulting in a nonparametric approach that does not require estimating the distribution of the classes. The adopted search strategy is based on a multiobjective optimization algorithm, which optimizes the two terms of the criterion function for the estimation of the Pareto-optimal solutions. This results in an effective approach of performing feature selection in a transfer learning setting.

However, screening for endocrine disruption using in vitro or in vivo approaches is costly and time-consuming. Computational methods, e.g., quantitative structure-activity relationship models, have become more reliable due to bigger training sets, increased computing power, and advanced machine learning algorithms, such as multilayered artificial neural networks. Machine learning models can be used to predict compounds for endocrine disrupting capabilities, such as binding to the estrogen receptor (ER), and allow for prioritization and further testing. In this work, an exhaustive comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms, chemical spaces, and evaluation metrics for ER binding was performed on public data sets curated using in-house cheminformatics software (Assay Central). Chemical features utilized in modeling consisted of binary fingerprints (ECFP6, FCFP6, ToxPrint, or MACCS keys) and continuous molecular descriptors from RDKit. Each feature set was subjected to classic machine learning algorithms (Bernoulli Naive Bayes, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Models were evaluated using a variety of metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, Cohen's Kappa, and Matthews correlation coefficient. For predicting compounds within the training set, DNN has an accuracy higher than that of other methods; however, in 5-fold cross validation and external test set predictions, DNN and most classic machine learning models perform similarly regardless of the data set or molecular descriptors used. We have also used the rank normalized scores as a performance-criteria for each machine learning method, and Random Forest performed best on the validation set when ranked by metric or by data sets.

Traditional TSVM for semi-supervised classification firstly train an SVM model with labeled data.

TSVM always uses a predefined kernel and fixed parameters during the optimization procedure and they also suffers potential over-fitting problem. In this paper we introduce proposed quasi-linear kernel to the TSVM. An SVM with quasi-linear kernel realizes an approximate nonlinear separation boundary by multi-local linear boundaries with interpolation. By applying quasi-linear kernel to semi-supervised classification it can avoid potential over-fitting and provide more accurate unlabeled data prediction. After unlabeled data prediction optimization, the quasi-linear kernel can be further adjusted considering the potential boundary data distribution as prior knowledge. We also introduce a minimal set method for optimizing unlabeled data prediction. The minimal set method follows the clustering assumption of semi-supervised learning. The pairwise label switching is allowed between minimal sets. It can speed up optimization procedure and reduce influence from label constrain in TSVM.

The HERF is an ensemble of classifiers composed of Extreme Learning Machines ELM and Decision Trees. Training of the HERF includes optimal rotation of random partitions of the feature set aimed to increase diversity. The first application is the segmentation of 3D Computed Tomography Angiography CTA following an Active Learning AL strategy for the optimal sample selection to minimize the number of data samples needed to obtain a required accuracy degree. AL is pertinent for interactive learning processes where a human operator is required to select training samples to enhance the classifier in an iterative process, therefore labeling samples for training may be a time consuming and expensive process. CTA image segmentation is one of such processes, due to the variability in CTA images which hinders the generalization of classifiers trained on one dataset to new datasets. Following an AL strategy, the human operator is presented with a visual selection of pixels whose labeling would be most informative for the classifier. After adding those labeled pixels to the training data, the classifier is retrained. This iteration is repeated until image segmentation quality meets the required level. The approach is applied to the segmentation of the thrombus in CTA imaging of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm AAA patients, showing that the structures of interest can be accurately segmented after a few iterations using a small data sample. The second application is a new semisupervised segmentation algorithm for hyperspectral images. The algorithm steps are: 1 supervised training an initial classifier from a small balanced training set, 2 clustering of the image pixels, by a k-means algorithm 3 adding unlabeled pixels to the original trainning data set according to the spatial neighborhood and the cluster membership, 4 supervised training of the classifier with the enriched training data set, 6 classification of the hyperspectral image 4 spatial regularization of classification results consisting in selecting the most frequent class in each pixel neighborhood.

Since different ontology matchers do not necessarily find the same correct correspondences, usually several competing matchers are applied to the same pair of entities in order to increase evidence towards a potential match or mismatch. How to select, combine and tune various ontology matchers to obtain the high quality ontology alignment is one of the main challenges in ontology matching domain. Recently, Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) has become the most suitable methodology to face this challenge, however, the huge memory consumption, slow convergence and premature convergence limit its application and reduce the solution\u2019s quality. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Hybrid Population-based Incremental Learning algorithm (HPBIL) to automatically select, combine and tune different ontology matchers, which can overcome three drawbacks of EA based ontology matching techniques and improve the ontology alignment\u2019s quality. In one hand, HPBIL makes use of a probabilistic representation of the population to perform the optimization process, which can significantly reduce EA\u2019s the memory consumption and the possibility of the premature convergence. In the other, we introduce the local search strategy into PBIL\u2019s evolving process to trade off its exploration and exploitation, and this marriage between global search and local search is helpful to reduce the runtime. In the experiment, we utilize different scale testing cases provided by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI 2016) to test HPBIL\u2019s performance, and the experimental results show that HPBIL\u2019s results significantly outperform other EA based ontology matching techniques and top-performers of the OAEI competitions.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12293-018-0255-8", "venue": null, "journal": "Memetic Computing", "mag_id": "2792734146", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["212425399", "212705665", "211242775", "210693743", "53045239", "215281415", "153313917", "198928981"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125455207"}

Using our transfer learning method we improve baseline NMT models by an average of 5.6 Bleu on four low-resource language pairs.

Additionally, using the transfer learning model for re-scoring, we can improve the SBMT system by an average of 1.3 Bleu, improving the state-of-the-art on low-resource machine translation.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1604.02201", "acl_id": "D16-1163", "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.18653/v1/D16-1163", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2950108887,2337363174,2963088995", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["61556494", "5953675", "10550488", "12744121", "3544821", "7358104", "765547", "1915014", "618683", "1998416", "18291533", "740063", "7961699", "3065236", "15301376", "18470994", "3330295", "17719760"], "inbound_citations": ["49743698", "28916303", "201633883", "20645862", "204783303", "21703708", "201635866", "3912183", "3653939", "44125049", "21731946", "17667087", "52141518", "211041231", "52160439", "204961341", "209500608", "53079244", "211018622", "7730925", "3295641", "4570432", "102354931", "75135250", "982761", "86849333", "201679348", "52183904", "4937857", "21753903", "202734308", "52054914", "207992210", "49560309", "52001093", "153312685", "208910447", "204737957", "51878592", "195886399", "210868376", "21689494", "214641440", "195767519", "209444664", "53238785", "214692833", "96432090", "52938038", "153312772", "52154258", "201624805", "195767626", "199543358", "30042437", "182225505", "202660912", "208248381", "204837859", "26392513", "3088415", "212657699", "208002314", "214727851", "207999578", "202539965", "49545390", "13754818", "3919314", "51880061", "202577926", "88486475", "195767029", "201681626", "17419868", "24860285", "204806285", "53246383", "215415899", "11185405", "208309968", "195063850", "48357955", "201679015", "54464708", "52156032", "53235792", "9266448", "201663202", "67855815", "195833172", "159041276", "3344408", "207924969", "201070626", "52281487", "52177946", "167217367", "207973290", "27738299", "4953145", "170078772", "19247366", "53145837", "201698472", "85500074", "11320015", "85510997", "214812313", "51878798", "189761997", "16866563", "212905435", "211004055", "146808476", "210928030", "201741290", "201666897", "3291104", "52009759", "199578763", "199578763", "15201884", "51918723", "53218398", "52310841", "53596423", "57572971", "202758777", "36653313", "44157913", "3638969", "202776138", "53236627", "203610484", "204793606", "51990297", "51882806", "195347858", "53285682", "2166461", "51976920", "202889310", "209500701", "215717832", "156052697", "209862736", "195218742", "52188299", "6236733", "3984122", "3490120", "29239744", "35273027", "10151247", "211104841", "202712706", "60440615", "11247552", "201058686", "201662413", "195069084", "30388479", "208163390", "53079221", "208547653", "53100288", "182952423", "3526501", "201692196", "53601909", "3488076", "196188410", "122552966", "207900426", "146804830", "53221681"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16631020"}

The goal of this paper is to propose a new Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based method to automatically detect dust storms using remote sensing data. Existing methods dealing with this problem are usually threshold-based that are of great complexity and uncertainty. In this paper we propose a simple and reliable method combining SVM with MODIS L1 data and explore the optimal band combinations used as the feature vectors of SVM. The developed method was evaluated by MODIS and OMI data qualitatively and quantitatively on three study sites located in the Arabian Desert, Gobi Desert and Taklimakan Desert, and it was also compared to three other traditional methods based on their accuracy, complexity, reliability and sensitivity to thresholds. The detection results demonstrated that the combination of (Band7 \u2212 Band3)/(Band7 + Band3) ((B7 \u2212 B3)/(B7 + B3)), Band20 \u2212 Band31 (B20 \u2212 B31), and Band31/Band32 (B31/B32) can detect the dust storms more precisely than other individual bands or their combination. The comparison among those cases indicated that the proposed automatic method exhibited an advantage of minimizing the uncertainty and complexity, which were the limits of defining thresholds based on the threshold-based methods.

Instrumentation and protocol improvements, however, are required to obtain useful signals and produce expeditiously self-applicable, comfortable and unobtrusive headgear. Approaches for improving the validity and reliability of fNIRS data for the purpose of sensing the mental state of commercial aircraft operators are identified, and an exemplary system design for attentional state monitoring is outlined. Intelligent flight decks of the future can be responsive to state changes to optimally support human performance. Thus, the identification of cognitive performance decrement, such as lapses in operator attention, may be used to predict and avoid error-prone states. The authors propose that attentional performance may be monitored with fNIRS through the quantification of hemodynamic activations in cortical regions which are part of functionally-connected attention and resting state networks. Activations in these regions have been shown to correlate with behavioral performance and task engagement. These regions lie beneath superficial tissue in head regions beyond the forehead. Headgear development is key to reliably and robustly accessing locations beyond the hairline to measure functionally-connected networks across the whole head. Human subject trials using both fNIRS and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) will be used to test this system.

Several advantages of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology, such as anti-interference, small, light and portable size of RFID tags, and its unique identification of different objects, make it superior to other wireless communication technologies for indoor positioning. However, certain drawbacks of existing RFID-based IPSs, such as high cost of RFID readers and active tags, as well as heavy dependence on the density of reference tags to provide the LBS, largely limit the application of RFID-based IPS. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we develop a cost-efficient RFID-based IPS by using cheaper active RFID tags and sensors. Furthermore, we also proposed three localization algorithms: Weighted Path Loss (WPL), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and integrated WPL-ELM. WPL is a centralized model-based approach which does not require any reference tags and provides accurate location estimation of the target effectively. ELM is a machine learning fingerprinting-based localization algorithm which can provide higher localization accuracy than other existing fingerprinting-based approaches. The integrated WPL-ELM approach combines the fast estimation of WPL and the high localization accuracy of ELM. Based on the experimental results, this integrated approach provides a higher localization efficiency and accuracy than existing approaches, e.g., the LANDMARC approach and the support vector machine for regression (SVR) approach.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1142/S2301385014400068", "venue": "Unmanned Systems", "journal": "Unmanned Systems", "mag_id": "2134081653", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3494790", "8579243", "14470726", "1911636", "41884283", "201111413", "4697319", "109938499", "204881684", "53438279", "31976323", "67865359", "207825129", "8810649", "51878011", "8561842", "53288070", "981528", "1028754", "96429546", "204899487", "92995130", "29212582", "19171555", "30839045", "18303304", "1510980", "211563011", "15402866", "215609151", "209496490", "67867696"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110919702"}

{"paper_id": "1139414", "title": "Semantic Matching using Kernel Methods", "authors": [{"first": "Alessandro", "middle": [], "last": "Moschitti", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Semantic matching (SM) for textual information can be informally defined as the task of effectively modeling text matching using representations more complex than those based on simple and independent set of surface forms of words or stems (typically indicated as bag-of-words). In this perspective, matching named entities (NEs) implies that the associated model can both overcomes mismatch between different representations of the same entities, e.g., George H. W. Bush vs. George Bush, and carry out entity disambiguation to avoid incorrect matches between different but similar entities, e.g., the entity above with his son George W. Bush. This means that both the context and structure of NEs must be taken into account in the IR model. SM becomes even more complex when attempting to match the shared semantics between two larger pieces of text, e.g., phrases or clauses, as there is currently no theory indicating how words should be semantically composed for deriving the meaning of text. The complexity above has traditionally led to define IR models based on bag-of-word representations in the vector space model (VSM), where (i) the necessary structure is minimally taken into account by considering n-grams or phrases; and (ii) the matching coverage is increased by projecting text in latent semantic spaces or alternatively by applying query expansion. Such methods introduce a considerable amount of noise, which negatively balances the benefit of achieving better coverage in most cases, thus producing no IR system improvement. In the last decade, a new class of semantic matching approaches based on the so-called Kernel Methods (KMs) for structured data (see e.g., [4]) have been proposed. KMs also adopt scalar products (which, in this context, take the names of kernel functions) in VSM. However, KMs introduce two new important aspects: \u2022 the scalar product is implicitly computed using smart techniques, which enable the use of huge feature spaces, e.g., all possible skip n-grams; and \u2022 KMs are typically applied within supervised algorithms, e.g., SVMs, which, exploiting training data, can filter out irrelevant features and noise. In this talk, we will briefly introduce and summarize, the latest results on kernel methods for semantic matching by focusing on structural kernels. These can be applied to match syntactic and/or semantic representations of text shaped as trees. Several variants are available: the Syntactic Tree Kernels (STK), [2], the String Kernels (SK) [5] and the Partial Tree Kernels (PTK) [4]. Most interestingly, we will present tree kernels exploiting SM between words contained in a text structure, i.e., the Syntactic Semantic Tree Kernels (SSTK) [1] and the Smoothed Partial Tree Kernels (SPTK) [3]. These extend STK and PTK by allowing for soft matching (i.e., via similarity computation) between nodes associated with different but related labels, e.g., synonyms. The node similarity can be derived from manually annotated resources, e.g., WordNet or Wikipedia, as well as using corpus-based clustering approaches, e.g., latent semantic analysis (LSA). An example of the use of such kernels for question classification in the question answering domain will illustrate the potentials of their structural similarity approach.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "SMIR@SIGIR", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2407428131", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["619181", "5615997", "574838", "35730151"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1139414"}

Many researchers now recognize that object perception and conceptual cognition are not distinct (Palmeri & Gauthier, 2004), making it important that models integrate both perception and cognition. In this paper, we argue that advances in our understanding of the visual system and new principles for the design of neu- ral architectures can be used to overcome many of the difficul- ties in providing a viable, neurally grounded, computational model of image categorization. We use the techniques of the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) (Eliasmith & Ander- son, 2003) to develop a model of category representation that connects retinal activity to high level cognitive judgments us- ing a class of vector-symbolic representations called semantic pointers (Eliasmith et al., 2012). The model receives natural images as input, produces category judgments as output, and carries out intermediate processing in simulated neurons. The proposed model replicates human performance on two inde- pendent studies of human judgment in prototype-based and exemplar-based image categorization, with no changes to the model. Semantic pointer architectures have been shown to support several important cognitive capacities (e.g. Stewart & Eliasmith, 2011; Eliasmith et al., 2012). Our study ex- tends this line of research, showing that semantic pointers computed by a plausible visual system model can be used to replicate human category judgments. Although studies of categorization have been a staple of psy- chological research for decades, there continues to be substan- tial disagreement about how unique classes of objects are rep- resented in the brain. We present a neural architecture for categorizing visual stimuli based on the Neural Engineering Framework and the manipulation of semantic pointers. The model accounts for how the visual system computes semantic representations from raw images, and how those representa- tions are then manipulated to produce category judgments. All computations of the model are carried out in simulated spiking neurons. We demonstrate that the model matches human per- formance on two seminal behavioural studies of image-based concept acquisition: Posner and Keele (1968) and Regehr and Brooks (1993). Keywords: category representation; image categorization; neural engineering framework; vector symbolic architecture Introduction Although studies of categorization have been a staple of psy- chological research for decades, there continues to be sub- stantial disagreement about how the mind represents informa- tion about unique classes of objects. Theories involving pro- totypes, exemplars, and explanatory schemas have all been shown to account for only a subset of known categorization phenomena, and progress toward a unified theory of cate- gory representation has been limited (for reviews, see Mur- phy, 2002; Machery, 2009; Smith & Medin, 1981). Histori- cally, the difficulty in modelling category representation has been to balance generality and accuracy. On one hand, many of the models developed from these theories have a fairly narrow scope of application. Con- sider, for instance, similarity-based accounts of concept ref- erence; these models produce impressive results at matching human behaviour in tasks that involve feature comparisons (see Smith & Medin, 1981), but they do not generalize well to other tasks that require the use of deeper category knowl- edge or explanatory inferences (see Murphy, 2002). On the other hand, approaches with greater scope tend to pay a price in terms of predictive accuracy or viability. For example, Barsalou\u2019s (1999) theory of perceptual symbol sys- tems is a more or less unified account of category repre- sentation, but it lacks a corresponding computational model (Dennett & Viger, 1999). Rogers and McClelland\u2019s (2004) account of semantic cognition provides a powerful model that performs well across a range of categorization tasks, but em- ploys both an idealized neural architecture and an idealized set of inputs (i.e. it is an abstract connectionist network that Model Description We developed a model of human image categorization that consists of a feed-forward visual perception model (similar to Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006) driving a vector-symbolic as- sociative memory (see Gayler, 2003; Plate, 2003). The model was first constructed using a rate approximation of the spik- ing leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model for the visual system and explicit vector computations for the associative memory. The model was then implemented fully in spiking neurons using the principles of the NEF. The visual system component of the model is a sequence of feed-forward neural populations that compresses high di- mensional input images into comparatively low dimensional vectors, which we refer to as semantic pointers. The first pop- ulation, analogous to the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), is a rasterized image, as would be captured by a con- ventional digital camera. Like the retina, a camera adapts to global lighting conditions and provides an image with stan- dard intensity levels.

SIC has been used as a primary data source for climate change prediction and ship navigation. However, the accuracy of PM SIC is typically low and biased in summer. To provide more accurate information for climatic research and ship navigation, it is necessary to evaluate quantitatively the accuracy of PM SIC and to account for its errors. In this research, we evaluated the SIC data derived from PM measurements using four representative sea ice algorithms: NASA Team (NT), Bootstrap (BT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF) hybrid, and Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction STudy (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI). Analyses were performed for the Chukchi Sea in summer using KOrean Multi-Purpose SATellite-5 (KOMPSAT-5) Enhanced Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Ice/water maps were generated by binary classification of texture features in the SAR images based on Random Forest, a rule-based machine learning approach. SIC values estimated from the sea ice algorithms showed good correlation with those calculated from the KOMPSAT-5 ice/water maps, but the root mean square error was larger than 10%. SIC values estimated from the algorithms showed different error trends according to the KOMPSAT-5 SIC range. All algorithms overestimated SIC values in open drift ice zones (KOMPSAT-5 SICs ranged from 0% to 15%). In marginal ice zones (SICs ranged from 15% to 80%), the OSISAF SIC values were the least biased compared to those from KOMPSAT-5. The NT algorithm largely underestimated SIC values in marginal ice zones, while the BT and ASI algorithms overestimated them considerably. All algorithms, except for BT, underestimated SIC in consolidated pack ice zones (SICs ranged from 80% to 100%). By analyzing the correlations of biases of SIC from the algorithms with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) data from the European Reanalysis Agency Interim reanalysis, it was found that the overestimation of NT and ASI SICs was largely influenced by atmospheric water vapor content, while the underestimation of NT and OSISAF SICs was owing to ice surface melting. The overestimation of BT SICs was not significantly correlated with the NWP data. The underestimated SIC from the BT and ASI algorithms for high SIC regions might be compensated by the atmospheric water vapor content. The differences in SIC values estimated from each algorithm were due to different sensitivities to atmospheric water vapor content in the regions with KOMPSAT-5 SIC lower than 40% and to ice surface melting in the regions with higher KOMPSAT-5 SIC.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2018.02.058", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2791469986", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["129621115", "130204002", "55509244", "22334330", "128880515", "89141", "128835722", "128899567", "126858415", "6843247", "50576", "34750605", "9683556", "17240833", "129308734", "58898386", "128869950", "140606231", "128693128", "43689652", "129445545", "206380316", "129490080", "123221960", "6962472", "129475384", "129396511", "14579803", "2985926", "125818696", "206786900", "121938208", "39032719", "14187034", "207020701", "21605657", "24676030", "18416377", "55164312", "54891899", "55668392", "54937615", "153563240", "26034721", "128683196", "129951170", "129483953", "27820873", "130514091", "47668", "19233185", "1683437", "127667242", "16462094", "206380734", "28099260", "128751719", "129689892", "16071576", "36735411", "37278199", "53356622", "133730527", "20416568", "2316958", "129474241", "128686949", "120576250", "125960499", "43333919", "129931884", "73631193", "4407199", "130598680", "17177047", "131965039", "73543752", "129187016", "13719636", "9179749", "11480273", "214994436", "128780720", "154855317", "131673760", "53632272", "86199105", "29557319", "36176638", "38488156", "1280521", "53662922", "38378097", "8653448", "9387303", "7062767"], "inbound_citations": ["128179795"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135163140"}

The DOF (texture and intensity) is used as the new feature vector that feeds the classifier. The classification system consists of two phases. The first phase differentiates between Benign and Malignant lesions, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The second phase further classifies the Benign into Hemangioma or Cyst and the Malignant into Metastasis or HCC, using a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier.

Given a wide range of images belonging to the normal class, emerging from some distribution, the objective of this task is to construct the model to detect out-of-distribution images belonging to abnormal instances. Semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-based methods have been gaining popularity in anomaly detection task recently. However, the training process of GAN is still unstable and challenging. To solve these issues, a novel adversarial dual autoencoder network is proposed, in which the underlying structure of training data is not only captured in latent feature space, but also can be further restricted in the space of latent representation in a discriminant manner, leading to a more accurate detector.

The objective of dimension reduction algorithms, such as principal component analysis (PCA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), random projection (RP), and auto-encoder (AE), is to reduce the noise or irrelevant information of the data. The features of PCA (eigenvectors) and linear AE are not able to represent data as parts (e.g. nose in a face image). On the other hand, NMF and non-linear AE are maimed by slow learning speed and RP only represents a subspace of original data. This paper introduces a dimension reduction framework which to some extend represents data as parts, has fast learning speed, and learns the between-class scatter subspace. To this end, this paper investigates a linear and non-linear dimension reduction framework referred to as extreme learning machine AE (ELM-AE) and sparse ELM-AE (SELM-AE). In contrast to tied weight AE, the hidden neurons in ELM-AE and SELM-AE need not be tuned, and their parameters (e.g, input weights in additive neurons) are initialized using orthogonal and sparse random weights, respectively.

In contrast to queries in traditional similarity search scenarios which are in the form of an input space point, SVM queries are hyperplanes in a (kernel function induced) feature space, and the best matches are instances farthest from the hyperplane.

Two corpus-based methods compute similarities via retrieving on web search engines and deep learning on large-scale corpora (news and microblog).

The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the comparatively highest performance of an operational approach based on integration of multisource information ensuring high mapping accuracy in large areas with acceptable processing time. The information used includes phenologically contrasted multiseasonal and multispectral bands, vegetation index, land surface temperature, and topographic features. The performance of different conventional and machine learning classifiers namely Malahanobis Distance (MD), Maximum Likelihood (ML), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests (RFs) was compared using the same datasets in the same IDL (Interactive Data Language) environment. An Eastern Mediterranean area with complex landscape and steep climate gradients was selected to test and develop the operational approach. The results showed that SVMs and RFs classifiers produced most accurate mapping at local-scale (up to 96.85% in Overall Accuracy), but were very time-consuming in whole-scene classification (more than five days per scene) whereas ML fulfilled the task rapidly (about 10 min per scene) with satisfying accuracy (94.2\u201396.4%).

CM is a natural phenomenon observed in many multilingual societies. It helps in speeding-up communication and allows wider variety of expression due to which it has become a popular mode of communication in social media forums like Facebook and Twitter. However, current Question Answering (QA) research and systems only support expressing a question in a single language which is an unrealistic and hard proposition especially for certain domains like health and technology. In this paper, we take the first step towards the development of a full-fledged QA system in CM language which is building a Question Classification (QC) system. The QC system analyzes the user question and infers the expected Answer Type (AType). The AType helps in locating and verifying the answer as it imposes certain type-specific constraints. In this paper, we present our initial efforts towards building a full-fledged QA system for CM language. We learn a basic Support Vector Machine (SVM) based QC system for English-Hindi CM questions. Due to the inherent complexities involved in processing CM language and also the unavailability of language processing resources such POS taggers, Chunkers, Parsers, we design our current system using only word-level resources such as language identification, transliteration and lexical translation. To reduce data sparsity and leverage resources available in a resource-rich language, in stead of extracting features directly from the original CM words, we translate them commonly into English and then perform featurization. We created an evaluation dataset for this task and our system achieves an accuracy of 63% and 45% in coarse-grained and fine-grained categories of the question taxanomy. The idea of translating features into English indeed helps in improving accuracy over the unigram baseline.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2740908.2743006", "venue": "WWW '15 Companion", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1783519389", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16295757", "17716065", "6364703", "18452630", "28569659", "3340886", "27199478", "197502", "60308218", "146143102", "11039301", "7622169", "150281880", "2131354", "60576031", "6857627", "5628888", "15600287", "19006835", "3331334"], "inbound_citations": ["46924963", "9434245", "15211128", "3477471", "199373245", "199022791", "37135539", "53501107", "52152266", "54437427", "199448224", "53097074", "51879705", "27036850", "51881821", "1981112", "64834166", "59616252", "21777977", "26055783", "52922601"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4502736"}

Although the keep it simple and straightforward (KISS) metric learning method for discriminative distance metric learning has been shown to be effective for the person re-identification, the estimation of the inverse of a covariance matrix is unstable and indeed may not exist when the training set is small, resulting in poor performance. Here, we present dual-regularized KISS (DR-KISS) metric learning. By regularizing the two covariance matrices, DR-KISS improves on KISS by reducing overestimation of large eigenvalues of the two estimated covariance matrices and, in doing so, guarantees that the covariance matrix is irreversible. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analyses for supporting the motivations. Specifically, we first prove why the regularization is necessary.

Then, we employ Ranking Support Vector Machine (SVM) model as the solution to our ranking based recommendation problem. By introducing two bias adjustment parameters, i.e., confidence contributions of publishers and the responsiveness of targets, our framework can effectively recommend top K proper users to mention.

By using the gradient of the network (i.e. discriminator) with high discriminability during training, we can, therefore, guide the gradient of a generator gradually toward the real data region. However, excessive negative feedback of the powerful classifier often prevents a generator from producing diverse images. Based on the main idea, we design a GAN including the added discriminator and propose a novel energy function in order to transfer the pre-trained knowledge to a generator and control the feedback of the added discriminator. We also present an incremental learning method to prevent the density of the generator to be the low-entropy distribution when training our GAN with respect to the energy function. We incorporate our method to DCGAN and demonstrate the ability to enhance the image quality even in high resolution on several datasets compared to DCGAN. In addition, we compare our method with recent GANs for the diversity of generated samples on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets and provide the extensive ablation studies to prove the benefits of our method.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2913697", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2944489172", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5216145", "6610705", "206771128", "2057420", "9957731", "3568073", "16367617", "1099052", "206594692", "9433631", "47019620", "11758569", "18268744", "308212", "38384342", "326772", "2309950", "8142135", "3464416", "4117071", "54437429", "4547917", "4744522", "4566854", "740063", "6628106", "10940950", "6287870", "206593880", "3366315", "10106675", "49316791", "8236317", "4637184", "17188384"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:148572844"}

Recent advances in evidence theory show that in an imbalance multiclass learning problem, optimizing of proper objective functions based on contingency tables prevents biases towards high-prior classes. Transfer learning usually deals with highly non-convex objectives and local minima in deep neural architectures. We propose a novel distributed transfer learning to tackle both optimization complexity and class-imbalance problem jointly. Our solution imposes separated greedy regularization to each individual convolutional filter to make single-filter neural networks such that the minority classes perform as the majority ones. Then, basic probability assignment from evidence theory boosts these distributed networks to improve the recognition performance on the target domains.

Its basic idea is that, in view of the gait pattern and Compressed Sensing( CS) framework of WBAN-based telemonitoring, the original acceleration-based data acquired at sensor node in WBAN was compressed only by spare measurement matrix( the simple linear projection algorithm),and the compressed data was transmitted to the remote terminal, where BSBL algorithm was used to perfectly recover the nonsparse acceleration data that assumed as block structure by exploiting intra-block correlation for further gait pattern recognition with high accuracy. The acceleration data from the open USC-HAD database including walking, running, jumping, upstairs and downstairs activities were employed for testing the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experiment results show that with acceleration-based data, the reconstruction performance of the proposed BSBL algorithm can significantly outperform some conventional CS algorithms for sparse data, and the best accuracy of 98% can be obtained by BSBL-based Support Vector Machine( SVM) classifier for gait pattern recognition. These results demonstrate that the proposed method not only can significantly improve the reconstruction performance of non-sparse acceleration data for further gait pattern recognition with high accuracy but also is very helpful for the design of low-cost sensor node hardware with lower energy consumption, which will be a potential approach for the energy-efficient WBAN-based telemonitoring of human gait pattern in further application.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Computer Applications", "mag_id": "2386919065", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64015902"}

The authors also evaluated the ability of these devices to differentiate indoors from outdoors, with the aim of enhancing contextual awareness. Data from this study was used to train and test five well known machine learning algorithms: C4.5, CART, Naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptrons and finally Support Vector Machines. Both single and multi-sensor approaches were examined to better understand the role each sensor in the device can play in unobtrusive activity recognition. The authors found overall results to be promising, with some models correctly classifying up to 100% of all instances.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4004015", "pubmed_id": "24662406", "doi": "10.3390/s140305687", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2103532308", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7047590", "17767316", "110202091", "6535151", "20913118", "31082431", "28606323", "45832842", "25528884", "36394769", "10080948", "26511416", "9152516", "16906545", "16543912", "104579", "11259953", "6568414", "23492271", "26786041", "273817", "3348287", "7401825", "47125649"], "inbound_citations": ["8728742", "24875335", "195755659", "51688740", "52966129", "20618110", "115750798", "59158996", "7393599", "34664746", "9294031", "210812229", "23179703", "59554931", "201837481", "214777637", "5065205", "4432050", "52960286", "75137518", "58674927", "198172093", "18296902", "116862617", "3506272", "52179260", "308184", "364510", "49666566", "2112296", "29793410", "52898904", "4055038", "55094260", "140294573", "864653", "203951389", "2157427", "43732835", "189926753", "13766625", "211838346", "37919943", "36962730", "55202452"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14609652"}

To address this issue, we first prove that the usual cost-sensitive SVM, here called the 2C-SVM, is equivalent to another formulation called the 2\\nu-SVM. We then exploit a characterization of the 2\\nu-SVM parameter space to develop a simple yet powerful approach to error estimation based on smoothing. In an extensive experimental study, we demonstrate that smoothing significantly improves the accuracy of cross-validation error estimates, leading to dramatic performance gains.

Although impressive results have been achieved on large/medium sized objects in large-scale detection benchmarks (e.g. the COCO dataset), the performance on small objects is far from satisfactory. The reason is that small objects lack sufficient detailed appearance information, which can distinguish them from the background or similar objects. To deal with the small object detection problem, we propose an end-to-end multi-task generative adversarial network (MTGAN). In the MTGAN, the generator is a super-resolution network, which can up-sample small blurred images into fine-scale ones and recover detailed information for more accurate detection. The discriminator is a multi-task network, which describes each super-resolved image patch with a real/fake score, object category scores, and bounding box regression offsets. Furthermore, to make the generator recover more details for easier detection, the classification and regression losses in the discriminator are back-propagated into the generator during training. Extensive experiments on the challenging COCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in restoring a clear super-resolved image from a blurred small one, and show that the detection performance, especially for small sized objects, improves over state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-01261-8_13", "venue": "ECCV", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2896155169", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52000710", "7148278", "7428689", "1282515", "13271756", "206770307", "1241368", "1033682", "206771194", "13740328", "206594692", "206595627", "5808102", "6200260", "9971732", "6628106", "207763512", "207763512", "211227", "10716717", "14113767", "2141740", "6892094", "11758569", "206594738", "786357", "10328909", "2843566", "13123786", "14124313", "1849990", "14924561"], "inbound_citations": ["198167658", "214802125", "202560591", "202767785", "202542872", "214693270", "202782652", "210173329", "207977271", "152282225", "208008097", "210972353", "181514330", "208310039", "198180536", "199020976", "189928363", "211104870", "211138821", "199543771", "152282793", "214606001", "202126012", "119120892", "210839653", "208637257", "62841491", "214713803", "208011605", "86654429", "212725757", "208157981", "207906713"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52963261"}

Traditional methods to ascertain ancestral informative markers usually require the prior knowledge of individual ancestry and have difficulty for admixed populations. Recently Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been employed with success to select SNPs which are highly correlated with top significant principal components (PCs) without use of individual ancestral information. The approach is also applicable to admixed populations. Here we propose a novel approach based on our recent result on summarizing population structure by graph laplacian eigenfunctions, which differs from PCA in that it is geometric and robust to outliers. Our approach also takes advantage of the priori sparseness of informative markers in the genome. Through simulation of a ring population and the real global population sample HGDP of 650K SNPs genotyped in 940 unrelated individuals, we validate the proposed algorithm at selecting most informative markers, a small fraction of which can recover the similar underlying population structure efficiently. Employing a standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict individuals' continental memberships on HGDP dataset of seven continents, we demonstrate that the selected SNPs by our method are more informative but less redundant than those selected by PCA.

So far, various simulation tools, engineering and Artificial Intelligence based methods are being used to perform optimal electricity demand forecasting. While engineering methods use dynamic equations to forecast, the AI-based methods use historical data to predict future demand. However, modeling of nonlinear electricity demand patterns is still underdeveloped for robust solutions as the existing methods are useful only for handling short-term dependencies. Moreover, the existing methods are static in nature because they are purely historical data driven. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based framework to forecast electricity demand by taking care of long-term historical dependencies. Initially, the cluster analysis is performed on the electricity consumption data of all months to generate season based segmented data. Subsequently, load trend characterization is carried out to have a deeper insight of metadata falling into each of the clusters. Further, Long Short Term Memory network multi-input multi-output models are trained to forecast electricity demand based upon the season, day and interval data. In the present work, we have also incorporated the concept of moving window based active learning to improve prediction results. To demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is applied to the electricity consumption data of Union Territory Chandigarh, India. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by comparing the prediction results with Artificial Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network and Support Vector Regression models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.113", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Energy", "mag_id": "2915043045", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["215723317", "209459160", "204700617", "212725146", "211129614", "214713904", "198981759", "210994142", "172137224", "208884208", "212424944", "211092422"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117339875"}

Two main challenges spring from this new task: (i) how to generate fine-grained details and realistic textures without segmentation map input; and (ii) how to create a background and weave it seamlessly into standalone objects. To tackle this, we propose Background Hallucination Generative Adversarial Network (BachGAN), which first selects a set of segmentation maps from a large candidate pool via a background retrieval module, then encodes these candidate layouts via a background fusion module to hallucinate a suitable background for the given objects. By generating the hallucinated background representation dynamically, our model can synthesize high-resolution images with both photo-realistic foreground and integral background.

Due to between sessions/subjects variations in the properties of brain signals, typically, a large amount of training data needs to be collected at the beginning of each session to calibrate the parameters of the BCI system for the target user. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach on the classification domain to reduce the calibration time without sacrificing the classification accuracy of MI-BCI. Thus, when only few subject-specific trials are available for training, the estimation of the classification parameters is improved by incorporating previously recorded data from other users. For this purpose, a regularization parameter is added to the objective function of the classifier to make the classification parameters as close as possible to the classification parameters of the previous users who have feature spaces similar to that of the target subject. In this paper, a new similarity measure based on the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence (KL) is used to measure the similarity between two feature spaces obtained using subject-specific common spatial patterns (CSP). The proposed transfer learning approach is applied on the logistic regression classifier and evaluated using three datasets. The results showed that compared with the subject-specific classifier, the proposed weighted transfer learning classifier improved the classification results, particularly when few subject-specific trials were available for training ( p < 0.05). Importantly, this improvement was more pronounced for users with medium and poor accuracy. Moreover, the statistical results showed that the proposed weighted transfer learning classifier performed significantly better than the considered comparable baseline algorithms.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31217122", "doi": "10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2923315", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2951108876", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["17571592", "32406088", "56550547", "60672758", "24756702", "919525", "22472204", "46792314", "14891596", "7263354", "203705183", "740063", "1059919", "5015776", "2709639", "214885890", "17882423", "471128", "7133580", "25277405", "23461673", "8399672", "9565267", "23485809", "1911593", "16142276", "61053364", "6404642", "2207234", "16711929", "15906583", "20972908", "19746442", "16768813", "12524156", "16757203", "11661123", "10908715", "16362395", "5268653", "6012752"], "inbound_citations": ["211010796"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195189686"}

Serval computational methods have been developed to detect associations between cancer and lncRNAs, yet those approaches have limitations in both sensitivity and specificity. With the goal of improving the prediction accuracy for associations of lncRNA with cancer, we upgraded our previously developed cancer-related lncRNA classifier, CRlncRC, to generate CRlncRC2. CRlncRC2 is an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning framework, including Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)-based over-sampling, along with Laplacian Score-based feature selection. Ten-fold cross-validation showed that the AUC value of CRlncRC2 for identification of cancer-related lncRNAs is much higher than previously reported by CRlncRC and others. Compared with CRlncRC, the number of features used by CRlncRC2 dropped from 85 to 51. Finally, we identified 439 cancer-related lncRNA candidates using CRlncRC2. To evaluate the accuracy of the predictions, we first consulted the cancer-related long non-coding RNA database Lnc2Cancer v2.0 and relevant literature for supporting information, then conducted statistical analysis of somatic mutations, distance from cancer genes, and differential expression in tumor tissues, using various data sets. The results showed that our approach was highly reliable for identifying cancer-related lncRNA candidates. Notably, the highest ranked candidate, lncRNA AC074117.1, has not been reported previously; however, integrated multi-omics analyses demonstrate that it is the target of multiple cancer-related miRNAs and interacts with adjacent protein-coding genes, suggesting that it may act as a cancer-related competing endogenous RNA, which warrants further investigation.

The proposed model consists of independent eyes and head controlled circuits with mutual interactions for the appropriate adjustment of coordination behaviour.

We explored three methods of labelling cognitive states for three-state classification.

The second method was more adaptive, it employed mixed effects stress-strain curve and estimated an individual\u2019s performance asymptotes with respect to the same spatial task. The final method was similar to the second approach, yet it employed a mixed effects Rasch model to estimate individual capacity limits context of item response theory for the memory task. To assess the strength of each of these labelling approaches we compared area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operating curves (ROC) as well the AUC of precision-recall ROCs (PR-ROC) from elastic net and random forest classifiers. We chose these classifiers based on a combination of interpretability, flexibility and past modeling success. We tested these techniques across two groups of individuals and two tasks to test the effects of different labelling techniques on cross-person and cross-task transfer.

Yet, the scan time limitations may prohibit the acquisition of certain contrasts, and some contrasts may be corrupted by noise and artifacts. In such cases, the ability to synthesize unacquired or corrupted contrasts can improve diagnostic utility. For multi-contrast synthesis, the current methods learn a nonlinear intensity transformation between the source and target images, either via nonlinear regression or deterministic neural networks. These methods can, in turn, suffer from the loss of structural details in synthesized images. Here, in this paper, we propose a new approach for multi-contrast MRI synthesis based on conditional generative adversarial networks. The proposed approach preserves intermediate-to-high frequency details via an adversarial loss, and it offers enhanced synthesis performance via pixel-wise and perceptual losses for registered multi-contrast images and a cycle-consistency loss for unregistered images. Information from neighboring cross-sections are utilized to further improve synthesis quality. Demonstrations on T1- and T2- weighted images from healthy subjects and patients clearly indicate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Moreover, the latent features produced by these algorithms are hard to interpret. In this paper, we present two novel tensor decomposition-based node embedding algorithms, that can learn node features from arbitrary types of graphs: undirected, directed, and/or weighted, without relying on eigendecomposition or word embedding-based hyperparameters. Both algorithms preserve the local and global structural properties of the graph by using k-step transition probability matrices to construct third-order multidimensional arrays or tensors and perform CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition in order to produce an interpretable and low dimensional vector space for the nodes. Our experiments encompass different types of graphs (undirected/directed, unweighted/weighted, sparse/dense) of different domains such as social networking and neuroscience.

Although such systems produce accurate results, their use can be expensive and data processing can be time consuming, which make them infeasible considering the demand for quick pavement evaluation. To overcome such problems, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be used as an alternative as they are relatively cheaper and easier-to-use. In this study, we propose a UAV based pavement crack identification system for monitoring rigid pavements' existing conditions. The system consists of recently introduced image processing algorithms used together with conventional machine learning techniques, both of which are used to perform detection of cracks on rigid pavements' surface and their classification. Through image processing, the distinct features of labelled crack bodies are first obtained from the UAV based images and then used for training of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The performance of the developed SVM model was assessed with a field study performed along a rigid pavement exposed to low traffic and serious temperature changes.

Initially, a comprehensive transcriptional signature was established for HPV-driven tumourigenesis and culminated in the confirmation of a driver role for HPV outside the Oropharynx in Head and Neck cancer and the discovery of prognostically relevant differences in the immune microenvironment with implications for patient management. Analysis of exomes for mutagenesis by APOBEC3B, found upregulated in HPV+ tumours, identified it as a key driver of genomic evolution in these tumours, and broadly as a determinant of hotspot specificity in PIK3CA mutations across cancers. Establishment of HPV-associated DNA methylation signatures, useful for classification, also highlighted novel HPV-related transcriptional changes and putative heterogeneity in cell-of-origin associated with HPV types and tissue sites. Analyses of transcriptional and epigenetic heterogeneity in Cervical Cancer, where multiple HPV types are causal, identified HPV45-associated molecular signatures indicative of increased invasiveness and inflammation with putative applications in patient stratification.

This problem greatly hampers the applicability of such techniques to many real-life segmentation tasks. In this thesis, we therefore investigate whether transfer-learning techniques can aid supervised neuro image segmentation on images from MRI scans with different characteristics. Transfer learning comprises techniques that can cope with certain differences in feature distributions between training and test data. We study different approaches to transfer learning that aim to compensate for these distribution differences at different stages of the classification framework: in the classifier, in the feature representation, or both. Experiments on a variety of neuro-image-segmentation tasks show that these techniques can greatly improve performance on data from different scanners, scanning parameters, and patient groups.

Afterwards, sepsis sensitive parameters were tested and selected, which were utilized as the input of the stratification model. For the model, the algorithm of Support Vector Machine was applied. Eventually, the model was tested in total of 522 clinical cases and an accuracy of 67.5% in stratification was achieved. The performance of the established model is superior to the conventional APACHE scoring method. Preliminary results exhibited that the established model is potential to help improve the patients\u2019 management by quickly stratifying the sepsis severity.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-19452-3_46", "venue": "IFMBE Proceedings", "journal": "IFMBE Proceedings", "mag_id": "2464693129", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56937419"}

Many of these proteins seem to be associated with disease processes. Being able to predict glucose-specific binding sites in these proteins will greatly enhance our ability to annotate protein function and may significantly contribute to drug design. We hereby present the first glucose-binding site classifier algorithm. We consider the sugar-binding pocket as a spherical spatio-chemical environment and represent it as a vector of geometric and chemical features. We then perform Random Forests feature selection to identify key features and analyze them using support vector machines classification. Our work shows that glucose binding sites can be modeled effectively using a limited number of basic chemical and residue features. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation method, our classifier achieves a 8.11% error, a 89.66% sensitivity and a 93.33% specificity over our dataset.

In this paper, we introduce two novel feature fusion methods based on the principle component analysis (PCA) and the artificial neural network based stacked autoencoder with extreme learning machine algorithm (ELM-AE), respectively. The concatenated feature consisted of LPCC and MFCC features are employed as the original inputs for the two feature learning algorithms.

The performance of an SVM depends largely on the selection of its parameters. Choosing between an SVM that solves an optimization problem with inequality constrains and one that solves the least square of errors (LS-SVM) adds to the complexity. Various methods have been proposed for tuning parameters, but no article puts the SVM and LS-SVM side by side to discuss the issue using a large dataset from the real world, which could be problematic for existing parameter tuning methods. We investigated both the SVM and LS-SVM with an artificial dataset and a dataset of more than 200,000 points used for the reconstruction of the global surface ocean CO2 concentration. The results reveal that: (1) the two models are most sensitive to the parameter of the kernel function, which lies in a narrow range for scaled input data; (2) the optimal values of other parameters do not change much for different datasets; and (3) the LS-SVM performs better than the SVM in general. The LS-SVM is recommended, as it has less parameters to be tuned and yields a smaller bias. Nevertheless, the SVM has advantages of consuming less computer resources and taking less time to train. The results suggest initial parameter guesses for using the models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/make1020043", "venue": "Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction", "journal": "Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2950363476", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3074096", "133908675", "126391780", "20426983", "53316691", "13923247", "55901039", "133307517", "52874011", "15480929", "53940663", "18025276", "10277818", "14607075", "12512548", "10101957", "13902239", "125985379", "55123801", "129956818", "128919356", "73657122", "15797313"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196180869"}

First, a trous DWT of the baseline wander removed and scaled multi-lead electrocardiogram signal is computed. Scales of 2^2, 2^3, and 2^4 and a smoothing function scale of 2^2 are selected. Then, using a simple approximation technique, the fiducial and J points of each detected QRS complex are estimated and then the complex and the corresponding chosen DWT scales are segmented. Next, for each excerpted segment, the second- (variance), third- (quasi-skewness), and fourth- (quasi-kurtosis) order statistical moments and the curve length (as a nonlinear moment) are calculated and used as elements of the feature vector (20 measures for the feature vector of each lead). The proposed features are used for regulating the parameters of five sequentially operating particle radial basis function (RBF)-based support vector machine (SVM) classifiers implemented for multi-lead records of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database for atrial premature (AP), nodal (junctional) premature (NP), ventricular escape (VE), nodal (junctional) escape (NE), abberated atrial premature (AAP), rhythm-changed (RC), ventricular-normal fusion (VNF), paced-normal fusion (PNF), non-conducted P-wave (NCPW), ventricular flutter (VF), paced beat (PB), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), and Normal categories. To increase the accuracy of the classification algorithm, the training database is divided into five groups, namely Normal+LBBB+RBBB+APB+PB (Group#0), NP+VE+NE (Group#1), AAP+RC+PVC (Group#2), VNF+PNF (Group#3), and VF+NCPW (Group#4). An RBF-SVM classifier is tuned for each group. In the proposed sequential particle classification algorithm, beats belonging to Group#0, Group#1, Group#2, and Group#3 are recognized and isolated from the test database via Classifier#0, Classifier#1, Classifier#2, and Classifier#3, respectively. Then, the arrhythmias of Group#4 are identified by Classifier#4. The proposed heart arrhythmia classification is applied to categorize the abovementioned arrhythmias. Average values of Se=99.34%, P+=99.60%, Sp=99.63%, and Acc=98.64% are obtained for sensitivity, positive predictivity, specificity, and accuracy, respectively, showing marginal improvement of the heart arrhythmia classification performance.

The idea of SVM is to perform a mapping from the input space to a higher-dimensional feature space using a kernel function, so that a linear learning algorithm can be employed. However, the burden of choosing the appropriate kernel function is usually left to the user. It can easily be shown that the accuracy of the learned model highly depends on the chosen kernel function and its parameters, especially for complex tasks. In order to obtain a good classification or regression model, an appropriate kernel function in combination with optimized pre- and post-processed data must be used. To circumvent these obstacles, we present two solutions for optimizing kernel functions: (a) automated hyperparameter tuning of kernel functions combined with an optimization of pre- and post-processing options by Sequential Parameter Optimization (SPO) and (b) evolving new kernel functions by Genetic Programming (GP). We review modern techniques for both approaches, comparing their different strengths and weaknesses. We apply tuning to SVM kernels for both regression and classification. Automatic hyperparameter tuning of standard kernels and pre- and post-processing options always yielded to systems with excellent prediction accuracy on the considered problems. Especially SPO-tuned kernels lead to much better results than all other tested tuning approaches.

In addition to the volume problem of such data sets nonlinearity becomes important, as the more detailed data sets contain also more comprehensive information, e.g. about non regular seasonal or cyclical movements as well as jumps in time series. This essay compares two nonlinear methods for predicting a high frequency time series, the USD/Euro exchange rate. The first method investigated is Autoregressive Neural Network Processes (ARNN), a neural network based nonlinear extension of classical autoregressive process models from time series analysis (see Dietz 2011). Its advantage is its simple but scalable time series process model architecture, which is able to include all kinds of nonlinearities based on the universal approximation theorem of Hornik, Stinchcombe and White 1989 and the extensions of Hornik 1993. However, restrictions related to the numeric estimation procedures limit the flexibility of the model. The alternative is a Support Vector Machine Model (SVM, Vapnik 1995). The two methods compared have different approaches of error minimization (Empirical error minimization at the ARNN vs. structural error minimization at the SVM). Our new finding is, that time series data classified as \u201cBig Data\u201d need new methods for prediction. Estimation and prediction was performed using the statistical programming language R. Besides prediction results we will also discuss the impact of Big Data on data preparation and model validation steps.

Besides modeling positive task correlation, our approach\u2014multitask relationship learning (MTRL)\u2014can also describe negative task correlation and identify outlier tasks based on the same underlying principle. By utilizing a matrix-variate normal distribution as a prior on the model parameters of all tasks, our MTRL method has a jointly convex objective function. For efficiency, we use an alternating method to learn the optimal model parameters for each task as well as the relationships between tasks. We study MTRL in the symmetric multitask learning setting and then generalize it to the asymmetric setting as well. We also discuss some variants of the regularization approach to demonstrate the use of other matrix-variate priors for learning task relationships. Moreover, to gain more insight into our model, we also study the relationships between MTRL and some existing multitask learning methods.

To this end, machine learning techniques have become popular as they can learn, analyze and even predict the RF signals and associated parameters that characterize a RF environment. However, classical machine learning methods have their limitations and there are situations where such methods become ineffective. One such setting is where active adversaries are present and try to disrupt the RF environment through malicious activities like jamming or spoofing. In this paper we propose an adversarial learning technique for identifying rogue RF transmitters and classifying trusted ones by designing and implementing generative adversarial nets (GAN). The GAN exploits the in-phase (I) and quadrature imbalance (i.e., the IQ imbalance) present in all transmitters to learn the unique high dimensional features that can be used as \u201cfingerprints\u201d for identifying and classifying the transmitters. We implement a generative model that learns the sample space of the IQ values of the known transmitters and use the learned representation to generate fake signals that imitate the transmissions of the known transmitters. We program 8 universal software radio peripheral (USRP) software defined radios as trusted transmitters and collect over-the-air raw IQ data from them using a RTL-SDR in a laboratory setting. We also implement a discriminator model and show that the discriminator is able to discriminate between the trusted transmitters from fake ones with 99.9% accuracy. Finally, the trusted transmitters are classified using convolutional neural network (CNN) and fully connected deep neural networks (DNN). Results reveal that the CNN and DNN are able to correctly discriminate between the 8 trusted transmitters with 81.6% and 96.6% accuracies respectively.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/WCNC.2019.8885548", "venue": "2019 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)", "journal": "2019 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2982637733", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6396569", "3780922", "37372574", "10458865", "1033682", "36093947", "19910274", "910182", "6199094", "3449450", "1282515", "206770979", "9957731", "6628106", "6844431", "5707386", "8993325", "15539264"], "inbound_citations": ["211227074", "215722593", "211684461", "155109985", "209457125"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:173176997"}

To simulate spatial variation of communities and predict the impact of climate change, it is essential to identify the distribution-controlling factors. Macroalgae biomass production in polar regions is determined by environmental factors such as irradiance, which are modified under climate change impact. In coastal fjords of King George Island/Isla 25 de Mayo, Antarctica, suspended particulate matter (SPM) from glacial melting causes shading of algal communities during summer. Ten different species distribution models (SDMs) were applied to predict macroalgae distribution based on their statistical relationships with environmental variables. The suitability of the SDMs was assessed by two different evaluation methods. Those SDMs based on a multitude of decision trees such as Random Forest and Classification Tree Analysis reached the highest predictive ability followed by generalized boosted models and maximum-entropy approaches. We achieved excellent results for the current status EM (true scale statistics 0.833 and relative operating characteristics 0.975). The environmental variables hard substrate and SPM were identified as the best predictors explaining more than 60 % of the modelled distribution. Additional variables distance to glacier, total organic carbon, bathymetry and slope increased the explanatory power proved by cross-validation. Presumably, the SPM load of the meltwater streams on the Potter Peninsula will continue to increase at least linearly. We therefore coupled the EM with changing SPM conditions representing enhanced or reduced melt water input. Increasing SPM by 25% decreased predicted macroalgal coverage by approximately 38%.

It could play a key role in NLP tasks like Information Extraction, Question Answering and Summarization. We propose a machine learning algorithm for semantic role parsing, extending the work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), Surdeanu et al. (2003) and others.

Methods: Hierarchical clustering technique was used along with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers to select marker-genes of three types of breast cancer. In this method, at each step, one subject is left out and the algorithm iteratively selects some clusters of genes from the remainder of subjects and selects a representative gene from each cluster. Then, classifiers are constructed based on these genes and the accuracy of each classifier to predict the class of leftout subject is recorded. The classifier with higher precision is considered superior. Results: Combining classification techniques with clustering method resulted in fewer genes with high degree of statistical precision. Although all classifiers selected a few genes from pre-determined highly ranked genes, the precision did not decrease. SVM precision was 100% with 22 genes instead of 50 genes while the NB resulted in higher precision of 97.95% in this case. When 20 highly ranked genes selected to be fed to the algorithm, same precision was obtained using 6 and 5 genes with SVM and NB classifiers respectively. Conclusion: Using hybrid method could be effective in choosing fewer number of plausible marker genes so that the classification precision of these markers is increased. In addition, this method enables detecting new plausible markers that their association to disease under study is not biologically proved.

Currently, habitat classification is performed by human surveyors - a laborious, expensive and subjective process. In this talk, I will present our work in developing automatic habitat classification solutions based on ground photographs. We employ image analysis methodologies from the multimedia and computer vision literature and formulate habitat classification as a fine-grained visual categorization problem. We treat digital photograph based habitat classification as an image-labeling problem and have developed an image-annotation framework that uses a random forest to automatically label a digital photo with habitat classes. As automatic visual recognition is still very hard whilst humans can perform visual recognition with the greatest ease, we have developed a human in the loop approach to enhancing the accuracy of automatic habitat classification. Using a crowd-sourcing mechanism, we extract medium-level knowledge about the photographs by asking humans a set of 17 questions about the visual appearances of the image that can be easily answered by non-ecologists. This medium-level knowledge is then fused with the low-level visual features in a random forest to improve the accuracy of habitat classification. Digital photographs taken with modern cameras (smartphones included) contains location information (GPS) and based on the reasonable assumption that neighboring areas should have similar ecological properties, we use the GPS information of the photos together with the random forest outputs to further improve the habitat classification performances. We have constructed a geo-referenced habitat photograph database containing over 1000 high-resolution ground photographs that have been manually annotated by habitat classification experts. This database has been specifically designed for the development of multimedia analysis techniques for ecological applications and is publicly available.

This paper introduces a novel framework for nonlinear metric learning, called kernel density metric learning (KDML), which is easy to use and provides nonlinear, probability-based distance measures. KDML constructs a direct nonlinear mapping from the original input space into a feature space based on kernel density estimation. The nonlinear mapping in KDML embodies established distance measures between probability density functions, and leads to accurate classification on datasets for which existing linear metric learning methods would fail. It addresses the severe challenge to distance-based classifiers when features are from heterogeneous domains and, as a result, the Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance between original feature vectors is not meaningful. We also propose two ways to determine the kernel bandwidths, including an adaptive local scaling approach and an integrated optimization algorithm that learns the Mahalanobis matrix and kernel bandwidths together. KDML is a general framework that can be combined with any existing metric learning algorithm. As concrete examples, we combine KDML with two leading metric learning algorithms, large margin nearest neighbors (LMNN) and neighborhood component analysis (NCA). KDML can naturally handle not only numerical features, but also categorical ones, which is rarely found in previous metric learning algorithms. Extensive experimental results on various datasets show that KDML significantly improves existing metric learning algorithms in terms of classification accuracy.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TKDE.2014.2384522", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2004834787", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8616518", "2643381", "8616518", "47325215", "2261947", "8055408", "8118901", "15064396", "6188188", "2583452", "5706510", "5555257", "262323", "123270174", "1484295", "653791", "10315527", "120349231", "15506682", "122414377", "123466489", "120067924", "198120268", "14694369", "17066951", "47325215", "10315527", "15514193", "13365148", "122897287", "34917506", "8281592", "12627456", "59849738", "6999054"], "inbound_citations": ["20160639", "16245392", "49230198", "209336723"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5808484"}

One of the main challenges in object detection, and machine learning in general, is acquiring sufficient training data. Many types of data can be hard or expensive to collect and label, or be subject to privacy concerns and regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This is particularly true for many object detection tasks, such as face detection where the training data consists of images depicting faces. Using synthetic data for training has been attempted before, but no consensus exists on how to best utilize it. This work focuses on using a priori trained Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce synthetic images of faces, and using them to train detectors based on Haar-like features. Experiments were conducted on both replacing real images with synthetic, and introducing synthetic variance by augmenting real images using image-to-image translating GANs. It was found that GAN-generated images can indeed be useful for detector training. Although real images consistently performs better, the amount of data plays a role as well, and a priori trained GANs can easily produce a lot of synthetic data with good variation. If real data is hard to collect, synthetic data produced by a GAN could be a viable option. It was also found that image-to-image translating GANs can be useful for data augmentation, especially when real data is scarce. Future work should focus on the impact of variance and bias in the synthetic data and how it can be controlled for optimal performance.

Because of the amount of data required to learn embeddings, they are trained on large corpus of written text. This can be an issue when dealing with non-canonical language, such as spontaneous speech: embeddings have to be adapted to fit the particularities of spoken transcriptions.

For this reason, an alternative, renewable and biodegradable combustible like biodiesel is necessary. For this purpose, waste cooking oil is a potential replacement for vegetable oils in the production of biodiesel. Direct transesterification of vegetable oils was undertaken to synthesize the biodiesel. Several variables controlled the process. The alkaline catalyst that is used, typically sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH), increases the solubility and speeds up the reaction. Therefore, the methodology that this study suggests for improving the biodiesel production is based on computing techniques for prediction and optimization of these process dimensions. The method builds and selects a group of regression models that predict several properties of biodiesel samples (viscosity turbidity, density, high heating value and yield) based on various attributes of the transesterification process (dosage of catalyst, molar ratio, mixing speed, mixing time, temperature, humidity and impurities). In order to develop it, a Box-Behnken type of Design of Experiment (DoE) was designed that considered the variables that were previously mentioned. Then, using this DoE, biodiesel production features were decided by conducting lab experiments to complete a dataset with real production properties. Subsequently, using this dataset, a group of regression models\u2014linear regression and support vector machines (using linear kernel, polynomial kernel and radial basic function kernel)\u2014were constructed to predict the studied properties of biodiesel and to obtain a better understanding of the process. Finally, several biodiesel optimization scenarios were reached through the application of genetic algorithms to the regression models obtained with greater precision. In this way, it was possible to identify the best combinations of variables, both independent and dependent. These scenarios were based mainly on a desire to improve the biodiesel yield by obtaining a higher heating value, while decreasing the viscosity, density and turbidity. These conditions were achieved when the dosage of catalyst was approximately 1 wt %.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/en11112995", "venue": null, "journal": "Energies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2898976263", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["32870468", "110394365", "9210561", "12841252", "95943256", "104230655", "106402381", "55016287", "115279694", "94061716", "95978245", "97293773", "109225621", "94847002", "31848143", "97841147", "64223085", "109468773", "90222829", "8474305", "18518851", "111004212", "97895023", "114290390", "109076425", "97989296", "95974327", "111215667", "136431677", "54499198", "120033757", "96363996", "82446001", "96006572", "94891361", "95997270", "19196574", "122736686", "5621960", "54778303", "21223758", "117156703", "27339479", "123933057", "29031037"], "inbound_citations": ["115766598", "195772899", "210169028"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54706544"}

Node representation learning or network embedding learns a mapping of each node to a vector. The mapping encodes structural information on network, providing low-dimensional dense node features for general machine learning and data mining frameworks. Since many social networks allow trust (friend) and distrust (enemy) relationships described by signed and directed edges, generalizing network embedding method to learn from sign and direction information in networks is crucial. In addition, social theories are critical tool in signed network analysis. However, none of the existing methods supports all of the desired properties: considering sign, direction, and social theoretical interpretation. In this paper, we propose SIDE, a general network embedding method that represents both sign and direction of edges in the embedding space. SIDE carefully formulates and optimizes likelihood over both direct and indirect signed connections. We provide socio-psychological interpretation for each component of likelihood function. We prove linear scalability of our algorithm and propose additional optimization techniques to reduce the training time and improve accuracy.

The DWT-DCT domain coefficients are used for feature extraction using simple statistical measures and quantization. This approach reduces the dimension of the original face images while preserving the property of data distribution in the feature subspace. A Support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used for classifying DWT-DCT based feature vectors into separate groups for recognition purposes. The hybrid DWT-DCT-SVM face recognition model is evaluated in MATLAB on the Cambridge ORL face database.

The prediction performance of SVR is compared with those of the model of theoretical linear salvation energy relationship (TLSER). By using leave-one-out cross validation of SVR test Henry constants for adsorption of 35 VOCs on MWNTs, the root mean square error is 0.080, the mean absolute percentage error is only 1.19%, and the correlation coefficient (R2) is as high as 0.997. Compared with the results of the TLSER model, it is shown that the estimated errors by SVR are all smaller than those achieved by TLSER. It reveals that the generalization ability of SVR is superior to that of the TLSER model. Meanwhile, multifactor analysis is adopted for investigation of the influences of each molecular structure descriptor on the Henry constants. According to the TLSER model, the adsorption mechanism of adsorption of carbon nanotubes of VOCs is mainly a result of van der Waals and interactions of hydrogen bonds. These can provide the theoretical support for the application of carbon nanotube adsorption of VOCs and can make up for the lack of experimental data.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1088/0256-307X/33/4/048201", "venue": null, "journal": "Chinese Physics Letters", "mag_id": "2339732064", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123668450"}

Traffic data obtained from these detectors are used for various ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) applications such as travel time estimation and incident detection. In the recent past, however, researchers have been interested in proactive applications of these data. These proactive applications primarily involve real-time crash risk assessment based on analysis of traffic surveillance data observed prior to historical crashes. In this study, we have analyzed the crash data from five freeway sections in the Utrecht region of the Netherlands to identify the traffic conditions significantly associated with crash occurrences. Random Forest, a data mining methodology employing multiple classification trees, would be used to analyze the data and identify traffic parameters significantly associated with the binary variable representing crash vs. non-crash. It was found that the turbulence in traffic speeds is related to real-time crash likelihood. The results are promising in that they show the potential of transferring the proactive traffic management approach proposed by Pande and Abdel-Aty (2007) for Interstate-4 in Orlando, FL to freeways in the Netherlands. INTRODUCTION Underground loop detectors are used to continuously collect real-time traffic information from highways (primarily uninterrupted flow facilities such as freeways) around the World. Data from these detectors are used for various ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) applications such as travel time estimation and incident detection. Recently, however, the focus has been shifting towards proactive applications of these data including the development of real-time crash risk assessment models. These models are developed based on analysis of traffic surveillance data observed prior to historical crashes. For example, Golob and Recker (2004) and Pande and Abdel-Aty (2006 a) related crash patterns to traffic c1ata from single loop detector stations in California and dual loop detector stations in Florida, respectively. These models can differentiate crash prone traffic conditions from non-crash (or 'normal') traffic conditions in real-time. They can potentially be used to issue warnings or implement traffic management strategies ahead in time for reducing measure(s) of crash risk and avoid an imminent crash. Despite the extensive analysis presented in these studies a critical issue that remains to be addressed is transferability of such an approach especially to locations with varying traffic surveillance systems. The archived freeway traffic data may vary in terms of collected traffic parameters, level of aggregation, and/or spacing of loop detectors. In this study we would explore a sample of crash as well as non-crash data from five freeways in the Utrecht region of the", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "8967978", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6602245"}

First, we introduce a novel Shape Model (SM) feature which captures the global structure and shape of the myocardium to produce a more accurate RF probability map.
