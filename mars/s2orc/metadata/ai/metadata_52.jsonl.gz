Some existing solutions try to learn each type of data one by one and analyze them separately without considering time information. In addition, the traditional methods also have to determine phone orientation because some sensors equipped in smartphone are orientation related. In this paper, we think that a combination of multiple sensors can represent an invariant feature for a crowdsensing context.

However, in many real-world applications, this assumption does not hold true. Hence, a realistic strategy, Cross Domain Adaptation (DA) or Transfer Learning (TA), can be used to employ previously labelled source domain data to boost the task in the new target domain. Previously, Cross Domain Adaptation methods have been focused on re-weighting the instances or aligning the cross-domain distributions. However, these methods have two significant challenges: (1) There is no proper consideration of the unlabelled data of target task as in the real-world, an abundant amount of unlabelled data is available, (2) The use of normal Euclidean distance function fails to capture the appropriate similarity or dissimilarity between samples. To deal with this issue, we have proposed a Semi-Supervised Metric Transfer Learning framework called SSMT that reduces the distribution between domains both statistically and geometrically by learning the instance weights, while a regularized distance metric is learned to minimize the within-class co-variance and maximize the between-class co-variance simultaneously for the target domain. Compared with the previous works where Mahalanobis distance metric and instance weights are learned by using the labelled data or in a pipelined framework that leads to a decrease in the performance, our proposed SSMT attempts to learn a regularized distance metric and instance weights by considering unlabelled data in a parallel framework. Experimental evaluation on three cross-domain visual data sets, e.g., PIE Face, Handwriting Digit Recognition on MNIST\u2013USPS and Object Recognition, demonstrates the effectiveness of our designed approach on facilitating the unlabelled target task learning, compared to current state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.knosys.2019.03.021", "venue": "Knowl.

Owing to the discriminative capability test for the random partition in each tree node's split process, a set of informative high-order local spatial patterns are derived, and new images are then encoded by counting the occurrences of such discriminative local spatial patterns.

Therefore, many of these diseases must be diagnosed at early stages of occurrence before they lead to a critical condition. Acoustic analysis can be used to identify voice disorders as a complementary technique with other traditional invasive methods, such as laryngoscopy. In this article, we followed an extensive study in the diagnosis of voice disorders using the statistical pattern recognition techniques. Finally, we proposed a combined scheme of feature reduction methods followed by pattern recognition methods to classify voice disorders. Six classifiers are used to evaluate feature vectors obtained by principal component analysis or linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as feature reduction methods. Furthermore, individual, forward, backward, and branch-and-bound methods are examined as feature selection methods. The performance of each combined scheme is evaluated in terms of the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The experimental results denote that LDA along with support vector machine (SVM) has the best performance, with a recognition rate of 94.26% and AUC of 97.94%.

In this paper, based on the computer vision technology, we proposed a new method for the classification of maize seeds, a method based on multi-scale feature fusion and extreme learning machine. First, we extract the multi-scale fusion feature of maize seeds. Second, based on extreme learning machine, we construct the classifier model of maize seed. Third, because of the window of image in the case of multi-scale detection has the problem of capturing the same object seed with many overlapping windows, we put forward a kind of window fusion algorithm to solve it. The simulation results show that: The method is able to identify the maize seeds accurately. Using this method the accuracy of classification of maize seeds can reached 97.66% and the error rate is less than 0.1%. Compared with the traditional methods, the method we proposed can improve the speed of detection and the accuracy of classification, and has no strict hardware requirements. Introduction Seeds are the most basic means of production in agricultural industry, it is the foundation of all agricultural production. Accurate and rapid identification of the seeds has great instructive significance in agricultural production. How to identify crop seed in a nondestructive, rapid way is an important part of the researches in this field. In recent years, with the rapid development of machine learning, many scholars at home and abroad have applied machine learning in the automatic detection of seed used in agricultural production [1]. When using machine vision to identify the seeds, in general, the first step is extracting the color [2] and shape feature of seed and others features, and then identify them through classifiers, such as Bayesian classifier, the BP neural network and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. For example: Shuqin Yang, etc, all of them applied BP neural network in the identification of maize varieties [3]. After analyzing the characters of grain shape and extracting the shape, size, color and other related structural features of corn grain. They used these features in classification and recognition conducted by the BP neural network, but the training time is too long and the accuracy is low. Hongyong Wang, etc, combined genetic algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) in recognizing maize seeds [4]. Using genetic algorithm to extract the corn seed's feature information , transfer it to training support vector machine (SVM) classifier, so as to identify maize varieties. Their comprehensive recognition rate is higher, but this method takes up much time and space to detect. In addition, Huang, etc[5], also used a spectral image characteristics method to study single seed identification, they have gained a high recognition accuracy in the corn seed testing set data. But studies [5][6] based on single feature recognition model can only identify a limited number of seed and require specialized hardware devices. The traditional seed identification methods has a slow detection speed and a long training time. Its 3rd International Conference on Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent Systems (ICMEIS 2015) \u00a9 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 391 identification accuracy is low and its high demand for hardware equipment are also a problems, so we proposes a multi-scale fusion feature extraction and seed identification method based on the extreme learning machine. This method can realize accurate identification of the corn seed. From the results of tests on the popular seed varieties such as the Aoyu311, Huayu986, Xinyu35, etc, we find that the test accuracy can reach 97.66% and the error is within 0.1%. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed method improved detecting speed, the training speed and identification precision and with no additional high demand of hardware equipment. The Corn Seed Recognition Framework Fig.1 Overall frame chart of the algorithm At first, we extract the HOG and multi-scale based HSV features of collected corn seeds. Second, use the extreme learning machine to train the collected feature information of corn seeds and generate classification model. Finally, we use the trained classifier to classify the features. We used a voting system to achieve final recognition results. In the last section of this article, we put forward a kind of local window fusion that based on fuzzy clustering algorithm to optimize our result. Multi-scale feature fusion The main idea is to calculate the distribution of gradient direction histogram of different scales. As shown in figure 2, after segmenting seminal image level-by-level, we divide each level into a few local areas, and then we use gradient direction histogram of blocks of each level to create a multi-scale gradient direction histogram in the order showed in Fig.2.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2991/icmeis-15.2015.72", "venue": "Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent Systems (ICMEIS 2015)", "journal": "Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent Systems (ICMEIS 2015)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1702543198", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1709511", "3045697", "63530624", "116858", "124914175", "62426710"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55746629"}

A particularly well-documented variety involves the pattern of errors made by \u201coptic aphasic\u201d patients, who have a selective deficit in naming visually presented objects. Based on our previous work in modeling impaired reading via meaning in deep dyslexia, we develop a connectionist simulation of visual object naming. The major extension in the present work is the incorporation of short-term correlational weights that bias the network towards reproducing patterns of activity that have occurred on recently preceding trials. Under damage, the network replicates the complex semantic and perseverative effects found in the optic aphasic error pattern. Further analysis reveals that the perseverative effects are strongest when the lesions are near or within semantics, and are relatively mild when the preceding object evokes no response. Like optic aphasics, the network produces predominantly semantic rather than visual errors because, in contrast to reading, there is some structure in the mapping from visual to semantic representations for objects. Viewed together with the dyslexia simulations, the replication of complex empirical phenomena concerning impaired visual comprehension based on a small set of general connectionist principles strongly suggests that these principles provide important insights into the nature of semantic processing of visual information and its breakdown following brain damage.", "year": 1993, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "23972122", "doi": "10.1162/jocn.1993.5.1.89", "venue": "Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience", "journal": "Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2092270458", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["4476059", "14161111", "25864779", "2983008", "118689350", "6383875", "11737656", "204329551", "140930411", "141346283", "141351707", "27447113", "30612394", "5892527", "209396626", "26077574", "10352032", "11146768", "32111907", "59924888", "59889341", "4281744", "21266990", "16710884", "144469286", "17575060", "4477654", "40884443", "1109069", "36853128", "43372378", "33833926", "32662189", "682951", "13552869", "149921887", "43759520", "15118845", "7745106", "142859812", "44451745", "142694502", "141194653", "1077843", "143537260", "31513196", "59796848", "146152365", "145239223", "145421167", "140855198", "30489549", "140747533", "40631023", "140373004", "140966434", "144032014", "15642520", "40204919", "140973606", "197660420", "34952198", "20854154", "144359103", "30339982", "25195155", "9312360", "4477940", "27464869", "12979634", "5552133", "60565534"], "inbound_citations": ["895052", "3334081", "14912843", "1447993", "28229346", "15376091", "14590283", "10890864", "16079640", "15572593", "7939521", "11454030", "14764361", "46499741", "212658104", "16763573", "13975886", "16904135", "9313010", "12557502", "108294694", "15355634", "524243", "7203408", "5771574", "14087428", "8088817", "14837491", "14666822", "14448198", "215423388", "8848297", "1571375"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16081349"}

However, little effort has been made to investigate how DNN-based image retrieval models are affected by such attacks. In this paper, we introduce Unsupervised Adversarial Attacks with Generative Adversarial Networks (UAA-GAN) to attack deep feature-based image retrieval systems. UAA-GAN is an unsupervised learning model that requires only a small amount of unlabeled data for training. Once trained, it produces query-specific perturbations for query images to form adversarial queries. The core idea is to ensure that the attached perturbation is barely perceptible to human yet effective in pushing the query away from its original position in the deep feature space. UAA-GAN works with various application scenarios that are based on deep features, including image retrieval, person Re-ID and face search. Empirical results show that UAA-GAN cripples retrieval performance without significant visual changes in the query images. UAA-GAN generated adversarial examples are less distinguishable because they tend to incorporate subtle perturbations in textured or salient areas of the images, such as key body parts of human, dominant structural patterns/textures or edges, rather than in visually insignificant areas (e.g., background and sky). Such tendency indicates that the model indeed learned how to toy with both image retrieval systems and human eyes.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1907.05793", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2958392555", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["604334", "6706414", "9059612", "2893830", "12387176", "11558223", "3350285", "5737015", "44220219", "207241700", "21949142", "22367645", "5225966", "786898", "206767722", "6426453", "18376539", "4591954", "206596594", "1033682", "11758569", "12803511", "211227", "4552226", "13058841", "2057420", "10894094", "206771128", "206594692", "11748195", "6447277", "64200748", "206592766", "3732882", "12203312", "6875974", "14991802", "2683207", "14599182", "2505895", "2930547"], "inbound_citations": ["207757912", "211506041"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196471230"}

More specifically, the modified DBSCAN model was applied to produce a number of sub-networks considering the spatial correlation of taxi pick-up events in the road network. And the CGAN model, fed with the historical taxi passenger demand and other conditional information, was capable to predict the taxi-passenger demands.

Adversarial training process was conducted to the two LSTMs. In the numerical experiment, different model layouts were compared. It was found that different network layouts provided reasonable accuracy. With limited training data, more LSTM layers in the generator network resulted in not only higher accuracy, but also more difficulties in training.

This study presents a methodology for prediction of landslide movements using random forests, a machine learning algorithm based on regression trees. The prediction method was established based on a time series consisting of 2 years of data on landslide movement, groundwater level and precipitation gathered from the Kostanjek landslide monitoring system and nearby meteorological stations in Zagreb (Croatia). Because of complex relations between precipitations and groundwater levels, the process of landslide movement prediction is divided into two separate models: (1) model for prediction of groundwater levels from precipitation data; and (2) model for prediction of landslide movements from groundwater level data. In a groundwater level prediction model, 75 parameters were used as predictors, calculated from precipitation and evapotranspiration data. In the landslide movement prediction model, 10 parameters calculated from groundwater level data were used as predictors. Model validation was performed through the prediction of groundwater levels and prediction of landslide movements for the periods from 10 to 90 days. The validation results show the capability of the model to predict the evolution of daily displacements, from predicted variations of groundwater levels, for the period up to 30 days. Practical contributions of the developed method include the possibility of automated predictions, updated and improved on daily basis, which would be an important source of information for decisions related to crisis management in the case of risky landslide movements.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-57777-7_35", "venue": "Landslide Dynamics: ISDR-ICL Landslide Interactive Teaching Tools", "journal": "Landslide Dynamics: ISDR-ICL Landslide Interactive Teaching Tools", "mag_id": "2787319609", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134798983"}

While the most useful information comes from visual features and speech recognition, a lot can also be inferred from the non-speech audio content, either alone or in conjunction with visual and speech cues. This paper studies MED with non-speech audio information only. MED is usually performed in two stages. The first stage generates a representation for each clip in the form of either a single vector or a sequence of vectors, often by aggregating frame-level features; the second stage performs binary or multi-class classification to decide whether each target event occurs in each clip. Common classifiers used for the second stage include support vector machines (SVMs), feed-forward deep neural networks (DNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this paper, we propose to classify clips for events using \"recurrent SVMs\". These models combine the kernel mapping and the large-margin optimization criterion of SVMs, and the ability to process sequences of variable lengths of RNNs.

Specifically, visual information on the Web pages is used to select appropriate atomic elements for extraction and also to distinguish attributes, and structured information from external Web databases is applied to assist the extraction process.

Non-technical losses (NTL) represent a significant proportion of electricity losses in both developing and developed countries.

This approach provides a method of data mining for this purpose and it involves extracting patterns of customer behaviour from historical kWh consumption data. The results yield classification classes that are used to reveal whether any significant behaviour that emerges are due to irregularities in consumption.

Our ensemble obtains a boosting of performance by combining local features, dense sampling features, and deep learning features.

The weighted covariance descriptor takes the following principles into consideration: past frames have less contribution for recognition and recent and informative frames such as key frames contribute more to the recognition. The online recognition is achieved using a simple nearest neighbor search against a set of offline trained action models. Experimental results on MSC-12 Kinect Gesture dataset and our newly constructed online action recognition dataset have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2018.08.003", "venue": "Inf.

Hyperspectral image classification is an active area to allocate distinct label to each pixel vector so that it is well defined by a given class. For classification of HSI, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is extensively used. To improve the classification accuracy, spectral-spatial preprocessing technique called Multi hypothesis (MH) prediction has been used prior to SVM classifier. This processed HSI will results in less intraclass inconsistency compared to original image and it gives robust classification in the existence of noise. Major contribution of this work is an improvement of classification accuracy and to achieve it, a post processing step after classification has been applied.

It is noticed that the result of several technique changes for software to software and no technique has always given a good result in various fields.Moreover, ensemble methods take the benefits of different individual prediction techniques and produce a better performance as compared to a single technique. Most of the works are available to classify the software system whether it is fault prone or non-fault prone but very few efforts are present for the prediction of faults using ensemble techniques. The main objective of a presented system is to find how many faults detected in software.

We have observed that in all data set Stacking Regression gives a better result among all selected top four machine learning techniques. The AAE, ARE, MSE, RMSE and accuracy provide better performance of the presented system.

TLS sensitivity to chert was investigated ::: by comparing laboratory-measured reflectance spectra to TLS intensity. It ::: is shown that the low-reflectance of chert can be exploited to distinguish ::: it from limestone. A method based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) ::: classifier was thus implemented to recognize chert semi-automatically on ::: TLS point clouds. ::: III) The Vispi Quarry (Maiolica Fm., Marne a Fucoidi Fm., Scaglia Bianca Fm.). In ::: this outcrop an almost continuous 200m-thick stratigraphic succession is ::: exposed spanning from the upper Maiolica Fm. to the Bonarelli level, and ::: representing ca. 20 Myrs.

Maximizing the differential prediction over specific data subsets is an interesting research problem with several real-world applications. This work represents the first attempt to address the multi-relational differential prediction problem. Our approaches are based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), which we use to learn differential rules. ::: We explore several differential methods for learning differential rules in a two-class two-strata system. First we propose the Model Filtering (MF) approach, which builds a rule model on the target stratum, and then selects rules that exhibit a differential performance on the other stratum. Second we propose the Differential Prediction Search (DPS) method, which alters the search space to consider both strata while scoring rules according to their differential prediction score. Unlike the first two automated methods, the third approach, Expert Driven (ED), builds a model on each dataset and lets an expert compare them and infer differential rules. ::: We compare these methods over a synthetic dataset, and over two important biomedical applications: modeling hexose-protein binding sites, and identifying age-specific breast cancer stage rules. In doing so, we devise the first glucose-binding classifier, empirically validate biochemical hexose-binding knowledge, report the first instance of differential predictive rules discovery, and infer new hexose-binding and breast-cancer dependencies. ::: Our results show that, for large and noisy data, which is what most real world applications are, DPS is more appropriate.

In this study, a smartphone-based hybrid system that fully automates the sperm morphological analysis is introduced with the aim of eliminating unwanted human factors. Proposed hybrid system consists of two progressive steps: automatic segmentation of possible sperm shapes and classification of normal/ab-normal sperms. In the segmentation step, clustering techniques with/without group sparsity approach were tested to extract region of interests from the images. Subsequently, a novel publicly available morphological sperm image data set, whose labels were identified by experts as non-sperm, normal and abnormal sperm, was created as the ground truths of classification step. In the classification step, conventional and ensemble machine learning methods were applied to domain-specific features that were extracted by using wavelet transform and descriptors. Additionally, as an alternative to conventional features, three deep neural network architectures, which can extract high-level features from raw images after using statistical learning, were employed to increase the proposed method's performance. The results show that, for the conventional features, the highest classification accuracies were achieved as 80.5% and 83.8% by using the wavelet- and descriptor-based features that were fed to the Support Vector Machines respectively.

Five dominant tree species were classified and identified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. We also examined the identification results of the dominant forest trees species obtained by using the up-scaling algorithm. The results showed that overall classification accuracy of tree species was significantly influenced by the spatial resolution of images. The highest accuracy at the 4 m resolution, and the accuracy decreased to a minimum as the resolution reduced to 30 m. The addition of texture information increased classification accuracy using multispectral imagery with resolutions from 1 to 8 m, and the overall accuracy of dominant tree species identification created after adding texture information was 2.0%-3.6% higher than that from results of spectral information alone in the study area. However, the improvement of accuracy did not appear to hold for medium resolution imagery (16 and 30 m spatial resolution). In addition, there was a significant difference between the multi-scale classification results provided by up-scaled images and that obtained from native remote-sensing images for each spatial scale.

The thesis cites current research on the topic of assault to generate a list of explanations victims use to describe their lack of reporting and compares the distributions with existing studies. We use a supervised learning technique to automatically categorize tweets into one of eight categories. This approach uses social sensing to determine why people do not report rather than surveys and interviews like current research. ::: The machine learning algorithms used to categorize the tweets as having a reason or not are Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Recurrent Neural Networks. Only Naive Bayes and Random Forest were used for categorizing the reasons because there was not enough data to train large numbers of parameters of RNN. Each algorithm produces relatively precise results for the binary classification and categorizing whether a tweet references shame, denial/minimization, fear of consequences, hopelessness/helplessness, drugs or drinking or disassociation, lack of information, protecting the assailant, or age as the reason they did not report. These algorithms and tweets can be used to label data in future studies. ::: Using the current research, natural language processing, and machine learning, we were able to determine a list of reasons mentioned on Twitter under the #WhyIDidntReport movement.

Traditional methods, e.g., principal component analysis (PCA) and locality preserving projection, usually neglect the information of within-class similarity and between-class dissimilarity, which is helpful to the improvement of classification. On the other hand, most of these methods, e.g., PCA and linear discriminative analysis, consider that the HSI data lie on a low-dimensional manifold or each class is on a submanifold. However, some class data of HSI may lie on a multimanifold. To avoid these problems, we propose a method for feature extraction in HSIs, assuming that a local region resides on a submainfold. In our method, we deal with the data region by region by taking into account the different discriminative locality information. Then, under the metric learning framework, a robust distance metric is learned. It aims to learn a subspace in which the samples in the same class are as near as possible while the samples in different classes are as far as possible.

We trained the Word2vec tool over two different corpus: Wikipedia and MedLine. Our main goal is to study the effectiveness of using word embeddings as features to improve performance on our baseline system, as well as to analyze whether the DINTO ontology could be a valuable complementary data source integrated in a machine learning NER system.

The drug repositioning problem essentially is a top-K recommendation task that recommends most likely diseases to drugs based on drug and disease related information. Therefore, many recommendation methods can be adopted to drug repositioning. Collaborative metric learning (CML) algorithm can produce distance metrics that capture the important relationships among objects, and has been applied successfully in recommendation domains. By applying CML in drug repositioning, a joint metric space is learned to encode not only drug preferences for different diseases but also the drug-drug and disease-disease similarity, and can uncover the underlying fine-grained preferences of drugs. In this study, we propose a novel drug repositioning computational method based on Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) to predict novel drug-disease associations based on known drug and disease related information. Specifically, the proposed method learns the latent features of drugs and diseases by applying metric learning, and then predicts the association probability of one drug-disease pair based on the learned features.

Several works exist that attempt to perform high-level face-related analysis tasks based on landmarks alone without the aid of face images. In contrast, in this work, an attempt is made to tackle the inverse problem of synthesizing faces from their respective landmarks. The primary aim of this work is to demonstrate that information preserved by landmarks (gender in particular) can be further accentuated by leveraging generative models to synthesize corresponding faces. Though the problem is particularly challenging due to its ill-posed nature, we believe that successful synthesis will enable several applications such as boosting performance of high-level face related tasks using landmark points and performing dataset augmentation. To this end, a novel face-synthesis method known as Gender Preserving Generative Adversarial Network (GP-GAN) that is guided by adversarial loss, perceptual loss and a gender preserving loss is presented.

Materials and Methods Forty-seven patients who had 60 coronary vessels with 30%\u201390% stenosis were included. Six anatomic CCTA descriptors (Agatston score, stenosis severity, mean plaque CT attenuation value, noncalcified and calcified plaque volumes, remodeling index) and a functional descriptor (CT-FFR) were measured.

Results Stenosis severity (40.8 \u00b1 15.7% vs 57.6 \u00b1 14.1%), noncalcified plaque volume (190 \u00b1 100 vs 254.8 \u00b1 133.3), and remodeling index (1.04 \u00b1 0.12 vs 1.11 \u00b1 0.13) were significantly higher in ischemia-related lesions than nonischemia-related lesions.

This investigation was carried out in the Adour-Garonne basin. Several key findings emerged from the use of a new modeling procedure called \u201cRandom Forests\u201d. Firstly, we established a typology of sites showing an upstream/downstream gradient structured by geographical descriptors and catchment hydromorphological features. Secondly, we found that the relationships between hydromorphology and the different spatial scales of land cover responded to a longitudinal gradient. Upstream, no noticeable difference was observed whatever the land cover pattern considered, whereas downstream, larger scales were strongly related to the hydromorphology. Thirdly, a specific land cover effect on each hydromorphological type was seen. Along the gradient, the contribution of the land cover variables structuring the hydromorphological types decreased and become homogeneous.

To alleviate these burdens and infer the terminal type precisely, a hierarchical approach integrating multiple non-linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers is proposed. The core idea is that the raw data processing and the training of classifiers are shifted to fog access points (F-APs), while the server in the cloud is only responsible for training task allocation and training data dissemination. Further, the training task allocation is formulated as an integer problem to minimize the total training time, which is solved by a branch and bound based method and a low complexity heuristic method.

Among the satellite-based earth observation systems, the Landsat and ASTER data are most suitable for mesoscale measurements of urban changes. Nevertheless, to date the difference in the capability of mapping built-up land between the two sensors is not clear. Therefore, this study compared the performances of the Landsat-7 ETM+ and ASTER sensors for built-up land mapping in the coastal areas of southeastern China. The comparison was implemented on three date-coincident image pairs and achieved by using three approaches, including per-band-based, index-based, and classification-based comparisons. The index used is the Index-based Built-up Index (IBI), while the classification algorithm employed is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results show that in the study areas, ETM+ and ASTER have an overall similar performance in built-up land mapping but also differ in several aspects. The IBI values determined from ASTER were consistently higher than from ETM+ by up to 45.54% according to percentage difference. The ASTER also estimates more built-up land area than ETM+ by 5.9\u20136.3% estimated with the IBI-based approach or 3.9\u20136.1% with the SVM classification.

Due to the forward scattering and block of radar signal, the water, bare soil, shadow, named low backscattering objects (LBOs), often present low backscattering intensity in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image.

Although some polarimetric features had been exploited to relieve the confusion phenomenon, the backscattering features are still found unstable when the system noise floor varies in the range direction. This paper will introduce a simple but effective scene classification method based on Bag of Words (BoW) model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to discriminate the LBOs, without relying on any polarimetric features. In the proposed approach, square windows are firstly opened around the LBOs adaptively to determine the scene images, and then the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) points are detected in training and test scenes. The several SIFT features detected are clustered using K-means to obtain certain cluster centers as the visual word lists and scene images are represented using word frequency. At last, the SVM is selected for training and predicting new scenes as some kind of LBOs.

A crucial step in the building of surrogate models is \ufb01nding a good sethyperparameters, which determine the behavior of the model. This is especially important when dealingwith sparse data, as the models are in that case more prone to over\ufb01tting. Cross-validation is often used tooptimize the hyperparameters of surrogate models, however it is computationally expensive and can stilllead to over\ufb01tting or other erratic model behavior. This pap er introduces a new auxiliary measure for theoptimization of the hyperparameters of surrogate models which, when used in conjunction with a cheapaccuracy measure, is fast and effective at avoiding unexplained model behavior. 1 Introduction In engineering design, many routine tasks such as design space exploration, sensitivity analysis or optimiza-tion can quickly become impractical due to the (relatively) high cost of computing a single design point.One way of speeding up the design process is by using surrogate models, also referred to as metamodelsor response surface models. Surrogate models are data-driven black box models, which accurately approx-imate the input-output behavior of the real simulator over the entire design space, using as little data aspossible. Examples of surrogate models are Arti\ufb01cial Neura l Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines(SVM), Kriging models and Radial Basis Function (RBF) models. Because they can be evaluated almostinstantaneously, they can replace, in a \ufb01rst design step, th e real simulator in order to quickly explore thedesign space.The quality of the surrogate model is in a great deal dependent on the hyperparameters that governits behavior. High quality models are not only able to accurately approximate the data samples that wereused to construct it, but also to accurately predict the values of unseen data points. Optimizing thesehyperparameters, however, is a non-trivial problem, sincethis requires an accurate estimation of the modelquality. Finding a good set of hyperparameters becomes even more dif\ufb01cult when dealing with sparsedata, as the models are more prone to over\ufb01tting in such cases , especially when high in-sample accuracy", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2613145988", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196080706"}

We present a medical imaging study for AD pattern recognition performed through the combined use of complex networks and machine learning techniques. Methods A set of 300 structural T1 brain scans, from subjects of the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, including AD patients, normal controls (NC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, were used. Our complex network description obtained by dividing brain scans into equal boxes can provide a convenient mathematical framework to model structural inter- and intra-subject brain similarities given in terms of Pearson\u2019s correlation. Network features were used to feed supervised learning algorithms in order to exploit this base of knowledge for accurately discriminating the three groups. In this study, we compare four different machine learning models: Random Forests, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks. We adopted a 5-fold cross-validation framework with a nested feature selection. Results Experimental results show that our brain connectivity model allows the extraction of complex network features able to distinguish healthy subjects respectively from illness and MCI subjects with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) greater than 0.90. Besides, we demonstrated that different supervised classification models permit a robust support to the early diagnosis of AD patients and a robust identification of brain regions significantly connected to the disease.

The proposed McGAN, which is composed of two discriminators and a generator, takes both original remote sensing image and the initial road network produced by existing road extraction methods as input. The first discriminator employs the original spectral information to instruct the reconstruction, and the other discriminator aims to refine the road network topology. Such a structure makes the generator capable of receiving both spectral and topological information of the road region, thus producing more complete road networks compared with the initial road network.

There is also a need to monitor biomass changes in the coastal Everglades due to continuing sea level rise. Previous research in biomass estimation of coastal marshes has focused on pixel-based parametric modeling methods. In this study, an object-based ensemble analysis approach was developed to map sawgrass biomass at multiple scales using Landsat data. Four machine learning regression algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were evaluated and compared to the commonly used Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method for both live and total sawgrass biomass estimation. A weighted combining scheme was developed to integrate predictions from comparable models for ensemble analysis. Nonparametric machine learning models had better performance than the parametric approach. ANN and SVM produced similar results in live biomass estimation with the correlation coefficient (r) larger than 0.9, while ANN achieved the best result for the total biomass estimation (r = 0.94). Sawgrass biomass maps were produced for two harvest seasons in 2014 and 2016 at three detail levels, which successfully revealed the spatial and temporal (seasonal and interannual) sawgrass biomass variations. Ensemble analysis of the ANN and SVM predictions of live sawgrass biomass not only made the estimation more reliable, but also generated an uncertainty map to identify the regions with a robust biomass prediction, as well as challenging areas for biomass quantification. It is concluded that the object-based ensemble analysis is a promising alternative to the commonly used pixel-based biomass modeling techniques.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2017.10.018", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2765260274", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211097326", "92026885", "132572608", "197519312", "215259892", "59603547", "198441691"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134035206"}

These experimental data and calculated values of thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency have been used to develop an ANN model. Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) learning algorithm were used to train the proposed ANN model. Six numbers of neurons were found with LM learning algorithm in the hidden layer as the optimal value on the basis of statistical error analysis. In the input layer, the time of experiments, mass flow rate, ambient temperature, mean temperature of air, absorber plate temperature and solar radiation intensity have been taken as input parameters; and energy efficiency and exergy efficiency have been taken as output parameters in the output layer. The 6-6-2 neural model has been obtained as the optimal model for prediction. Performance predictions using ANN were compared with the experimental data and a close agreement was observed.

This study aims at being one step towards the proposal of an intrusion detection system (IDS) that faces those attacks not previously seen (zero-day attacks), by studying the combination of clustering and neural visualization techniques. To do that, MObile VIsualization Connectionist Agent-Based IDS (MOVICAB-IDS), previously proposed as a hybrid intelligent IDS based on a visualization approach, is upgraded by adding clustering methods. One of the main drawbacks of MOVICAB-IDS was its dependence on human processing; it could not automatically raise an alarm to warn about attacks. Additionally, human users could fail to detect an intrusion even when visualized as an anomalous one. To overcome this limitation, present work proposes the application of clustering techniques to provide automatic response to MOVICAB-IDS to quickly abort intrusive actions while happening. To check the validity of the proposed clustering extension, it faces now an anomalous situation related to the Simple Network Management Protocol: a community search. This attack to get the community string (password guessing) is analysed by clustering and neural tools, individually and in conjunction.

The ability to visualize tissue in varied contrasts in the form of MR pulse sequences in a single scan provides valuable insights to physicians, as well as enabling automated systems performing downstream analysis. However, many issues like prohibitive scan time, image corruption, different acquisition protocols, or allergies to certain contrast materials may hinder the process of acquiring multiple sequences for a patient. This poses challenges to both physicians and automated systems since complementary information provided by the missing sequences is lost. In this paper, we propose a variant of generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of leveraging redundant information contained within multiple available sequences in order to generate one or more missing sequences for a patient scan.

During the simulated tasks, the participants wore an inertial measurement unit on the dorsum of their dominant (right) hand to capture their hand motion patterns. The pattern from each bench model task performed was preprocessed into a symbolic time series and labeled as expert (attending) or novice (resident). The labeled hand motion patterns were processed and used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm. The trained algorithm was then tested for discriminative/predictive power against unlabeled (blinded) hand motion patterns from tasks not used in the training. The Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity metric was also measured from each hand motion pattern, with an optimal threshold calculated to separately classify the patterns. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The LZ metric classified unlabeled (blinded) hand motion patterns into expert and novice groups with an accuracy of 70% (sensitivity 64%, specificity 80%). The SVM algorithm had an accuracy of 83% (sensitivity 86%, specificity 80%). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The results confirmed the hypothesis. The SVM algorithm increased the predictive power to classify blinded surgical hand motion patterns into expert versus novice groups.

State-of-the-art deformation transfer methods require either point-wise correspondences between source and target shapes, or pairs of deformed source and target shapes with corresponding deformations. However, in most cases, such correspondences are not available and cannot be reliably established using an automatic algorithm. Therefore, substantial user effort is needed to label the correspondences or to obtain and specify such shape sets. In this work, we propose a novel approach to automatic deformation transfer between two unpaired shape sets without correspondences. 3D deformation is represented in a high-dimensional space. To obtain a more compact and effective representation, two convolutional variational autoencoders are learned to encode source and target shapes to their latent spaces. We exploit a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to map deformed source shapes to deformed target shapes, both in the latent spaces, which ensures the obtained shapes from the mapping are indistinguishable from the target shapes. This is still an under-constrained problem, so we further utilize a reverse mapping from target shapes to source shapes and incorporate cycle consistency loss, i.e. applying both mappings should reverse to the input shape. This VAE-Cycle GAN (VC-GAN) architecture is used to build a reliable mapping between shape spaces. Finally, a similarity constraint is employed to ensure the mapping is consistent with visual similarity, achieved by learning a similarity neural network that takes the embedding vectors from the source and target latent spaces and predicts the light field distance between the corresponding shapes.

The conjunctive use model that coupled numerical simulation with nonlinear optimization is used to minimize shortages of water in meeting irrigation demands for four irrigation systems.

This paper proposes a two-layer Conditional Random Field model for simultaneous classification of land cover and land use. Both classification tasks are integrated into a unified graphical model, which is reasonable due to the fact that land cover and land use exhibit strong contextual dependencies. In the CRF, we distinguish a land cover layer and a land use layer . Both layers differ with respect to the entities corresponding to the nodes and the classes to be distinguished. In the land cover layer, the nodes correspond to superpixels extracted from the image data, whereas in the land use layer the nodes correspond to objects of a geospatial land use database. Statistical dependencies between land cover and land use are explicitly modelled as pair-wise potentials.

Methods: Various MRI scans were collected from patients with recurrent GBM. Each scan session collected post\u2010contrastT1(+C T1), T2, diffusion, perfusion, and multi\u2010echo hypoxia images. Thediffusion\u2010weighted images were converted to Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) maps. The perfusion images were corrected for leakage and represented as corrected rCBV maps. All of these scans were co\u2010registered to each other, giving an input matrix to our support vector machine consisting of roughly 13,000 voxels, each with 5 feature values (+C T1, T2, ADC, rCBVcorrected, delta T2*).

These labels were obtained using longitudinal data as well as clinical scans, and tested on new data to determine the accuracy of classifying tumor and cyst voxels. Results: The tumor model resulted in a specificity of 0.9841 and a sensitivity of 0.7498. The cyst model resulted in a specificity of 0.9825 anda sensitivity of 0.9414. Both models showed improvement with increasing features. Conclusions: These results show that the SVM is capable of classifying tumor and cyst voxels in a single case study. Aside from optimizing the current tumor model, future work will focus on the potential for the SVM to help in early detection of recurrence. In order to achieve this,we will need to test SVMs across patients.

We can now query cellular state at higher resolution, giving us better insight into complex diseases. For example, there are currently tens of thousands of cancer patients with simultaneous copy number, mutation, methylation, mRNA, miRNA and protein level profiles. Furthermore, cellular perturbations are increasingly characterized on the multi-omic level. These experiments uncover important dependencies among genes, their products and environmental conditions - relationships that accumulate in a growing number of databases. However, the integration of such prior pathway knowledge with new heterogeneous genomic measurements in an interpretable model remains a formidable challenge that is still not fully solved.My thesis presents three different approaches which incrementally address that problem. First, I present a feature engineering method (hVIPER) that infers kinase protein activity levels in a pathway-informed manner. Next, I develop one of the joint winners of the DREAM9 Gene Essentiality Prediction Challenge - a Multiple Kernel Learning algorithm with multi-omic pathway-derived kernel functions (MPL). Finally, I improve upon the DREAM9 winner by introducing empirical kernel functions computed through Random Forest tree ensembles (AKLIMATE). AKLIMATE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse phenotype learning tasks, including predicting microsatellite instability in endometrial and colorectal cancer, survival in breast cancer and shRNA knockdown response in CCLE cell lines.

The incidental prostatic carcinomas of the decade 1990\u201399 diagnosed at our department were reexamined. Besides acquisition of routine clinical and pathological data, the tumours were scored by immunohistochemistry for proliferative activity and p53\u2010overexpression. Tumour vascularization (angiogenesis) and epithelial texture were investigated by quantitative stereology. Learning vector quantization (LVQ) and support vector machines (SVM) were used for the purpose of prediction of tumour category from a set of 10 input variables (age, Gleason score, preoperative PSA value, immunohistochemical scores for proliferation and p53\u2010overexpression, 3 stereological parameters of angiogenesis, 2 stereological parameters of epithelial texture). In a stepwise logistic regression analysis with the tumour categories T1a and T1b as dependent variables, only the Gleason score and the volume fraction of epithelial cells proved to be significant as independent predictor variables of the tumour category. Using LVQ and SVM with the information from all 10 input variables, more than 80 of the cases could be correctly predicted as T1a or T1b category with specificity, sensitivity, negative and positive predictive value from 74\u201392%. Using only the two significant input variables Gleason score and epithelial volume fraction, the accuracy of prediction was not worse.

How to automatically recognize and analyze scenes from these satellite images effectively and efficiently has become a big challenge in the remote sensing field. Recently, a lot of work in scene classification has been proposed, focusing on deep neural networks, which learn hierarchical internal feature representations from image data sets and produce state-of-the-art performance. However, most methods, including the traditional shallow methods and deep neural networks, only concentrate on training a single model. Meanwhile, neural network ensembles have proved to be a powerful and practical tool for a number of different predictive tasks. Can we find a way to combine different deep neural networks effectively and efficiently for scene classification? In this paper, we propose a gradient boosting random convolutional network (GBRCN) framework for scene classification, which can effectively combine many deep neural networks. As far as we know, this is the first time that a deep ensemble framework has been proposed for scene classification. Moreover, in the experiments, the proposed method was applied to two challenging high-resolution data sets: 1) the UC Merced data set containing 21 different aerial scene categories with a submeter resolution and 2) a Sydney data set containing eight land-use categories with a 1.0-m spatial resolution. The proposed GBRCN framework outperformed the state-of-the-art methods with the UC Merced data set, including the traditional single convolutional network approach. For the Sydney data set, the proposed method again obtained the best accuracy, demonstrating that the proposed framework can provide more accurate classification results than the state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2015.2488681", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2291068538", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["206691461", "14457153", "993769", "21226824", "3177797", "9265597", "23544151", "2949497", "7625356", "4071727", "16821651", "12802977", "16864990", "15051824", "41365367", "2542741", "14542261", "195908774", "14289164", "10408361", "206592484", "110743331", "32107021", "314637", "3960646", "1241368", "7955044", "10707042", "2141952", "13904304", "14972102"], "inbound_citations": ["51775882", "15100295", "2206412", "3809717", "3839934", "38923308", "51965235", "195534227", "182304926", "46996572", "209925612", "208867872", "44148479", "49416821", "51867928", "210843071", "22975757", "174819202", "12917263", "3322282", "208175884", "211837843", "6510239", "181960847", "201308250", "96461955", "201686907", "59233891", "53229285", "20705436", "67872258", "207987901", "20351644", "209516498", "58007233", "125813330", "22513165", "195346157", "5565038", "172136699", "23642788", "19056963", "198464277", "208229839", "4029759", "125896773", "208037261", "204754584", "6950668", "52290573", "126008425", "132586570", "24017680", "211171532", "104293032", "64673948", "169037897", "202769113", "51965533", "29520077", "5195472", "52164997", "34882738", "211226982", "126044833", "1307414", "209048350", "46965995", "33731564", "15298934", "8349072", "208192343", "12537710", "207905202", "49333444", "209450832", "69274491", "203186479", "34724654", "117942794", "67870502", "195439306", "36231135", "3852282", "3046524", "209339783", "52124431", "9125483", "215447558", "24501682", "4809177", "204949442", "21726431", "208034543", "24266516", "5085777", "51884690", "4902232", "19989473", "20638644", "202945397", "208879074", "9443977", "22538752", "212656486", "126674845", "204205056", "208038437", "149728579", "182849029", "687557", "27798755", "212702949", "21702261", "195730303", "208036594", "59617226", "209457390", "52917103", "3592284", "46927956", "362920", "37089428", "678821", "182542276", "209202436", "208038758", "52149969", "202738905", "208041189", "23666975", "139104813", "65063612", "3682921", "203567139", "24984156", "4169619", "181328914", "13824546", "208035258", "201032419", "4054164", "54214383", "7258467", "157060099", "52903129", "198959726", "13611820", "4871425", "201876830", "4243939", "49414690", "58013755", "201646322", "53948857"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10397600"}

Another application of GANs is image-to-image translations, e.g. generating magnetic resonance (MR) images from computed tomography (CT) images, which can be used to obtain multimodal datasets from a single modality. Here, we evaluate two unsupervised GAN models (CycleGAN and UNIT) for image-to-image translation of T1- and T2-weighted MR images, by comparing generated synthetic MR images to ground truth images. We also evaluate two supervised models; a modification of CycleGAN and a pure generator model. A small perceptual study was also performed to evaluate how visually realistic the synthesized images are. It is shown that the implemented GAN models can synthesize visually realistic MR images (incorrectly labeled as real by a human). It is also shown that models producing more visually realistic synthetic images not necessarily have better quantitative error measurements, when compared to ground truth data.

It consists of two sub-problems: detection and classification. In the first step, a recognition algorithm is used to detect disturbance from power quality events.

In this paper, we proposed a method to recognize speech emotions adopting ANNs and to fuse two kinds of recognitions using different features at the decision level. Each emotional utterance is recognized by some individual recognizers firstly. Then the outputs of these recognizers were fused adopting the voting strategy. Furthermore, the dimensionality of supervectors constructed from spectral features is reduced through PCA. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed decision fusion is effective and the dimensionality reduction is feasible. Index Terms : speech emotion recognition, ANN, decision fusion 1. Introduction Speech is a dominant tool for communication, and it is also an important and effective approach for transmitting information and human emotions. With the increasing role of speech interfaces in human-machine interaction applications, speech emotion recognition becomes more and more important recently. Speech emotion recognition is an interesting and challenging speech technology, which can be applied to broad areas, such as environment of call center [1], treatment of mental and psychological diseases [2], development of education and entertainment software [3], and so on. Speech emotion recognition deals with how to make the computer automatically recognize various emotions in speech signal by extracting and analyzing some acoustic features. A key problem of speech emotion recognition is that which kinds of speech features can be used to represent human emotions. Some researchers have investigated the relations between features and emotions. With their efforts, many speech features were found to be used for emotion recognition. Statistical features based on prosody and voice quality have been widely used in speech emotion recognition and demonstrated considerable recognition success [4, 5]. Besides statistical features, spectral or cepstral features are another effective group for describing emotional states [6, 7]. Since these features all have played significant roles in speech emotion recognition, it is necessary to explore an effective way to complementarily fuse both two kinds of features to further enhance the performance of emotion recognition.Another key issue of speech emotion recognition is how to choose an effective method to classify speech emotions. So far, many pattern classification methods have been used for speech emotion recognition [6-9], such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and so on. These methods are all feasible, but their performances are different with each other seriously. The SVMs based method has been shown to be robust and performs well. But some fresh researches have indicated that ideal performance may be obtained using ANNs as well. However, it is difficult to determine which kind of ANNs is suitable for emotion recognition and it is necessary to compare its performance with the SVMs. In this paper, the ANN based decision fusion for speech emotion recognition was presented. Firstly four different ANNs were used to recognize various emotions. Then the voting scheme was adopted to fuse recognitions using two kinds of features at the decision level. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach improved the performance of ANN based recognition and its accuracy was comparable with SVM based method.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The features used for speech emotion recognition are introduced in Section 2. The principles of PCA and ANN are briefly described in Section 3 and Section 4 respectively. The proposed decision fusion is depicted in Section 5. In Section 6, experiments and discussions of experimental results are presented. In Section 7, conclusions are drawn and future works are suggested.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "INTERSPEECH", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "24729848", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10506530", "34701441", "73548", "9046374", "12427373", "60594797", "18789950", "64010177", "18322500"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26286824"}

If the selected best split of trees matched the desired accuracy the construction terminates. Otherwise a new tree is added with random forest and accuracy is measured. The fitting criteria of random forest are accuracy and correlation. The accuracy is based on the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the mean absolute relative error (MARE).In proposed system to refine the termination criteria of Random Forest, Binomial distribution, multinomial distribution and sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) are used. The proposed method stops the random forest earlier compared with existing Random Forest algorithm. The supervised learning model like support vector machine takes a set of inputs and analyze the inputs and recognize the desired patterns. The disease data sets are supplied to SVM and prediction accuracy is measured. The comparison is made between Random Forest and SVM and best class labels are identified based on disease.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.9790/0661-145104111", "venue": null, "journal": "IOSR Journal of Computer Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2314134451", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17327610", "389956", "207738357", "6644398", "206420153", "89141", "62145540", "6117989", "1380585", "6169784", "27747120", "17329907", "61206121", "14410913", "8342558", "16609273", "539863", "7708825"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55696469"}

Yet, this objective has been addressed mainly in short-lived model species. Thus, expanding knowledge to nonmodel species with contrasting life histories, such as forest trees, appears necessary. To uncover the genetic basis of adaptation to climate in the widely distributed boreal conifer white spruce (Picea glauca), an environmental association study was conducted using 11,085 single nucleotide polymorphisms representing 7,819 genes, that is, approximately a quarter of the transcriptome. ::: ::: Linear and quadratic regressions controlling for isolation-by-distance, and the Random Forest algorithm, identified several dozen genes putatively under selection, among which 43 showed strongest signals along temperature and precipitation gradients. Most of them were related to temperature. Small to moderate shifts in allele frequencies were observed. Genes involved encompassed a wide variety of functions and processes, some of them being likely important for plant survival under biotic and abiotic environmental stresses according to expression data. Literature mining and sequence comparison also highlighted conserved sequences and functions with angiosperm homologs. ::: ::: Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions that local adaptation involves genes with small frequency shifts when selection is recent and gene flow among populations is high. Accordingly, genetic adaptation to climate in P. glauca appears to be complex, involving many independent and interacting gene functions, biochemical pathways, and processes.

A bioclimate model predicting the presence or absence of P. leiophylla (lumped with its putative variety P. leiophylla var. chihuahuana ) was developed by using the Random Forests classification tree on Mexican and Unites States of America forest inventory data.

Projecting the 1961-1990 climate niche into future climates provided by three general circulation models and two greenhouse-effect gas emission scenarios, suggested that the area occupied by the niche should diminish rapidly over the course of the century: a decrease of 35 % by the decade surrounding 2030, 50 % for 2060, and 76 % for 2090. The most serious habitat reduction occurs at both latitudinal extremes of the species distribution: Chiricagua Mountains, Arizona, Unites States of America in the northern extreme, and at Oaxaca State, Mexico, in the southernmost extreme.

A significant challenge is that the rates of increase and decrease differ substantially across subjects. Moreover, the actual absolute differences of intensity values carry little information, with their relative order being more important. To solve the intensity prediction problem we propose a new dynamic ranking model that models the signal intensity at each time as a label on an ordinal scale and links the temporally proximal labels using dynamic smoothness constraints. This new model extends the successful static ordinal regression to a structured (dynamic) setting by using an analogy with Conditional Random Field (CRF) models in structured classification. We show that, although non-convex, the new model can be accurately learned using efficient gradient search. The predictions resulting from this dynamic ranking model show significant improvements over the regular CRFs, which fail to consider ordinal relationships between predicted labels. We also observe substantial improvements over static ranking models that do not exploit temporal dependencies of ordinal predictions.

For this reason, much recent research in k-NN methods has focused on metric learning, i.e. finding an optimized metric. In this paper we propose a simple gradient-based algorithm for metric learning. We discuss in detail the motivations behind metric learning, i.e. error minimization and margin maximization. Our formulation differs from the prevalent techniques in metric learning, where the goal is to maximize the classifier\u2019s margin. Instead our proposed technique (MEGM) finds an optimal metric by directly minimizing the mean square error. Our technique not only results in greatly improved k-NN performance, but also performs better than competing metric learning techniques.

MRI is one of the commonly used medical imaging techniques. The data collected by MRI scanner for image reconstruction is called the k-space data. For reconstructing an image from k-space data, there are various algorithms such as Homodyne algorithm, Zero Filling method, Dictionary Learning, and Projections onto Convex Set method. All the characteristics of k-space data and MRI data collection technique are reviewed in detail. The algorithms used for image reconstruction discussed in detail along with their pros and cons. Various modern magnetic resonance imaging techniques like functional MRI, diffusion MRI have also been introduced. The concepts of classical techniques like Expectation Maximization, Sensitive Encoding, Level Set Method, and the recent techniques such as Alternating Minimization, Signal Modeling, and Sphere Shaped Support Vector Machine are also reviewed. It is observed that most of these techniques enhance the gradient encoding and reduce the scanning time.

It considers learner variables (e.g., time of L2 learning and proficiency) and input variables (word types and bilingual distance) to assess determinants of bilingual lexical acquisition. It examines the time course of acquisition, the emergence of structured lexical representations in L1 and L2, and the effect of learning history on learning plasticity. The model attempts to account for important processes such as competition, the extent to which the two lexicons compete for resources in the lexical space over time; entrenchment, the extent to which lexical structures are consolidated in L1 affects the learning of L2, and vice versa; and plasticity, the extent to which structural consolidation of L1 impacts the learning of L2. In the final talk Michael Thomas will review the recent application of connectionist models of language processing to bilingualism. Connectionist models have frequently appealed to two different architectures, localist interactive activation models and distributed processing models. These architectures have been used to explore different phenomena within bilingual language processing, including localist models of visual and auditory word recognition and distributed models of lexical and syntactic acquisition. Recent approaches employing self-organization attempt to bridge the two types of model. The range of existing models of monolingual language processing suggest clear avenues for future bilingual research to pursue, in particular focusing on dynamic aspects of (1) bilingual acquisition, (2) gradual changes in language dominance, (3) real-time switching between languages, (4) bilingual aphasia and recovery, and (5) language decay. Finally, Thomas will conclude with his recent modeling work exploring critical periods and their implications for second language acquisition. Ping Li will give an introduction and overview of the symposium at the beginning, and Yasuhiro Shirai will provide an integrative discussion at the end. Introduction Computational modeling and bilingualism have had until recently only limited interactions (see reviews in French & Jacquet, 2004; Hernandez, Li, & MacWhinney, 2005; Li & Farkas, 2002; Thomas & van Heuven, 2005). Bilingualism has been the norm rather than the exception in our globalized world, but the acquisition of two languages entails significant complexity that challenges empirical methodology. Computational modeling, because of its flexibility in parameter variation and hypothesis testing, is ideally suited for identifying mechanisms underlying bilingual language acquisition and representation. In this symposium, we propose to integrate current computational studies of bilingualism and second language acquisition. Summary of Presentations Robert French will begin by reviewing the state of the art in the study of bilingual lexical memory, pointing out crucial issues in the field. He will then present the BSRN, a bilingual simple recurrent network model. The model learns both English and French NVN strings, intermixed at the sentence level for the two languages. The simulations show that BSRN can develop distinct representations not only for individual lexical categories in each language (as in Elman, 1990), but also for the two languages in general. Thus, the model can display distinct behaviors for the bilingual\u2019s two lexicons without invoking separate mechanisms for each language, providing evidence to the idea of \u201csingle mechanism, variable representations\u201d from bilingualism. In the second talk Curt Burgess will present the bilingual HAL model. Using language co-occurrences to model language or memory raises a number of controversial issues on the nature of lexical and semantic representations. In addition, using lexical co-occurrence to model bilingualism introduces crucial theoretical considerations since it is incumbent on the model to account for the transformation of the different lexical codes of multiple languages into similar semantic representations. On the surface this may seem straightforward. However, since co-occurrence models function (at some point in the encoding process) by counting the number of co-occurrences between specific lexical items, one has to provide an account of how the co- occurrence vectors for L1 can merge or co-exist with the vectors for L2. Burgess will discuss this memory consolidation process, a step that is not required in high- dimensional models that encodes only one language. In the third talk Ping Li will present a self-organizing neural network model that simulates developmental stages of the bilingual lexicon. The model is based on DevLex, a References French, R., & Jacquet, M. (2004). Understanding bilingual memory: models and data. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Hernandez, A., Li, P., & MacWhinney, B.

In this study a novel machine learning algorithm, Geographically-Weighted Gradient Boosting Machine (GW-GBM), was developed by improving GBM through building spatial smoothing kernels to weigh the loss function. This modification addressed the spatial nonstationarity of the relationships between PM2.5 concentrations and predictor variables such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological conditions. GW-GBM also overcame the estimation bias of PM2.5 concentrations due to missing AOD retrievals, and thus potentially improved subsequent exposure analyses. GW-GBM showed good performance in predicting daily PM2.5 concentrations (R2 = 0.76, RMSE = 23.0 \u03bcg/m3) even with partially missing AOD data, which was better than the original GBM model (R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 25.3 \u03bcg/m3). On the basis of the continuous spatiotemporal prediction of PM2.5 concentrations, it was predicted that 95% of the population lived in areas where the estimated annual mean PM2.5 concentration was higher than 35 \u03bcg/m3, and 45% of the population was exposed to PM2.5 >75 \u03bcg/m3 for over 100 days in 2014.

One important problem here is concept drift, where global data patterns (movement, preferences, activities, etc.) change according to the actual set of participating users, the weather, the time of day, or as a result of events such as accidents or even natural catastrophes. In an important case \u2014 when the network is very large but only a few training samples can be obtained at each node locally \u2014 no efficient distributed solution is known that could follow concept drift efficiently. This case is characteristic of smart device platforms where each device stores only one local observation or data record related to a learning problem. Here we present two algorithms to handle concept drift. None of the algorithms collects data to a central location, instead models of the data perform random walks in the network, while being improved using an online learning algorithm. The first algorithm achieves adaptivity by maintaining young as well as old models in the network according to a fixed age distribution.

We demonstrate through a thorough experimental analysis that our algorithms outperform the known competing methods if the number of independent local samples is limited relative to the speed of drift: a typical scenario in our targeted application domains.

In the design of control systems the use of theoretical models for the simulation of engine behaviour proved to be very useful, and it is apparent from the literature. However, since automotive engines have become very complex plants, their modelling requires a comprehensive description of the behaviour of many processes and components. Combustion process has a strong influence on performance and emissions, but its theoretical description can be hardly combined with the requirements of control-oriented models (especially as regards \u201creal-time\u201d applications). Two simplified theoretical models are proposed in the paper, based on a thermodynamic and a simplified approach respectively. In the first case a single-zone method was followed with the introduction of an apparent heat release rate (HRR) described as a superposition of two Wiebe functions. Coefficients of these burning functions are estimated by means of Learning Machines (LM), i.e. Support Vector Machines (SVM), trained from experimental data and then embedded in a Simulink\u00ae block. In order to make calculation time shorter, a simpler and faster model based on the application of SVM was defined to describe combustion process. Starting from experimental data, the proposed SVM was trained and implemented in a Simulink\u00ae block to evaluate exhaust gas temperature and bmep directly from engine operating parameters. Both blocks were defined to be easily embedded in engine simulation models for control-oriented applications. Results were promising for both models, showing very short computation time.

To date, predictive biomarkers of this incomplete immune reconstitution have not been established. We aimed to identify a baseline metabolomic signature associated with a poor immunological recovery after antiretroviral therapy (ART) to envisage the underlying mechanistic pathways that influence the treatment response. ::: ::: ::: DESIGN ::: This was a multicentre, prospective cohort study in ART-naive and a pre-ART low nadir (<200 cells/\u03bcl) HIV-infected patients (n = 64). ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We obtained clinical data and metabolomic profiles for each individual, in which low molecular weight metabolites, lipids and lipoproteins (including particle concentrations and sizes) were measured by NMR spectroscopy. Immunological recovery was defined as reaching CD4 T-cell count at least 250 cells/\u03bcl after 36 months of virologically successful ART. We used univariate comparisons, Random Forest test and receiver-operating characteristic curves to identify and evaluate the predictive factors of immunological recovery after treatment. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: HIV-infected patients with a baseline metabolic pattern characterized by high levels of large high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, HDL cholesterol and larger sizes of low density lipoprotein particles had a better immunological recovery after treatment. Conversely, patients with high ratios of non-HDL lipoprotein particles did not experience this full recovery. Medium very-low-density lipoprotein particles and glucose increased the classification power of the multivariate model despite not showing any significant differences between the two groups. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: In HIV-infected patients, a baseline healthier metabolomic profile is related to a better response to ART where the lipoprotein profile, mainly large HDL particles, may play a key role.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5844590", "pubmed_id": "29280761", "doi": "10.1097/QAD.0000000000001730", "venue": null, "journal": "AIDS", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2981119497,2776196691", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2875983", "206897654", "205576218", "23564742", "21823990", "1842948", "25756962", "56755110", "35288750", "2681324", "206528925", "6791408", "33012222", "9940553", "16796527", "205995825", "15898428", "22348664", "46295885", "25519434", "3756335", "78119287", "16315677", "20975013", "2187140", "34715839", "21084031", "9029143"], "inbound_citations": ["204456573", "215487712", "202722176"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3694327"}

One of the design issues in SVM classifier is reducing the number of support vectors without compromising the classification accuracy. In this paper, a novel technique which requires only a subset of the support vectors is proposed. The subset is obtained by including only those support vectors for which Lagrange multiplier is greater than a threshold. In order to find the subset which yields the highest classification accuracy with the least number of support vectors in the subset, the recognition performance corresponding to subsets with different threshold values are to be evaluated and compared. The proposed technique is applied for SVM based isolated digit recognition system and is studied using speaker dependent as well as multispeaker dependent TI46 database of isolated digits. Two feature extraction techniques, one using LPC and another using MFCC are applied to the speech from the above database and the features are mapped using SOFM. This in turn is used by the SVM classifier to evaluate the recognition accuracy. The proposed technique is applied to One-Against-All (OAA) scheme and is denoted as Modified One-Against-All (M-OAA) approach in this paper. Based on this study, it is found that for MFCC feature input, the proposed M-OAA based SVM classifier approach results in reduction of support vectors by a factor of 1.86 to 18.3 with no compromise in recognition accuracy. For LPC feature input, the M-OAA based SVM classifier results in reduction of support vectors by a factor of 1.59 to 2.52 without any compromise in recognition accuracy for some cases and with a maximum of 1% degradation in recognition accuracy for some cases.

This work evaluates algorithms for spatial interpolation of evapotranspiration data in terms of precision and performance. It compares conventional strategies as the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and Ordinary Kriging (OK), and machine learning strategies, represented by the Random Forest (RF) and a Random Forest variation for spatial predictions (RFsp). The evaluation uses data of evapotranspiration from automatic meteorological stations located in the northeast region of Brazil, in January 2017. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to compare the precision of each interpolation algorithm. The results showed that RF obtained better results for the estimation of the reference evapotranspiration than conventional approaches, coming to reduce to roughly half the error obtained. Despite to resolve blocky artifacts present in RF spatial distribution, RFsp did not present better results than RF, obtaining a very similar performance to IDW and OK.

To prevent CVD, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) imaging, a noninvasive ultrasonography method, has proven to be clinically valuable in identifying at-risk persons before adverse events. Researchers are developing systems to automate CIMT video interpretation based on deep learning, but such efforts are impeded by the lack of large annotated CIMT video datasets. CIMT video annotation is not only tedious, laborious, and time consuming, but also demanding of costly, specialty-oriented knowledge and skills, which are not easily accessible. To dramatically reduce the cost of CIMT video annotation, this paper makes three main contributions. Our first contribution is a new concept, called Annotation Unit (AU), which simplifies the entire CIMT video annotation process down to six simple mouse clicks. Our second contribution is a new algorithm, called AFT (active fine-tuning), which naturally integrates active learning and transfer learning (fine-tuning) into a single framework. AFT starts directly with a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), focuses on selecting the most informative and representative AU s from the unannotated pool for annotation, and then fine-tunes the CNN by incorporating newly annotated AU s in each iteration to enhance the CNN\u2019s performance gradually. Our third contribution is a systematic evaluation, which shows that, in comparison with the state-of-the-art method (Tajbakhsh et al., IEEE Trans Med Imaging 35(5):1299\u20131312, 2016), our method can cut the annotation cost by >81% relative to their training from scratch and >50% relative to their random selection.

In order to address the issue that medical images would suffer from severe blurring caused by lack of high-frequency details, this paper develops a novel image super-resolution(SR) algorithm called SR-DBAN via dense neural network and blended attention mechanism. Specifically, a novel blended attention block is proposed and introduced to dense neural network(DenseNet), so that the neural network can concentrate more attention to the regions and channels with sufficient high-frequency details adaptively. In the framework of SR-DBAN, batch normalization layers in the original DenseNet are removed to avoid loss of high-frequency texture details, final HR images are obtained by deconvolution at the very end of the network. Furthermore, inspired by the impressive performance of generative adversarial network, this paper develops a novel image SR algorithm called SR-DBAGAN via dense blended attention generative adversarial network. SR-DBAGAN consists a generator and a discriminator, the generator uses our proposed SR-DBAN to generate HR images and try to fool the discriminator while the discriminator is designed based on Wasserstein GAN(WGAN) to discriminate. We deployed our algorithms on blurry prostate MRI images, and experimental results showed that our proposed algorithms have generated considerable sharpness and texture details and have a significant improvement on the peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR) and structural similarity index(SSIM), respectively, compared with mainstream interpolation-based and deep learning-based image SR algorithms, which fully proves the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed algorithms.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1906.06575", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2951510769", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["24247500", "51626013", "206750461", "52896889", "52963261", "14504837", "39626557", "14083444", "1148534", "8187730", "6593498", "9971732", "7037846", "13271756", "206594692", "211227", "6145845", "1543021", "3446654", "206596371", "206597034", "60565534", "5273326", "125522540", "6252984", "6628106", "894721", "207761262", "6540453"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:189928363"}

One of the most evident changes is urbanization and an accompanying loss of agricultural lands and open spaces. These rapid changes pose enormous challenges for local populations as well as planning authorities. Accurate and timely data on changes in built-up urban environments are essential for supporting sound urban development. In this study, we applied the Support Vector Machine classification (SVM) to multi-temporal stacks of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images from 1993 to 2010 to quantify changes in built-up areas.

For example, the special subclass of problems with convex quadratic objective function plays a fundamental role in the training of Support Vector Machine, which is a technique for machine learning problems. For this particular subclass of convex quadratic problem, some convergent decomposition methods, based on the solution of a sequence of smaller subproblems, have been proposed. In this paper we define a new globally convergent decomposition algorithm that differs from the previous methods in the rule for the choice of the subproblem variables and in the presence of a proximal point modification in the objective function of the subproblems. In particular, the new rule for sequentially selecting the subproblems appears to be suited to tackle large scale problems, while the introduction of the proximal point term allows us to ensure the global convergence of the algorithm for the general case of nonconvex objective function.

Previous work based on a simulation model with ground-level measured reflectance data of pine ( Pinus sylvestris L .), spruce ( Picea abies ( L .) H. Karst .), and birch ( Betula pubescens Ehrh . and Betula pendula Roth ) tree species and idealized Leica ADS80 sensitivities suggested that the addition of a fifth sensitivity band in the red edge wavelength region to the existing Leica ADS80 system significantly improves the classification performance. In this paper, we extend this analysis using a simulated model with accurate spectral sensitivity information and airborne AisaEAGLE II hyperspectral data for these three tree species. We simulated multispectral responses using spectral sensitivity characteristics of the Leica ADS40, the Vexcel UltraCam-D, the Intergraph-Z/I Digital mapping camera and the Leica ADS40 system with an added band in the 691\u2013785 nm region. We evaluated the tree species classification performance of these simulated responses using Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The classification experiment result showed that the simulated responses of the 5-band multispectral system yielded the most robust classification performance with approximately 98% accuracy. This result was similar to the accuracy obtained with the hyperspectral data. Although differences were observed in the sensitivity functions of the 4-band systems, there were no large differences observed in the classification performances between them. With the simulated 5-band system, there was an increase of 5\u201313% points in classification accuracy when compared to the accuracies of the 4-band systems.

It is difficult to use existing computational method to predict miRNA-binding residues in proteins due to the lack of training examples. To address this issue, unlabeled data may be exploited to help construct a computational model. Semisupervised learning deals with methods for exploiting unlabeled data in addition to labeled data automatically to improve learning performance, where no human intervention is assumed. In addition, miRNA-binding proteins almost always contain a much smaller number of binding than nonbinding residues, and cost-sensitive learning has been deemed as a good solution to the class imbalance problem. In this work, a novel model is proposed for recognizing miRNA-binding residues in proteins from sequences using a cost-sensitive extension of Laplacian support vector machines (CS-LapSVM) with a hybrid feature. The hybrid feature consists of evolutionary information of the amino acid sequence (position-specific scoring matrices), the conservation information about three biochemical properties (HKM) and mutual interaction propensities in protein-miRNA complex structures. The CS-LapSVM receives good performance with an F1 score of $(26.23 \\pm 2.55\\%)$ and an AUC value of $(0.805 \\pm 0.020)$ superior to existing approaches for the recognition of RNA-binding residues.

There has been some research on exploring the spatio-temporal information of BS in different fields. However, these works lack re-usability, which require the new researcher to re-do the work of representing the spatio-temporal information. To solve this problem, we propose a neural network model based on autoencoder and representation learning called BSENet to learn embedding of BS based on raw data. The embedding contains spatio-temporal information of BS. In this way, other fields that are related to BS can make use of spatio-temporal information with BSENet embeddings. Besides the spatial information, BSENet can maintain the independence of BS. Moreover, we use bi-directional LSTM to get temporal information and propose a time dropout method to improve the generalization ability. We propose a soft threshold to consider all spatial relations. In addition, we introduce weight to enhance compatibility. We treat the missing states as the inputs to deal with the missing values. The results of clustering show that BSENet embedding is better than other embeddings. In experiments of mobile traffic prediction, BSENet embedding helps a temporal model to improve the Mean Squared Error (MSE) from 0.01463 to 0.01334, which is similar to 0.01302 of a spatio-temporal model.

Felled trees were searched for hollows and secondary evidence of use by fauna. Classification Trees and Bayesian logistic regression modelling were used to examine the site and tree attributes that best explained the use of a tree by fauna. We did two separate analyses: one using attributes expected to be causally related to hollow use, and a second using attributes that might be correlated with hollow use and could be easily assessed in standing trees. In all, 28% of hollow-bearing trees examined showed evidence of use, which is at the lower end of the scale found in other areas of Australia. The variables most strongly related to the use of a tree were hollow abundance, tree size and senescence. Random Forest modelling indicated that the likelihood of a hollow being used increased with hollow size, particularly hollow depth. Counting the number of hollows in standing trees was the best way to identify a tree that is likely to be used by fauna and this was particularly important for younger and healthier trees.

{"paper_id": "52230596", "title": "The Emergence of Mind: Personal Knowledge and Connectionism", "authors": [{"first": "Jean", "middle": [], "last": "Bocharova", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "At the end of Personal Knowledge, Polanyi discusses human development, arguing for a view of the human person as emerging out of but not constituted by its material substrate. As part of this view, he argues that the human person can never be likened to a computer, an inference machine, or a neural model because all are based in formalized processes of automation, processes that cannot account for the contribution of unformalizable, tacit knowing. This paper revisits Polanyi\u2019s discussion of the emergence of consciousness and his rejection of neural models in light of recent developments in connectionism. Connectionist neural modeling proposes an emergentist account of brain structure and, in many ways, is compatible with Polanyi\u2019s philosophy, even if it ultimately neglects questions of meaning. In his discussion of evolution in \u201cThe Rise of Man\u201d at the end of Personal Knowledge, Polanyi touches on the emergent properties of human development. He argues in this section that the movement from embryo to fully developed human person cannot be explained either as mere preprogrammed maturation or as the result of an \u201cexternal creative agency\u201d (395). Rather, human development involves something he calls the \u201cintensification of individuality\u201d (395). According to this view, stages of development\u2014new achievements of a developing human person\u2014arise in a manner similar to the emergence of new scientific discoveries: both processes require the crossing of a \u201cgap,\u201d a heuristic gap in the case of the scientist or an ontological gap in the case of the human person. Just as the scientist strives toward a truth that can only be intimated, so too does the infant passionately strive toward an achievement yet to be realized but intimated as possible. The result of such striving is the emergence of personhood, achieved most fully when a child enters into the \u201ctraditional noosphere,\u201d his or her culture\u2019s \u201clasting articulate framework of thought\u201d (388). For Polanyi, this intensification of individuality at the level of human development is consistent with his view that higher-order structures and characteristics of the human mind are not predetermined in the material substrate of biology but emerge indeterminately as a result of an individual\u2019s personal commitment (395-397). In this way, his view of the emergence of human consciousness is part of his larger refutation of a Laplacean conception of the universe as reducible to the laws of physics and chemistry. Related to Polanyi\u2019s discussion at the end of PK, the concept of emergence has recently begun to gain prominence among cognitive neuroscientists who model brain function using connectionism. Connectionist models of brain architecture assume that higher-order cognitive functions can only be understood globally in terms of patterns of activity distributed over multiple connections in the brain. In this sense, and for readers familiar with Juarrero\u2019s work, it could almost be called a dynamical systems approach to human cognition (e.g., McClelland et al. 2010). Connectionism stands in opposition to \u201cgrandmother cell\u201d theories that try to locate thoughts in specific neurons or groups of neurons; representational nativists (e.g., Pinker and Chomsky) who argue that humans are born with significant domain-specific knowledge located in specialized, predetermined modules in the brain; probabilistic models of cognition, which adTradition & Discovery: The Polanyi Society Periodical, 41:3 21 vocate a top-down modeling approach to study cognitive processes; and other computational theories of mind (e.g., Fodor and Pylyshyn) which argue that the brain operates like a digital computer. In contrast to these other theories and approaches, connectionists argue that the complex brain architecture of an adult is emergent from simpler neural structures (Rumelhart 1987; McClelland et al. 2010, 348; McClelland 2011, 134). These structures, rather than being pre-programmed to mature a certain way or to specialize for pre-determined functions, acquire their abilities by encountering inputs in their environment (McClelland 2010, 753). As a revision of the brain-as-computer metaphor, connectionism informs many of the most prominent contemporary discussions about the mind-body relation. It provides a foundation for neurophilosophy, eliminative materialism, embodied cognition, dynamic core theory, and work in artificial intelligence.1 Because connectionism is so fruitful in the cognitive sciences, it is worth considering how it might agree with or depart from Polanyi\u2019s understanding of emergence, especially as it relates to his larger arguments about human development and the relationship between mind and body. Below I explain how many of Polanyi\u2019s objections to the neural model in PK do not apply to current neural models based on connectionist assumptions. Connectionism, which favors pattern recognition rather than logic as a descriptor of cognitive processing, agrees with many of Polanyi\u2019s points about the nature of tacit knowing. Despite such agreement, however, there remains a divergence regarding the status of the human person as an active center. Connectionism: An Overview Connectionism traces its origins to the 1940\u2019s with the McCulloch and Pitts neural model, but it is generally understood to have begun to take its current form in the 1980\u2019s as a result of studies in artificial intelligence (McCleod et al. 1998, 314). It was at this time that David Rumelhart, James McClelland, Geoff Hinton and others developed computer models of brain function that operated through parallel distributed processing (PDP). PDP involves many small \u201cneuron-like\u201d units operating simultaneously over a multilayered network.2 In these networks, information is not carried in whole chunks (such as binary units of 1 or 0). Instead, it is conveyed as a pattern of activity among many units. For example, whereas a localist or symbolic representational system might assign a whole concept, such as \u201cdog,\u201d to a single neuron, a small group of neurons, or a single unit in a computer network, distributed systems do not represent or store such a concept in any single place. Rather, a representation of \u201cdog\u201d would arise from a pattern of activity among many different units, units which are also used to represent other concepts, like cats or coyotes (Elman et al. 1999, 90-91). This pattern of activity is generated and stored as a potential in the weights between connections in the network. These weights reflect the probability that a unit will activate given various levels of input (McClelland 2000, 583). Thus, connectionism treats the human brain primarily as an information processor. But unlike other brain-as-computer theories, connectionism rejects the notion that the brain operates through symbolic processing, with preprogrammed and sequential steps, local storage of memory, and discrete packets of information. Instead, they propose that it is more likely that the brain operates through weighted connections that store and generate information over a distributed network, with units operating in parallel and with larger systems emerging from simpler architectures (Elman et al. 1999, 50-56).3 Since the 1980s, parallel distributed processing models of cognitive function have shown that significant cognitive tasks, such as learning the meaning of words and identifying similarities and differences between objects, can be performed by multiple simple units working in parallel in layered networks (Rumelhart and Todd 1993, 14-15; Elman 1990, 200). Much current work in connectionism focuses on modeling human learning and development, and researchers in the field have built computer models that mimic how humans acquire and perform higher-order cognitive tasks such as learning how to pronounce", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5840/traddisc2014/201541324", "venue": "Tradition and Discovery: The Polanyi Society Periodical", "journal": "Tradition and Discovery: The Polanyi Society Periodical", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2307220303", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["54119278", "18470979", "144825248", "144135100", "143415106", "143166578", "63690192", "2763403", "2105042", "143637046", "14969150", "38623065", "143163374", "191398794", "6144184", "208625228", "60496409", "557347", "17126604", "170091790", "60905565", "27428025"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52230596"}

Additionally, defining a structuring element is no longer needed in the proposed method and the dilation is adaptive to the topology of the dot patterns. We assessed the property of object structure preservation by using common measurement metrics. We also demonstrated such property through handwritten digit classification using HOG descriptors extracted from dilated images of different approaches and trained using Support Vector Machines. The confusion matrix shows that our algorithm has the best accuracy estimate in 80% of the cases. In both experiments, our approach shows a consistent improved performance over other methods which advocates for the suitability of the proposed method.

In the evaluation of our approach, it is shown that DDRL is able to achieve state-of-art classification accuracy efficiently on both medium and large datasets. The result implies that our approach is more efficient than the conventional deep learning approaches, and can be applied to big data that is too complex for parameter designing focused approaches. More specifically, DDRL contains two main components, i.e., feature extraction and selection. A hierarchical distributed deep representation learning algorithm is designed to extract image statistics and a nonlinear mapping algorithm is used to map the inherent statistics into abstract features. Both algorithms are carefully designed to avoid millions of parameters tuning. This leads to a more compact solution for image classification of big data.

The characterisation of spatial variability in such images, for example, to measure of texture, is of great utility for the discrimination of land cover classes. To this end, the variogram, a function commonly applied in geostatistics, has been used widely to extract image texture for remotely sensed data classification. The aim of this study was to assess the increase in accuracy that can be achieved by incorporating univariate and multivariate textural measures of Landsat TM imagery in classification models applied to large heterogeneous landscapes. Such landscapes which difficult to classify due to the large number of land cover categories and low inter-class separability. Madogram, rodogram and direct variogram for the univariate case, and cross- and pseudocross variograms for the multivariate one, together with multi-seasonal spectral information were used in a Random Forest classifier to map land cover types. The addition of spatial variability into multi-seasonal Random Forest models leads to an increase in the overall accuracy of 8%, and to an increase in the Kappa index of 9%, respectively. The increase in per categories Kappa for the textural Random Forest model reached 30% for certain categories. This study demonstrates that the use of information on spatial variability produces a fundamental increase in per class classification accuracy of complex land-cover categories.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.proenv.2011.02.009", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia environmental sciences", "mag_id": "2046036663", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199095842", "56034899", "14321583", "212613230", "14516022", "34123087", "13826115", "84833796", "127632303", "2561251", "128410266", "131039005", "4178672", "201674840"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:128895158"}

Second, we generated time difference and isotope distribution pattern similarities for each peak pair. Third, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification was used based on the two features. Finally, the accuracy was measured along with final coverage. We first used a 10-fold cross validation to test the effectiveness of the SVM learning model.

This research investigates the algorithm development for automated high-yield classification with less time on analysis. 493 recorded heart sounds (HSs), comprised of 144 normal HSs, 141 musical murmurs, and 208 pathological murmurs, are first undergone through Preprocessing stage to form consistency of each incoming HSs.

Such methods generally perform well when provided with a training set that is representative of the test images to the segment. However, problems may arise when training and test data follow different distributions, for example, due to differences in scanners, scanning protocols, or patient groups. Under such conditions, weighting training images according to distribution similarity have been shown to greatly improve performance. However, this assumes that a part of the training data is representative of the test data; it does not make unrepresentative data more similar. We, therefore, investigate kernel learning as a way to reduce differences between training and test data and explore the added value of kernel learning for image weighting. We also propose a new image weighting method that minimizes maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between training and test data, which enables the joint optimization of image weights and kernel. Experiments on brain tissue, white matter lesion, and hippocampus segmentation show that both kernel learning and image weighting, when used separately, greatly improve performance on heterogeneous data. Here, MMD weighting obtains similar performance to previously proposed image weighting methods.

In this paper, firstly a comprehensive warning system is proposed, which consists of two vital indispensable modules, namely effective forecasting and scientific evaluation, respectively. For the forecasting module, a novel hybrid model combining the theory of data preprocessing and numerical optimization is first developed to implement effective forecasting for air pollutant concentration. Especially, in order to further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the warning system, interval forecasting is implemented to quantify the uncertainties generated by forecasts, which can provide significant risk signals by using point forecasting for decision-makers. For the evaluation module, a cloud model, based on probability and fuzzy set theory, is developed to perform comprehensive evaluations of air quality, which can realize the transformation between qualitative concept and quantitative data. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the warning system, extensive simulations based on air pollutants data from Dalian in China were effectively implemented, which illustrate that the warning system is not only remarkably high-performance, but also widely applicable.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5369085", "pubmed_id": "28257122", "doi": "10.3390/ijerph14030249", "venue": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "journal": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2594385188", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["40264322", "94998482", "95673361", "1783016", "93938737", "94270034", "62931634", "93942803", "110167527", "94114001", "112346648", "26002841", "23219792", "110637795", "10268642", "1262186", "6293882", "9493169", "10240144", "5551072", "73716885", "1822580", "124410797", "8319014", "6697244", "109526590", "2237364", "7138354", "207579947", "11225382", "14779381", "42087045", "7638094", "109951376"], "inbound_citations": ["52888708", "4988178", "115369519", "51619071", "52183589", "45966241"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8669015"}

The monitoring of these changes plays a vital role in planning and managing sustainable land use and land cover. Impervious surface, although not attributable to the whole area of urban sprawl, influences local climate known as urban heat island (UHI) effect, distribution of watershed, water quality and many other factors which ultimately affect the inhabitants of an area. To approximate consequences, exact measurements of Impervious Surface Area (ISA) are needed, which have to be cost-effective and up to date. Current operational methods to detect ISA offer only low temporal resolutions, are mostly based upon costly airborne surveying techniques or are not freely available. ::: In this study, an approach based on remote sensing satellite data for the mapping of impervious surface is evaluated on Munich, Bavaria for the year 2011 and 2017. With the use of very high spatially resolved WorldView-2 and WorldView-4 sensors as reference data, the Percentage of Impervious Surface (PIS) is estimated with a Support Vector Regression (SVR) for medium spatially resolved and freely available sensors Landsat 5, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2. PIS calculation is done per-pixel on a spatial resolution of 30, 15 and 10 meters. Comparison is made for different inputs, which are the reflectance data of the sensor, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), spectral indices and combination of PCA and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Subsequently the needed amount of samples for an accurate result is analyzed, as well as the noise which results out of a randomized input sample selection. The results are compared to Copernicus\u2019 imperviousness status maps and a municipal imperviousness study from 2011 by the city of Munich. ::: Results show that PIS and extent of ISA can be predicted at 11.12% Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (16.15% Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)) for the city of Munich, with a slight loss in accuracy for higher spatial resolutions. Differences in accuracy related to spatial resolution are within 3% range in MAE and 6% RMSE for the same coherent Area Of Interest (AOI) as reference sample. A combination of PCA and the NDVI showed to deliver the most consistent results in the comparison. A sample size of 200 to 400 data points was preferred, given the amount of calculation time and reduced noise with more samples. The final comparison with the municipal imperviousness study for 2011 and Copernicus\u2019 imperviousness maps for 2012 and 2015 showed MAE and RMSE values ranging from 14.23 to 19.92% and 20.64 to 29.33% for all sensors.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2944229295", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:164546628"}

Meanwhile, as the rolling bearing works in the normal state at most times, it is easy to raise the imbalance problem of fault types which restricts the diagnosis accuracy and stability. To solve these problems, we present an imbalanced fault diagnosis method based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) and provide a comparative study in detail. The key idea is utilizing GAN, a kind of deep learning technique, to generate synthetic samples for minority fault class and then improve the generalization ability of the fault diagnosis model. First, this method applies fast Fourier transform to pre-process the original vibration signal and then obtains the frequency spectrum of fault samples. Second, it uses the spectrum data as the input of GAN to generate the synthetic minority samples following the data distribution of the real samples. Finally, it puts the synthetic samples into the training set and builds a stacked denoising auto encoder model for fault diagnosis. To testify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a series of comparative experiments is carried out on the CWRU bearing dataset. The results show that the proposed method can provide a better solution for imbalanced fault diagnosis on the basis of generating similar fault samples. As a comparative study, the proposed method is compared to several diagnostic methods with traditional time-frequency domain characteristics. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms three widely used sample synthesis techniques, such as random oversampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique, and the principal curve-based oversampling method in terms of diagnosis accuracy and numerical stability.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2890693", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2908062660", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["64336653", "1554582", "7303933", "8223142", "123250444", "125778268", "758563", "5916438", "3655946", "11758569", "49675637", "27996431", "52289294", "58005880", "207168299", "110988692", "13144767", "5516512", "108663275", "5684889", "108773659", "125392032", "20958781", "33598201", "353336", "205432428", "123294256", "7553711"], "inbound_citations": ["211297589", "208037744", "181438764", "212628694", "204700574", "195737949", "211118034", "210696420", "209376485", "213696822", "213696822"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59261859"}

However, learning from synthetic faces may not achieve the desired performance due to the discrepancy between distributions of the synthetic and real face images. To narrow this gap, we propose a Dual-Agent Generative Adversarial Network (DA-GAN) model, which can improve the realism of a face simulator's output using unlabeled real faces, while preserving the identity information during the realism refinement. The dual agents are specifically designed for distinguishing real v.s. fake and identities simultaneously. In particular, we employ an off-the-shelf 3D face model as a simulator to generate profile face images with varying poses. DA-GAN leverages a fully convolutional network as the generator to generate high-resolution images and an auto-encoder as the discriminator with the dual agents. Besides the novel architecture, we make several key modifications to the standard GAN to preserve pose and texture, preserve identity and stabilize training process: (i) a pose perception loss; (ii) an identity perception loss; (iii) an adversarial loss with a boundary equilibrium regularization term. Experimental results show that DA-GAN not only presents compelling perceptual results but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts on the large-scale and challenging NIST IJB-A unconstrained face recognition benchmark.

Seasonal drought early warning is thus vital for the whole region. In this study, the predictability of hydrological droughts during the main runoff period from December to May is assessed with statistical approaches. Three methods (Multiple Linear Models, Artifical Neural Networks, Random Forest Regression Trees) are compared in terms of their ability to forecast streamflow with up to 12 months lead time. The following four main findings 5 result from the study. 1) There are stations in the basin at which standardised streamflow is predictable with lead times up to 12 months. The results show high interstation differences of forecast skill but reach a coefficient of determination as high as 0.73 (cross validated). 2) A large range of potential predictors is considered in this study, comprising well established climate indices, customised teleconnection indices derived from sea surface temperatures, and antecedent streamflow as proxy of catchment conditions. El-Nino and customised indices, representing sea surface temperature in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean, 10 prove to be important teleconnection predictors for the region. Antecedent streamflow is a strong predictor in small catchments (with median 42% explained variance), whereas teleconnections exert a stronger influence in large catchments. 3) Multiple linear models show the best forecast skill in this study and the greatest robustness compared to artificial neural networks and Random Forest regression trees, despite their capabilities to represent non-linear relationships. 4) Employed in early warning the models can be used to forecast a specific drought level. Even if the coefficient of determination is low, the forecast 15 models have a skill better than a climatological forecast, which is shown by analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Seasonal statistical forecasts in the Limpopo show promising results, and thus it is recommended to employ them complementary to existing forecasts in order to strengthen preparedness for droughts.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/hess-21-1611-2017", "venue": null, "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2310949430", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["40431292", "89141", "37506818", "123221960", "62607265", "129935234", "73536786", "55058710", "129989046", "120000437", "130895808", "130269161", "129187009", "129819019", "130016213", "128880836", "153445514", "56362613", "97969864", "122062011", "129512141", "51736693", "62199311", "129872324", "17089461", "84653568", "129306017", "128751528", "122167944", "56098960", "129843105", "17986999", "18915717", "128670836", "54800789", "128693180", "97550651", "40426428", "9436617", "129691928", "34983956", "12577700", "52557578", "8635308", "39445390", "59395732", "140722878", "54586604", "98556059", "129451018"], "inbound_citations": ["159235061", "55902065", "126319929", "73582001", "126318371", "55122759", "199099446", "55321916", "155980866", "133819717", "208075381", "207996071", "208612926", "55614984"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55166406"}

On the other hand, the Kernel Fisher Discriminant(KFD) is a non-linear classifier which has proven to be powerful and competitive to several state-of-the-art classifiers. This paper proposes a novel KSVM + KFD model which combines these two methods. This model can be viewed as an extension to the KSVM by incorporating 'global' characteristics of the data to estimate the decision boundary in the Kernel space. On the other hand, this new model could also be considered as an improvement to the KFD by incorporating the Support Vectors (local margin concept) into the KFD formulation. The KSVM + KFD model can be reduced to the classical KSVM model so that existing KSVM softwares can be used for easy implementation. An extensive comparison of the KSVM + KFD to the KFD, KSVM, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) and the combined LSVM and LDA, performed on real data sets, has shown the advantages of our proposed model.

However, some nanoparticles show toxicity to living organisms, and can potentially have a negative influence on environmental ecosystems. While toxicity can be determined experimentally, such studies are time consuming and costly. Computational toxicology can provide an alternative approach and there is a need to develop methods to reliably assess Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships for nanomaterials (nano-QSPRs). Importantly, development of such models requires careful collection and curation of data. This article overviews freely available nano-QSPR models, which were developed using the Online Chemical Modeling Environment (OCHEM). Multiple data on toxicity of nanoparticles to different living organisms were collected from the literature and uploaded in the OCHEM database. The main characteristics of nanoparticles such as chemical composition of nanoparticles, average particle size, shape, surface charge and information about the biological test species were used as descriptors for developing QSPR models. QSPR methodologies used Random Forests (WEKA-RF), k-Nearest Neighbors and Associative Neural Networks. The predictive ability of the models was tested through cross-validation, giving cross-validated coefficients q2 = 0.58-0.80 for regression models and balanced accuracies of 65-88% for classification models. These results matched the predictions for the test sets used to develop the models.

It would be of great value for governments if anomalies can be automatically alerted in their early stage. However, detecting anomalies in urban area has two main challenges. First, the criteria to determine an anomaly on different occasions (e.g. rainy days vs. sunny days, or holidays vs. workdays) and in different places (e.g. tourist attractions vs. office areas) are distinctly different, as these occasions and places have their own definitions on normal patterns. Second, urban anomalies often exhibit complex forms (e.g. road closure may cause decrease in taxi flow and increase in bike flow). We need an algorithm that not only models the anomaly degree of individual data source but also the combination of changes in multiple data sources. In this paper, we propose a two-step method to tackle those challenges. In the first step, we use a similarity-based algorithm to estimate an anomaly score for each individual data source in each region and time slot based on the values of historically similar regions.

One of the strategies used to optimize this task is the use of a system that automates part of this process through a machine learning approach. This paper presents an approach that introduces the historical request from beneficiaries to the learning process in preauthorization in order to improve performance of the classification. For this, different approaches to data pre-processing and classification were tested. In the proposed methodology three types of historical representation were tested: binary, term frequency (TF) and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). For each of these representations, feature selection and transformation algorithms were applied: consistency subset eval, wrapper subset eval and Kernel PCA (KPCA). In the classification were tested three classic algorithms of machine learning: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-neareast neighbors (KNN).

Such a service requires a user to send data, e.g. image, voice and video, to the provider, which presents a serious challenge to user privacy. To address this, prior works either obfuscate the data, e.g. add noise and remove identity information, or send representations extracted from the data, e.g. anonymized features. They struggle to balance between the service utility and data privacy because obfuscated data reduces utility and extracted representation may still reveal sensitive information. ::: This work departs from prior works in methodology: we leverage adversarial learning to better balance between privacy and utility. We design a representation encoder that generates the feature representations to optimize against the privacy disclosure risk of sensitive information (a measure of privacy) by the privacy adversaries, and concurrently optimize with the task inference accuracy (a measure of utility) by the utility discriminator. The result is the privacy adversarial network (PAN), a novel deep model with the new training algorithm, that can automatically learn representations from the raw data. And the trained encoder can be deployed on the user side to generate representations that satisfy the task-defined utility requirements and the user-specified/agnostic privacy budgets. ::: Intuitively, PAN adversarially forces the extracted representations to only convey information required by the target task. Surprisingly, this constitutes an implicit regularization that actually improves task accuracy. As a result, PAN achieves better utility and better privacy at the same time!

It is devised to identify malicious applications. To start with, features of real\u2013world known-benign and known\u2013malicious applications are extracted, gathering 299 features grouped into 8 categories: stats, requested permissions, used permission, API calls, Intents, risks, system calls, and content access. MaLDroide uses static analysis in order to automatically extract these features. As an essential part of the work, a mechanism for dimensionality reduction, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), was applied, the original 299 features are reduced to 27, retaining 90% of the variance, and dramatically reducing time and space consumption. Once determined the appropriate data set, a training process of the seven most widely used Machine Learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and AdaBoost) is undertaken. After an evaluation process with 436 normal applications and 2295 malware samples, and on the basis of the evaluation results, one can conclude that Support Vector Machine classifier produces the most accurate predictions, and identifies malware with an accuracy of 99.8%.

The roller bearing's nature of vibration reveals its condition and the features that show the nature, are to be extracted through some indirect means. Statistical parameters like kurtosis, standard deviation, maximum value, etc. form a set of features, which are widely used in fault diagnostics. Often the problem is, finding out good features that discriminate the different fault conditions of the bearing. Selection of good features is an important phase in pattern recognition and requires detailed domain knowledge. This paper illustrates the use of a Decision Tree that identifies the best features from a given set of samples for the purpose of classification. It uses Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM), which has the capability to efficiently classify the faults using statistical features. The vibration signal from a piezoelectric transducer is captured for the following conditions: good bearing, bearing with inner race fault, bearing with outer race fault, and inner and outer race fault. The statistical features are extracted therefrom and classified successfully using PSVM and SVM. The results of PSVM and SVM are compared.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ymssp.2006.05.004", "venue": null, "journal": "Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing", "mag_id": "2040584032", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10039662", "17212381", "8353412", "35755461", "117496646", "15373901", "28998887", "15195213", "4676145", "24327494", "3800669", "33078446", "203951856", "12752860", "7100417", "4676431", "73523789", "56425027", "90718899", "39794132", "195774403", "109961221", "14488210", "161051741", "41984943", "55201106", "55201106", "211243579", "14473056", "38495613", "19130346", "112838537", "43618774", "208332217", "210996081", "108836871", "3689069", "6519420", "73641763", "33610521", "125102769", "125166372", "49645101", "13466586", "54464650", "209696315", "11105932", "22049043", "15310626", "122972024", "208304669", "199376711", "16396580", "110878743", "195698016", "16825037", "17842100", "18792098", "139520265", "413819", "31425707", "8166909", "17636162", "169324880", "54454395", "5569954", "108445014", "1017357", "13265659", "17246815", "57753504", "6712798", "7356097", "86717021", "10990924", "12906148", "108506429", "27698547", "6700924", "18694511", "7567213", "11031961", "69474152", "35923280", "52898926", "18073978", "126085348", "211060292", "24888311", "202614865", "210994283", "54852564", "54602576", "1105018", "14662866", "17405834", "117409487", "7016036", "54455360", "32575276", "18232162", "1494540", "15988639", "3793030", "21754206", "53106538", "23426789", "62196403", "204816141", "53439273", "77387434", "12280845", "6753499", "113649202", "63121317", "210995312", "34821893", "158771088", "13294534", "211195277", "204861944", "53305567", "110010309", "30412765", "109480522"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:121448487"}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel mid-level feature descriptor for pedestrian detection in thermal domain, which combines pixel-level Steering Kernel Regression Weights Matrix (SKRWM) with their corresponding covariances. SKRWM can properly capture the local structure of pixels, while the covariance computation can further provide the correlation of low level feature. This mid-level feature descriptor not only captures the pixel-level data difference and spatial differences of local structure, but also explores the correlations among low-level features. In the case of human detection, the proposed mid-level feature descriptor can discriminatively distinguish pedestrian from complexity. For testing the performance of proposed feature descriptor, a popular classifier framework based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is also built.

The closed-loop control system, equipped with the function of intelligent optimization and dynamic regulation, has been developed. A hybrid intelligent algorithm called ZOGE, in which both the searching definiteness and randomness are taken into account and the multipoint searching and single-point searching are simultaneously carried through, has been proposed. The equivalent factor of flatness target curve has been optimized by function module HYBALO, which is developed on the basis of the hybrid intelligent algorithm and is operated on CFC configuration language in SIMATIC TDC controller.

This leads to more appropriate propagation of side-information among tasks and provides potential for further improving the performance.

The underlying architecture of such robots would be of the abstract agent variety and implemented in CommonLisp. The abstract agent defines a framework for defining and testing different learning agents. Also, the architecture of the abstract agent allows a new agent to be created by plugging in a new module or recombining old modules. The experimental task domain defined for the robots is the operation of a tilting tray. A robotic manipulator holds a square tray, bounded by four vertical walls, which may be tilted at any angle desired. An object, typically a square block, slides freely in the tray. By a judicious choice of tilting sequence, the robot is able to position the object in the tray. The chief complication of the tilting-tray occurs when the object hits a wall. Now, one of the experimental robots is proposed to have been fitted with the rote agent performs rote-learning of tilt motions mechanics while the other with the inductive agent, which does a simple version-space learning to generalize in the space of tilt-angles. Both agents use exhaustive search to construct plans.

IBD, is a gut related disorder where the deviations from the healthy gut microbiome are considered to be associated with IBD. Although existing studies attempt to unveal the composition of the gut microbiome in relation to IBD diseases, a comprehensive picture is far from being complete. Due to the complexity of metagenomic studies, the applications of the state of the art machine learning techniques became popular to address a wide range of questions in the field of metagenomic data analysis. In this regard, using IBD associated metagenomics dataset, this study utilizes both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, i) to generate a classification model that aids IBD diagnosis, ii) to discover IBD associated biomarkers, iii) to find subgroups of IBD patients using k means and hierarchical clustering. To deal with the high dimensionality of features, we applied robust feature selection algorithms such as Conditional Mutual Information Maximization (CMIM), Fast Correlation Based Filter (FCBF), min redundancy max relevance (mRMR) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). In our experiments with 10 fold cross validation, XGBoost had a considerable effect in terms of minimizing the microbiota used for the diagnosis of IBD and thus reducing the cost and time.

A crucial question within this realm is to what extent the execution of a cognitive task affects the intrinsic activity of brain regions not involved in the task. Computational models can be useful to answer this question because they allow us to distinguish task from non-task neural elements while giving us the effects of task execution on non-task regions of interest at the neuroimaging level. The quantification of those effects in a computational model would represent a step towards elucidating the intrinsic versus task-evoked connection. Here we used computational modeling and graph theoretical metrics to quantify changes in intrinsic functional brain connectivity due to task execution. We used our Large-Scale Neural Modeling framework to embed a computational model of visual short-term memory into an empirically derived connectome. We simulated a neuroimaging study consisting of ten subjects performing passive fixation (PF), passive viewing (PV) and delay match-to-sample (DMS) tasks. We used the simulated BOLD fMRI time-series to calculate functional connectivity (FC) matrices and used those matrices to compute several graph theoretical measures. After determining that the simulated graph theoretical measures were largely consistent with experiments, we were able to quantify the differences between the graph metrics of the PF condition and those of the PV and DMS conditions. Thus, we show that we can use graph theoretical methods applied to simulated brain networks to aid in the quantification of changes in intrinsic brain functional connectivity during task execution. Our results represent a step towards establishing a connection between intrinsic and task-related brain activity. Author Summary Studies of resting-state conditions are popular in neuroimaging. Participants in resting-state studies are instructed to fixate on a neutral image or to close their eyes. This type of study has advantages over traditional task-based studies, including its ability to allow participation of those with difficulties performing tasks. Further, a resting-state neuroimaging study reveals intrinsic activity of participants\u2019 brains. However, task-related brain activity may change this intrinsic activity, much as a stone thrown in a lake causes ripples on the water\u2019s surface. Can we measure those activity changes? To answer that question, we merged a computational model of visual short-term memory (task regions) with an anatomical model incorporating major connections between brain regions (non-task regions). In a computational model, unlike real data, we know how different regions are connected and which regions are doing the task. First, we simulated neuronal and neuroimaging activity of both task and non-task regions during three conditions: passive fixation (baseline), passive viewing, and visual short-term memory. Then, applying graph theory to the simulated neuroimaging of non-task regions, we computed differences between the baseline and the other conditions. Our results show that we can measure changes in non-task regions due to brain activity changes in task-related regions.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/250894", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "mag_id": "2791042506", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196635100"}

Support Vector Machine is a supervised classification technique, has its extraction in geometric Learning Theory and have gained importance as they are strong, precise and are effective even after using a small training model. With their character Support Vector Machines are basically binary classifiers, though, they can be tailored to handle the manifold classification tasks general in scene classification.

Such data contain insightful information for understanding the mechanism of molecular biological systems and have proved useful in diagnosis, treatment, and drug design for genetic disorders or complex diseases. For this focus issue, we have invited the researchers to contribute original research articles which develop or improve systems biology approaches to mining high throughput biological data. ::: ::: With high throughput data, it is appealing to develop systems biology approaches to understand important biological processes. In the paper \u201cDifferential Expression Analysis in RNA-Seq by a Naive Bayes Classifier with Local Normalization,\u201d Y. Dou et al. developed a new tool for the identification of differentially expressed genes with RNA-Seq data, named GExposer. This tool introduced a local normalization algorithm to reduce the bias of nonrandomly positioned read depth. The Naive Bayes classifier was employed to integrate fold change, transcript length, and GC-content to identify differentially expressed genes. Results on several independent tests showed that GExposer had better performance than other methods. In the paper \u201cK-Profiles: A Nonlinear Clustering Method for Pattern Detection in High Dimensional Data,\u201d K. Wang et al. designed the nonlinear K-profiles clustering method, which can be seen as the nonlinear counterpart of the K-means clustering algorithm. The method had a built-in statistical testing procedure that ensures genes not belonging to any cluster do not impact the estimation of cluster profiles. Results from extensive simulation studies showed that K-profiles clustering outperformed traditional linear K-means algorithm. In addition, K-profile clustering generated biologically meaningful results from a gene expression dataset. ::: ::: Replicative senescence is of fundamental importance for the process of cellular aging. In the paper \u201cSimilarities in Gene Expression Profiles during In Vitro Aging of Primary Human Embryonic Lung and Foreskin Fibroblasts,\u201d S. Diekmann et al. elucidated cellular aging process by comparing gene expression changes, measured by RNA-Seq, in fibroblasts originating from two different tissues, embryonic lung (MRC-5) and foreskin (HFF), at five different time points during their transition into senescence. Their results showed that a number of monotonically up- and downregulated genes had a novel strong functional link to aging and senescence related processes. ::: ::: More and more studies have shown that many complex diseases are contributed jointly by alterations of numerous genes. Genes often coordinate together as a functional biological pathway or network and are highly correlated. In the paper \u201cModule Based Differential Coexpression Analysis Method for Type 2 Diabetes,\u201d L. Yuan et al. proposed a gene differential coexpression analysis algorithm and applied it to a publicly available type 2 diabetes (T2D) expression dataset. Two differential coexpression gene modules about T2D were detected and were expected to be useful for exploring the biological functions of the related genes. ::: ::: Oral mucosa is a useful material for regeneration therapy with the advantages of its accessibility and versatility regardless of age and gender. In the paper \u201cGene Signature of Human Oral Mucosa Fibroblasts: Comparison with Dermal Fibroblasts and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,\u201d K. Miyoshi et al. reported the comparative profiles of the gene signatures of human oral mucosa fibroblasts (hOFs), human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs), and hOF-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (hOF-iPSCs), linking these with biological roles by functional annotation and pathway analyses. Their findings demonstrated that hOFs had unique cellular characteristics in specificity and plasticity. These data may provide useful insight into application of oral fibroblasts for direct reprograming. ::: ::: Predicting disease genes for a particular genetic disease is very challenging. However, this challenge can be tackled via exploring high throughput data. In the paper \u201cProSim: A Method for Prioritizing Disease Genes Based on Protein Proximity and Disease Similarity,\u201d G. U. Ganegoda et al. proposed a new algorithm called proximity disease similarity algorithm (ProSim), which took use of two types of data: disease similarity data and protein-protein interaction data. The computational results have shown that their proposed method outperformed existing methods. ::: ::: In order to learn the protein structures and functions via computational methods, it is important to predict the solvent accessibility and the contact number of protein residues from protein sequence. In the paper \u201cAcconPred: Predicting Solvent Accessibility and Contact Number Simultaneously by a Multitask Learning Framework under the Conditional Neural Fields Model,\u201d J. Ma and S. Wang presented a method AcconPred for predicting solvent accessibility and contact number simultaneously, which was based on a shared weight multitask learning framework under the CNF (Conditional Neural Fields) model. Trained on a 5729 monomeric soluble globular protein dataset, AcconPred could reach 0.68 three-state accuracy for solvent accessibility and 0.75 correlation for the contact number. Tested on the 105 CASP11 domain dataset for solvent accessibility, AcconPred could reach 0.64 accuracy, which outperformed existing methods. ::: ::: The Smith-Waterman algorithm is one of the key sequence search algorithms for sequence alignment and has gained popularity due to improved implementations and rapidly increasing compute power. Recently, the Smith-Waterman algorithm has been successfully mapped onto the emerging general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs). In the paper \u201cImproving the Mapping of Smith-Waterman Sequence Database Searches onto CUDA-Enabled GPUs,\u201d L.-T. Huang et al. employed the CUDA-enabled GPU to improve the mapping of Smith-Waterman algorithm, especially for short query sequences. The computational results showed that the proposed method significantly improved Smith-Waterman algorithm on CUDA-enabled GPUs in proper allocation of block and thread numbers. ::: ::: Protein interaction article classification is a text classification task in the biological domain to determine which articles describe protein-protein interactions. In the paper \u201cImproving Classification of Protein Interaction Articles Using Context Similarity-Based Feature Selection,\u201d Y. Chen et al. proposed new context similarity-based feature selection methods. Their performances were evaluated on two protein interaction article collections and compared against the frequency-based methods. The experimental results revealed that the context similarity-based methods performed better in terms of the F1 measure and the dimension reduction rate. ::: ::: Recent studies suggest that posttranscriptional RNA modifications play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. In practice, a single methylation site can contain multiple RNA methylation residuals, some of which can be regulated by different enzymes and thus differentially methylated between two conditions. However, existing peak-based methods could not effectively differentiate multiple methylation residuals located within a single methylation site. In the paper \u201cSpatially Enhanced Differential RNA Methylation Analysis from Affinity-Based Sequencing Data with Hidden Markov Model,\u201d Y.-C. Zhang et al. proposed a hidden Markov model (HMM) based approach to address this issue. The proposed algorithms were tested on both simulated data and real data. Results suggested that their proposed algorithm clearly outperformed existing peak-based approach on simulated systems and could detect differential methylation regions with higher statistical significance on real data, indicating an improved performance. ::: ::: Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) and drug-metabolizing target genes are involved in most of inductive herb-drug interactions. To predict this kind of herb-drug interactions, the protocol could be simplified to only screen agonists of PXR from herbs because the relations of drugs with their metabolizing enzymes are well studied. In the paper \u201cScreening Ingredients from Herbs against Pregnane X Receptor in the Study of Inductive Herb-Drug Interactions: Combining Pharmacophore and Docking-Based Rank Aggregation,\u201d Z. Cui et al. employed a combinational in silico strategy of pharmacophore modelling and docking-based rank aggregation (DRA) to identify PXR's agonists. To validate their method, a curated herb-drug interaction database was built, which recorded 380 herb-drug interactions. The results showed that, among the top 10 herb ingredients from the ranking list, 6 ingredients were reported to involve herb-drug interactions. ::: ::: In summary, this focus issue has reported the recent progress in systems biology approaches to analyzing high throughput data such as gene expression data, various biomolecular interaction data, and sequencing data. We hope that the readers of this focus issue could get some benefits from these newly developed methods. ::: ::: ::: Fang-Xiang Wu ::: ::: Min Li ::: ::: Jishou Ruan ::: ::: Feng Luo", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4539426", "pubmed_id": "26347339", "doi": "10.1155/2015/504362", "venue": "BioMed research international", "journal": "BioMed research international", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1567524883", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5509697"}

However, these algorithms require many training examples to be efficient and robust. For this purpose, pathologists must manually segment hundreds or even thousands of objects in histological images, i.e. a long, tedious and potentially biased task. The present paper aims to review strategies that could help provide the very large number of annotated images needed to automate the segmentation of histological images using deep learning. This review identifies and describes four different approaches: the use of immunohistochemical markers as labels, realistic data augmentation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and transfer learning. In addition, we describe alternative learning strategies that can use imperfect annotations.

The key advantage of TCBR over traditional Information Retrieval systems is its ability to incorporate domain-specific knowledge to facilitate case comparison beyond simple keyword matching. However, substantial human intervention is needed to acquire and transform this knowledge into a form suitable for a TCBR system. In this research, we present automated approaches that exploit statistical properties of document collections to alleviate this knowledge acquisition bottleneck. We focus on two important knowledge containers: relevance knowledge, which shows relatedness of features to cases, and similarity knowledge, which captures the relatedness of features to each other. The terminology is derived from the Case Retrieval Network (CRN) retrieval architecture in TCBR, which is used as the underlying formalism in this thesis applied to text classification. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) generated concepts are a useful resource for relevance knowledge acquisition for CRNs. This thesis introduces a supervised LSI technique called sprinkling that exploits class knowledge to bias LSI's concept generation. An extension of this idea, called Adaptive Sprinkling has been proposed to handle inter-class relationships in complex domains like hierarchical (e.g. Yahoo directory) and ordinal (e.g. product ranking) classification tasks. Experimental evaluation results show the superiority of CRNs created with sprinkling and AS, not only over LSI on its own, but also over state-of-the-art classifiers like Support Vector Machines (SVM). Current statistical approaches based on feature co-occurrences can be utilized to mine similarity knowledge for CRNs. However, related words often do not co-occur in the same document, though they co-occur with similar words. We introduce an algorithm to efficiently mine such indirect associations, called higher order associations. Empirical results show that CRNs created with the acquired similarity knowledge outperform both LSI and SVM. Incorporating acquired knowledge into the CRN transforms it into a densely connected network. While improving retrieval effectiveness, this has the unintended effect of slowing down retrieval. We propose a novel retrieval formalism called the Fast Case Retrieval Network (FCRN) which eliminates redundant run-time computations to improve retrieval speed. Experimental results show FCRN's ability to scale up over high dimensional textual casebases. Finally, we investigate novel ways of visualizing and estimating complexity of textual casebases that can help explain performance differences across casebases. Visualization provides a qualitative insight into the casebase, while complexity is a quantitative measure that characterizes classification or retrieval hardness intrinsic to a dataset. We study correlations of experimental results from the proposed approaches against complexity measures over diverse casebases.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1596612606", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:41480546"}

Tree- GNG extends the Growing Neural Gas algorithm by maintaining a time history of the learned topological mapping. TreeGNG is able to recover from poor decisions made during the construction of the tree, and pro- vides the novel ability to influence the general shape of the hierarchy. 1 Background In this paper we present TreeGNG, a new hierarchical clustering algorithm based on a time audit trail of the graph connectivity of the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) (4) algorithm. GNG grows and prunes the network components in response to incremental learning. The dynamic nature of the network can produce disjoint graph structures, and these disconnected graphs \"can be used to identify clusters in the input data\" (5). By maintaining a time audit trail of the graph connectivity, we can uncover hierarchical structure within the data. The use of unsupervised learning techniques to discover the hierarchy of concepts from unlabelled data, primarily focus on extensions to Kohonen's Self- organising Feature Map (SOM) (8). Recently, two hierarchical neural clusterers, HiGCS (1) and TreeGCS (6), have been proposed, both based on Bernd Fritzke's Growing Cell Structures (GCS) (3). The hierarchical structures produced by TreeGCS are binary. Moreover, there are some limitations of GCS, which are detailed in (7) and (1), and the results of our own evaluation of GCS concur with these findings. The models produced by the GCS and SOM algorithms are a topological mapping only if the topology of the graph matches the topological structure of the manifold from which the data are drawn. In (9), it was shown that an algorithm for the homogeneous distribution of the network nodes combined with the competitive Hebb rule produces the induced Delaunay triangulation of the manifold. GNG is an incremental implementation of this node distribution and competitive Hebbian learning concept, and the resultant graph structures are a topology preserving map of the manifold.

The SVM classifier was trained at discriminating between Dominant and Non-Dominant hemispheric language production activation pattern on a group of 250 participants previously identified as Typicals (HFLI strongly leftward). Then, SVM was applied to each hemispheric language activation pattern of 47 non-typical individuals. The results showed that at least one hemisphere (left or right) was found to be Dominant in every, except 3 individuals, indicating that the \"dominant\" type of functional organization is the most frequent in non-typicals. Specifically, left hemisphere dominance was predicted in all non-typical right-handers (RH) and in 57.4% of non-typical left-handers (LH). When both hemisphere classifications were jointly considered, four types of brain patterns were observed. The most often predicted pattern (51%) was left-dominant (Dominant left-hemisphere and Non-Dominant right-hemisphere), followed by right-dominant (23%, Dominant right-hemisphere and Non-Dominant left-hemisphere) and co-dominant (19%, 2 Dominant hemispheres) patterns. Co-non-dominant was rare (6%, 2 Non-Dominant hemispheres), but was normal variants of hemispheric specialization. In RH, only left-dominant (72%) and co-dominant patterns were detected, while for LH, all types were found, although with different occurrences. Among the 10 LH with a strong rightward HFLI, 8 had a right-dominant brain pattern. Whole-brain analysis of the right-dominant pattern group confirmed that it exhibited a functional organization strictly mirroring that of left-dominant pattern group.

Methods: In this paper some data mining techniques like Decision tree algorithm, Bayesian network model, Naive Bayes method, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest neighbour classifier were discussed. Findings: Each algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages. Decision tree technique do not perform well if the data have smooth boundaries. The Naive Bayesian classifier works with both continuous and discrete attributes and works well for real time problems. This method is very fast and highly scalable. The drawback of this technique is when a data set which has strong dependency among the attribute is considered then this method gives poor performance. KNN can perform well in many situations and it particularly suits well for multi-model classes as well as applications in which an object can have many labels. The drawback of KNN is it involves lot of computation and when the size of training set taken is large then the process will become slow. Support vector machine suites well when the data need to be classified into two groups.

Recently, it has been shown that the general Statistical Learning problem can be restated as a linear inverse problem. Hence, new algorithms were proposed to solve this inverse problem in the context of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. In this paper, we detail one iterative learning algorithm belonging to this class, called \u03bd-method, and test its effectiveness in a between-subjects regression framework. Specifically, our goal was to predict the perceived pain intensity based on fMRI signals, during an experimental model of acute prolonged noxious stimulation. We found that, using a linear kernel, the psychophysical time profile was well reconstructed, while pain intensity was in some cases significantly over/underestimated. No substantial differences in terms of accuracy were found between the proposed approach and one of the state-of-the-art learning methods, the Support Vector Machines. Nonetheless, adopting the \u03bd-method yielded a significant reduction in computational time, an advantage that became more evident when a relevant feature selection procedure was implemented. The \u03bd-method can be easily extended and included in typical approaches for binary or multiple classification problems, and therefore it seems well-suited to build effective brain activity estimators.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21296171", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.074", "venue": "NeuroImage", "journal": "NeuroImage", "mag_id": "2084163941", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201976666", "21082874", "44058227", "5624454", "15079819", "5994301", "12023520", "6508581", "4637944", "25903812", "215504146"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25773271"}

In some resource limited settings, VL tests may be limited by cost or technology, and diagnoses are based on other clinical markers.

The proposed approach uses the flow information of all 3 dimensions to classify an action. In our approach, we have obtained the 2-D optical flow and used it along with the depth image to obtain the depth flow (Z motion vectors). The obtained flow captures the dynamics of the actions in space-time. Feature vectors are obtained by averaging the 3-D motion over a grid laid over the silhouette in a hierarchical fashion. These hierarchical fine to coarse windows capture the motion dynamics of the object at various scales. The extracted features are used to train a Meta-cognitive Radial Basis Function Network (McRBFN) that uses a Projection Based Learning (PBL) algorithm, referred to as PBL-McRBFN, henceforth. PBL-McRBFN begins with zero hidden neurons and builds the network based on the best human learning strategy, namely, self-regulated learning in a meta-cognitive environment. When a sample is used for learning, PBL-McRBFN uses the sample overlapping conditions, and a projection based learning algorithm to estimate the parameters of the network. The performance of PBL-McRBFN is compared to that of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifiers with representation of every person and action in the training and testing datasets. Performance study shows that PBL-McRBFN outperforms these classifiers in recognizing actions in 3-D. Further, a subject-independent study is conducted by leave-one-subject-out strategy and its generalization performance is tested. It is observed from the subject-independent study that McRBFN is capable of generalizing actions accurately.

Existing approaches try to tackle the problem by transferring traditional single-label stream classification practices to the multi-label domain. Nevertheless, they fail to consider some of the unique properties of the problem such as within and between class imbalance and multiple concept drift. To deal with these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multilabel stream classification approach that employs two windows for each label, one for positive and one for negative examples.

The use of highly patient-effort dependent, time-consuming, and expensive methods are some major inherent limitations of previous techniques. Lack of knowledge about the disease and inadequacy of proper diagnostic tool for early detection of COPD is another reason behind the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide. For this reason, this study aims to explore the utility of ECG Derived Respiration (EDR) for classification between COPD patients and normal healthy subjects as EDR can be easily extracted from ECG. ECG and respiration signals collected from 30 normal and 30 COPD subjects were analysed. Error calculation and statistical analysis were performed to observe the similarity between original respiration and EDR signal. The morphological pattern changes of respiration and EDR signals were analysed and three different features were extracted from those.

The cognitive component of McELM is a three-layered extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier. The neurons in the hidden layer of the cognitive component employ the q-Gaussian activation function, while the neurons in the input and output layers are linear. The meta-cognitive component of McELM has a self-regulatory learning mechanism that decides what-to-learn, when-to-learn, and how-to-learn in a meta-cognitive framework. As the samples in the training set are presented one-by-one, the meta-cognitive component receives the monitory signals from the cognitive component and chooses suitable learning strategies for the sample. Thus, it either deletes the sample, uses the sample to add a new neuron, or updates the output weights based on the sample, or reserves the sample for future use. Therefore, unlike the conventional ELM, the architecture of McELM is not fixed a priori, instead, the network is built during the training process. While adding a neuron, McELM chooses the centers based on the sample, and the width of the Gaussian function is chosen randomly. The output weights are estimated using the least square estimate based on the hinge-loss error function. The hinge-loss error function facilitates prediction of posterior probabilities better than the mean-square error and is hence preferred to develop the McELM classifier. While updating the network parameters, the output weights are updated using a recursive least square estimate. The performance of McELM is evaluated on a set of benchmark classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository.

The aim in this paper was to develop a computational approach, using a machine learning framework, to determine if DFC features were more successful than FC features in the classification of cocaine-dependent patients and healthy controls. fMRI data were obtained from of 25 healthy and 58 cocaine-dependent participants while performing a motor response inhibition task, stop signal task. Group independent component analysis was carried out on all participant data to compute spatially independent components (ICs). Eight ICs were selected manually as relevant brain networks, which were used to classify healthy versus cocaine-dependent participants. FC and DFC measures of the chosen IC pairs were used as features for the classification algorithm. Support Vector Machines were used for both feature selection/reduction and participant classification. Based on DFC with only seven IC pairs, participants were successfully classified with 95% accuracy (and with 90% accuracy with three IC pairs), whereas static FC yielded only 81% accuracy. Visual, sensorimotor, default mode, and executive control networks, amygdala, and insula played the most significant role in the DFC-based classification.

Although extensive research has been conducted on Wi-Fi fingerprint-based positioning, especially, in complex environments and long-term deployments, the automatic adaptation of radio map has not been fully studied and the problems remain open. When the positions of some Access Points (APs) change, the traditional approach regularly conducts site surveying which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing indoor positioning approach based on ensemble learning for automatic Altered APs Identification and Fingerprints Updating, namely AAIFU. We propose an algorithm to detect and identify the altered APs in crowdsourcing data. After getting the altered APs, we use the relationship between the received signal strength values of the altered APs and the unaltered APs in the crowdsourcing data to train a prediction model used to update the radio map. We also handle the device diversity on all the processes of AAIFU. Our proposed solution is light-weight which does not rely on additional infrastructure and inertial sensors with high power consumption. The comprehensive experiments have been carried out in our teaching building to evaluate the effectiveness of AAIFU. The results show that our proposed AAIFU can effectively adapt the radio map to the movement of APs and improve positioning accuracy.

It is based mainly on the recording and analysis of fetal heart rate signal ( FHR). Computer systems for fetal monitoring provide a quantitative description of FHR signals, however the effective m ethods for their qualitative assessment are still n eeded. The measurements of hydronium ions concentration (pH) in newborn cord blood is considered as the objective indicator of the fetal state. Improper pH level is a symptom of acidemia being the result of fetal hypoxia. The pap er proposes a twostep analysis of signals allowing for effective pr ediction of the acidemia risk. The first step consi sts in the fuzzy classification of FHR signals. The task of fuzzy in ference is to indicate signals that according to th e FIGO guidelines represent the fetal wellbeing. These recordings are eliminated from the further classification with La grangian Support Vector Machines. The proposed procedure was evaluated using data collected with computerized fetal sur veillance system. The classification results confirmed the hi gh quality of the proposed fuzzy method of fetal st ate evaluation. Cardiotocography (CTG) is a biophysical method for assessment of fetal state. It consists in recording of changes of the fetal heart rate (FHR) and analysis of their relation to fetal movements a nd maternal uterine contractile activity (UC). Proper cardiac function is an indicator of adequate fetal blood oxygenation and show that the central nervous syste m is intact and provides a good modulating control. Hence, the analysis of fetal heart rate is an essen tial element of the routine diagnostic method for evaluation of the fetuses during pregnancy and labo ur [6,8]. A graphical representation of FHR signal is subject to the interpretation of a physician, whose task is to identify and classify the recording fea tures. The basal level of FHR signal (called baseline) and its variability in the aspect of transient increas e (acceleration) or decrease (deceleration) is the pr imary subject of medical evaluation. Acceleration patterns, as the temporary increases of FHR in resp onse to fetal movement, are the signs of fetal wellbeing, indicating the alertness of the central nervous system. Fetal distress is revealed by decel eration patterns, as temporary slowing of the FHR that is u sually related to dangerous oxygen deficiency. Numerous attempts were made to formalize the criteria for FHR signals evaluation. Nevertheless, the clinical standards are in accordance with guideline s on antepartum electronic fetal monitoring introdu ced by FIGO (fr. Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique) [10]. Visual analysis of FHR recordings obtained directly from bedside monitor p rintouts is very difficult even for experienced clinicians. Therefore it was replaced by automated computer analysis. The computerized fetal monitoring systems provide the quantitative description of the signals but the effective methods for the diagnosi s support, are still the topic of research [2,4,7]. T he paper presents the procedure of evaluating the r isk of fetal acidemia with a two-step parametric analysis of FHR signal. In the first stage, the quantitative parameters of signals were classified using fuzzy s coring system, whose rule base was developed using the FIGO guidelines. The goal of the fuzzy evaluati on was to confirm the fetal wellbeing with the high est certainty. In the second stage of classification, t he FHR signal parameters were assessed with Lagrangian Support Vector Machines (LSVM) [9]. However, only the recordings previously classified as indicating the abnormal state of the fetus were classified. Th e fuzzy assessment of fetal state corresponds to th e screening procedure, whose goal is to eliminate hea lthy patients from further medical diagnostics, whi le the second stage may be interpreted as a diagnostic test conducted by a clinical expert.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Medical Informatics and Technologies", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1487966872", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["1963803", "46286", "109164596", "2307023", "25405842", "22906714", "7794861"], "inbound_citations": ["60103555"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13894550"}

Furthermore, our generator networks are extended to be three dimensional fully convolutional neural networks, allowing for the generation of high resolution images from arbitrary fields of view. In our verification tests, we show that the proposed method obtains the best scores by PSNR/SSIM metrics and Visual Turing Test, allowing for accurate reproduction of the principle anatomy in high resolution.

Most of existing methods highly rely on massive labeled data which are scarce in many real world applications. It should also be noticed that progressive learning demands of existing data is very common today. That is, we may pay attention to more fine-grained information (like arctic tern, black tern, buttercup or tulip) in an existing data set with labels like \u201cbird\u201d and \u201cflower\u201d. It is reasonable to believe that the existing labels and model with transferable knowledge would be helpful to another related but different, fine-grained recognition task. In this context, an improved transfer deep learning approach with hierarchical multi-adversarial networks is proposed in this paper. With this approach, cross domain features are extracted by advanced deep encoders coarsely. After that, we annotate a small amount of images in the target domain, thereby creating the \u201cactive labels\u201d which can provide instructions for adversarial learning. Then, the GAN-based hierarchical model is utilized to select cross domain categories and enhance related features so as to facilitate an effective transfer. In order to exploit useful local features, a novel adaptive attention mechanism, Region Adversarial Network (RAN) which can select attention regions during adversarial learning and generate valuable fine-grained features, is introduced in the article. We call the proposed hierarchical framework \u201cAttentional Multi-Adversarial Networks (AMAN)\u201d .

The aim of this study is to build a regression model of daily air quality prediction by using support vector machine (SVM) technique in Gij\u00f3n urban area (Northern Spain) at local scale. To accomplish the objective, the observed data of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone and dust for years 2006 to 2008 are used to create a highly nonlinear model of the air quality in the city based on SVM techniques. One objective of this model was to make a preliminary estimate of the dependence between primary and secondary pollutants in Gij\u00f3n urban area at local scale. A second aim was to determine the factors with the greatest bearing on air quality in order to propose health and lifestyle improvements. This support vector regression model captures the main insight of statistical learning theory to obtain a good prediction of the dependence among the main pollutants in Gij\u00f3n urban area since it shows a good agreement between the observed and predicted values of pollutants using statistical estimators as correlation coefficients, mean errors and root mean squared errors.

Electronic Mail: ddulany@s.psych.uiuc.edu Abstract: Connectionism can provide useful theories in which consciousness is the exclusive vehicle of explicit representation. The theories may not, however, handle some phenomena adequately: sense of agency, modes and contents of awareness, propositional and deliberative thought, metacognitive awareness and consciousness of self. They should, however, be useful in describing automatic, activational relations among nonpropositional conscious contents. Connectionism has become a powerful intellectual force, and consciousness is the most significant intellectual challenge facing a number of disciplines. Whatever the limitations of a connectionist approach to consciousness, O'Brien and Opie can be congratulated for bringing forward a provocative and useful thesis for examination. Most significant, I believe, is their case that connectionist metatheory provides for consciousness being an exclusive vehicle of explicit representation. The view is sure to be challenged by those with a deep commitment to a cognitive unconscious that symbolically represents and can act as an independent system. That assumption has been fundamental to standard architectures, from Bower (1975) to Baars (1996). It is also embodied in computational views (e.g. Jackendoff, 1987) holding that consciousness is only a sometime, non-obligatory emergent of fully-formed cognitions. The authors are right to describe serious challenges to that view, but no single paper can undo decades of conceptual confusion and methodological bias in the \"dissociation\" literatures. Suffice it to say now that if claims for the power of a cognitive unconscious were correct, the experimental effects would be too strong and replicable for these literatures even to be controversial. No one can claim that. If we challenge the dissociation thesis, a major value of connectionist metatheory lies in consigning the nonconscious to mental operations and the potentially explicit; the explicit representations and their forming operations become inseparable within the network. This is inconsistent with symbols in an unconscious being essentially like symbols in consciousness, just \"stored\" but separately doing what symbols do while waiting to be \"retrieved.\" But does connectionism provide the computational resources needed for a broad enough vehicle theory of consciousness? And does the authors' conception of \"explicit representation\" capture what we need to recognize in phenomenal experience? We can all consciously symbolize something past in remembrance, something present in perception, or some possible future in an intention or expectation, or even something entirely unreal in imagery.

Early diagnosis of the disease using mining of medical data prevents the inattention of occurrence of sudden CHD events. Today, almost all hospitals are using hospital information system and it has huge volume of patient records. This study results in the development of a decision support system using machine intelligence techniques applied on the medical records stored in hospital databases. Classification algorithms are used to evaluate the accuracy of the early prediction of coronary heart events. The classification techniques analyzed are K-nearest neighbor, decision tree-C4.5, Naive Bayes, and the random forest. The accuracy of each technique is found to be 77, 81, 84, and 89 %, respectively. In this study 10-fold cross-validation method is used to measure the unbiased estimate of these prediction models.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-81-322-2671-0_66", "venue": "Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing", "journal": "Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing", "mag_id": "2346870418", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["54440709", "911004", "3672926"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63091171"}

Instead of concatenating these descriptors to a super vector, a hierarchical heterogeneous descriptor fusion support vector machine (HHDF-SVM) framework is proposed to simultaneously apply heterogeneous descriptors for GERD diagnosis and overcome the curse of dimensionality problem. During validation, heterogeneous descriptors are extracted from test endoscopic images at first. The classification result is obtained by using HHDF-SVM with heterogeneous descriptors.

We design an analytic pipeline which first generates synthetic retinal images from clinical images; a subsequent verification step is applied. In the synthesizing step we merge GANs (DCGANs and WGANs architectures) and style transferring for the image generation, whereas the verified step controls the accuracy of the generated images. We find that the generated images contain sufficient pathological details to facilitate ophthalmologists' task of disease classification and in discovery of disease relevant features.

These phenological metrics were used to classify rubber plantations and forests with the Random Forest classification algorithm. We evaluated which key phenological characteristics were important to discriminate rubber plantations and natural forests by estimating the influence of each metric on the classification accuracy. As a benchmark, we compared the best classification with a classification based on the full, fitted time series data. Overall classification accuracies derived from EVI and SWIR time series alone were 64.4% and 67.9%, respectively. Combining the phenological metrics from EVI and SWIR time series improved the accuracy to 73.5%. Using the full, smoothed time series data instead of metrics derived from the time series improved the overall accuracy only slightly (1.3%), indicating that the phenological metrics were sufficient to explain the seasonal changes captured by the MODIS time series.

One such method is expectation regularization (XR) (Mann and McCallum, 2007), where models are trained based on expected label proportions. We propose a novel application of the XR framework for transfer learning between related tasks, where knowing the labels of task A provides an estimation of the label proportion of task B. We then use a model trained for A to label a large corpus, and use this corpus with an XR loss to train a model for task B.

We demonstrate the approach on the task of Aspect-based Sentiment classification, where we effectively use a sentence-level sentiment predictor to train accurate aspect-based predictor.

In particular, they are really attractive for application in medical domain, where often a lack of knowledge exists. Kernel trick, on which SVMs are based, allows to map non-linearly separable data into potentially linearly separable one, according to the kernel function and its internal parameters value. During recent years non-parametric approaches have also been proposed for learning the most appropriate kernel, such as linear combination of basic kernels. Thus, SVMs classifiers may have several parameters to be tuned and their optimal values are usually difficult to be identified a-priori. Furthermore, combining different classifiers may reduce risk to perform errors on new unseen data. For such reasons, we present an hyper-solution framework for SVM classification, based on meta-heuristics, that searches for the most reliable hyper-classifier (SVM with a basic kernel, SVM with a combination of kernel, and ensemble of SVMs), and for its optimal configuration. We have applied the proposed framework on a critical and quite complex issue for the management of Chronic Heart Failure patient: the early detection of decompensation conditions. In fact, predicting new destabilizations in advance may reduce the burden of heart failure on the healthcare systems while improving quality of life of affected patients.

Current approaches combine the auxiliary datapoints and original training data to train the generalized zero-shot learning model and obtain state-of-the-art results. Inspired by such models, we propose to feed the generated data via a model selection mechanism. Specifically, we leverage two sources of datapoints (observed and auxiliary) to train some classifier to recognize which test datapoints come from seen and which from unseen classes.

Given the availability of massive training samples, deep metric learning is known to suffer from slow convergence due to a large fraction of trivial samples. Therefore, most existing methods generally resort to sample mining strategies for selecting nontrivial samples to accelerate convergence and improve performance. In this work, we identify two critical limitations of the sample mining methods, and provide solutions for both of them. First, previous mining methods assign one binary score to each sample, i.e., dropping or keeping it, so they only selects a subset of relevant samples in a mini-batch. Therefore, we propose a novel sample mining method, called Online Soft Mining (OSM), which assigns one continuous score to each sample to make use of all samples in the mini-batch. OSM learns extended manifolds that preserve useful intraclass variances by focusing on more similar positives. Second, the existing methods are easily influenced by outliers as they are generally included in the mined subset.

We report initial production of a combined deep learning and radiomics model to predict overall survival in a clinically heterogeneous cohort of patients with high-grade gliomas.

Determination of the type of the defect at cable joints can reduce the repair time and maintenance cost. In this project, defect type in cable joint determination using partial discharge testing under noisy condition was carried out. Five joints of cross-linked polyethylene cable including artificial defects were created according to the conditions usually found at site. Various noise reduction techniques were applied to denoise the PD signals and the denoised PD signals were used to determine different types of defect in cable joints. The input features from different noise reduction techniques were applied to train the classifier to determine the type of the problem in the samples.

These features, called runners and risers, are removed by a hazardous manual process known as fettling. They differ in form, size and presence from casting to casting. Unfettled castings tend to be geometrically imprecise and often composed of surfaces of a free-form nature. This makes the automation of the process of fettling difficult as a fixed datum cannot be easily defined. Previous methods to automate the process have centred on directing a robotic tool through a predefined path, irrespective of the nature, or even absence, of any rogue features. We present here a new connectionist model, IvOR (Invariant Object Recogniser), for the adaptive recognition and assessment of free-form 3-D objects. It has been derived as the front-end to an intelligent automated fettling system. IvOR has two distinct phases for learning and recognition. For both phases the initial stages are the same, a surface type map (termed an HK map) is created from the local mean (H) and Gaussian (K) curvatures within the range data representation of an object. The HK map is then passed through a focusing pre-processor to remove positional and scale variance within the input image. In the learning stage the \"focused\" image is learnt by an ART2a Network. In the recognition stage rotational variance (relative to the master representation) is removed by a rotational match network based on the principles of Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART). Assessment for rogue features is done by anovel local matching method based on the local comparison of network weights. IvOR allows adaptation of object representations and learning of new objects, online, with recognition and assessment at speeds acceptable for a manufacturing process.", "year": 1999, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3233/ica-1999-6107", "venue": "Integr.

Sparse LS-SVM is obtained with a pruning procedure. The performance of sparse LS-SVM depends on the selection of hyper-parameters (i.e. kernel and penalty parameters). Currently, CV and LOO are the most common methods to select hyper-parameters for LS-SVM. However, CV is computationally expensive while LOO yields a high variance of validation error which may mislead the selection of hyper-parameters. Selecting both kernel and penalty parameters simultaneously needs to search in a high dimensional parameter space. In this work, we propose a new two-step hyper-parameter selection method. Distance between Two Classes (DBTC) method is adopted to select the kernel parameters based on a maximization of between-class separation of the projected samples in the feature space. However, data distribution could not be helpful in penalty parameter selection. Therefore, we propose to select the penalty parameter via a minimization of a Localized Generalization Error to enhance the generalization capability of the LS-SVM.

Methods Initially, a preprocessing stage based on wavelet denoising electrocardiogram signal scaling is applied. Then, the signal is segmented taking into account the ventricular depolarization timing and a new set of geometrical features are extracted.

Many IMDs are enabled with wireless communication capabilities and can communicate with an outside programmer/reader wirelessly. With the rapid growth of IMDs, IMD security becomes a critical issue since attacks on IMDs may directly harm the patient. Typical IMDs have very limited resource in terms of energy, computation and storage. In this research, we identify a new kind of attacks on IMDs -Resource Depletion (RD) attacks that could deplete IMD resources (e.g., battery power) quickly. The RD attacks could reduce the lifetime of an IMD from several years to a few weeks. The attacks can be easily launched but can not be defended by traditional cryptographic approaches.

In particular, TAKES adopts a novel keyphrase extraction-based query expansion technique to collect promising documents. It also uses a Conditional Random Field-based machine learning technique to extract important biological entities and relations. TAKES is applied to biological knowledge extraction, particularly retrieving promising documents that contain Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) and extracting PPI pairs. TAKES consists of two major components: DocSpotter, which is used to query and retrieve promising documents for extraction, and a Conditional Random Field (CRF)-based entity extraction component known as FCRF. The present paper investigated research problems addressing the issues with a knowledge extraction system and conducted a series of experiments to test our hypotheses. The ndings from the experiments are as follows: First, the author veri ed, using three di erent test collections to measure the performance of our query expansion technique, that DocSpotter is robust and highly accurate when compared to Okapi BM25 and SLIPPER. Second, the author veri ed that our relation extraction algorithm, FCRF, is highly accurate in terms of F-Measure compared to four other competitive extraction algorithms: Support Vector Ma -chine, Maximum Entropy, Single POS HMM, and Rapier.Keywords", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1633/JISTaP.2014.2.1.1", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Information Science Theory and Practice", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2063614128", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8177615", "2818758", "18301907", "12880854", "28575942", "15645051", "519582", "62589788", "7421603", "6953360", "277918", "28022811", "5991216", "11173134", "1446941", "1160159", "8410430", "10437060", "16628332", "45186038", "431089", "16342026"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56354884"}

Much progress has been made to map the extent of flooding with multi-source remote sensing imagery and pattern recognition algorithms. However, urban flood mapping at high spatial resolution remains a major challenge due to three main reasons: (1) the very high resolution (VHR) optical remote sensing imagery often has heterogeneous background involving various ground objects (e.g., vehicles, buildings, roads, and trees), making traditional classification algorithms fail to capture the underlying spatial correlation between neighboring pixels within the flood hazard area; (2) traditional flood mapping methods with handcrafted features as input cannot fully leverage massive available data, which requires robust and scalable algorithms; and (3) due to inconsistent weather conditions at different time of data acquisition, pixels of the same objects in VHR optical imagery could have very different pixel values, leading to the poor generalization capability of classical flood mapping methods. To address this challenge, this paper proposed a residual patch similarity convolutional neural network (ResPSNet) to map urban flood hazard zones using bi-temporal high resolution (3m) pre- and post-flooding multispectral surface reflectance satellite imagery. Besides, remote sensing specific data augmentation was also developed to remove the impact of varying illuminations due to different data acquisition conditions, which in turn further improves the performance of the proposed model. Experiments using the high resolution imagery before and after the 2017 Hurricane Harvey flood in Houston, Texas, showed that the developed ResPSNet model, along with associated remote sensing specific data augmentation method, can robustly produce flood maps over urban areas with high precision (0.9002), recall (0.9302), F1 score (0.9128), and overall accuracy (0.9497).

This paper describes using of a machine learner to automatically extract spans of abbreviations and acronyms from clinical notes and map them to the UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) CUI (Concept Unique Iden- tifier).

The different feature sets were applied with 10-fold cross vali- dation to find the best feature set to create the machine learning model. Second- ly, the identified spans for abbreviation/acronyms were mapped to the UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) CUIs. Thirdly, a rule based engine was applied for disambiguation of terms with multiple abbreviations or acronyms. Approach: A novel supervised learning model was developed that incorpo- rates a machine learning algorithm and a rule-based engine. Evaluation of each step included precision, recall and F-score metrics for span detection and accu- racy for CUI mapping.

In this work, we propose a continuous reservoir that utilizes transient dynamics of coupled chaotic oscillators in a critical regime where sudden amplitude death occurs. This \"explosive death\" not only brings the system a large criticality which provides a variety of orbits for computing, but also stabilizes them which otherwise diverge soon in chaotic units.

This is due to the fact that computer-based automatic gender recognition has multiple applications including, but not limited to, face perception, age, ethnicity, identity analysis, video surveillance and smart human computer interaction. In this paper, we discuss a machine learning approach for efficient identification of gender purely from the dynamics of a person\u2019s smile. Thus, we show that the complex dynamics of a smile on someone\u2019s face bear much relation to the person\u2019s gender. To do this, we first formulate a computational framework that captures the dynamic characteristics of a smile. Our dynamic framework measures changes in the face during a smile using a set of spatial features on the overall face, the area of the mouth, the geometric flow around prominent parts of the face and a set of intrinsic features based on the dynamic geometry of the face. This enables us to extract 210 distinct dynamic smile parameters which form as the contributing features for machine learning. For machine classification, we have utilised both the Support Vector Machine and the k-Nearest Neighbour algorithms. To verify the accuracy of our approach, we have tested our algorithms on two databases, namely the CK+ and the MUG, consisting of a total of 109 subjects. As a result, using the k-NN algorithm, along with tenfold cross validation, for example, we achieve an accurate gender classification rate of over 85%.

However, using unclassified point clouds with building footprints to estimate building heights may yield erroneous results due to potential errors and anomalies in both datasets and their integration. Some of the points within footprints often reflect irrelevant objects other than roofs, leading to biases in height estimation, and few studies have developed systematic methods to filter them out. In this paper, a LiDAR point classification methodology is proposed that extracts only rooftop points for building height estimation. The LiDAR points are characterized by point, footprint, and neighborhood-based features and classified by the Random Forest (RF) algorithm into four classes \u2013 rooftop, wall, ground, and high outlier. The percentage of correctly classified points among 15,577 sample points in Columbus, Ohio, amounts to 96.5%. Conducting this classification separately for different building types (commercial, residential, skyscraper, and small constructions) does not significantly change the overall accuracy. The footprint-based features contribute most to predicting the classes correctly. Height validation results based on a sample of 498 buildings show that (1) using average or median heights with classified points provides the best estimates, minimizing the disparities between computed heights and ground truth and (2) the RF method yields outcomes much closer to ground truth than earlier classification approaches.

This large number of features can lead to suboptimal classification performance and increased computation time. Feature selection, whereby only a subset of the original features are used for building a classification model, is the most commonly used technique to counter high dimensionality. One category of feature selection called wrapper-based techniques employ a classifier to directly find the subset of features which performs best. Unfortunately, noise can negatively impact the effectiveness of data mining techniques and subsequently lead to suboptimal results. Class noise in particular has a detrimental effect on the classification performance, making datasets perform poorly across a wide range of classifiers (i.e. Having a high \"\"\"\"difficulty-of-learning.\"\"\"\"). No previous work has examined the effectiveness of wrapper-based feature selection when learning from real world high dimensional gene expression datasets in the context of difficulty-of-learning due to noise. To study this effectiveness, we perform experiments using ten gene expression datasets which was first determined to be easy-to-learn-from then had artificial class noise injected in a controlled fashion creating three levels of difficulty-of-learning (Easy, Moderate, and Hard). Using the Naive Bayes learner, we perform wrapper feature selection followed by classification, using four classifiers (Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron, 5-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machines), and we compare these results to the classification performance without feature selection. The results show that wrapper-based feature selection effectiveness depends on the choice of learner: for Multilayer Perceptron, wrapper selection improved performance compared to not using feature selection, while for Naive Bayes it slightly reduced performance and for the remaining learners it further reduced performance. Because its performance relative to no feature selection varied depending on the choice of learner, we recommend that wrapper selection be at least considered in future bioinformatics experiments, especially if the goal is gene discovery not classification. Also, as dimensionality reduction techniques are not only useful but necessary for high-dimensional bioinformatics datasets, the no-feature-selection case may not be feasible in practice.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BIBE.2014.62", "venue": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering", "journal": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1990214975", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17178983", "2382325", "1477778", "6778315", "18862444", "77139", "6054025", "379259", "60577818", "16319759", "17890742", "5791212", "15494001", "28436517", "15705187", "5467854", "18885326", "140109802", "3331253"], "inbound_citations": ["67866846", "51919199", "57362788"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13032262"}

With the increasing proportion of multimodal tweets consisting of images, texts, and emoticons, new challenges have been raised to the existing sentiment prediction schemes. More crucially, it remains an open problem to model the dependency among multiple modalities, where one or more modalities may be missing. In this paper, we present a novel Bi-layer Multimodal Hypergraph learning (Bi-MHG) toward robust sentiment prediction of multimodal tweets to tackle the above challenges. In particular, we design a two-layer structure for the proposed Bi-MHG model: The first layer, that is, a tweet-level hypergraph, learns the tweet-feature correlation and the tweet relevance to predict the sentiments of unlabeled tweets. The second layer, that is, a feature-level hypergraph learns the relevance among different feature modalities (including the midlevel visual features in Sentibank [1] ) by leveraging prior multimodal sentiment dictionaries. These two layers are connected by sharing the relevance of multimodal features in a unified bilayer learning scheme.

Even though, there is a wide range of numerical models to estimate coefficient of longitudinal dispersion, these mathematical techniques may often come in quite few inaccuracies due to complex mechanism of convection-diffusion processes in pollutant transition in water pipelines. In this research work, to obtain more accurate prediction of LDC, general structure of group method of data handling (GMDH) is modified by means of extreme learning machine (ELM) conceptions. In fact, with getting inspiration from ELM, a novel GMDH method, called GMDH network based on using extreme learning machine (GMDH-ELM), is proposed in which weighting coefficients of quadratic polynomials applied in conventional GMDH are no longer required to be updated either using back propagation technique or other evolutionary algorithms through training stage. In fact, an intermediate parameter is employed to establish a relationship between the input and output in each neuron of the GMDH model. In this way, a well-known and reliable dataset (233 experimental data) related to LDC in water network pipelines, as output vector, is applied to conduct training and testing phases. Through datasets, the Re number, the average longitudinal flow velocity, the friction factor of pipeline and the diameter of pipe are considered as inputs of the proposed approach. The results of GMDH-ELM model indicate a highly satisfying level of precision in both training and testing phases. Furthermore, feed forward structure of GMDH model was improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and gravitational search algorithm (GSA) to predict LDC. Through a sound judgment, a comparison is drawn between the performance of GMDH-ELM and other developed GMDH models. Moreover, several empirical equations existing in literature have been applied for comparisons.

Current potato varieties are highly susceptible to drought stress. In view of global climate change, selection of cultivars with improved drought tolerance and high yield potential is of paramount importance. Drought tolerance breeding of potato is currently based on direct selection according to yield and phenotypic traits and requires multiple trials under drought conditions. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) is cheaper, faster and reduces classification errors caused by noncontrolled environmental effects. We analysed 31 potato cultivars grown under optimal and reduced water supply in six independent field trials. Drought tolerance was determined as tuber starch yield. Leaf samples from young plants were screened for preselected transcript and nontargeted metabolite abundance using qRT-PCR and GC-MS profiling, respectively. Transcript marker candidates were selected from a published RNA-Seq data set. A Random Forest machine learning approach extracted metabolite and transcript markers for drought tolerance prediction with low error rates of 6% and 9%, respectively. Moreover, by combining transcript and metabolite markers, the prediction error was reduced to 4.3%. Feature selection from Random Forest models allowed model minimization, yielding a minimal combination of only 20 metabolite and transcript markers that were successfully tested for their reproducibility in 16 independent agronomic field trials. We demonstrate that a minimum combination of transcript and metabolite markers sampled at early cultivation stages predicts potato yield stability under drought largely independent of seasonal and regional agronomic conditions.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5866952", "pubmed_id": "28929574", "doi": "10.1111/pbi.12840", "venue": "Plant Biotechnology Journal", "journal": "Plant Biotechnology Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2755811281", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["84232620", "17881491", "207645", "43027008", "88242", "22369897", "477483", "31166870", "6287716", "43638323", "6384811", "83422656", "324684", "3379276", "153336019", "114744111", "18476918", "2583017", "60488129", "5016503", "14045446", "2901317", "214897192", "3093707", "21160159", "83785283", "1556107", "156297249", "83873376", "922915", "16231146", "8939003", "14170500", "31129264", "18585726", "9694162", "85072084", "41744542", "6636009", "205559368", "34561934", "10898225", "201300", "86366958"], "inbound_citations": ["211534802", "212743049", "215049711", "209588613", "49406273", "53290643", "92520661", "195795902", "215418518", "209357665"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4396523"}

It has been suggested that the brain engages in Bayesian inference during perception but how such probabilistic representations are used to select actions has remained unclear. Here we propose a neural model of action selection and decision making based on the theory of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Actions are selected based not on a single \u201coptimal\u201d estimate of state but on the posterior distribution over states (the \u201cbelief\u201d state). We show how such a model provides a unified framework for explaining experimental results in decision making that involve both information gathering and overt actions. The model utilizes temporal difference (TD) learning for maximizing expected reward. The resulting neural architecture posits an active role for the neocortex in belief computation while ascribing a role to the basal ganglia in belief representation, value computation, and action selection. When applied to the random dots motion discrimination task, model neurons representing belief exhibit responses similar to those of LIP neurons in primate neocortex. The appropriate threshold for switching from information gathering to overt actions emerges naturally during reward maximization. Additionally, the time course of reward prediction error in the model shares similarities with dopaminergic responses in the basal ganglia during the random dots task. For tasks with a deadline, the model learns a decision making strategy that changes with elapsed time, predicting a collapsing decision threshold consistent with some experimental studies. The model provides a new framework for understanding neural decision making and suggests an important role for interactions between the neocortex and the basal ganglia in learning the mapping between probabilistic sensory representations and actions that maximize rewards.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2998859", "pubmed_id": "21152255", "doi": "10.3389/fncom.2010.00146", "venue": "Front.

The success of the SVM is mostly due to its elegant margin concept and theory in binary classification. Generalization to the multicategory setting, however, is not trivial. There are a number of different multicategory extensions of the SVM in the literature. In this paper, we review several commonly used extensions and Fisher consistency of these extensions. For inconsistent extensions, we propose two approaches to make them Fisher consistent, one is to add bounded constraints and the other is to truncate unbounded hinge losses. 1 Background on Binary SVM The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a well known large margin classifier and has achieved great success in many applications (Vapnik, 1998, Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000, and Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, 2000). The basic concept behind the binary SVM is to search a separating hyperplane with maximum separation between the two classes. Suppose a training dataset containing n training pairs {xi, yi}i=1, i.i.d realizations from a probability distribution P (x, y), is given. The goal is to search for a linear function f(x) = w \u2032 x + b so that sign(f(x)) can be used for prediction of labels for new inputs. The SVM aims to find such an f so that points of class +1 and points of class \u22121 are best separated. In particular, for the separable case, the SVM\u2019s solution maximizes the distance between f(x) = \u00b11 subject to yif(xi) \u2265 1; i = 1, . . . , n. This distance can be expressed as 2 \u2016w\u2016 and is known as the geometric margin. When perfect separation between two classes is not feasible, slack variables \u03bei; i = 1, . . . , n, can be used to measure the amount of violation of the original constraints. Then the SVM solves the following optimization problem: min w,b 1 2 \u2016w\u20162 + C n \u2211", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "AISTATS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1531180237,2605751635,2398429633", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["2833811", "10151608", "14727192", "15874442", "7087225", "15133424", "122184372", "951428", "28637672", "118677895", "15059183", "18573938", "15413835"], "inbound_citations": ["89609080", "59470790", "18221370", "12413651", "214704924", "3094788", "40630388", "117325013", "351824", "211021042", "13197707", "16479954", "10913546", "12435258", "88515113", "17520393", "198431169", "4515406", "4517081", "15505139", "9215575", "71151506", "10052495", "210473566", "88511721", "88517893", "53957208", "53232072", "12246009", "12415639", "3140763", "6475282", "17729265", "4228580", "2328675", "16993540", "39755600", "4471512", "225244", "44518796", "56177574", "15409845", "15684489", "32221878", "7055565"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18876084"}

State-of-the-art hyperspectral image classification algorithms use the dependencies in a heuristic way or in probabilistic frameworks but impose unreasonable assumptions on observed data. In this paper, we formulate a conditional random field (CRF) to replace such heuristics and unreasonable assumptions for the classification of hyperspectral images. Moreover, because of avoiding explicit modeling of the observed data, the proposed method can incorporate the classification of hyperspectral images with different statistics characteristics into a unified probabilistic framework. Since the usual classification task for hyperspectral images needs the proposed CRF to be trained on local samples, available global training methods cannot be directly used. Under piecewise training framework, this paper develops an efficient local method to train the CRF. It is efficiently implemented through separated training of simple classifiers defined by corresponding potentials. However, the independent classifier training may lead to over-counting problems during inference. So we further propose a strategy to combine the independently trained models to obtain final CRF model. Experiments on real-world hyperspectral data show that our algorithm is competitive with the most recent results in hyperspectral image classification.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "20236900", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2010.2045034", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2166229804", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["13879369", "12666682", "10800171", "5080495", "16993255", "37082642", "53745285", "206786900", "122533617", "44803526", "2149922", "15049946", "7443466", "8184980", "38343266", "13273116", "1408251", "15590248", "5571990", "3189198", "1745442", "2606623", "15360746", "116757950", "8559332", "2932038", "13154466", "6934721", "6958332", "10689850", "206688291", "9389968", "9759858", "11098988", "28824442", "7117722", "25623004", "14495716", "6906514", "20249964", "229594", "22699992", "277918", "11937426", "122868590", "5927350", "1662982", "53303132", "8122137"], "inbound_citations": ["49410696", "125514806", "126556283", "198172779", "126016251", "21861535", "23217046", "13587986", "3408395", "3693618", "4271039", "10712715", "21075725", "9133706", "15638863", "8389575", "8194204", "208224773", "36479504", "84186630", "4149981", "52159015", "160011983", "454589", "9905454", "25006293", "52166566", "9866582", "21834013", "8769962", "21245572", "3544458", "52106580", "26277487", "51965250", "152282365", "52903508", "19225801", "13440558", "1537057", "52188577", "29518892", "16881644", "134393408", "2614253", "24511674", "7908891", "209924129", "67864344", "62224977", "21584177", "8185553", "35410259", "149728579", "4840483", "4108161", "123288799", "9705204", "3646890", "104293450", "19162991", "203000552", "24118584", "5856281", "4290580", "18720912", "4629611", "4772712", "20603010", "4175692", "9362608", "213187975", "53232612", "111919044", "16971704", "51965264", "15410401"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16828020"}

Four microalgae species, including Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Nannochloropsis oculata, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, were chosen as the experimental materials. Using an established spectral acquisition system, which consists of a portable USB 4000 spectrometer having transmitting and receiving fiber bundles connected by a fiber optic probe, a halogen light source, and a computer, the Vis/NIR transmission spectral data of 120 different samples of the microalgae with different concentration gradients were collected, and the spectral curves of fourmicroalgae species were pre-processed by different pre-treatment methods (baseline filtering, convolution smoothing, etc. ). Based on the pre-treated effects, SPA was applied to select effective wavelengths (EWs), and the selected EWs were introduced as inputs to develop and compare PLS, Least Square Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)models, so as to explore the feasibility of using Vis/NIR transmission spectroscopy technology for the rapid identification of four microalgae species in situ. The results showed that: the effect of Savitzky-Golay smoothing was much better than the other pre-treatment methods. Six EWs selected in the spectraby SPA were possibly relevant to the content of carotenoids, chlorophyll in the microalgae. Moreover, the SPA-PLS model obtained better performance than the Full-Spectral-PLS model. The average prediction accuracy of three methods including SPA-LV-SVM, SPA-ELM, and SPA-PLS were 80%, 85% and 65%. The established method in this study may identify four microalgae species effectively, which provides a new way for the identification and classification of the microalgae species.

Most applications use networks pre-trained on noise-free RGB image datasets, what is observed even when the target domain counts on grayscale images or when data is degraded by noise. In this paper, we evaluate the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on such transfer learning scenarios and the impact of using RGB trained networks on grayscale image tasks. Our results confirm that the use of networks trained using colored images on grayscale tasks hinders the overall performance when compared to a similar network trained on a quantized version of the original dataset.

Although traditional scene understanding provides good performance of object recognition and semantic segmentation, it tells us little about physical relation interpretation. Meanwhile, there are few methods to demonstrate the contextual relations among objects in the scene. While some of them artificially define prior constrains and solve the equation by minimizing the objective function, others aim at perceiving the stability of 3D blocks to classify the support relation to several classes. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed which can automatically get the prior knowledge based on deep learning and Conditional Random Fields(CRF) to infer support relationship.

In these applications, so as to collapse the system, the malevolent nodes may create enormous amount of traffic. In order to identify and prevent the intrusion activities, there are numerous researches that are presented by diverse researchers. LEoNIDS: architecture solves the energy-latency tradeoff by giving minimum power utilization as well as minimum detection latency all at once. However LEoNIDS architecture focus on the latency but not the precise detection of intrusion. This work resolves these issues by presenting the technique called Attack Feature based Fast and Accurate Intrusion Detection System (AF-FAIDS). This work presents a solution that enables intrusion detection in an effective way with enhanced delay and latency parameter. This also track and eliminate the intrusion attack existing in the system in an effective way with guaranteed energy saving. By using Machine learning, methods like Support Vector Machine, attack detection ratio is enhanced that would learn the attacks features in an effective way. Those features, which are taken in this presented technique, are Average Length of IP Flow, One-Way Connection Density, Incoming and Outgoing Ratio of IP Packets, Entropy of Protocols as well as Length in IP Flow. This technique provides the precise and quicker identification of intrusion attacks that will decrease the latency.

Though extremely effective, SVMs are not a panacea. SVM training and testing is computationally expensive. Also, tuning the kernel parameters is a complicated procedure. On the other hand, the Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier is computationally efficient. In order to achieve the classification efficiency of an SVM and the computational efficiency of a KNN classifier, it has been shown previously that, rather than training a single global SVM, a separate SVM can be trained for the neighbourhood of each query point. In this work, we have extended this Local SVM (LSVM) formulation. Our Local Adaptive SVM (LASVM) formulation trains a local SVM in a modified neighborhood space of a query point. The main contributions of the paper are twofold: First, we present a novel LASVM algorithm to train a local SVM. Second, we discuss in detail the motivations behind the LSVM and LASVM formulations and its possible impacts on tuning the kernel parameters of an SVM. We found that training an SVM in a local adaptive neighborhood can result in significant classification performance gain.

The SVM method has been chosen to further improve the accuracy of the correlations that were developed by Ghajar and his co-workers using the traditional least-squares method (Ghajar and Tam, 1994) and more recently the artificial neural networks (ANN) method (Ghajar et al., 2004). Using the ANN method improved the accuracy of their correlation. However, there are drawbacks associated with ANN method. One of the major problems with the ANN method is that it does not provide a unique correlation due to different coefficient matrices. The SVM method used in this study eliminated the drawbacks associated with the ANN method and provided a unique correlation with comparable accuracy as the ANN method. For the experimental data used, majority of the data points were predicted within 5% deviation. Comparisons were made regarding the accuracy of the developed correlation and its characteristic using SVM and ANN methods.

They, however, have difficulty in classifying several sleep stages because of the resemblance of EEG signals, especially, REM and Non-REM1 (N1) stage.

It is estimated that in 2012, 1,638, 910 people will be diagnosed with cancer, which remains the second most common cause of death in the US. NIH estimates from 2007 put the overall cost of cancer that year as $226.8 billion in direct and indirect costs. This dissertation explored selected cancers, focusing on women's cancers: breast, cervical, melanoma (which has higher incidence and incidence increase in women); and new investigational approaches for translational research using optical imaging and image processing techniques. It is well known that the established criteria for cytology and even histopathology, long considered the gold standard for diagnosis, are subjective and suffer from difficulties with interpretation. ::: This dissertation contains a step wise progression of in situ -in vivo approaches to various challenges in pathology applications towards a proposed combination of multi-spectral imaging methods and image analysis techniques to create a prototype automated computer-aided system towards the diagnosis of cancer using digitized multispectral slides. The techniques have been applied to many areas from fresh stained and unstained breast tissue to in vivo imaging of lesions suspected to be melanoma. There are several original contributions: first, a quantitative assessment of the utility of various multispectral devices and imagery for segmentation and classification tasks in pathology. Next, tissue level and object level segmentation algorithms are developed for various histological classes along with quantitative metrics. In addition, references of both tissue, spatial, and object level features are extracted to create a comprehensive feature selection framework for classification of objects and images. The tools, algorithms, and methods described are for quantifying molecular changes in light microscope images of cellular structures indicative of cancer or precancerous lesions. ::: For the cervical and melanoma applications object level features as implemented are versatile and useful to extract important features even from relatively inaccurately segmented images. In addition, the use of non-nuclear features, like features of the cytoplasm and stroma has very good classification performance when compared to commercial devices. The system is in two parts: the segmentation of squamous epithelium and the subsequent diagnosis of CIN. For the segmentation of squamous epithelium, to save processing time, a multi-resolution method is developed to segment cervical virtual slides. ::: The nuclei segmentation method uses robust texture features in combination with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform classification. Medical histology rules are finally applied to remove misclassifications. In tests using 31 virtual slides, the segmentation achieves an average accuracy of more than 94.25%. Training nuclei are spectrally classified into Normal, CIN I, CIN II and CIN III. The final diagnosis for a slide region is based on combining the classification of nuclei and classical morphologic features. .The robustness of the system in terms of regional diagnosis is measured against slides manually classified by three pathologists. Results indicate that the multispectral imaging system offers a promising basis for a computer-assisted diagnostic tool. Its main limitation is seen to be in the selection of more extensive and more varied training data.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "92216559", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["4812577", "30021850", "81788546", "202158424"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67995119"}

In fact, the experiments we have realized so far, involving different datasets from the UCI repository, reveal that the proper choice of the prototypes can be a rather determinant issue to leverage the classifier\u2019s performance.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-90-481-3658-2_66", "venue": "SCSS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1527618536", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["140109802", "61314536", "10776502", "9838089", "209099422", "60461418", "59916112", "2989237", "61074523", "110590318", "27339479"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9248562"}

Errors created during sequencing and library preparation make variant calling a difficult task. Encoding the reference genome and aligned reads covering sites of genetic variation as numeric tensors allows us to leverage CNNs for variant filtration. Convolutions over these tensors learn to detect motifs useful for classifying variants. Variant filtering models are trained to classify variants as artifacts or real variation. Visualizing the learned weights of the CNN confirmed it detects familiar DNA motifs known to correlate with real variation, like homopolymers and short tandem repeats. After confirmation of the biological plausibility of the learned features we compared our model to current state-of-the-art filtration methods like Gaussian Mixture Models, Random Forests, and CNNs designed for image classification, like DeepVariant. We demonstrate improvements in both sensitivity and precision. The tensor encoding was carefully tailored for processing genomic data, respecting the qualitative differences in structure between DNA and natural images. Ablation tests quantitatively measured the benefits of our tensor encoding strategy. Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization confirmed our notion that architectures designed with DNA data in mind outperform off-the-shelf image classification models.

We envision using the results of our method to reduce the three-dimensional search space of ab initio methods. Our method is based on the signature molecular descriptor, which has been used previously to predict protein-protein interactions successfully, and to develop quantitative structure-activity relationships for small organic drugs and peptide inhibitors. Here, we show how the signature descriptor can be used in a Support Vector Machine to predict whether or not two beta-strands will pack adjacently within a protein. We then show how these predictions can be used to order beta-strands within beta-sheets. Using the entire PDB database with ten-fold cross-validation, we have achieved 74.0% accuracy in packing prediction and 75.6% accuracy in the prediction of edge strands. For the case of beta-strand ordering, we are able to predict the correct ordering accurately for 51.3% of the beta-sheets. Furthermore, using a simple confidence metric, we can determine those sheets for which accurate predictions can be obtained.

We have shown Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FTIR) is useful [1] and now combine it Mass Spectrometry (MS) to investigate novel biomarkers in lung cancer (LC). METHODS: Spontaneous sputum was collected from 23 patients with LC+ (17 NSCLC, 6 SCLC, 1 clinico-radiological diagnosis) and 33 healthy controls (LC-). Samples were analysed using flow infusion electrospray ion mass spectrometry. Data-mining of the derived metabolite profiles using artificial neural networks and receiver operating characteristic / area under the curve (ROC/AUC) were calculated. RESULTS: LC+ class could be detected when compared to LC- with an accuracy of 0.68, LC- versus controls with an accuracy of 0.85 and LC + vs LC - with an accuracy of 0.79. Further datamining based on Random Forest identified metabolites with AUC values of > 0.8 which distinguished between LC + /LC - and included the metabolite Ganglioside GM1, involved in cellular membrane turnover and which has previously been linked to LC [2]. CONCLUSION: Non-invasive metabolomic approaches based on sputum are feasible, can differentiate lung cancer from controls and can identify specific discriminating metabolites. These offer potential for diagnosis and identifying biological targets for intervention.

The proposed method leverages an adversarial searching mechanism to search for the architectures of generator and discriminator simultaneously in a differentiable manner. Therefore, the searching algorithm considers the relevance and balance between the two networks leading to search for a superior generative model.

The objective of the present study was to develop a multianalyte serum algorithm predictive of disease recurrence in stage I NSCLC patients. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The Luminex immunobead platform was used to evaluate 43 biomarkers against 79 patients with resectable NSCLC, with the following cohorts represented: stage I (T(1)-T(2)N(0)M(0)) NSCLC without recurrence (n = 37), stage I (T(1)-T(2)N(0)M(0)) NSCLC with recurrence (n = 15), and node-positive (T(1)-T(2)N(1)-N(2)M(0)) NSCLC (n = 27). Peripheral blood was collected before surgery, with all patients undergoing anatomic resection. Univariate statistical methods (receiver operating characteristics curves and log-rank test) were used to evaluate each biomarker with respect to recurrence and outcome. Multivariate statistical methods were used to develop a prognostic classification panel for disease recurrence. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: No relationship was found between recurrence and age, gender, smoking history, or histologic type. Analysis for all stage I patients revealed 28 biomarkers significant for recurrence. Of these, the log-rank test identified 10 biomarkers that were strongly (P < .01) prognostic for recurrence. The Random Forest algorithm created a 6-analyte panel for preoperative classification that accurately predicted recurrence in 77% of stage I patients tested, with a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 79%. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: We report the development of a serum biomarker algorithm capable of preoperatively predicting disease recurrence in stage I NSCLC patients.

It incorporates the features of complex business processing and sophisticated in-memory processing techniques for speed and throughput. These systems are distributed in nature, and they use a large number of processing nodes incorporating fault tolerance mechanisms. Complex systems also have a large effective number of strongly interdependent variables. Hence detecting faults and failures in stock market systems is a complex and cumbersome task. The study explores machine learning techniques to detect anomalous behavior to provide warnings before a system results in a fault or failure state. The study extensively utilizes a supervised learning approach with machine learning algorithms such as C4.5, Naive Bayes, and ensemble techniques; bagging and Random Forest. The system statistics captured from log files are preprocessed and transformed to eliminate system environment dependencies. For each of the three components the initial feature selection is carried out manually using domain knowledge and expertise. Initial feature selection based on domain expertise was required as the number of features per component is large and does not closely relate to the system state. Feature selection methods (Info Gain algorithm with Ranker search) have been successfully employed to filter out unrelated attributes and to reduce computational complexity. A comparative evaluation is performed under each component status prediction. This study also utilizes oversampling techniques to overcome limitations caused by the class imbalance phenomena. A range of evaluators are used to analyze the results and effectiveness of the models. The highest accuracy and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) values are achieved when C4.5 decision tree is applied to the oversampled feature set and when the Random Forest algorithm is applied to the oversampled feature set.

Whereas prior studies examined either early setting of \"global\" biases for a specific problem taken as a whole (which learning method/algorithm is most appropriate to a finding a \"cover\" for a particular training set) or setting of localized parameters as an algorithm proceeds (e.g., adjusting weights on rules), this work takes a different approach. First, a generalized framework for SBL classification algorithms is proposed. This allows existing biases of several algorithms to be unified and consolidated under one roof, with the original algorithms corresponding to specific settings of \"bias switches\". Thus the meta-algorithm spans existing biases, but still allows a user to assert specific preferences. Secondly, heuristics are added to the framework to adjust biases according to progress of the biases in solving a learning problem at hand. Thirdly, problems are broken into subproblems in which the prevailing biases are allowed to differ. This permits a higher degree of structure than previously possible in a solution as well as promising more efficiency on problems that can be viewed as a composition of subproblems. Yet, it is more than a matter of pasting together previous learning algorithms. In order to identify that structure, care must be taken to isolate the learning subproblems--for example, to ensure that the quasioptimal quantization of numerical values for one subproblem does not obscure the pattern of values present in another subproblem. This particular difficulty is handled through a flexible value aggregation scheme which is an integral part of the framework mentioned above. ::: The experimental agenda includes 3 sets of studies: 2 which are more artificial and controlled, and another which is more realistic. In the first sets, to demonstrate the utility of being adaptive to subproblems bias, problems with known structure are synthesized by a problem generator. In the real-world study set (Sparks, Engine Design, Annealing), there is known to be considerable noise, and dealing with numerical values is a strong consideration.

Therefore, spectral data matrix processing is critical for quantitative LIBS analysis. A prevalent assumption when constructing a matrix approximation is that the partially observed matrix is of low-rank. Moreover, the low-rank structure always reflects the useful information and is regarded as a powerful data preprocessing method. In this paper, a novel and quantitative LIBS analysis method based on a sparse low-rank matrix approximation via convex optimization is proposed. Based on the sparsity of the spectral signals, we present a convex objective function consisting of a data-fidelity term and two parameterized penalty terms. To improve the accuracy of the quantitative analysis, a new non-convex and non-separable penalty based on the Moreau envelope is proposed. Then, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm was utilized to solve the optimization problem.

Most current routine diagnostic methods are costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. Although T. gondii can be directly observed under the microscope in tissue or spinal fluid samples, this form of identification is difficult and requires well-trained professionals. Nevertheless, the traditional identification of parasites under the microscope is still performed by a large number of laboratories. Novel, efficient, and reliable methods of T. gondii identification are therefore needed, particularly in developing countries. To this end, we developed a novel transfer learning-based microscopic image recognition method for T. gondii identification. This approach employs the fuzzy cycle generative adversarial network (FCGAN) with transfer learning utilizing knowledge gained by parasitologists that Toxoplasma is banana or crescent shaped. Our approach aims to build connections between microscopic and macroscopic associated objects by embedding the fuzzy C-means cluster algorithm into the cycle generative adversarial network (Cycle GAN). Our approach achieves 93.1% and 94.0% detection accuracy for \u00d7400 and \u00d71,000 Toxoplasma microscopic images, respectively. We showed the high accuracy and effectiveness of our approach in newly collected unlabeled Toxoplasma microscopic images, compared to other currently available deep learning methods. This novel method for Toxoplasma microscopic image recognition will open a new window for developing cost-effective and scalable deep learning-based diagnostic solutions, potentially enabling broader clinical access in developing countries. IMPORTANCEToxoplasma gondii, one of the world\u2019s most common parasites, can infect all types of warm-blooded animals, including one-third of the world\u2019s human population. Artificial intelligence (AI) could provide accurate and rapid diagnosis in fighting Toxoplasma. So far, none of the previously reported deep learning methods have attempted to explore the advantages of transfer learning for Toxoplasma detection.

We then used the Random Forests tree-based classifier to discriminate species with minimally-correlated, importance-ranked metrics. At all scales, best overall accuracies were achieved with metrics derived from all four techniques and that targeted chemical and structural properties across the visible to shortwave infrared spectrum (400\u20132500 nm). For tissue spectra, overall accuracies were 86.8% for leaves, 74.2% for bark, and 84.9% for leaves plus bark. Variation in tissue metrics was best explained by an axis of red absorption related to photosynthetic leaves and an axis distinguishing bark water and other chemical absorption features. Overall accuracies for individual tree crowns were 71.5% for pixel spectra, 70.6% crown-mean spectra, and 87.4% for a pixel-majority technique.

Here we investigated classifier performance under different sample sizes, reference class distribution, and scene complexities. Twenty six 10 km \u00d7 10 km blocks with complete reference information across the continental US are used. Per-pixel classification took place using six spectral bands from Landsat imagery. The tested classifiers included Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Bootstrap-aggregation ensemble of decision trees (BagTE), artificial neural network up to 2 hidden layers, and deep neural network (DNN) up to 3 hidden layers. For the entire block, our accuracy assessment indicated that all classifiers, with the exception of NB (a Maximum Likelihood variant), performed similarly. However, when we concentrated on edge pixels (pixels at the border of adjacent land cover classes), it was clear that the SVM and KNN offer considerable accuracy advantages, especially for larger reference datasets. Because of their relatively low execution times SVM and KNN would be recommended for classifications using Landsat's spectral inputs and Anderson's 11-level classification scheme. However, both SVM and KNN demonstrated substantial accuracy degradation during the parameter grid search. For this reason, an exhaustive parameter optimization process is suggested.

For that purpose, these analyses combine information provided by linkage disequilibrium, linkage and/or genealogy through a set of heuristic rules or, most often, by a hidden Markov model. Here, we develop an extremely randomized trees framework to address the issue of local haplotype matching. In our approach, a supervised classifier using extra-trees (a particular type of random forests) learns how to identify the best local matches between haplotypes using a collection of observed examples. For each example, various features related to the different sources of information are observed, such as the length of a segment shared between haplotypes, or estimates of relationships between individuals, gametes, and haplotypes. The random forests framework was fed with 30 relevant features for local haplotype matching. Repeated cross-validations allowed ranking these features in regard to their importance for local haplotype matching. The distance to the edge of a segment shared by both haplotypes being matched was found to be the most important feature. Similarity comparisons between predicted and true whole-genome sequence haplotypes showed that the random forests framework was more efficient than a hidden Markov model in reconstructing a target haplotype as a mosaic of reference haplotypes. To further evaluate its efficiency, the random forests framework was applied to imputation of whole-genome sequence from 50k genotypes and it yielded average reliabilities similar or slightly better than IMPUTE2. Through this exploratory study, we lay the foundations of a new framework to automatically learn local haplotype matching and we show that extra-trees are a promising approach for such purposes. The use of this new technique also reveals some useful lessons on the relevant features for the purpose of haplotype matching.

One of the approaches of DFU treatment depends on the attentiveness of clinicians and patients. This treatment approach has drawbacks such as the high cost of the diagnosis as well as the length of treatment. Although this approach gives powerful results, the need for a remote, cost-effective, and convenient DFU diagnosis approach is urgent. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset of 754-ft images which contain healthy skin and skin with a diabetic ulcer from different patients. A novel Deep Convolutional Neural Network, DFU_QUTNet, is also proposed for the automatic classification of normal skin (healthy skin) class versus abnormal skin (DFU) class. Stacking more layers to a traditional Convolutional Neural Network to make it very deep does not lead to better performance, instead leading to worse performance due to the gradient. Therefore, our proposed DFU_QUTNet network is designed based on the idea of increasing the width of the network while keeping the depth compared to the state-of-the-art networks. Our network has been proven to be very beneficial for gradient propagation, as the error can be back-propagated through multiple paths. It also helps to combine different levels of features at each step of the network. Features extracted by DFU_QUTNet network are used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers. For the sake of comparison, we have fine-tuned then re-trained and tested three pre-trained deep learning networks (GoogleNet, VGG16, and AlexNet) for the same task.

The exergetic data were computed using mass, energy, and exergy balance equations for the engine at different speeds and loads as well as various biodiesel and EPS wastes quantities. Three statistical indicators namely root means square error, coefficient of determination and Pearson coefficient were used to access the capability of the developed approaches for exergetic performance modelling of the DI diesel engine. The modelling results indicated that the SVM-WT approach was more efficient in exergetic modelling of the engine than the other three approaches.

Connectionist computational models are one of the most popular approaches for simulating those mapping problems; however, their lack of explanatory ability has prevented them from being further used to understand the language learning process. Therefore, the work of extracting rational rules from a connectionist model is as important as simulating the mapping behaviors. Unfortunately, there is no available technique that can be directly applied in those computational models to simulate nonclassification problems. In this paper, an autoencoder-based connectionist computational model is proposed to derive a rule extraction method that can construct \u201cIf-Then\u201d rational relations with high fidelity for nonclassification mapping problems. To demonstrate its generalizability, this computational model is extended to a modified version to address a multi-label classification mapping problem related to cognitive style prediction. Experiments prove this computational model's simulation ability and its explanatory ability on nonclassification problems by comparing its fidelity performances with those of the classical connectionist computational model (multilayer perceptron artificial neural network), and its similar ability on a multi-label classification problem (Felder-Silverman learning style classification) by comparing its prediction accuracy with those of other rule induction techniques.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1002/cpe.4262", "venue": "Concurr.

Most classification models are ::: devoted to a static environment where the complete training data set is presented to the ::: classification algorithm. This data set is assumed to cover all information needed to ::: learn the pertinent concepts (rules and patterns) related to how to classify unseen ::: examples to predefined classes. However, in dynamic (non-stationary) domains, the set ::: of features (input data attributes) may change over time. For instance, some features ::: that are considered significant at time Ti might become useless or irrelevant at time Ti+j. ::: This situation results in a phenomena called Virtual Concept Drift. Yet, the set of ::: features that are dropped at time Ti+j might return to become significant again in the ::: future. Such a situation results in the so-called Cyclical Concept Drift, which is a direct ::: result of the frequently called catastrophic forgetting dilemma. Catastrophic forgetting ::: happens when the learning of new knowledge completely removes the previously ::: learned knowledge. ::: Phishing is a dynamic classification problem where a virtual concept drift might occur. ::: Yet, the virtual concept drift that occurs in phishing might be guided by some ::: malevolent intelligent agent rather than occurring naturally. One reason why phishers ::: keep changing the features combination when creating phishing websites might be that ::: they have the ability to interpret the anti-phishing tool and thus they pick a new set of ::: features that can circumvent it.

With experiments on two large scale medical imaging datasets, and CIFAR-10, we find transfer has almost negligible effects on performance, but significantly helps convergence speed. However, in all of these settings, convergence without transfer can be sped up dramatically by using only mean and variance statistics of the pretrained weights. Visualizing the lower layer filters shows that models trained from random initialization do not learn Gabor filters on medical images.

Our approach benefits classification problems that involve data living on surfaces, such as in cortical parcellation. For instance, current methods for labeling cortical points into surface parcels often involve a slow mesh deformation toward pre-labeled atlases, requiring as much as 4 hours with the established FreeSurfer. This may burden neuroscience studies involving region-specific measurements. Learning techniques offer an attractive computational advantage, however, their representation of spatial information, typically defined in a Euclidean domain, may be inadequate for cortical parcellation. Indeed, cortical data resides on surfaces that are highly variable in space and shape. Consequently, Euclidean representations of surface data may be inconsistent across individuals. We propose to fundamentally change the spatial representation of surface data, by exploiting spectral coordinates derived from the Laplacian eigenfunctions of shapes. They have the advantage over Euclidean coordinates, to be geometry aware and to parameterize surfaces explicitly. This change of paradigm, from Euclidean to spectral representations, enables a classifier to be applied directly on surface data via spectral coordinates. In this paper, we decide to build upon the successful Random Decision Forests algorithm and improve its spatial representation with spectral features.

After looking through many images containing healthy bones, a tired radiologist has been found to miss a fractured case among the many healthy ones. Automated fracture detection can help the doctors by screening for obvious cases and flagging suspicious cases for closer examinations. Since bone fractures can occur in many ways, no one single algorithm can detect all the possible fractures accurately. This paper describes an approach in detecting fractures of the femur and the radius by combining various detection methods. These methods extract different kinds of features for fracture detection. They include neck-shaft angle, which is specifically extracted for femur fracture detection, and Gabor texture, Markov Random Field texture, and intensity gradient, which are general features that can be applied to detecting fractures of various bones.

Firstly, the three-dimensional eigenvectors are extracted according to the cyclic spectrum of the signal, and the anti-noise performance can be improved by using the cyclic spectrum features. Then the LDA algorithm is used to reduce the feature dimension, which reduces the similar feature redundancy and improves the training speed of the subsequent algorithm. Finally, based on the transformed samples, the spectrum sensing model is trained by the XGBoost algorithm.

Each type has defining molecular events, gene/protein expression patterns, genetic risk factors, sites of origin, and responses to treatment. Gold standard treatment is surgery followed by platinum-taxane chemotherapy despite mounting evidence suggesting CCCs, MCs, and LGSCs are largely platinum-taxane resistant. If outcomes are to be improved, it is critical to adopt a type specific strategy. Retrospective review studies have suggested histotype may be misdiagnosed or omitted in up to 30% of cases. However, pathological diagnosis of histotypes has been greatly refined in recent years and the use of biomarkers as aides is becoming more widespread. Nonetheless a rapid and fully objective classifier of histotypes will undoubtedly improve diagnostic accuracy, especially in the case of pre-surgical biopsies where small amounts of material present a challenge. ::: ::: Methods: Over 1000 ovarian carcinoma samples underwent expert gynecopathological review to establish a gold standard diagnosis for the 5 major carcinoma types. RNA was extracted from FFPE tissues and levels of a pre-selected set of >100 genes were quantified using the NanoString GX system. Cohort was split with ~1/3 set aside for independent validation. Several statistical models were tested to generate a prediction algorithm for histological type including PAM, Random Forest, Lasso, Recursive Partitioning, and Discriminant Analysis. Feature selection methods and prediction error were examined using cross-validation in the train /test series prior to validation in the independent set. ::: ::: Results: Preliminary analysis suggests classification of the 5 major histotypes is possible using NanoString derived RNA expression levels. Accuracy appears to be equivalent to interobserver variation amongst expert gynecopathologist. ::: ::: Conclusions: The NanoString GX platform provides a stable and reproducible platform on which a robust single sample histological type classifier can be established. Our algorithm combined with the NanoString platform provides a rapid, and cost-effective option that does not require modification to current pathology lab tissue processing protocols. Diagnostic prediction require little material and is applicable to pre- and post- surgical specimens where an objective measure is desired to confirm diagnosis or aide in especially challenging cases. ::: ::: Citation Format: Michael S.

{"paper_id": "52881578", "title": "Understanding colour image: colour constancy", "authors": [{"first": "Bo-zhi", "middle": [], "last": "Liu", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Human visual system has a mechanism which ensures that the perceived colour of an object remains almost constant under varying illumination conditions, and this mechanism is called colour constancy. Electronic imaging systems such as digital cameras do not naturally have this ability. The color appearance of images of an object under different lighting conditions changes with the colour of the light sources and this can cause problems in many computer vision applications such as object recognition. To deal with this problem, many algorithms have been developed to estimate the input image\u2019s illuminant, and then recover the intrinsic colour of the scene correctly. In this thesis, we focus on this topic, try to produce new colour constancy algorithms in both images and videos, to improve the performance of the state of the art. ::: ::: This thesis makes four technical contributions. First, we have developed a new image representation scheme suitable for developing learning based colour constancy algorithms; second, we introduce a new method that formulates the colour constancy problem as one that infers the illuminant class of the input image; third, we introduce a novel clustering classification colour constancy framework (the 4C method); and finally, we extend our method from still image into video processing, create a new framework to deal with the colour constancy problem in videos. ::: ::: As in many computer vision problems, one of the crucial issues is how to effectively represent the input events. Colour constancy is no exception and we need to first represent the input image. As we are only interested in the colours of the image, colour histogram is a natural choice. However, traditional colour histogram is content dependent. As our task is estimating the colours of the illuminant rather than the colours of the image, we need a representation that is relatively independent of the image content. Based on this reasoning, we introduce the novel concept of a binary colour histogram where it records if a colour has appeared in the image or not and disregards the frequency of the colours appear in the image. We will present experimental results to demonstrate that our new binary histogram representation is particularly suitable for learning based colour constancy and that it provides better performances than other traditional representation schemes. ::: ::: The colour of a digital image is directly affected by the colour of the illuminant. We reason if we can recognize or classify the illuminant source of the image, we can then correct the colour of the image. Based on this rationale, we formulate the colour constancy problem as an illuminant classification problem. We assume that each image has an associated class of illuminant and the task of colour constancy is that of recognizing the illuminant class of the image. To accomplish this, we make use of our newly introduced binary colour histogram representation scheme and employ a powerful machine learning method called the Random Forest to construct the illuminant recognition system. We will present experimental results to show the effectiveness of our new method. ::: ::: Encouraged by the success of our illuminant recognition framework, we have developed a novel clustering classification colour constancy (the 4C) framework. We reason that similar illuminants will result in similar white point colours in an image. Based on this assumption, we first use a clustering algorithm to group similar white point colours of the training samples into the same cluster. We then treat the images in the same cluster as belonging to the same illumination source and each cluster as one class of illuminants. The colour constancy problem, i.e., that of estimating the unknown illuminant of an image, becomes that of identifying which illuminant class (cluster) the image\u2019s illuminant falling into. We again make use of our novel binary colour histogram representation and our random forest based illuminant classification methods to implement our new 4C colour constancy framework. We present experimental results on publicly available testing datasets and show that our new method is competitive to state of the art. ::: ::: As a practical application, we have successfully extended our novel colour constancy methods from still image into video processing. The video tonal stabilization problem is still an unsolved problem, and current algorithms are only focusing on keeping the tonal stable during video playing, not really trying to recover the incorrect illuminant. We tackle these two problems together by keeping the tonal stable and recovering the frame colour to a canonical illuminant. Our approach first divides video frames into shots containing similar illuminant characteristics. We then correct the frames in the same scene by using the Random Forest illuminant estimation framework. A smooth function is applied to prevent flick and flash from occurring at the boundary of the neighboring scenes. Experimental results show that our new methods can improve video quality effectively.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2889630030", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52881578"}

Most of the development in this area is based on discontinuous thumb position control, which makes it possible to recreate several of the most important functions of the thumb but does not result in total imitation.

Spectroscopy together with the pattern recognition technology is a preferred method of achieving rapid identification of wine quality, in which the Raman Spectroscopy is promising because of its little affection of water and little or free of sample pretreatment. So, in this paper, Raman spectra and support vector regression (SVR) are used to recognize different ages and different storing time of the liquor of the same age. The innovation of this paper is mainly reflected in the following three aspects. First, the application of Raman in the area of liquor analysis is rarely reported till now. Second, the concentration of studying the recognition of wine age, while most studies focus on studying specific components of liquor and studies together with the pattern recognition method focus more on the identification of brands or different types of base wine. The third one is the application of regression analysis framework, which cannot be only used to identify different years of liquor, but also can be used to analyze different storing time, which has theoretical and practical significance to the research and quality control of liquor. Three kinds of experiments are conducted in this paper. Firstly, SVR is used to recognize different ages of 5, 8, 16 and 26 years of the Gujing Liquor; secondly, SVR is also used to classify the storing time of the 8-years liquor; thirdly, certain group of train data is deleted form the train set and put into the test set to simulate the actual situation of liquor age recognition. Results show that the SVR model has good train and predict performance in these experiments, and it has better performance than other non-liner regression method such as the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS) method, and can also be applied in the practice of liquor analysis.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27400515", "doi": null, "venue": "Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu", "journal": "Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu", "mag_id": "2510753207", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21500321"}

The Support Vector Machine framework for uniform arrays beamforming is then established. Simulation results show that the SVM-based optimizing beamforming approach can not only approximate conventional one well in the case of free noise condition and small data sets, but also improve the generalization ability and reduce the computation burden.

To obtain better estimation, we propose an alternative method through performing data mining on historical data. This paper suggests performing this prediction using three machine learning techniques that were applied to a preprocessed COCOMO NASA benchmark data which covered 93 projects: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Random Forests. The generated models were tested using five folds cross-validation and were evaluated using Classification Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC. The estimation results were then compared to COCOMO estimation. All the applied techniques were successful in achieving better results than the compared COCOMO model. However, the best performance was obtained using both Naive Bayes and Random Forests. Despite the fact that Naive Bayes outperformed both of the other two techniques in its ROC curve and Recall score, Random Forests has a better Confusion Matrix and scored better in both Classification Accuracy, and Precision measures.

Conventional methods, such as time domain simulations and direct methods impose limitations to fast on-line transient stability assessment in modern power systems.

Many classification algorithms have been reported in the literature for assessing transient stability. This paper aims to provide insights regarding which algorithm is more suitable for a given dataset for power system stability assessment. For this purpose, decision trees, support vector machines and artificial neural networks are investigated for their ability to address the binary stability classification problem in a comparative analysis for two datasets.

The contributions of this paper include an analysis of which machine learning algorithms and which features provide the best classification performance. This analysis shows that the Random Forest algorithm yields the best classification performance. We find however, that the performance of the ML-classifier varies a lot for classifying different role-stereotypes. In particular its performs degrades for rare role-types.

During last decade, few other swarm intelligence based algorithms such as particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, and bacterial foraging optimization have emerged. Microwave researchers also observe these techniques and try to adopt them for various microwave design applications. In this chapter, a review of microwave design using five soft computing methods namely Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been presented. Out of these methods, ANN and GA have been widely exploited by microwave researchers.

In this system both appearance and motion are measured to detect the anomalies. The Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is used for capture the appearance information and Histograms of Oriented Swarms (HOS) is used for capture the frame dynamics.

For Proba-V, cloud detection is challenging due to the limited number of spectral bands. Advanced machine learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), have shown to work well on this problem provided enough labeled data. However, simultaneous collocated information about the presence of clouds is usually not available or requires a great amount of manual labor. In this work, we propose to learn from the available Landsat \u22128 cloud masks datasets and transfer this learning to solve the Proba-V cloud detection problem.

The NEF can use neuron models that closely emulate neurophysiology in that they produce action potentials at specific points in time.

The common representation used to communicate between modalities is the mathematical construct of semantic pointers. The temporal control of neural processing steps is realized in the NEF by an action selection system implemented by basal ganglia and thalamus models.

DDIs can decrease therapeutic benefit or efficacy of treatments and this could have very harmful consequences in the patient\u2019s health that could even cause the patient\u2019s death. Knowing the interactions between prescribed drugs is of great clinical importance; it is very important to keep databases up-to-date with respect to new DDI. In this thesis we aim to build a system to assist healthcare professionals to be updated about published drug-drug interactions. The goal of this thesis is to study a method based on maximal frequent sequences (MFS) and machine learning techniques in order to automatically detect interactions between drugs in pharmacological and medical literature. With the study of these methods, the information technology community will assist healthcare community to update their drug interactions database in a fast and semi-automatic way. In a first solution, we classify pharmacological sentences depending on whether or not they are describing a drug-drug interaction. This would enable to automatically find sentences containing drug-drug interactions. This solution is completely based on maximal frequent sequences extracted from a set of test documents. In a second solution based on machine learning, we go further in the search and perform DDI extraction, determining whether two specific drugs appearing in a sentence interact or not. This can be used as an assisting tool to populate databases with drug-drug interactions. The machine learning classifier is trained with several features: bag of words, word categories, MFS, token and char level features, as well as drug level features. We used a Random Forest classifier. With this system we participated at the DDIExtraction 2011 competition, where we obtained 6th position.

{"paper_id": "25927376", "title": "A methodology to enhance spatial understanding of disease outbreak events reported in news articles.", "authors": [{"first": "Hutchatai", "middle": [], "last": "Chanlekha", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Nigel", "middle": [], "last": "Collier", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The emergence and re-emergence of disease outbreaks of international concern in the last several years has raised the importance of health surveillance systems that exploit the open media for their timely and precise detection of events. However, one of the key barriers faced by current event-based health surveillance systems is in identifying fine-grained terms for an outbreak's geographical location. In this article, we present a method to tackle this problem by associating each reported event with the most specific spatial information available in a news report. This would be useful not only for health surveillance systems, but also for other event-centered processing systems. Methods To develop an automated spatial attribute annotation system, we first created a gold standard corpus for training a machine learning model. Since the qualitative analysis on data suggested that the event class might have an impact on the spatial attribute annotation, we also developed an event classification system to incorporate event class information into the spatial attribute annotation model. To automatically recognize the spatial attribute of events, several approaches, ranging from a simple heuristic technique to a more sophisticated approach based on a state-of-the-art Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model were explored. Different feature sets were incorporated into the model and compared. Results The evaluations were conducted on 100 outbreak news articles. Spatial attribute recognition performance was evaluated based on three metrics; precision, recall and the harmonic mean of precision and recall (F-score). Among three strategies proposed in this article, the CRF model appeared to be the most promising for spatial attribute recognition with a best performance of 85.5% F-score (86.3% precision and 84.7% recall). Conclusion We presented a methodology for associating each event in media outbreak reports with their spatial attribute at the finest level of granularity. Our goal has been to provide a means for enhancing the spatial understanding of outbreak-related events. Evaluation studies showed promising results for automatic spatial attribute annotation. In the future, we plan to explore more features, such as semantic correlation between words, that maybe useful for the spatial attribute annotation task.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "20153972", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2010.01.014", "venue": "International journal of medical informatics", "journal": "International journal of medical informatics", "mag_id": "2022645019", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["15956930", "70280", "22570639", "16540824"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25927376"}

Kernel methods, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), could not provide satisfactory classification accuracy on some complicated data sets, which are still not linearly separable in feature space. It means kernels designed only by tuning kernel parameters cannot adapt well to classification of complicated data sets. Unlike tuning parameters, OSM learns and designs its kernel from training data, through a sequence of two mappings and optimizing a criteria function. After feature mapping of OSM, data in the feature space appear not only linearly separable but also intra-class compact and extra-class separate. As the problem of optimizing the criteria function reduces to a generalized eigenvalue problem, OSM possesses non-iterative and low complex properties. Comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICWAPR.2008.4635810", "venue": "2008 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition", "journal": "2008 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2103819908", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2147067", "16292818", "41459724", "35730151", "17466014", "14879317"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20209575"}

A pivotal problem solving setting is given by hierarchical control systems familiar from hierarchical task networks. If these structures can be modified autonomously by, e.g., Coalition formation and reconfiguration, adequate decisions on higher levels require a faithful abstracted model of a collective of agents. An illustrative example is found in calculating schedules for a set of power plants organized in a hierarchy of Autonomous Virtual Power Plants. Functional dependencies over the combinatorial domain, such as the joint costs or rates of change of power production, are approximated by repeatedly sampling input-output pairs and substituting the actual functions by piecewise linear functions. However, if the sampled data points are weakly informative, the resulting abstracted high-level optimization introduces severe errors. Furthermore, obtaining additional point labels amounts to solving computationally hard optimization problems. Building on prior work, we propose to apply techniques from active learning to maximize the information gained by each additional point.

Getting the switches set to enable the ERP software to go live is becoming straightforward. The really difficult part is understanding all of the dynamic interactions that accrue as a consequence. Dynamic causal and connectionist models are employed to facilitate an understanding of the dynamics and to enable control of the information-enhanced processes to take place. The connectionist model ran be analyzing (behind the scenes) the information accesses and transfers and coming If some conclusions about strong linkages that are getting established and what the behavioral implications of those new linkages and information accesses we. Ultimately, the connectionist model will come to an understanding of the dynamic, behavioral implications of the larger ERP implementation/installation per se. The underlying connectionist model will determine information transfers and workflow. Once a map of these two infrastructures is determined by the model, it becomes a relatively easy job for an analyst to suggest improvements in both. Connectionist models start with analog object structures and then use learning to produce mechanisms for managerial problem diagnoses. These mechanisms are neural models with multiple-layer structures that support continuous input/output. Based on earlier work performed and published by the author[10][11], a Connectionist ReasOning and LEarning System(CROLES) is developed that mimics the real-world reasoning infrastructure. Coupled with an explanation subsystem, this system can provide explanations as to why a particular reasoning structure behaved the way it did. Such a system operates in the backgmund, observing what is happening as every information access, every information response coming from each and every intelligent node (whether natural or artificial) operating within the ERP infrastructure is recorded and encoded. The CROLES is also able to transfer all workflows and map these onto the decision-making nodes of the organization.", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "The e-Business Studies", "mag_id": "1605346597", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61047732"}

We built Random Forest models to identify event modality and polarity. To identify temporal expressions we built on the HeidelTime system. To detect temporal relations, we systematically studied their breakdown into distinct situations; we designed an oracle method to determine the most prominent situations and the most suitable associated classifiers, and combined their results. ::: ::: Results We achieved F-measures of 0.8307 for event identification, based on rules, and 0.8385 for temporal expression identification.

Among traditional machine learning approaches, ensemble tree-based algorithms, such as Random Forests and Decision Trees have better performance when compared with other approaches.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICIEV.2019.8858531", "venue": "2019 Joint 8th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2019 3rd International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)", "journal": "2019 Joint 8th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2019 3rd International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2979723807", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11211402", "53712545", "215684647", "3206495", "8579387", "4512133", "5765430", "3332288", "206470907", "23312161", "14751371", "3642412", "14141955", "67367330", "1688946", "11833989"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204231420"}

For the optimization, we use only a small subset of public dataset identified by k-nearest neighbor search instead of using all available training data.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect Diabetes Mellitus based on facial block texture features using the Gabor filter. For Diabetes Mellitus detection we first select four blocks to represent a facial image. Next, we extract texture features using the Gabor filter from each facial block to represent the samples, where each facial block is defined by a single texture value. Afterwards, k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine are applied for classification.

We refer to the problem of estimating the inverse depth for the union of FOVs, while leveraging the stereo information in the overlapping FOV, as Tele-Wide Stereo Matching (TW-SM). We propose different deep learning solutions to the TW-SM problem. Since the disparity is proportional to the inverse depth, we train stereo matching disparity estimation (SMDE) networks to estimate the disparity for the union WFOV. We further propose an end-to-end deep multitask tele-wide stereo matching neural network (MT-TW-SMNet), which simultaneously learns the SMDE task for the overlapped Tele FOV and the single image inverse depth estimation (SIDE) task for the WFOV.

The reported approach involves the inclusion of learning modules in each of the supervised agents, and considers a scenario where the system's coordinator privately transmits to individual agents their action plans in the form of symbolic strings. Each agent's plans belong in some particular class of (subregular) languages which is identifiable in the limit from positive data. With knowledge of the class of languages their plans belong to, agents can observe their coordinator's instructions and utilize the Grammatical Inference modules to identify the behavior specified for them. From that, they can then work collectively to infer the executive function of their supervisor. The paper proves that in cases where the coordinator fails, or communication to subordinates is disrupted, agents are able not only to maintain functional capacity but also to recover normalcy of operation by reconstructing their coordinator. Guaranteeing normalcy recovery in supervisory CPSs is critical in cases of a catastrophic failure or malicious attack, and is important for the design of next-generation Cyber-Physical Systems.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3389/frobt.2016.00036", "venue": "Front.

The fruits classified based on Extraction of morphological and Fourier features of a fruit image by applying DTNB classifier. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The proposed method is adapted to achieve fruit classification. The digital image of any fruits was given as an input to the system. Background elimination is the first step employed, is given based on the threshold technique. This helps in extracting only the interested pixel regions. Noise of the cropped image was removed; by applying mean filter.Statistical, morphological and Fourier features extracted from the image for the classification Findings: According to the literature survey conducted, most of the researchers used SVM (Support Vector Machine), neural network, KNN classifiers etc. for Automatic classification of fruits. Most of the authors extracted either spatial features or Fourier features for the classification. Very few researchers extracted both spatial and Fourier features to classify the fruit. The proposed method extracts both spatial and Fourier features of the fruits, which are commonly available in south Indian regions. The proposed system uses a hybrid combination of Decision table and Naive Bayes classifier to obtain the accuracy of 88.08%. Mat Lab is used for extracting the features of fruit images. There is no sufficient work done on fruit image classification for south Indian image fruits.

For surveillance applications audio-visual fusion is very promising given the complementary nature of the two streams. However, drawing the correct conclusion from multi-sensor data is not straightforward. In previous work we have analysed a database with audio-visual recordings of unwanted behavior in trains (Lefter et al., 2012) and focused on a limited subset of the recorded data. We have collected multi- and unimodal assessments by humans, who have given aggression scores on a 3 point scale. We showed that there are no trivial fusion algorithms to predict the multimodal labels from the unimodal labels since part of the information is lost when using the unimodal streams. We proposed an intermediate step to discover the structure in the fusion process. This step is based upon meta-features and we find a set of five which have an impact on the fusion process. In this paper we extend the findings in (Lefter et al., 2012) for the general case using the entire database. We prove that the meta-features have a positive effect on the fusion process in terms of labels. We then compare three fusion methods that encapsulate the meta-features. They are based on automatic prediction of the intermediate level variables and multimodal aggression from state of the art low level acoustic, linguistic and visual features. The first fusion method is based on applying multiple classifiers to predict intermediate level features from the low level features, and to predict the multimodal label from the intermediate variables. The other two approaches are based on probabilistic graphical models, one using (Dynamic) Bayesian Networks and the other one using Conditional Random Fields.

Understanding this structure helps many other projects, e.g. 4DCBCT phase sorting. This work will validate this hypothesis using a manifold learning algorithm. Methods: An NCAT phantom in the thorax region with a smooth respiratory motion pattern is used to generate a series of CBCT projections with realistic scanning and breathing parameters. A manifold learning technique, diffusion map, is employed to extract the topological structure underlying these projections. Specifically, a diffusion matrix is first constructed, whose entries are determined based on the Euclidian distance between those projections in V. The associated transition matrix is then computed and diagonalized. The eigenvectors, when sorted according to the associated eigenvalues in a descending order, represent the inherent topological structure of the manifold in a coarse\u2010to\u2010fine manner. The first three eigenvectors are selected as the coordinates to represent the CBCT projections, which reduces the dimensionality from the space V to a 3D space, while preserving the major topological properties. This also allows for a visualization of the hypothesized 2\u2010torus structure. Results: The points given by the first three eigenvectors form an oscillatory curve on a distorted 2\u2010torus in the 3D space. The two principle directions of the torus can be interpreted as the directions corresponding to the gantry rotation and the patient breathing, respectively. During CBCT projection acquisition, the gantry angle continuously increases, while the breathing phase oscillates periodically. Hence, those projections, while being represented by points in this 3D space, travel along a spiral curve winding around the torus. Conclusions: The manifold learning method can recover the 2\u2010torus structure of the thorax CBCT projections, whose two independent intrinsic dimensions correspond to gantry rotation and patient breathing.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1118/1.4735934", "venue": null, "journal": "Medical Physics", "mag_id": "2063188156", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:122255731"}

Methods: Using Random Forests (RF) algorithm, MIR prediction of soil properties for a set of georeferenced soil samples associated with the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project, from 44 sentinel sites, randomized across sub-Sahara Africa, were done . RF regression models were used to model the residuals of the predictions against TXRF spectra combined with MIR first derivative spectra and also against dominant mineralogy groupings measured using XRD. Results: MIR resulted in good prediction models (R>0.80) using RF out-of-bag validation for organic and total C and N, extractable Ca and Al, and pH. Acceptable models (R 2 >0.60) were obtained for exchangeable bases, but models were poor (R<0.60) for exchangeable Na, and Mehlich-3 extractable P, K, S, Na, Cu, and Zn. The prediction performance of combined MIR and TXRF spectra was better than MIR alone for several soil properties. Relative improvements in prediction accuracy over MIR alone were: exchangeable Na (828%), Mehlich-3 S 350%; Mehlich-3 Zn; 150%; and Mehlich-3 Cu, 10%. However, TXRF data was generally limited in explaining the residuals of the MIR predictions for extractable P and K.

Given those constraints, our algorithm aims to learn a distance metric under which the points with must-link constraints are pushed as close as possible, while simultaneously, the points with cannot-link constraints are pulled away as far as possible. The kernelized version of our algorithm is also derived to tackle the nonlinear problem.

Currently, there is no cure for AMD, however early detection and subsequent treatment may prevent the severe vision loss or slow the progression of the disease. AMD can be classified into two types: dry and wet AMDs. The people with macular degeneration are mostly affected by dry AMD. Early symptoms of AMD are formation of drusen and yellow pigmentation. These lesions are identified by manual inspection of fundus images by the ophthalmologists. It is a time consuming, tiresome process, and hence an automated diagnosis of AMD screening tool can aid clinicians in their diagnosis significantly. This study proposes an automated dry AMD detection system using various entropies (Shannon, Kapur, Renyi and Yager), Higher Order Spectra (HOS) bispectra features, Fractional Dimension (FD), and Gabor wavelet features extracted from greyscale fundus images. The features are ranked using t-test, Kullback-Lieber Divergence (KLD), Chernoff Bound and Bhattacharyya Distance (CBBD), Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve-based and Wilcoxon ranking methods in order to select optimum features and classified into normal and AMD classes using Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using private (Kasturba Medical Hospital, Manipal, India), Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) and STructured Analysis of the Retina (STARE) datasets. The proposed system yielded the highest average classification accuracies of 90.19%, 95.07% and 95% with 42, 54 and 38 optimal ranked features using SVM classifier for private, ARIA and STARE datasets respectively.

In this paper, we present the first membership inference attack on generative models. To mount the attack, we train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which combines a discriminative and a generative model, to detect overfitting and recognize inputs that are part of training datasets by relying on the discriminator's capacity to learn statistical differences in distributions. We present attacks based on both white-box and black-box access to the target model, and show how to improve the latter using limited auxiliary knowledge of dataset samples.

The white-box attacks are 100% successful at inferring which samples were used to train the target model, and the black-box ones succeeds with 80% accuracy.

In this paper, we present a semi-supervised Deep Coupled Ensemble (DCE) model, which contributes to ensemble learning and classification landmark exploration for better locating the final decision boundaries in the learnt latent space. First, multiple complementary consistency regularizations are integrated into our DCE model to enable the ensemble members to learn from each other and themselves, such that training experience from different sources can be shared and utilized during training. Second, in view of the possibility of producing incorrect predictions on a number of difficult instances, we adopt class-wise mean feature matching to explore important unlabeled instances as classification landmarks, on which the model predictions are more reliable. Minimizing the weighted conditional entropy on unlabeled data is able to force the final decision boundaries to move away from important training data points, which facilitates semi-supervised learning. Ensemble members could eventually have similar performance due to consistency regularization, and thus only one of these members is needed during the test stage, such that the efficiency of our model is the same as the non-ensemble case.

By discarding useless or redundant variables, not only it improves model performance but also facilitates its interpretability. The well-known Support Vector Machines\u2013Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm provides good performance with moderate computational efforts, in particular for wide datasets. When using SVM-RFE on a multiclass classification problem, the usual strategy is to decompose it into a series of binary ones, and to generate an importance statistics for each feature on each binary problem. These importances are then averaged over the set of binary problems to synthesize a single value for feature ranking. In some cases, however, this procedure can lead to poor selection. In this paper we discuss six new strategies, based on list combination, designed to yield improved selections starting from the importances given by the binary problems. We evaluate them on artificial and real-world datasets, using both One\u2013Vs\u2013One (OVO) and One\u2013Vs\u2013All (OVA) strategies. Our results suggest that the OVO decomposition is most effective for feature selection on multiclass problems.

We evaluated the diagnostic potential of sera XAGE-1a and XAGE-1d in lung cancer, both of which are variants of the X antigen family, member 1. Methods The expression levels of XAGE-1a and XAGE-1d in cell lines were determined using western blot analysis. Competitive ELISA was used to analyze XAGE-1a and XAGE-1d levels in culture supernatants and sera from 194 lung cancer patients and 194 healthy sex- and age-group-matched controls. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of these proteins, we also analyzed carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21\u20131) in culture supernatants and 388 sera using commercial ELISA kits. Results XAGE-1a and XAGE-1d proteins were expressed in both breast cancer and lung cancer cell lines, but they were only secreted by the latter. The areas under the curves (AUCs) for XAGE-1a and XAGE-1d were 0.787 and 0.806, respectively. The cutoff values (sensitivity, specificity) for XAGE-1a and XAGE-1d were 1.62 ng/ml (0.866, 0.572) and 2.51 ng/ml (0.871, 0.613), respectively. The diagnostic performance was improved for patients with squamous cell carcinoma. The AUC values for XAGE-1a and XAGE-1d for patients with squamous cell carcinoma versus a group containing all healthy participants and patients with any illness other than squamous cell carcinoma were similar to those for CEA and CYFRA 21\u20131. Better performance (AUC: 0.914) for all patients was obtained when using a combination of four markers (Random Forest). Conclusions Sera XAGE-1a and XAGE-1d are potential biomarkers for lung cancer; they display a diagnostic performance comparable to that of CEA or CYFRA 21\u20131.

The image representation to be employed in the classification engine plays an important role. We believe that texture features have been not properly considered in this application domain. This paper points out, through a set of experiments, that textures are fundamental to properly recognize different food items. For this purpose the bag of visual words model (BoW) is employed. Images are processed with a bank of rotation and scale invariant filters and then a small codebook of Textons is built for each food class. The learned class-based Textons are hence collected in a single visual dictionary. The food images are represented as visual words distributions (Bag of Textons) and a Support Vector Machine is used for the classification stage. The experiments demonstrate that the image representation based on Bag of Textons is more accurate than existing (and more complex) approaches in classifying the 61 classes of the Pittsburgh Fast-Food Image Dataset.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICIP.2014.7026055", "venue": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)", "journal": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2013756443", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["304354", "1548631", "14427263", "15978957", "14072575", "4067210", "192579448", "2313314", "2414354", "61934926", "17606900", "3188360", "14970108", "961425", "17944708", "11298788", "11002418", "1457124"], "inbound_citations": ["61811488", "195779258", "49865851", "207242933", "39226924", "2040113", "57572990", "123973275", "31879562", "8679438", "8971953", "37105431", "3914807", "52122152", "44090871", "17006311", "59234125", "52348266", "6655663", "8335287", "214871774", "211297753", "51958987", "52069634", "14301184", "199383016", "12804735", "49189131", "31347346", "57573036", "12412602", "12180250", "191516662", "16837629"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5808384"}

The use of transactional memory results in significant improvement of performance by avoiding thread synchronization and locks overhead. Also, transactions scheduling apparently influences the performance of transactional memory. In this paper, we study the fairness of transactions' scheduling using Lazy Snapshot Algorithm. The fairness of transactions' scheduling aims to balance between transactions types which are read-only and update transactions. Indeed, we support the fairness of the scheduling procedure by a machine learning technique. The machine learning techniques improve the fairness decisions according to transactions' history. The experiments in this paper show that the throughput of the Lazy Snapshot Algorithm is improved with a machine learning support. Indeed, our experiments show that the learning significantly affects the performance if the durations of update transactions are much longer than read-only ones.

Software project risk management may gain a high rate of return in investment. Establishing an intelligent risk evaluation model for project will be valuable in the analysis and control of project risks. In this paper, we employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) approaches to establish a model for risk evaluation in project development. In the model, the input is a vector of software risk factors that were obtained through interview with 30 experts, and the output is the final outcome of the project. The data for modeling were collected from 120 real software projects through questionnaires. The experiment shows the model is valid.

In our study, the standard neural network model had lower prediction accuracy compared to SVM due to its tendency in finding local optima.

An improved method for detecting CHD could have a substantial clinical impact given that sudden cardiac death is the initial presentation in 15% of patients with CHD. Building on the idea that systemic effects of CHD risk factors are a conglomeration of genetic and environmental factors, we used machine learning techniques and integrated genetic, epigenetic and phenotype data from the Framingham Heart Study to build and test a classification model for CHD. The initial development of this prediction model included 1545 individuals (58/851 females and 115/694 males diagnosed with CHD) in the training set and 142 individuals (22/54 females and 49/88 males diagnosed with CHD) in the test set. An ensemble of Random Forest classifiers consisting of 4 DNA methylation (DNAm) sites, 2 SNPs, age and gender was capable of predicting CHD status with a test sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 0.80, respectively. In contrast, an ensemble consisting of conventional CHD risk factors (age, gender, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, diabetes and smoking status) performed with a test sensitivity and specificity of 0.41 and 0.89, respectively. The 4 DNAm sites captured variance associated with age, gender, total cholesterol, smoking and diabetes. Our integrated approach with superior minimization of false negatives may be a viable alternative for CHD diagnosis and may obviate the need for cumbersome testing procedures, the collection of considerable amounts of blood and multiple lab tests. Conceivably, these will be greatly reduced by using a single genetic-epigenetic assay that uses a microgram or less of blood or saliva DNA. More importantly, the methylation at epigenetic loci with high predictive value could be very useful in guiding therapeutic interventions, management of risk factors and monitoring efficacy of treatments and lifestyle modifications. Optimization of our current panel led to better selection of biomarkers and improved testing metrics. We further demonstrated translational feasibility of our method by developing an alpha biomarker panel.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Circulation", "mag_id": "2809456660", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:80965750"}

Therefore, this study has not considered the noise removal method, and this differs compared to most previous works, which have implemented noise removal method for eliminating the eyelid and eyelashes information. The images from CASIA Version 1 and Version 4-Interval are used to assess the proposed method. The results obtained on these data sets reveal the effectiveness of the suggested method.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2189041074", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["39236775", "31781525", "16357735", "3075985", "9203634", "15033006", "14272714", "180101", "34859264", "41631125", "7231042", "5773065", "17847612", "14943983", "16818600", "985690", "7444960", "13222461", "62546562", "6970666", "16317449", "119685424", "119565564", "122866882", "19688854", "43009527", "37846875", "10018929", "10972287", "42820346", "38422566", "12155768"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13015295"}

Diabetes Mellitus (DM), a chronic lifelong condition, is characterized by increased blood sugar levels. As there is no cure for DM, the major focus lies on controlling the disease. Therefore, DM diagnosis and treatment is of great importance. The most common complications of DM include retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy and cardiomyopathy. Diabetes causes cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy that affects the Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Hence, in the absence of other causes, the HRV analysis can be used to diagnose diabetes. The present work aims at developing an automated system for classification of normal and diabetes classes by using the heart rate (HR) information extracted from the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The spectral analysis of HRV recognizes patients with autonomic diabetic neuropathy, and gives an earlier diagnosis of impairment of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). Significant correlations with the impaired ANS are observed of the HRV spectral indices obtained by using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) method. Herein, in order to diagnose and detect DM automatically, we have performed DWT decomposition up to 5 levels, and extracted the energy, sample entropy, approximation entropy, kurtosis and skewness features at various detailed coefficient levels of the DWT. We have extracted relative wavelet energy and entropy features up to the 5th level of DWT coefficients extracted from HR signals. These features are ranked by using various ranking methods, namely, Bhattacharyya space algorithm, t-test, Wilcoxon test, Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) and entropy.The ranked features are then fed into different classifiers, that include Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NBC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our results have shown maximum diagnostic differentiation performance by using a minimum number of features. With our system, we have obtained an average accuracy of 92.02%, sensitivity of 92.59% and specificity of 91.46%, by using DT classifier with ten-fold cross validation.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.knosys.2015.02.005", "venue": "Knowl.

Method and Materials: The optimization goal is to find the optimal parameters of the tangential beams to cover the planning target volume (PTV) including the clinical target volume (CTV) and the ipsilateral breast and minimize the dose to the organs at risk (OARs) consisting of the heart, ipsilateral lung, contralateral breast. Relative significance of different organs were first determined based on the following clinical concerns: (1) CTV should be fully covered, (2) heart sparing is more critical than lung sparing, (3) coverage of the ipsilateral breast tissue beyond the CTV can be compromised in exchange for significant dose reduction of heart and lung, and (4) radiation to the contralateral breast should be avoided. The SVM finds the optimal plane that best separates the PTV and OARs according to a pre\u2010defined cost function considering the relative significances of all involved objects. Gantry angle, collimator angle and collimator opening of the tangential beams were obtained through geometry transformations of this plane. Dose\u2010volume histograms of plans determined by this beam placement algorithm were then compared with those by radiationoncologists.Results: Plans of 23 prone and 13 supine patients were analyzed. Our algorithm reduced the heart volume that receives >500 cGy by 38.0% (from 2.68cm3 to 1.66cm3) on average and the ipsilateral lung volume that receives >1000 cGy by 26.3% (from 55.22cm3 to 40.71cm3). Volume of CTV1 and CTV2 receiving >95% of prescription dose decreased by only 0.74% and 0.07% respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the feasibility of using a SVM\u2010based algorithm to determine the optimal beam placement without physician's intervention. Our algorithm significantly reduced the dose of OARs at the expense of slightly degraded but still acceptable dose homogeneity and coverage.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1118/1.3468880", "venue": null, "journal": "Medical Physics", "mag_id": "1971486803", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:120013093"}

We propose a vision-based method to detect smoke using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (DC-GANs). Many existing supervised learning approaches using convolutional neural networks require substantial amount of labeled data. In order to have a robust representation of sequences with and without smoke, we propose a two-stage training of a DCGAN. Our training framework includes, the regular training of a DCGAN with real images and noise vectors, and training the discriminator separately using the smoke images without the generator. Before training the networks, the temporal evolution of smoke is also integrated with a motion-based transformation of images as a pre-processing step. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively detects the smoke images with negligible false positive rates in real-time.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8683629", "venue": "ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "journal": "ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2940390282", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6859284", "15795198", "36471601", "13890134", "10066908", "12722704", "1033682", "3074096", "630955", "3633861", "11758569", "16516553", "5808102", "13740328", "6844431", "6628106", "6287870", "15601477"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:140086226"}

In this paper, we present a robust DML algorithm based on Bayesian inference. In particular, our method is essentially a Bayesian extension to a previous classic DML method-large margin nearest neighbor classification and we use stochastic variational inference to estimate the posterior distribution of the transformation matrix. Furthermore, we theoretically show that the proposed algorithm is robust against label noise in the sense that an arbitrary point with label noise has bounded influence on the learnt model. With some reasonable assumptions, we derive a generalization error bound of this method in the presence of label noise. We also show that the DML hypothesis class in which our model lies is probably approximately correct-learnable and give the sample complexity.
