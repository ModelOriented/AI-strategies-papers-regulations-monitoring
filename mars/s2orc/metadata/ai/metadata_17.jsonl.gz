The effectiveness of learning-based SR methods, however, depends highly upon the consistency between the supporting training set and low-resolution (LR) images to be handled. To reduce the adverse effect brought by incompatible high-frequency details in the training set, we propose a single image SR approach by learning multiscale self-similarities from an LR image itself. The proposed SR approach is based upon an observation that small patches in natural images tend to redundantly repeat themselves many times both within the same scale and across different scales. To synthesize the missing details, we establish the HR-LR patch pairs using the initial LR input and its down-sampled version to capture the similarities across different scales and utilize the neighbor embedding algorithm to estimate the relationship between the LR and HR image pairs. To fully exploit the similarities across various scales inside the input LR image, we accumulate the previous resultant images as training examples for the subsequent reconstruction processes and adopt a gradual magnification scheme to upscale the LR input to the desired size step by step. In addition, to preserve sharper edges and suppress aliasing artifacts, we further apply the nonlocal means method to learn the similarity within the same scale and formulate a nonlocal prior regularization term to well pose SR estimation under a reconstruction-based SR framework.

Finding an effective mapping approach is thereby crucial for natural resource condition monitoring and investment, agricultural productivity, sustainability and planning, biodiversity conservation, natural disaster management, and bio-security. In this paper, four machine learning algorithms, i.e., the classic k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and newly developed Capsule Network (CapsNet), are applied to classify satellite images for land use. For comprehensively comparing the performance of different algorithms for land use mapping, the experiments have been conducted on real-world datasets. Based on the experiment results, several improvements on the algorithms are proposed in order to fulfil the requirement of a large-scale land mapping. In addition, we design and implement these algorithms for land use mapping in a Machine Learning Land Use Mapping (ML-LUM) system. The system is able to train the models, predict classifications of satellite images, map the land use, display the land use statistic data, and predict production yields. With a friendly graphic user interface for farmers, the system is implemented by using the cloud computing technique for processing large land use data. Furthermore, we present a case study.

Smallholder agriculture provides 90 % of primary food production in developing countries. Its mapping is thus a key element for national food security. Remote sensing is widely used for crop mapping, but it is underperforming for smallholder agriculture due to several constraints like small field size, fragmented landscape, highly variable cropping practices or cloudy conditions. In this study, we developed an original approach combining remote sensing and spatial modelling to improve crop type mapping in complex agricultural landscapes. The spatial dynamics are modelled using Ocelet, a domain-specific language based on interaction graphs. The method combines high spatial resolution satellite imagery (Spot 6/7, to characterize the landscape structure through image segmentation), high revisit frequency time series (Sentinel 2, Landsat 8, to monitor the land dynamic processes), and spatiotemporal rules (STrules, to express the strategies and practices of local farmers). The method includes three steps. First, each crop type is defined by a set of general STrules from which a model-based map of crop distribution probability is obtained. Second, a preliminary crop type map is produced using satellite image processing based on a combined Random Forest (RF) and Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) classification scheme, after which each geographical object is labelled with the class membership probabilities. Finally, the STrules are applied in the model to identify objects with classes locally incompatible with known farming constraints and strategies. The result is a map of the spatial distribution of crop type mapping errors (omission or commission) that are subsequently corrected through the joint use of spatiotemporal rules and RF class membership probabilities. Combining remote sensing and spatial modelling thus provides a viable way to better characterize and monitor complex agricultural systems.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-3-W11-35-2020", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3005839595", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16808522", "53225765", "23702320", "89141", "56034899", "59468137", "129494315", "10344554", "51903355", "65011323", "206786900", "20692766", "129671724", "14192736", "6361594", "17377572", "62883674", "55700035"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212430474"}

Especially in heterogeneous ecosystems, such as Savannas, accurate carbon quantifications are still lacking, where highly variable vegetation densities occur and a strong seasonality hinders consistent data acquisition. In order to account for these challenges we analyzed the potential of land surface phenological metrics derived from gap-filled 8-day Landsat time series for carbon mapping. We selected three areas located in different subregions in the central Brazil region, which is a prominent example of a Savanna with significant carbon stocks that has been undergoing extensive land cover conversions. Here phenological metrics from the season 2014/2015 were combined with aboveground carbon field samples of cerrado sensu stricto vegetation using Random Forest regression models to map the regional carbon distribution and to analyze the relation between phenological metrics and aboveground carbon. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The gap filling approach enabled to accurately approximate the original Landsat ETM+ and OLI EVI values and the subsequent derivation of annual phenological metrics. Random Forest model performances varied between the three study areas with RMSE values of 1.64 t/ha (mean relative RMSE 30%), 2.35 t/ha (46%) and 2.18 t/ha (45%). Comparable relationships between remote sensing based land surface phenological metrics and aboveground carbon were observed in all study areas. Aboveground carbon distributions could be mapped and revealed comprehensible spatial patterns. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Phenological metrics were derived from 8-day Landsat time series with a spatial resolution that is sufficient to capture gradual changes in carbon stocks of heterogeneous Savanna ecosystems. These metrics revealed the relationship between aboveground carbon and the phenology of the observed vegetation. Our results suggest that metrics relating to the seasonal minimum and maximum values were the most influential variables and bear potential to improve spatially explicit mapping approaches in heterogeneous ecosystems, where both spatial and temporal resolutions are critical.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5953907", "pubmed_id": "29766371", "doi": "10.1186/s13021-018-0097-1", "venue": "Carbon Balance and Management", "journal": "Carbon Balance and Management", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2807570433", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["128809488", "1183492", "131296264", "131963336", "157785461", "15605549", "14682687", "52060775", "15882424", "140540390", "29381402", "2803901", "14669574", "131050047", "19234622", "27309028", "132596863", "85023351", "87132193", "4414279", "127692700", "129925527", "124643335", "86538807", "23070636", "82082129", "129014455", "131001633", "129328454", "130803912", "128999881", "1103447", "56098924", "132244418", "6693643", "133491950", "140613899", "39194318", "55147576", "26609248", "54723721", "29854089", "11451672", "20425095", "89141", "52254631", "5159970", "128399891", "129494315", "5155706", "7502354", "10509991", "85090215", "129054954", "134402978", "17004168"], "inbound_citations": ["54723721", "150375031"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21735418"}

Unfortunately, when the initial hidden layer output matrix is in a high dimensional feature space, solving the LASSO problem remains a challenge. To improve the efficiency of solving high-dimension LASSO, we propose interval LASSO based ELM (iLASSO-ELM), which is generated by incorporating interval selection of hidden layer output matrix into original LASSO-ELM. The proposed model combines the coarse screening of interval selection and fine screening of LASSO. Thus, it can identify the relevant hidden nodes quickly and prevent over-fitting.

This is particularly important for the scientific publishing domain, where currently most of the datasets are being created in an author-driven, manual manner. In addition, such datasets capture only fragments of the complete metadata, omitting usually, important elements such as the references, although they represent valuable information. In this paper we present an approach that aims at dealing with this aspect of extraction and processing of reference information. The experimental evaluation shows that, currently, our solution handles very well diverse types of reference format, thus making it usable for, or adaptable to, any area of scientific publishing. 1. INTRODUCTION The progressive adoption of Semantic Web (1) techniques resulted in the creation of a series of datasets connected by the Linked Data (2) initiative, and via the Linked Data principles, into a universal Web of Linked Data. In order to foster the continuous growth of this Linked Data Web, we need to improve the acquisition and extraction mechanisms of the underlying semantic metadata. Unfortunately, the scientific publishing domain, a domain with an enormous potential for generating large amounts of Linked Data, still promotes trivial mechanisms for producing semantic metadata. (3) As an illustration, the metadata acquisition process of the Semantic Web Dog Food Server, (4) the main Linked Data publication repository available on the Web, consists of two steps: * the authors manually fill-in submission forms corresponding to different publishing venues (e.g., conferences or workshops), with the resulting (usually XML) information being transformed via scripts into semantic metadata, and * the entity URIs (i.e., authors and publications) present in this semantic metadata are then manually mapped to existing Web URIs for linking/consolidation purposes. Moreover, independent of the creation/acquisition process, one particular component of the publication metadata, i.e., the reference information, is almost constantly neglected. The reason is mainly the amount of work required to manually create it, or the complexity of the task, in the case of automatic extraction. As a result, currently, there are no datasets in the Linked Data Web exposing reference information, while the number of digital libraries providing search and link functionality over references is rather limited. This is quite a problematic gap if we consider the amount of information provided by references and their foundational support for other application techniques that bring value to researchers and librarians, such as citation analysis and citation metrics, tracking temporal author-topic evolution (5) or co-authorship graph analysis. (6,7) In this paper we focus on the first of the above-mentioned steps, i.e., providing the underlying mechanisms for automatic extraction of reference metadata. We devise a solution that enables extraction and chunking of references using Conditional Random Fields (CRF). (8) The resulting metadata can then be easily transformed into semantic metadata adhering to particular schemas via scripts, the added value being the exclusion of the manual author-driven creation step from the process. From the domain perspective, we focus on computer science and health sciences only because these domains have representative datasets that can be used for evaluation and hence enable comparison against similar approaches. However, we believe that our model can be applied also in domains such as digital humanities or social sciences, and we intend, in the near future, to build a corresponding corpus that would allow us to test and adapt (if necessary) our solution to these domains. \u2026", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Information Technology and Libraries", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "110161424", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10003259", "150906", "2536130", "277918", "7138354", "141747", "2104960", "36344640", "514080", "1300961", "141747", "5786681", "16011291", "36344640", "658845", "2266699", "7209436", "18528318", "2475265", "9434555", "2776147", "277918", "2702042", "36344640", "141747", "6277818", "36344640", "141747", "1300961", "16011291"], "inbound_citations": ["27320720", "61097190"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53835987"}

To solve this problem, transfer learning leverages the labeled samples from the source domain to annotate the target domain which has few or none labels. Existing approaches typically consider learning a global domain shift while ignoring the intra-affinity between classes, which will hinder the performance of the algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel and general cross-domain learning framework that can exploit the intra-affinity of classes to perform intra-class knowledge transfer. The proposed framework, referred to as Stratified Transfer Learning (STL), can dramatically improve the classification accuracy for cross-domain activity recognition. Specifically, STL first obtains pseudo labels for the target domain via majority voting technique. Then, it performs intra-class knowledge transfer iteratively to transform both domains into the same subspaces. Finally, the labels of target domain are obtained via the second annotation. To evaluate the performance of STL, we conduct comprehensive experiments on three large public activity recognition datasets (i.e., OPPORTUNITY, PAMAP2, and UCI DSADS), which demonstrates that STL significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods w.r.t. classification accuracy (improvement of 7.68%). Furthermore, we extensively investigate the performance of STL across different degrees of similarities and activity levels between domains.

It is critical to ensure the veracity of the produced data because responses collected from different users may be noisy and unreliable. Previous works solve this veracity problem by estimating both the user ability and question difficulty based on the knowledge in each task individually. In this case, each single task needs large amounts of data to provide accurate estimations. However, in practice, budgets provided by customers for a given target task may be limited, and hence each question can be presented to only a few users where each user can answer only a few questions. This data sparsity problem can cause previous approaches to perform poorly due to the overfitting problem on rare data and eventually damage the data veracity. Fortunately, in real-world applications, users can answer questions from multiple historical tasks. For example, one can annotate images as well as label the sentiment of a given title. In this paper, we employ transfer learning, which borrows knowledge from auxiliary historical tasks to improve the data veracity in a given target task. The motivation is that users have stable characteristics across different crowdsourcing tasks and thus data from different tasks can be exploited collectively to estimate users' abilities in the target task. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model, TLC (Transfer Learning for Crowdsourcing), to implement this idea by considering the overlapping users as a bridge. In addition, to avoid possible negative impact, TLC introduces task-specific factors to model task differences. The experimental results show that TLC significantly improves the accuracy over several state-of-the-art non-transfer-learning approaches under very limited budget in various labeling tasks.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2487575.2487593", "venue": "KDD '13", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2045114813", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["38363", "1008215", "14187847", "14154185", "16438719", "60565534", "2963746", "740063", "547108", "59155870", "7008675", "7082873", "9256947", "16484321", "67124817", "2332622", "16197334", "5196212"], "inbound_citations": ["15926285", "16842020", "38645470", "52288233", "2700101", "6070060", "955887", "37735602", "208617394", "6858395", "6102609", "195448966", "15416426", "24609306", "2570572", "52897725", "77375177", "62895756", "202539746", "54457658", "15559378", "12119242", "17745507", "3004120", "207223616", "20524459", "206698004"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1236633"}

An effective way to improve the performance is through exploiting knowledge from other related tasks. Multi-task learning (MTL) is one such useful paradigm that aims to improve the performance through jointly modeling multiple related tasks. Although there exist numerous classification or regression models in machine learning literature, most of the MTL models are built around ridge or logistic regression. There exist some limited works, which propose multi-task extension of techniques such as support vector machine, Gaussian processes. However, all these MTL models are tied to specific classification or regression algorithms and there is no single MTL algorithm that can be used at a meta level for any given learning algorithm. Addressing this problem, we propose a generic, model-agnostic joint modeling framework that can take any classification or regression algorithm of a practitioner's choice (standard or custom-built) and build its MTL variant. The key observation that drives our framework is that due to small number of examples, the estimates of task parameters are usually poor, and we show that this leads to an under-estimation of task relatedness between any two tasks with high probability. We derive an algorithm that brings the tasks closer to their true relatedness by improving the estimates of task parameters. This is achieved by appropriate sharing of data across tasks. We provide the detail theoretical underpinning of the algorithm. Through our experiments with both synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate that the multi-task variants of several classifiers/regressors (logistic regression, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, Random Forest, ridge regression, support vector regression) convincingly outperform their single-task counterparts. We also show that the proposed model performs comparable or better than many state-of-the-art MTL and transfer learning baselines.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10115-016-0926-z", "venue": "Knowledge and Information Systems", "journal": "Knowledge and Information Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2285149252", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6617228", "13967968", "15781767", "10790217", "8873859", "10790217", "89141", "207752942", "9112273", "281573", "8153773", "6257661", "14154185", "317248", "16193644", "719551", "9869870", "17429744", "16341265", "12833219", "11010787", "13243633", "2745043", "35003919", "483797", "12817931", "9494747", "15764546", "303727", "10319833", "154757383", "124836998", "18365911", "5176875", "7311285", "11943552", "740063", "11169788", "9546337", "15610350", "56563878", "6692382", "15093863", "9238949", "12199213", "17565754", "11695825", "715932", "7263397", "13895067", "1314568", "9929910", "18237764", "1942105", "10772262"], "inbound_citations": ["13879593", "41868828"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1292195"}

In literature, it can be found that some techniques are used exclusively for the detection process and some others are dedicated for the recognition. In this paper, we propose to test and evaluate a common technique for both processes. More particularly, we consider in this paper only the detection process. In order to do that, we have investigated three descriptors: Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH), and Histogram Of Gradient (HOG) to get features of faces. These features are used for training process with the same Support Vector Machine classifier taken in different conditions in order to have training dataset. The use of LBPH desciptor followed by SVM classifier for the detection process consitite the second contribution of the paper. Two sets composed of negative images (non-faces) and positive images (faces) are used to generate the training dataset. The test is performed on another dataset.

For a specific region, the comprehensive effects of multiple meteorological factors are important indicators for the climatic suitability of the crops. To evaluate the synthetic effects, an integrated climatic assessment indicator (ICAI) are developed in Jiangsu Province, China. A newly produced meteorological assimilation driving datasets (CMADS V1.0) combined with observation data are used in establishing the indicator. The procedure to construct the indicator involves building statistical crop models by meteorological factors and determining the indicator values by classification. In modeling, two machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are compared and the classification model of RF is chosen to build ICAI due to its better performance in the independent test set. To determine a reasonable division in classification, distribution detection of climatic yield is carried out and Monte Carlo simulations are applied for the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (KS) test. The generated indicator includes three values: yield loss, normal and yield increment, with the spatial and temporal prediction accuracy from 67.86% to 100% in the test set for the Northern, Central and Southern Jiangsu. The ICAI are used to estimate the past climatic suitability of winter wheat and the future suitability under global warming conditions in Jiangsu Province. The results show that the climate in 1990s has more adverse effects on wheat production than the other two sub-periods in Northern and Southern Jiangsu. The adaptability of wheat production in Southern Jiangsu has improved greatly to the local environments during the past three decades. In addition, when annual temperature accelerates upwards, both possibilities of yield loss in Northern Jiangsu and yield increment in Southern Jiangsu will increase.

Our goal is to develop models that can separate TSs under normal conditions and TSs under traffic conditions preceding rear-end crashes using Random Forest encapsulated in TreeBagger class developed in MatLab by The MathWorks ([1]). Normal TSs for the whole year of 2005 were clustered to form groups of similar normal TSs that we call traffic regimes (TRs). Pre-crash TSs are classified into TRs so that a RECRIM for each TR is developed. Interpreting results of high performance models suggests that speed variance on the right lane and speed difference between two lanes are the two main causes of the rear-end crashes.

These results bring an idea of finding fraudulent documents from the inspection of financial ratios since the unacceptable conformity implies a large likelihood of a fraudulent document. Fuzzy support vector machines models are developed to implement such an idea. The dependent variable is a fuzzy variable quantifying the conformity of an XBRL instance document to the Benford's law; whereas, independent variables are financial ratios. Nevertheless, insufficient data are available to define any membership function for describing the fuzziness in independent and dependent variables, but the interval factor method is introduced to express that fuzziness. Using the resulting fuzzy support vector machines model, it is suggested that the price-to-book ratio versus equity ratio may be used to classify the priority of auditing XBRL instance documents. The misclassification rate is less than 30 \\%.

It is usually expensive to label new data instances for training a model. To solve this problem, domain adaptation in transfer learning has been proposed to classify target domain data by using some other source domain data, even when the data may have different distributions. However, domain adaptation may not work well when the differences between the source and target domains are large. In this paper, we design a novel transfer learning approach, called BIG (Bridging Information Gap), to effectively extract useful knowledge in a worldwide knowledge base, which is then used to link the source and target domains for improving the classification performance. BIG works when the source and target domains share the same feature space but different underlying data distributions. Using the auxiliary source data, we can extract a ?bridge? that allows cross-domain text classification problems to be solved using standard semisupervised learning algorithms. A major contribution of our work is that with BIG, a large amount of worldwide knowledge can be easily adapted and used for learning in the target domain.

While acute myocardial infarction (colloquially: heart attack), has multiple proximate causes, proximate etiology cannot be determined by a blood-based diagnostic test. We enrolled a suitable patient cohort and conducted a non-targeted quantification of plasma metabolites by mass spectrometry for developing a test that can differentiate between thrombotic MI, non-thrombotic MI, and stable disease. A significant challenge in developing such a diagnostic test is solving the NP-hard problem of feature selection for constructing an optimal statistical classifier. Objective We employed a Wisdom of Artificial Crowds (WoAC) strategy for solving the feature selection problem and evaluated the accuracy and parsimony of downstream classifiers in comparison with traditional feature selection techniques including the Lasso and selection using Random Forest variable importance criteria. Materials and methods Artificial Crowd Wisdom was generated via aggregation of the best solutions from independent and diverse genetic algorithm populations that were initialized with bootstrapping and a random subspaces constraint. Results/Conclusions Strong evidence was observed that a statistical classifier utilizing WoAC feature selection can discriminate between human subjects presenting with thrombotic MI, non-thrombotic MI, and stable Coronary Artery Disease given abundances of selected plasma metabolites. Utilizing the abundances of twenty selected metabolites, a leave-one-out cross-validation estimated misclassification rate of 2.6% was observed.

It is usually tackled in three stages: detection, feature extraction and classification. This paper focuses on the second stage of the process, namely traffic sign feature extraction and proposes to fuse two discriminative and complementary feature sets. In this approach, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is used to extract global features of traffic sign while Local Binary Patterns (LBP) is used to extract local descriptors.

This biochemical event has been proved to occur in multiple types of RNAs, including rRNA, mRNA, tRNA, and nuclear/nucleolar RNA.

Although some laboratory techniques have come up with moderately good outcomes in pseudouridine identification, they are costly and required skilled work experience. We propose iPseU-NCP \u2013 an efficient computational framework to predict pseudouridine sites using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm combined with nucleotide chemical properties (NCP) generated from RNA sequences. The benchmark dataset collected from Chen et al. (2016) was used to develop iPseU-NCP and fairly compare its performances with other methods. Under the same experimental settings, comparing with three state-of-the-art methods including iPseU-CNN, PseUI, and iRNA-PseU, the Matthew\u2019s correlation coefficient (MCC) of our model increased by about 20.0%, 55.0%, and 109.0% when tested on the H. sapiens (H_200) dataset and by about 6.5%, 35.0%, and 150.0% when tested on the S. cerevisiae (S_200) dataset, respectively. This significant growth in MCC is very important since it ensures the stability and performance of our model.

In the traditional settings of metric learning, an implicit assumption is that the associated labels of the instances are deterministic. However, in many real-world applications, the associated labels come naturally with probabilities instead of deterministic values. Thus, the existing metric learning methods cannot work well in these applications. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we study how to effectively learn the distance metric from datasets that contain probabilistic information, and then propose two novel metric learning mechanisms for two types of probabilistic labels, i.e., the instance-wise probabilistic label and the group-wise probabilistic label. Compared with the existing metric learning methods, our proposed mechanisms are capable of learning distance metrics directly from the probabilistic labels with high accuracy. We also theoretically analyze the two proposed mechanisms and provide theoretical bounds on the sample complexity for both of them.

It significantly reduces the training complexity of recurrent neural networks and is also suitable for hardware implementation whereby device physics are utilized in performing data processing. In this paper, the RC concept is applied to detecting a transmitted symbol in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. Due to wireless propagation, the transmitted signal may undergo severe distortion before reaching the receiver. The nonlinear distortion introduced by the power amplifier at the transmitter may further complicate this process. Therefore, an efficient symbol detection strategy becomes critical. The conventional approach for symbol detection at the receiver requires accurate channel estimation of the underlying MIMO-OFDM system. However, in this paper, we introduce a novel symbol detection scheme where the estimation of the MIMO-OFDM channel becomes unnecessary. The introduced scheme utilizes an echo state network (ESN), which is a special class of RC. The ESN acts as a black box for system modeling purposes and can predict nonlinear dynamic systems in an efficient way.

To facilitate application of the LLE to population genetic analysis, we systematically investigate several important properties of the LLE and reveal the connection between the LLE and principal component analysis (PCA). Identifying a set of markers and genomic regions which could be used for population structure analysis will provide invaluable information for population genetics and association studies. In addition to identifying the LLE-correlated or PCA-correlated structure informative marker, we have developed a new statistic that integrates genomic information content in a genomic region for collectively studying its association with the population structure and LASSO algorithm to search such regions across the genomes. We applied the developed methodologies to a low coverage pilot dataset in the 1000 Genomes Project and a PHASE III Mexico dataset of the HapMap. We observed that 25.1%, 44.9% and 21.4% of the common variants and 89.2%, 92.4% and 75.1% of the rare variants were the LLE-correlated markers in CEU, YRI and ASI, respectively.

Subsequently, based on this model, the most relevant candidates are chosen and introduced to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based recognizer. At the final stage, the recognition is finalized by the SVM, with the aid of a novel idea that is to segment the input word and find an entry with the maximum number of similar segments.

In particular, the framework considers the learning process of robotic writing as an adversarial procedure which is implemented by three interactive modules including a stroke generation module, a stroke discriminative module and a training module. Noting that the stroke generative module included in the conventional generative adversarial nets cannot solve the non-differentiable problem, the policy gradient commonly used in reinforcement learning is thus adapted in this work to train the generative module by regarding the outputs from the discriminative module as rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework allows a calligraphic robot to successfully write fundamental Chinese strokes with good quality in various styles.

So far, Laplacian regularization has been widely used in semisupervised learning. In this paper, we propose a new regularization method called tangent space intrinsic manifold regularization. It is intrinsic to data manifold and favors linear functions on the manifold. Fundamental elements involved in the formulation of the regularization are local tangent space representations, which are estimated by local principal component analysis, and the connections that relate adjacent tangent spaces. Simultaneously, we explore its application to semisupervised classification and propose two new learning algorithms called tangent space intrinsic manifold regularized support vector machines (TiSVMs) and tangent space intrinsic manifold regularized twin SVMs (TiTSVMs). They effectively integrate the tangent space intrinsic manifold regularization consideration. The optimization of TiSVMs can be solved by a standard quadratic programming, while the optimization of TiTSVMs can be solved by a pair of standard quadratic programmings.

Literature on using a two-stage DEA model to measure and classifying the banks using data from Ghana is also scarce. The purpose is to evaluate the efficiency of bank using DEA model and also classify the bank branches into classes using a proposed Bank Classification Algorithm (BC Algorithm). The study adopted a two-stage DEA model to measure the efficiency scores of 444 Ghanaian bank branches. The efficiencies of the banks in collecting deposits as well as investing the deposit were all calculates using the CCR Two-Phase DEA BuildHull algorithm. This algorithm has its package \u201cRobust Data Envelopment Analysis\u201d (rDEA) version 1.2-5 was implemented in R using R studio. The proposed Bank Classification Algorithm (BC Algorithm) was used to classify the banks where efficient bank was designated as bank with efficiency score of 80% or more. For deposit stage, 72.5%of the Banks were in class 2 thus, majority of the banks even though were not efficient in using resources to collect deposit, they were able to achieve overall efficiency. Just about 10.6% of the banks were efficient in collecting deposit from customers and also achieve overall efficiency. For investment stage, 82.9% of the banks were class 2 thus, majority was not efficient deposit (stage 2) but they were able to achieve overall efficiency. Just about 16.7% (74) of the banks were not efficient in investing their deposit and also achieve overall efficiency. Finally, the results of the analysis shows that majority of DMUs thus commercial bank branches in Ghana achieve greater percentage (80% or more) of performance/ overall efficiency in their dual role operations.

The three regression algorithms are the regression of support vector machine ( R -SVM), the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and the multiple regression analysis (MRA), while the three classification algorithms are the classification of support vector machine ( C -SVM), the naive Bayesian (NBAY), and the Bayesian successive discrimination (BAYSD). In general, when all these six algorithms are used to solve a real-world problem, they often produce different solution accuracies. In this paper, the solution accuracy is expressed with the total mean absolute relative residual for all samples, R (%), and it is proposed that an algorithm is applicable if R (%) \u2264 10 . A case study at the Nebraska Panhandle has been used to validate the proposed approach. This case study consists of two problems: regression and classification. The only difference between these two problems is the predicted variable in regression problem is real number, while the predicted variable in classification problem is integer number. And the integer number is determined from the real number by using proposed convertion rules. For the regression problem, R -SVM, BPNN and MRA are inapplicable because their R (%) values are 140, 51 and 293, respectively. For the classification problem, however, C -SVM, NBAY and BAYSD are all applicable since their R (%) values are all 0. From the case study, it is concluded that: a) For classification problems, the preferable algorithm is C -SVM, NBAY, or BAYSD, and BAYSD can also serve as a promising dimension-reduction tool; b) for regression problems, the preferable algorithm is BPNN, but MRA can serve as a promising dimension-reduction tool only when the studied problems are linear; c) if BPNN is inapplicable for a regression problem because its R (%) > 10, it is proposed to change this problem from regression to classification by reasonable conversion rules, then apply C -SVM, NBAY, or BAYSD; and d) comparing with C -SVM, BAYSD is conditionally better than C -SVM.

Recently, researchers started to tackle the OAD problem in the challenging setting of untrimmed, streaming videos that contain substantial background shots. However, they evaluate OAD in terms of per-frame labeling, which does not require detection at the instance-level and does not evaluate the timeliness of the online detection process. In this paper, we design new protocols and metrics. Further, to specifically address challenges of OAD in untrimmed, streaming videos, we propose three novel methods: (1) we design a hard negative samples generation module based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to better distinguish ambiguous background shots that share similar scenes but lack true characteristics of action start; (2) during training we impose a temporal consistency constraint between data around action start and data succeeding action start to model their similarity; (3) we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy to handle the scarcity of the important training data around action start.

Here, we unravel the invasion routes of the invasive pest Drosophila suzukii using a multi-locus microsatellite dataset (25 loci on 23 worldwide sampling locations). To do this, we use approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), which has improved the reconstruction of invasion routes, but can be computationally expensive. We use our study to illustrate the use of a new, more efficient, ABC method, ABC random forest (ABC-RF) and compare it to a standard ABC method (ABC-LDA). We find that Japan emerges as the most probable source of the earliest recorded invasion into Hawaii. Southeast China and Hawaii together are the most probable sources of populations in western North America, which then in turn served as sources for those in eastern North America. European populations are genetically more homogeneous than North American populations, and their most probable source is northeast China, with evidence of limited gene flow from the eastern US as well.

The object-oriented data set consists of segmented, near global, satellite precipitation data characterized into four-dimensional (4D) objects (longitude, latitude, time and intensity). We use the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) .25-degree dataset, which covers from 60N to 60S and from March 1st, 2000 to January 1st, 2011 as our source data. This data set is the called PERSIANN-CONNected objECT (CONNECT) and is stored in a PostgreSQL database. Using this novel data set we propose a prediction and discovery framework that 1) empirically studies the monthly precipitation systems, 2) builds accurate prediction models, and 3) estimates the relevance of the features included in a data matrix of attributes. We use four machine learning models, 1) Lasso, 2) Elastic Net, 3) Gradient Boosting Trees, and 4) Extremely Random Trees, combined with model validation, using a leave one out (LOO) prediction strategy and confidence estimation using bootstrap resampling that is applied to a precipitation prediction problem. Our case study focuses on a subset population of 626 Western U.S. precipitation systems. The study shows the joint interactions of the selected climate phenomena: 1) Arctic Oscillation (AO), 2) El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and 3) Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) on these 626 precipitation systems by analyzing the increased/decreased likelihood of having precipitation systems occurring over the Western U.S. In addition, this dissertation finds that the machine learning methods produce accurate monthly precipitation frequency predictions, comparable to climatology at different monthly lead times and identify relevant features that correspond to interacting modes of climate, such as the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP), Atlantic Meridional Mode Sea Surface Temperatures (AMMSST), North Pacific Index (NP) and the South West Monsoon Index (SWMONSOON) leading to alternate physical explanations of Western U.S. precipitation variability. Given the importance of monthly prediction in water resource planning and management, this framework provides an approach to understanding Western U.S. precipitation, and even more importantly, an approach that can be applicable to study precipitation around the world.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2522221178", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:29441413"}

Multivariate pattern analysis has been applied successfully to task-based and resting-based fMRI studies to investigate which neural markers distinguish individuals with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) from controls. Given the wealth of existing fMRI datasets, there is a need for techniques that can merge information from multiple datasets. We propose a data-driven approach that we apply to 2 fMRI experiments acquired in the same group of ASD (n=15) and control subjects (n=14). Methods. The 1st experiment (Conty, Dezecache, Hugueville, & Grezes, 2012) addressed how ASD participants process anger expressions. We presented pictures of individuals expressing social cues (i.e. gaze) directed or not at the observer (factors gaze direction*emotion, total 4 conditions). The 2nd experiment (Pichon, De Gelder, & Grezes, 2012) aimed at distinguishing between automaticity and attention in the processing of emotional stimuli varying attention while observing movie-clips depicting angry, fear and neutral body actions (factors attention*emotion, total 4 conditions). For each subject and experiment, we collected 370 EPI volumes (TR=2000ms). fMRI images were processed and analyzed using SPM8. Motion artefacts were taken into account by adding 24 motion-related regressors in each models (Friston, Williams, Howard, Frackowiak, & Turner, 1996). We first classified ASD from controls (figure 1). We trained a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) independently for each condition using the raw beta maps as inputs. The continuous outputs of the classifiers were then averaged to obtain a final decision for each subject. The accuracy was computed for each experiment (i.e. combination of 4 conditions) and for the fusion of the two experiments (i.e. combination of 8 conditions). The significance of the accuracy was computed using a binomial test. Although SVMs achieve good performance in high dimensional spaces, they can still benefit from feature selection methods. In addition, feature selection allows investigating the location of voxel activities driving the classification performance. Therefore we employed SVM Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM RFE) (Guyon, Weston, Barnhill, & Vapnik, 2002) to order features by relevance and restrain the classification to a subset of discriminant voxels. To identify the most discriminative voxels across experiments (i.e. voxels which are well ranked by SVM RFE on several conditions), we employed an approximation of the rank product test (Koziol, 2010). Results. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the different classification methods are reported in Table1. Regarding accuracy, the fusion of experiments reflected the accuracy of the most discriminative experiment. The fusion dramatically increased the significance of discriminative features and increased the number of significant discriminative voxels by roughly 50%. Discriminative voxels (figure2) were found in regions related to social cognition (FFA, OFA, EBA, STS, TPJ and premotor). These regions showed reduced contribution in ASD compared to controls. Feature selection did not improve accuracy but helped reducing the correlation of classifiers' output with motion (figure 3). Conclusions. These results show that the method is efficient for selecting features that are common across experiments, for identifying discriminative brain activity and for reducing motion artefacts. Identified areas were astonishingly consistent with brain regions of the \u201csocial-brain\u201d known to show aberrant functioning in ASD. One of the originalities of our method is that the computed statistic is based only on the features ranks. Consequently, this method could be used to combine heterogeneous data sources such as different fMRI experiments, different BOLD-related signals (i.e. activation magnitude, connectivity) or even different brain imaging modalities (i.e. structural MRI, voxel-based morphometry, functional MRI, PET).", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2340899377", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53465044"}

Hyperspectral imagery could provide a useful means of monitoring the efficacy of wilding control measures but little research has examined this possibility. Data were collected from an experiment, that included thirty-nine young Pinus contorta (Douglas) trees allocated to a control and two herbicide treatments (triclopyr butoxyethyl ester and diquat dibromide monohydrate). The objectives of this research were to examine the temporal impacts of herbicide on needle discolouration, spectral properties and tree physiology and to develop models to predict photosynthetic parameters from hyperspectral data. In accordance with obvious discolouration on the first day after treatment, values of net photosynthesis rate (A), electron transport rate (ETR), stomatal conductance (G) and optimal quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) declined rapidly for plants treated with diquat. Discolouration following application of triclopyr was not evident before the second week, and values of A, ETR, G and Fv/Fm declined slower than those of diquat. Of the tested narrow-band spectral indices calculated from needle spectra photochemical reflectance index (PRI) exhibited the strongest correlation with the four photosynthetic parameters and R2 values between PRI and A, Fv/Fm, ETR and G were, respectively, 0.53, 0.46, 0.68 and 0.29.

A number of studies have been developing strategies to extract knowledge from the clinical data, aiming to identify important risk factors that can be used to prevent the recurrence of diseases. However, these studies do not focus on secondary cancer. Secondary cancer is lack of the strategies for clinical treatment as well as risk factor identification to prevent the occurrence. Methods: We propose an effective ensemble feature learning method to identify the risk factors for predicting secondary cancer by considering class imbalance and patient heterogeneity. We first divide the patients into some heterogeneous groups based on spectral clustering. In each group, we apply the oversampling method to balance the number of samples in each class and use them as training data for ensemble feature learning. The purpose of ensemble feature learning is to identify the risk factors and construct a diagnosis model for each group. The importance of risk factors is measured based on the properties of patients in each group separately. We predict secondary cancer by assigning the patient to a corresponding group and based on the diagnosis model in this corresponding group. Results: Analysis of the results shows that the decision tree obtains the best results for predicting secondary cancer in the three classifiers. The best results of the decision tree are 0.72 in terms of AUC when dividing the patients into 15 groups, 0.38 in terms of F1 score when dividing the patients into 20 groups. In terms of AUC, decision tree achieves 67.4% improvement compared to using all 20 predictor variables and 28.6% improvement compared to no group division. In terms of F1 score, decision tree achieves 216.7% improvement compared to using all 20 predictor variables and 80.9% improvement compared to no group division. Different groups provide different ranking results for the predictor variables. Conclusion: The accuracies of predicting secondary cancer using k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, support vector machine indeed increased after using the selected important risk factors as predictors. Group division on patients to predict secondary cancer on the separated models can further improve the prediction accuracies. The information discovered in the experiments can provide important references to the personality and clinical symptom representations on all phases of guide interventions, with the complexities of multiple symptoms associated with secondary cancer in all phases of the recurrent trajectory.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6643128", "pubmed_id": "31341408", "doi": "10.7150/ijms.33820", "venue": "International Journal of Medical Sciences", "journal": "International Journal of Medical Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2951612214", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["9721852", "8795807", "80404854", "11830641", "426582", "10530343", "6655441", "13402694", "3052001", "23548858", "15916359", "6960306", "37982772", "63517017", "49689531", "1554582"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196537391"}

Timely availability of crop acreage estimation is crucial for maintaining economic and ecological sustainability or modelling purposes. Remote sensing data has proven to be a reliable source for crop mapping and acreage estimation on parcel-level. However, when relying on a single source of remote sensing data, e.g. multispectral sensors like RapidEye or Landsat, several obstacles can hamper the desired outcome, for example cloud cover or haze. Another limitation may be a similarity in optical reflectance patterns of crops, especially in an early season approach by the end of March, early April. Usually, a reliable crop type map for winter-crops (winter wheat/rye, winter barley and rapeseed) in Central Europe can be obtained by using optical remote sensing data from late April to early May, given a full coverage of the study area and cloudless conditions. These prerequisites can often not be met. By integrating dual-polarimetric SAR-sensors with high temporal and spatial resolution, these limitations can be overcome. SAR-sensors are not influenced by clouds or haze and provide an additional source of information due to the signal-interaction with plant-architecture. The overall goal of this study is to investigate the contribution of Sentinel-1 SAR-data to regional crop type mapping for an early season map of disaggregated winter-crops for a subset of the Rur-Catchment in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany). For this reason, RapidEye data and Sentinel-1 data are combined and the performance of Support Vector Machine and Maximum Likelihood classifiers are compared. Our results show that a combination of Sentinel-1 and RapidEye is a promising approach for most crops, but consideration of phenology for data selection can improve results.

For example, a typical content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system often relies on an effective distance metric to measure similarity between any two images. Conventional CBIR systems simply adopting Euclidean distance metric often fail to return satisfactory results mainly due to the well-known semantic gap challenge. In this article, we present a novel framework of Semi-Supervised Distance Metric Learning for learning effective distance metrics by exploring the historical relevance feedback log data of a CBIR system and utilizing unlabeled data when log data are limited and noisy. We formally formulate the learning problem into a convex optimization task and then present a new technique, named as \u201cLaplacian Regularized Metric Learning\u201d (LRML). Two efficient algorithms are then proposed to solve the LRML task. Further, we apply the proposed technique to two applications. One direct application is for Collaborative Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to explore the CBIR log data for improving the retrieval performance of CBIR systems.

We apply three techniques in training the BERT classifier, specifically, preliminary domain adaptation, repetitive soft undersampling, and classifier unification. These techniques cope with two levels of infrequency: legal term-level infrequency that causes class imbalance and legal term set-level infrequency that causes underfitting. Concretely, preliminary domain adaptation improves overall performance by providing prior knowledge of statutory sentences, repetitive soft undersampling improves performance on infrequent legal terms without sacrificing performance on frequent legal terms, and classifier unification improves performance on infrequent legal term sets by sharing common knowledge among legal term sets.

Because personal air quality data are collected manually, it difficult to collect such data in large quantities. The main challenge facing personal air quality predictions is building an effective prediction model with a small amount of training data. Moreover, public atmospheric monitoring stations in urban areas have collected large quantities of air quality data. Therefore, we focus on using atmospheric monitoring data with a transfer-learning method to predict personal air quality. In this paper, we design a transferlearning framework based on an encoder\u2013decoder structure. This transfer-learning framework uses the Wasserstein distance to match the heterogeneous distribution of the source domain (the data from the atmospheric monitoring stations) and the target domain (the personal air quality); we refer to this as decoder transfer learning (DTL). We use data from public atmospheric monitoring stations, collected by the Atmospheric Environmental Regional Observation System (AEROS) of Japan, as the source domain dataset and private datasets collected in Fujisawa, Japan, and Tokyo, Japan, as the target domain datasets to evaluate this approach.

Weaknesses of the servers enable hackers to intrude on computers by using not only known but also new attack-types, which are more sophisticated and harder to detect. To protect the computers from them, Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which is trained with some machine learning techniques by using a pre-collected dataset, is one of the most preferred protection mechanisms. The used datasets were collected during a limited period in some specific networks and generally don\u2019t contain up-to-date data. Additionally, they are imbalanced and cannot hold sufficient data for all types of attacks. These imbalanced and outdated datasets decrease the efficiency of current IDSs, especially for rarely encountered attack types. In this paper, we propose six machine-learning-based IDSs by using K Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaboost, Decision Tree, and Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithms. To implement a more realistic IDS, an up-to-date security dataset, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, is used instead of older and mostly worked datasets. The selected dataset is also imbalanced. Therefore, to increase the efficiency of the system depending on attack types and to decrease missed intrusions and false alarms, the imbalance ratio is reduced by using a synthetic data generation model called Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE). Data generation is performed for minor classes, and their numbers are increased to the average data size via this technique.

Though supervised methods for person re-identification have attained impressive performance, obtaining large scale cross-view labeled training data is very expensive. However, unlabelled data is available in abundance. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised metric learning approach that can utilize information in unlabelled data with the help of a few labelled training samples. We also address the small sample size problem that inherently occurs due to the few labeled training data. Our method learns a discriminative space where within class samples collapse to singular points, achieving the least within class variance, and then use a maximum margin criterion over a high dimensional kernel space to maximally separate the distinct class samples.

Our goal is to develop a single unified model that can simultaneously create and edit high quality face images with desired attributes. A key idea of our work is that we decompose the image into the latent and attribute vector in low dimensional representation, and then utilize the GAN framework for mapping the low dimensional representation to the image.

While there has been much work in recent years in understanding the consistency properties of learning algorithms for `binary' non-decomposable metrics, little is known either about the form of the optimal classifier for a general multi-class non-decomposable metric, or about how these learning algorithms generalize to the multi-class case. In this paper, we provide a unified framework for analysing a multi-class non-decomposable performance metric, where the problem of finding the optimal classifier for the performance metric is viewed as an optimization problem over the space of all confusion matrices achievable under the given distribution. Using this framework, we show that (under a continuous distribution) the optimal classifier for a multi-class performance metric can be obtained as the solution of a cost-sensitive classification problem, thus generalizing several previous results on specific binary non-decomposable metrics. We then design a consistent learning algorithm for concave multi-class performance metrics that proceeds via a sequence of cost-sensitive classification problems, and can be seen as applying the conditional gradient (CG) optimization method over the space of feasible confusion matrices. To our knowledge, this is the first efficient learning algorithm (whose running time is polynomial in the number of classes) that is consistent for a large family of multi-class non-decomposable metrics.

Leveraging on the advances of graph signal processing (GSP), recently binary classifier learning is posed as a signal restoration problem regularized using a graph smoothness prior, where the undirected graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of weighted edges connecting vertices with similar features. In this paper, we improve the performance of such a graph-based classifier by simultaneously optimizing the feature weights used in the construction of the similarity graph. Specifically, we start by interpolating missing labels by first formulating a boolean quadratic program with a graph signal smoothness objective, then relax it to a convex semi-definite program, solvable in polynomial time. Next, we optimize the feature weights used for construction of the similarity graph by reusing the smoothness objective but with a convex set constraint for the weight vector. The reposed convex but non-differentiable problem is solved via an iterative proximal gradient descent algorithm. The two steps are solved alternately until convergence.

However, the complex nature of laser-material interaction requires additional measures in order to reach the high-quality standards of the goods produced. Therefore, continuous process monitoring in laser welding is crucial to achieve reliable mass production and high-quality products at once. Camera-based process monitoring offers great advantages compared to one-dimensional observation techniques. The spatial resolution enables the monitoring of several process characteristics simultaneously, which leads to a more detailed description of the current process state2. In the last few years, we proposed a coaxially integrated camera system with external illumination. Process images taken by this system typically show the keyhole area, the weld pool, but also areas of solidified weld and areas of the blank sheet3. To automate image evaluation with respect to the recognition of aforementioned areas, we propose a convolutional neural network architecture to perform pixel-wise image classification4. In this paper, we investigate the influence of multiple hyper-parameters required for the network architecture in use, but also the amount of data that is necessary for high segmentation accuracies. In a second step, the outcome of the network is used to detect process deviations in laser welding image data using supervised machine learning. With the help of the Random Forest algorithm, assessment of the extracted process characteristics with respect to prediction accuracy takes place.

In the species distributions modelling literature, studies have demonstrated that more complex models tend to provide better fits.

Testing of species distributions models is challenging because independent data for testing are often lacking, but a more general problem is that model complexity has never been formally described in such studies. Here, we systematically examine predictive performance of models against data and models of varying complexity. We introduce the concept of computational complexity, widely used in theoretical computer sciences, to quantify model complexity. In addition, complexity of species distributional data is characterized by their geometrical properties. Tests involved analysis of models\u2019 ability to predict virtual species distributions in the same region and the same time as used for training the models, and to project distributions in different times under climate change. Of the eight species distribution models analyzed five (Random Forest, boosted regression trees, generalized additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, MaxEnt) showed similar performance despite differences in computational complexity. The ability of models to forecast distributions under climate change was also not affected by model complexity. In contrast, geometrical characteristics of the data were related to model performance in several ways: complex datasets were consistently more difficult to model, and the complexity of the data was affected by the choice of predictors and the type of data analyzed.

The efficacy of radiation treatment highly depends on segmentation accuracy. However, accurate segmentation of male pelvic organs is challenging due to low tissue contrast of CT images, as well as large variations of shape and appearance of the pelvic organs. Among existing segmentation methods, deformable models are the most popular, as shape prior can be easily incorporated to regularize the segmentation. Nonetheless, the sensitivity to initialization often limits their performance, especially for segmenting organs with large shape variations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to guide deformable models, thus making them robust against arbitrary initializations. Specifically, we learn a displacement regressor, which predicts 3D displacement from any image voxel to the target organ boundary based on the local patch appearance. This regressor provides a non-local external force for each vertex of deformable model, thus overcoming the initialization problem suffered by the traditional deformable models. To learn a reliable displacement regressor, two strategies are particularly proposed. 1) A multi-task random forest is proposed to learn the displacement regressor jointly with the organ classifier; 2) an auto-context model is used to iteratively enforce structural information during voxel-wise prediction. Extensive experiments on 313 planning CT scans of 313 patients show that our method achieves better results than alternative classification or regression based methods, and also several other existing methods in CT pelvic organ segmentation.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4918760", "pubmed_id": "26800531", "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2016.2519264", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2344669114", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["10972294", "6809168", "18846096", "11907574", "2269279", "8998794", "3135141", "13982095", "7706206", "9765151", "9763691", "13920184", "22005853", "691953", "34824702", "1344879", "206748223", "63717849", "967430", "12461947", "33191877", "10218449", "13829810", "62574244", "207752942", "42281583", "21715833", "19596703", "206019310", "5100207", "6758477", "28830436", "35411811", "5159370", "18602339"], "inbound_citations": ["73412855", "150377254", "204246620", "4629357", "195261213", "52288752", "46047547", "52057354", "3859265", "4896936", "210888814", "4864127", "13148953", "89618615", "5078659", "54482402", "2953744", "3742844", "195884149", "4182034", "44119104", "43944120", "13748891", "118857539", "52003762", "24646474", "206705553", "44087729"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23396922"}

Support vector machine classification (SVM-C) models were developed to provide qualitative estimations of the cream samples\u2019 microbiological status based on FTIR spectral fingerprints. The developed SVM models were further validated against independent samples obtained from the market and exhibited a satisfactory performance.

During the pulverised coal combustion, char particles are produced by devolatising coal and represent the dominant stage in the combustion process. The pyrolysis produces different char morphologies that determine coal reactivity affecting the performance of coal combustion in power plants and the emissions of carbon dioxide, CO2. In this paper, an automatic char classification model is proposed using supervised learning. A general classification model is trained given a set of char particles classified by an expert. In particular, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest are the trained classifiers. Two types of features are evaluated to built classification models: local and global. Local features are calculated using the Scale-Invariant Transform Feature (SIFT). Global features are defined based on the morphology classification by the International Committee for Coal and Organic Petrology (ICCP). Each classifier is trained by SVM or Random Forest and evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation. The 70% of data is used as training set and the rest as testing set. A total of 2928 char-particle images are used for evaluating performance of classification models. Additionally, evaluation of model generalisation capability is done using a test set of 732 char particle images.

Terrain smoothing from 10 to 30 m raster resolution was applied in order to obtain the best possible model. For the same purpose, several model tuning parameters were tested and a prepredictor selection with the R-package Boruta was applied. Model versions were evaluated and compared by 100 repetitions of the calculation of the residual mean square error of a five-fold cross-validation. Position specific density functions of the predicted soil parameters were then used to display prediction uncertainty. Prepredictor selection and tuning of the Random Forest algorithm in some cases resulted in an improved model performance. We therefore recommend testing prepredictor selection and tuning to make sure that the best possible model is chosen.

An automatic singer identification system is constructed and has achieved a very high identification accuracy. This system consists of three crucial parts: singing voice detection, background music removal and pattern recognition. These parts are introduced and explored in great details in this thesis. To be specific, in terms of the singing voice detection, we firstly study a traditional method, double GMM. Then an improved method, namely single GMM, is proposed. The experimental result shows that the detection accuracy of single GMM can be achieved as high as 96.42%. In terms of the background music removal, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) are demonstrated. The evaluation result shows that RPCA outperforms NMF. In terms of pattern recognition, we explore the algorithms of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).

However, these models have high computational demand, limiting their clinical adoption. In this manuscript, we present a deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) for predicting average strain as an alternative to physics-based approaches. The model is trained on a large database of synthetically generated cancellous bone anatomies, where the target values are computed using the physics-based FEA model. The performance of the trained model was assessed by comparing the predictions against physics-based computations on a separate test data set. Correlation between deep learning and physics-based predictions was very good (0.895, p < 0.001), and no systematic bias was found in Bland-Altman analysis. The CNN model also performed better than the previously introduced Support Vector Machine (SVM) model which relied on handcrafted features (correlation 0.847, p < 0.001).

It is quite useful for many applications, such as surveillance systems and smart vehicle systems. It is also an important basic step for content analysis for behavior recognition and target detection. Due to the variations in human positions, complicated backgrounds and environmental conditions, human tracking remains challenging work. In particular, difficulties caused by environment and background such as occlusion and noises should be solved. Also, real-time human tracking now seems a critical step in intelligent video surveillance systems because of its huge computational workload. In this paper we propose a Particle Swarm Optimization based Support Vector Machine (PSO-SVM) to overcome these problems. First, we finish the preliminary human tracking step in several frames based on some filters such as particle filter and kalman filter. Second, for each newly come frame need to be processed, we use the proposed PSO-SVM to process the previous frames as a regression frame work, based on this regression frame work, an estimated location of the target will be calculated out. Third, we process the newly come frame based on the particle filter and calculate out the target location as the basic target location. Finally, based on comparison analysis between basic target location and estimated target location, we can get the tracked target location.

Medullary breast cancers (MBC) display a basal profile, but a favorable prognosis. We hypothesized that a previously published 368-gene expression signature associated with MBC might serve to define a prognostic classifier in basal cancers. We collected public gene expression and histoclinical data of 2145 invasive early breast adenocarcinomas. We developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on this 368-gene list in a learning set, and tested its predictive performances in an independent validation set. Then, we assessed its prognostic value and that of six prognostic signatures for disease-free survival (DFS) in the remaining 2034 samples. The SVM model accurately classified all MBC samples in the learning and validation sets. A total of 466 cases were basal across other sets. The SVM classifier separated them into two subgroups, subgroup 1 (resembling MBC) and subgroup 2 (not resembling MBC). Subgroup 1 exhibited 71% 5-year DFS, whereas subgroup 2 exhibited 50% (P = 9.93E-05). The classifier outperformed the classical prognostic variables in multivariate analysis, conferring lesser risk for relapse in subgroup 1 (HR = 0.52, P = 3.9E-04). This prognostic value was specific to the basal subtype, in which none of the other prognostic signatures was informative. Ontology analysis revealed effective immune response (IR), enhanced tumor cell apoptosis, elevated levels of metastasis-inhibiting factors and low levels of metastasis-promoting factors in the good-prognosis subgroup, and a more developed cell migration system in the poor-prognosis subgroup. In conclusion, based on this 368-gene SVM model derived from an MBC signature, basal breast cancers were classified in two prognostic subgroups, suggesting that MBC and basal breast cancers share similar molecular alterations associated with aggressiveness. This signature could help define the prognosis, adapt the systemic treatment, and identify new therapeutic targets.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "20490655", "doi": "10.1007/s10549-010-0897-9", "venue": "Breast Cancer Research and Treatment", "journal": "Breast Cancer Research and Treatment", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2007997332", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["25226357", "15549055", "6840112", "2915321", "68802759", "9118907", "23665256", "2979385", "10951527", "27591579", "14879001", "10395", "577727", "39116639", "10345168", "2459288", "13370676", "6300410", "27080534", "6570324", "8937660", "15266174", "7068685", "8225580", "206323507", "8419197", "17675287", "6851374", "15629986", "8424051", "13856936", "8705854", "14389580", "39871598", "27583168", "2109069", "3115693", "13143603", "2374637", "28486032", "10608218", "16505733", "41913630", "24425926", "7983611", "985005", "5446612", "205243065", "2256403", "18780779", "26694347", "41466242", "17146065", "46480036", "25894733"], "inbound_citations": ["207697398", "31052264", "54619826", "2702346", "1034633", "26001028", "14063679", "11078497", "14966351", "8534895", "15842717", "27545828", "1389371", "30713069", "13460141", "10611224", "23158224", "12316065", "21724144", "215527015", "1439024", "29052168", "14557771", "215332591", "12961130", "6348006", "7427690", "53689856", "30116430", "11452854", "6034516", "74323472", "11354636", "215214961", "34780750", "40810733", "8982923", "21695240", "30246401", "1491969", "953540", "195985138", "21743034", "4586756", "18894011", "6241104", "7901292", "2137543", "566676", "19286658", "14064892", "215211933", "6955563", "25829390", "27924132", "215598018", "59252202", "2983007", "18179884", "17010195", "2719787", "20884550", "13903701", "2012282", "195797984", "215614591", "206317489", "7664672", "215398954", "9209549", "16487289", "34773957", "28939078", "18996421", "215703226", "7043607", "13227531", "7790406", "28947661", "7025338", "6146057", "57728829", "2109348", "4684509", "215623584", "198119162", "11606626", "16989801", "79605602", "214857872", "173990088", "46470863", "8225731", "6207465", "9838093", "1694634", "215015069", "13668519", "108292935", "51727196", "27074608", "30454990", "12601819", "215189503", "1582779", "2391274", "67033743", "4473795", "206336784", "29028471", "18031130", "92226371", "17158446", "14068721", "6054406", "44036989", "92312013", "16203026", "49527005", "211038960", "215605292", "1417144", "4427439", "53214831", "214840147", "12162706", "56265204", "18041971", "51828029", "49291159", "215667670", "11595740"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:804853"}

To perform well on a given task, these algorithms require large dataset for training. However, deep learning algorithms lack generalization and suffer from over-fitting whenever trained on small dataset, especially when one is dealing with medical images. For supervised image analysis in medical imaging, having image data along with their corresponding annotated ground-truths is costly as well as time consuming since annotations of the data is done by medical experts manually. In this paper, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network for Medical Imaging (MI-GAN). The MI-GAN generates synthetic medical images and their segmented masks, which can then be used for the application of supervised analysis of medical images. Particularly, we present MI-GAN for synthesis of retinal images. The proposed method generates precise segmented images better than the existing techniques.

We aim to answer three research questions: (i) Is it possible to reliably distinguish deception from truth based on EDA measurements during a dyadic game interaction? (ii) Is it possible to reliably distinguish the state of suspicion from trust based on EDA measurements during a card game? (iii) What is the relative importance of EDA measured on left and right wrists? To answer our research questions we conducted a study in which 20 participants were playing the game Cheat in pairs with one EDA sensor placed on each of their wrists. Our experimental results show that EDA measures from left and right wrists provide more information for suspicion detection than for deception detection and that the person-dependent detection is more reliable than the person-independent detection. In particular, classifying the EDA signal with Support Vector Machine (SVM) yields accuracies of 52% and 57% for person-independent prediction of deception and suspicion respectively, and 63% and 76% for person-dependent prediction of deception and suspicion respectively. Also, we found that: (i) the optimal interval of informative EDA signal for deception detection is about 1 s while it is around 3.5 s for suspicion detection; (ii) the EDA signal relevant for deception/suspicion detection can be captured after around 3.0 seconds after a stimulus occurrence regardless of the stimulus type (deception/truthfulness/suspicion/trust); and that (iii) features extracted from EDA from both wrists are important for classification of both deception and suspicion.

Although for model-based friction compensation, several sophisticated friction models have been proposed in the literatures, there exists no universally agreed parametric friction model, which by implication has made selection of an appropriate parametric model difficult. More so, accurate determination of the parameters of these sophisticated parametric friction models has been challenging due to complexity of friction nonlinearities. Motivated by the need for a simple, non-parametric based, and yet effective friction compensation in motion control system, an Artificial Intelligent (AI)-based (non-parametric) friction model using v-Support Vector Regression (v-SVR) is proposed in this work to estimate the non-linear friction in a motion control system. Unlike conventional SVR technique, v-SVR is characterized with fewer parameters for its development, and requires less development time. The effectiveness of the developed model in representing and compensating for the frictional effects is evaluated experimentally on a rotary experimental motion system. The performance is benchmarked with three parametric based (Coulomb, Tustin, and Lorentzian) friction models. The results show the v-SVR as a viable and efficient alternative to the parametric-based techniques in representing and compensating friction effects.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.engappai.2012.03.018", "venue": "Eng.

Hackers and intruders can create many successful attempts to cause the crash of the networks and web services by unauthorized intrusion. New threats and associated solutions to prevent these threats are emerging together with the secured system evolution. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are one of these solutions. The main function of Intrusion Detection System is to protect the resources from threats. It analyzes and predicts the behaviours of users, and then these behaviours will be considered an attack or a normal behaviour. There are several techniques which exist at present to provide more security to the network, but most of these techniques are static. On the other hand, intrusion detection is a dynamic one, which can give dynamic protection to the network security by observing the attack. In recent times, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been extensively applied to provide potential solutions for the IDS problem.

A clear understanding of those reasons, and accurate classification of gap-type, are critical for 3D geometry-based damage assessment. In this study, a methodology was developed to delineate buildings from a point cloud and classify the present gaps. The building delineation process was carried out by identifying and merging the roof segments of single buildings from the pre-segmented 3D point cloud. This approach detected 96% of the buildings from a point cloud generated using airborne oblique images. The gap detection and classification methods were tested using two other data sets obtained with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images with a ground resolution of around 1\u20132 cm.

Generally, meta-heuristic optimization is required to optimize scheme parameters in the watermarking embedding. Even though meta-heuristic methods have been widely used because of their enhancing capability, due to their large time consumption nature they are not applicable for time-sensitive applications. This paper proposes a time efficient optimization method based on machine learning algorithms to detect the best embedding parameter for image watermarking with both robustness and imperceptibility. Initially, for providing robustness against watermarking attacks, a method for watermarking embedding is designed in the domain of Discrete Cosine Transform. After that, Ant Colony optimization is used for finding the optimization parameters. Then an observation data is obtained, which includes the feature vector and optimum strength values of the training images. The image features are extracted at different embedded strength values by the calculation of optimum fitness function. Finally Light Gradient Boosting algorithm (LGBA) is applied to predict the optimum embedding parameters of the set of new images which are to be watermarked. When compared with the existing optimization methods, it has been found that the proposed method consumes very less time for the evaluation of optimum solutions. From the results, it has been identified that the proposed algorithm satisfies the image watermarking with the improvement in time enhancement.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) regulates the transcription of several gene products involved in the protective response to oxidative stress. The transcriptional regulatory and signaling relationships linking gene products involved in the response to oxidative stress are, currently, only partially resolved. Microarray data constitute RNA abundance measures representing gene expression patterns. In some cases, these patterns can identify the molecular interactions of gene products. They can be, in effect, proxies for protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Traditional techniques used for clustering coregulated genes on high-throughput gene arrays are rarely capable of distinguishing between direct transcriptional regulatory interactions and indirect ones. In this study, newly developed information-theoretic algorithms that employ the concept of mutual information were used: the Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNE), and Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR). These algorithms captured dependencies in the gene expression profiles of the mouse lung, allowing the regulatory effect of Nrf2 in response to oxidative stress to be determined more precisely. In addition, a characterization of promoter sequences of Nrf2 regulatory targets was conducted using a Support Vector Machine classification algorithm to corroborate ARACNE and CLR predictions. Inferred networks were analyzed, compared, and integrated using the Collective Analysis of Biological Interaction Networks (CABIN) plug-in of Cytoscape. Using the two network inference algorithms and one machine learning algorithm, a number of both previously known and novel targets of Nrf2 transcriptional activation were identified. Genes predicted as novel Nrf2 targets include Atf1, Srxn1, Prnp, Sod2, Als2, Nfkbib, and Ppp1r15b. Furthermore, microarray and quantitative RT-PCR experiments following cigarette-smoke-induced oxidative stress in Nrf2(+/+) and Nrf2(-/-) mouse lung affirmed many of the predictions made. Several new potential feed-forward regulatory loops involving Nrf2, Nqo1, Srxn1, Prdx1, Als2, Atf1, Sod1, and Park7 were predicted.

In contrast to dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, the resulting features from feature selection are selected from the original feature space; hence, easy to interpret. A large host of feature selection algorithms has been proposed in the literature. This has created a critical issue: which algorithm should one use? Moreover, how does a feature selection method affect the performance of a given classification algorithm? This paper addresses these issues by (1) presenting an open source software system that integrates eleven feature selection algorithms and five common classifiers; and (2) systematically comparing and evaluating the selected features and their impact over these five classifiers using five datasets. Specifically, this system includes ten commonly adopted filter-based feature selection algorithms: ChiSquare, Information Gain, Fisher Score, Gini Index, Kruskal-Wallis, Laplacian Score, ReliefF, FCBF, CFS, and mRmR. It also includes one state-of-the-art embedded approach built upon Random Forests. The five classifiers are SVM, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, kNN and C4.5 Decision Tree. Comprehensive evaluations consisting of around 1000 experiments were conducted over five text datasets. Several approximately equivalent groups (AEG), where algorithms in the same group select highly similar features, have been identified. Suitable feature-selection-classifier combinations have also been identified. For example, Chi-square and Information Gain form an AEG. Furthermore, Gini Index or Kruskal-Wallis together with SVM often produces classification performance that is comparable with or better than using all the original features.

Furthermore, inspired from the conventional Common Spatial Pattern, discriminant analysis performed directly on the SPD manifold using different mentioned metrics are proposed to improve the classification accuracy. We also propose a new feature, namely Heterogeneous Orders Relevance Composition (HORC), by combining different relevance matrices, such as Covariance, Mutual Information or Kernel Matrix under the Tensor Framework and Multiple Kernel fusion. Multi-Class Multi-Kernel Relevance Vector Machine is adopted to provide a sparse classifier and Bayesian confidence prediction. Finally, we compare the performance of total 16 methods on the dataset IIa of the BCI Competition IV.

The applicability of RS methods is determined by its limitations and requirements. One of the most important limitations is the species percentage cover at which the classification result is correct and useful for nature conservation. The primary objective, carried out in 2017 in three areas of Poland, was to determine the minimum percentage cover from which it is possible to identify a target species by RS methods. A secondary objective of this research, related to the requirements of the method, was to optimize the set of training polygons for a target species in terms of the number of polygons and abundance percentage cover of the target species. Our method has to be easy to use, effective, and applicable, therefore the analysis was carried out using the basic set of rasters\u2014the first 30 channels after the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation (the mosaic of hyperspectral data from HySpex sensors with spectral range 0.4\u20132.5 \u00b5m) and commonly used Random Forest algorithm. The analysis used airborne hyperspectral data with a spatial resolution of 1 m to perform classification of one invasive and three expansive plants\u2014two grasses and two large perennials. On-ground training and validation data sets were collected simultaneously with airborne data collection. When testing different classification scenarios, only the set of training polygons for a target species was changed. Classification results were evaluated based on three methods: accuracy measures (Kappa and F1), true-positive pixels in subclasses with different species cover and compatibility with field mapping. The classification results indicate that to classify the target plant species at the accepted level, the training dataset should contain polygons with a species cover ranging from 80\u2013100%. Training performed only using polygons with a species characterized by a variable, but lower, cover (20\u201370%) and missing samples in the 80\u2013100% range, led to a map which was not acceptable because of a high overestimation of target species.

We aimed to determine if subgroups of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subjects can be identified based on differences in gut microbial composition, and if there are correlations between gut microbial measures and structural brain signatures in IBS.MethodsBehavioral measures, stool samples, and structural brain images were collected from 29 adult IBS and 23 healthy control subjects (HCs). 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was used to profile stool microbial communities, and various multivariate analysis approaches were used to quantitate microbial composition, abundance, and diversity. The metagenomic content of samples was inferred from 16S rRNA gene sequence data using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt). T1-weighted brain images were acquired on a Siemens Allegra 3T scanner, and morphological measures were computed for 165 brain regions.ResultsUsing unweighted Unifrac distances with hierarchical clustering on microbial data, samples were clustered into two IBS subgroups within the IBS population (IBS1 (n = 13) and HC-like IBS (n = 16)) and HCs (n = 23) (AUROC = 0.96, sensitivity 0.95, specificity 0.67). A Random Forest classifier provided further support for the differentiation of IBS1 and HC groups. Microbes belonging to the genera Faecalibacterium, Blautia, and Bacteroides contributed to this subclassification. Clinical features distinguishing the groups included a history of early life trauma and duration of symptoms (greater in IBS1), but not self-reported bowel habits, anxiety, depression, or medication use. Gut microbial composition correlated with structural measures of brain regions including sensory- and salience-related regions, and with a history of early life trauma.ConclusionsThe results confirm previous reports of gut microbiome-based IBS subgroups and identify for the first time brain structural alterations associated with these subgroups.

Deep Learning (DL), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) were used to differentiate AD from CN.

Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID).

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that organically combines an existing spectrum-based deep metric learning model and the conditional random field algorithm. The deep metric learning model is supervised by center loss, and is used to produce spectrum-based features that gather more tightly within classes in Euclidean space. The conditional random field with Gaussian edge potentials, which is firstly proposed for image segmentation problem, is utilized to jointly account for both the geometry distance of two pixels and the Euclidean distance between their corresponding features extracted by the deep metric learning model. The final predictions are given by the conditional random field. Generally, the proposed framework is trained by spectra pixels at the deep metric learning stage, and utilizes the half handcrafted spatial features at the conditional random field stage.

The classification of the targets is realized by making comparison between the deduced target properties and the different target features which are already recorded in a database. First, the study of scattering theory allows us to understand the physical meaning of the extracted features and describe them mathematically. Second, feature extraction methods are applied in order to extract signatures of the targets. A good choice of features is important to distinguish different targets. Different methods of feature extraction are compared including wavelet transform and high resolution techniques such as: Prony\u2019s method, Root-Multiple SIgnal Classification (Root-MUSIC), Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT) and Matrix Pencil Method (MPM). Third, an efficient method of supervised classification is necessary to classify unknown targets by using the extracted features. Different methods of classification are compared: Mahalanobis Distance Classifier (MDC), Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). A useful classifier design technique should have a high rate of accuracy in the presence of noisy data coming from different aspect angles. The different algorithms are demonstrated using simulated backscattered data from canonical objects and complex target geometries modeled by perfectly conducting thin wires. A method of ATC based on the use of Matrix Pencil Method in Frequency Domain (MPMFD) for feature extraction and MDC for classification is proposed. Simulation results illustrate that features extracted with MPMFD present a plausible solution to automatic target classification. In addition, we prove that the proposed method has better ability to tolerate noise effects in radar target classification.

The proposed method consists of two stages: candidate generation and verification. The candidate generation stage is aimed at obtaining the segmentation through the energy minimization. In this stage, images are first partitioned into a number of image regions. Then, Support Vector Machines (SVM) is applied on those pre-partitioned image regions to obtain the class conditional distributions, which are then fed into an energy function and optimized with the graph-cut algorithm.

This paper presents a methodological framework based on data mining techniques for exploring the determinants of urban expansion. We employ the Random Forest regression to apportion the relative importance for 33 determinants of urban expansion across 30 megacities in China. Analysis is facilitated by a dataset of urban land information in period 1993\u20132012 (derived from time-series nighttime light imageries) as the independent variable, and an equivalent dataset of 33 determinants of four categories (economic, demographic, social and natural) as exploratory variables. Results show that the relative importance of determinants varies with cities but shows some similarities. Greatest contribution is observed for the economic determinants, followed by social determinants. Demographic and natural determinants have comparative relative importance. In general, economic, social, and demographic determinants have increasing contribution to urban expansion, but the natural determinants show declining influence on urban expansion with time. Four clusters are identified by a Self-Organizing Map among the 30 megacities, with respect to the driving forces profiles. Urban expansion in these four clusters is respectively dominated by demographic, social, natural, and economic determinants.

In this paper, a new front-end for ABSC is proposed that incorporates this specific information through the non-negative decomposition of bird sound spectrograms. It consists of the following two different stages: short-time feature extraction and temporal feature integration. In the first stage, which aims at providing a better spectral representation of bird sounds on a frame-by-frame basis, two methods are evaluated. In the first method, cepstral-like features (NMF_CC) are extracted by using a filter bank that is automatically learned by means of the application of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on bird audio spectrograms. In the second method, the features are directly derived from the activation coefficients of the spectrogram decomposition as performed through NMF (H_CC). The second stage summarizes the most relevant information contained in the short-time features by computing several statistical measures over long segments. The experiments show that the use of NMF_CC and H_CC in conjunction with temporal integration significantly improves the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based ABSC system with respect to conventional MFCC.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5476267", "pubmed_id": "28628630", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0179403", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2646300815", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["33485268", "83558588", "9046763", "23647911", "16989828", "17355112", "10072489", "63736727", "9092886", "6165096", "17878171", "10988833", "33403036", "4005816", "34644762", "2856543", "1502120", "3200465", "2935999", "16320334", "2237682", "2095855", "33913183", "35785666", "9067943", "9177319", "39660980", "88513115", "122266405", "961425", "12506569"], "inbound_citations": ["214583248", "139108671"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:284323"}

The development of rapid point-of-care (POC) chairside diagnostics has the potential for the early detection of periodontal infection and progression to identify incipient disease and reduce health care costs. However, validation of effective diagnostics requires the identification and verification of biomarkers correlated with disease progression. This clinical study sought to determine the ability of putative host- and microbially derived biomarkers to identify periodontal disease status from whole saliva and plaque biofilm. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: One hundred human subjects were equally recruited into a healthy/gingivitis group or a periodontitis population. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects and analyzed using antibody arrays to measure the levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and bone resorptive/turnover markers. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Salivary biomarker data were correlated to comprehensive clinical, radiographic, and microbial plaque biofilm levels measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for the generation of models for periodontal disease identification. Significantly elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and -9 were found in subjects with advanced periodontitis with Random Forest importance scores of 7.1 and 5.1, respectively. The generation of receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated that permutations of salivary biomarkers and pathogen biofilm values augmented the prediction of disease category. Multiple combinations of salivary biomarkers (especially MMP-8 and -9 and osteoprotegerin) combined with red-complex anaerobic periodontal pathogens (such as Porphyromonas gingivalis or Treponema denticola) provided highly accurate predictions of periodontal disease category. Elevated salivary MMP-8 and T. denticola biofilm levels displayed robust combinatorial characteristics in predicting periodontal disease severity (area under the curve = 0.88; odds ratio = 24.6; 95% confidence interval: 5.2 to 116.5). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Using qPCR and sensitive immunoassays, we identified host- and bacterially derived biomarkers correlated with periodontal disease.

It is often beneficial to learn such a metric from the input training data, instead of using a default one such as the Euclidean distance. In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed BoostMetric, for learning a quadratic Mahalanobis distance metric. Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance metric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the metric remains positive definite. Semidefinite programming is often used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well and easy to implement. BoostMetric is instead based on the observation that any positive semidefinite matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. BoostMetric thus uses rank-one positive semidefinite matrices as weak learners within an efficient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting methods are easy to implement, efficient, and can accommodate various types of constraints. We extend traditional boosting algorithms in that its weak learner is a positive semidefinite matrix with trace and rank being one rather than a classifier or regressor.

Recently, we proposed Twin Kernel Embedding (TKE) that processes structured or non-vectorial data directly without vectorization. Here, we apply this method to clustering and visualizing fingerprints in a 2-dimensional space. It works by learning an optimal kernel in the latent space from a distance metric defined on the input fingerprints instead of a kernel.

Direct observation was used to continuously code ground truth activity class and specific activity types occurring within each class using a bespoke two-stage coding scheme. Performance was assessed by calculating overall classification accuracy and extended confusion matrices summarizing class-level accuracy and the frequency of specific activities observed within each class. ::: ::: Results: Accuracy for the hip and wrist RF algorithms was 69.4% and 59.1%, respectively. Accuracy for hip and wrist SVM algorithms was 66.4% and 59.3%, respectively. Compared to the laboratory cross-validation, accuracy decreased by 11-15% for the hip classifiers and 19-21% for the wrist classifiers.

Nevertheless, there is no clear understanding of the rule extraction routine from nonlinear SVM. The most comprehensible methods imply very complicated and indirect constraints that strictly enforce convexity of the searched-through half-space of inducted nonlinear classifier [1]. Apparently non-convex hyper-surfaces couldnt be effectively described by a finite set of convex rules without violating bounds of constrained non-convex area. In this paper we describe an approach for converting a widely acknowledged rule extraction algorithm for Linear Support Vector Machine [3] into a number of constrained linear programming (LP) problems. Stated LP problems incorporate finite number of linear constraints based on different individual decision hyperplanes to ensure piecewise-linear approximation of underlying nonlinearity.

In this paper, we proposed a View Transformation Generative Adversarial Networks (VT-GAN) to achieve view transformation of gaits across two arbitrary views using only one uniform model. In specific, we generated gaits in target view conditioned on input images from any views and the corresponding target view indicator. In addition to the classical discriminator in GAN which makes the generated images look realistic, a view classifier is imposed. This controls the consistency of generated images and conditioned target view indicator and ensures to generate gaits in the specified target view. On the other hand, retaining identity information while performing view transformation is another challenge. To solve the issue, an identity distilling module with triplet loss is integrated, which constrains the generated images inheriting identity information from inputs and yields discriminative feature embeddings.

In this work the attention is focused on two such commonly accepted hypotheses: (i) the hemodynamic response function (HRF) to be searched in the BOLD signal can be described by a specific parametric model e.g., double-gamma; (ii) the effect of stimuli on the signal is taken to be linearly additive. While these assumptions have been empirically proven to generate high sensitivity for statistical methods, they also limit the identification of relevant voxels to what is already postulated in the signal, thus not allowing the discovery of unknown correlates in the data due to the presence of unexpected hemodynamics. This paper tries to overcome these limitations by proposing a method wherein the HRF is learned directly from data rather than induced from its basic form assumed in advance. This approach produces a set of voxel-wise models of HRF and, as a result, relevant voxels are filterable according to the accuracy of their prediction in a machine learning framework.This approach is instantiated using a temporal architecture based on the paradigm of Reservoir Computing wherein a Liquid State Machine is combined with a decoding Feed-Forward Neural Network. This splits the modeling into two parts: first a representation of the complex temporal reactivity of the hemodynamic response is determined by a universal global \"reservoir\" which is essentially temporal; second an interpretation of the encoded representation is determined by a standard feed-forward neural network, which is trained by the data. Thus the reservoir models the temporal state of information during and following temporal stimuli in a feed-back system, while the neural network \"translates\" this data to fit the specific HRF response as given, e.g. by BOLD signal measurements in fMRI.An empirical analysis on synthetic datasets shows that the learning process can be robust both to noise and to the varying shape of the underlying HRF. A similar investigation on real fMRI datasets provides evidence that BOLD predictability allows for discrimination between relevant and irrelevant voxels for a given set of stimuli.

This thesis starts from the error analysis for the three top-performing systems in FNC-1. Based on the analysis, a simple but tough-to-beat Multilayer Perceptron system is chosen as the baseline. Afterwards, three approaches are explored to improve baseline.The first approach explores the possibility of improving the prediction accuracy by adding extra keywords features when training a model, where keywords are converted to an indicator vector and then concatenated to the baseline features. A list of keywords is manually selected based on the error analysis, which may best reflect some characteristics of fake news titles and bodies. To make this selection process automatically, three algorithms are created based on Mutual Information (MI) theory: keywords generator based on MI stance class, MI customised class, and Pointwise MI algorithm. The second approach is based on word embedding, where word2vec model is introduced and two document similarities calculation algorithms are implemented: wor2vec cosine similarity and WMD distance. The third approach is ensemble learning. Different models are configured together with two continuous outputs combining algorithms. The 10-fold cross validation reveals that the ensemble of three neural network models trained from simple bag-of-words features gives the best performance.

The time and resource intensive computations require tradeoffs between accuracy and speed . In addition, state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS) analytics are not cognizant of the image diagnostic quality . To address these challenges, we propose a novel CS framework that uses generative adversarial networks (GAN) to model the (low-dimensional) manifold of high-quality MR images. Leveraging a mixture of least-squares (LS) GANs and pixel-wise $\\ell _{1}/\\ell _{2}$ cost, a deep residual network with skip connections is trained as the generator that learns to remove the aliasing artifacts by projecting onto the image manifold. The LSGAN learns the texture details, while the $\\ell _{1}/\\ell _{2}$ cost suppresses high-frequency noise. A discriminator network, which is a multilayer convolutional neural network (CNN), plays the role of a perceptual cost that is then jointly trained based on high-quality MR images to score the quality of retrieved images. In the operational phase, an initial aliased estimate (e.g., simply obtained by zero-filling) is propagated into the trained generator to output the desired reconstruction. This demands a very low computational overhead. Extensive evaluations are performed on a large contrast-enhanced MR dataset of pediatric patients. Images rated by expert radiologists corroborate that GANCS retrieves higher quality images with improved fine texture details compared with conventional Wavelet-based and dictionary-learning-based CS schemes as well as with deep-learning-based schemes using pixel-wise training.

Conventional approaches to Information Extraction try to find syntactic patterns based on deep processing of text, such as partial or full parsing. The problem these solutions have to face is that as deeper analysis is used, the accuracy of the result decreases, and one cannot recover from the induced errors. On the other hand, lower level processing is more accurate and it can also provide useful information. However, within the framework of conventional approaches, this kind of information can not be efficiently incorporated. ::: This thesis describes a novel supervised approach based on kernel methods to address these issues. In this approach customized kernels are used to match syntactic structures produced from different preprocessing phases. Using properties of a kernel, individual kernels are combined into a composite kernel to integrate and extend all the information. The composite kernels can be used with various classifiers, such as Nearest Neighbor or Support Vector Machines (SVM). The main classifier we propose to use is SVM due to its ability to generalize in large dimensional feature spaces. We will show that each level of syntactic information can contribute to IE tasks, and low level information can help to recover from errors in deep processing. ::: The new approach has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark tasks. The first task is detecting slot fillers for management succession events (MUC-6). For this task two types of kernels were designed, a surface kernel based on word n-grams and a kernel built on sentence dependency trees; the second task is the ACE RDR evaluation, which is to recognize relations between entities in text from newswire and broadcast news transcript. For this task, five kernels were built to represent information from sentence tokenization, syntactic parsing and dependency parsing.

More specifically, a dense channel attention model is embedded into the encoder. Moreover, its output is projected forward to the corresponding multiscale spatial attention model in the decoder. Both attention models form an attention-to-attention mechanism to implement attention projection, thus capturing global feature dependencies of the whole network. Besides, we analyze the dehazing mechanism based on the atmospheric scattering model, and then utilize an improved RaLSGAN to recover more realistic texture information and enhance visual contrast for different hazy scenes. Finally, in order to improve the visual performance of image restoration, we remove all the instance normalization layers to avoid unnecessary artifacts, and then introduce spectral normalization for all the convolution layers to stabilize the entire training process.

Due to increasing elderly population every year to the total population and the health problems and risks caused by fall especially among the age group of 60 and above, detecting fall at the earliest is essential in order to avoid human loss. Basically, fall detection is considered as a classification problem which requires developing a classifier model that recognizes and classifies normal human activities and abnormal activity like fall. Most of the existing fall detection methods are based on classifiers constructed using traditional methods such as decision trees, Bayesian Networks, Support Vector Machine etc. These classifiers may miss to cover certain hidden and interesting patterns in the data and thus suffer high false positives rates. This paper presents a novel algorithm called Frequent Bit Pattern based Associative Classification (FBPAC) that maps the tri-axial accelerometer data streams to bit patterns and mines the frequent bit pattern occurring for normal activities like sitting/standing, lying and walking within a time-sensitive sliding window. Unlike normal activities, fall have significant peak acceleration and it is detected by setting most significant bit of bit pattern and thus clearly distinguishes fall from lying activity, thereby reducing false positive rates. Empirical studies are conducted by collecting real time tri-axial accelerometer data from a wearable and unobtrusive sensing device.

The category of each text cluster is labeled by the label of texts in it. When a new unlabeled text is incoming, we measure its similarity with the text clusters and give its label with that of the nearest text clusters.

Human motion analysis is considered as a key technology for living states recognition in an assisted living system. Recent research has proved that rich information can be obtained from human movements, such as the motion category, moving patterns, and human identity. In this paper, a nonintrusive human movement sensing system is established with a mono-static ultrawide bandwidth radar. Then, we propose a well-designed joint motion classification (MCL) and person identification (PID) convolutional neural network (named as \u201cJMI-CNN\u201d). To recognize human motions and identities simultaneously, the network employs a multitask learning scheme as well as the attention mechanism and the hierarchical feature reuse strategies. We report the experimental result on the data from 15 individuals, each performing six motions.

The traditional ship design process only involves independent design optimization with some regression formulas within each discipline. With such an approach, there is no guarantee to achieve the optimum design. At the same time, it is also crucial for modem ship design to improve the efficiency of ship optimization. Nowadays, Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has brought into ship design optimization. However, there are still some problems such as modeling, calculation precision and time consumption even when CFD software is inlaid into the optimization procedure. Modeling is a far-ranging and all-around subject, and its precision directly affects the scientific decision in future. How to use an algorithm to establish a statistical approximation model instead of the CFD calculation will be the key problem. The Support Vector Machines (SVM), a new general machine learning method based on the frame of statistical learning theory, may solve the problems of non-linear classification and regression in sample space and be an effective method of processing the non-liner classification and regression. Recently, Support Vector Regression (SVR) has been introduced to solve regression and modeling problems and been used in wide fields. The classical SVR has two parameters to control the errors. A new algorithm of Support Vector Regression proposed in this article has only one parameter to control the errors, adds b2/2 to the item of confidence interval at the same time, and adopts the Laplace loss function.

The brain computer interface that uses multi channel and multi type EEG signal is gradually fusing on other ways that can better reflect the brain activity. Based on the EEG computer interface technology, we can use adaptive linear discriminant analysis (aLDA) algorithm and human-computer interaction method, also regulate adaptive updating coefficient (UC) to reflect the brain thinking activity better. In this paper, we use adaptive common spatial pattern (aCSP) algorithm to extract feature and better classification algorithm to process the EEG, which can improve the efficiency, accuracy and stability of signal classification. Introduction Feature recognition rate on EEG is a core part of brain information classification, because pattern recognition of EEG result shall directly influence the control effect of multi-modal interface [1]. In the part of feature extraction and pattern recognition, using the heavy disability's EEG as the control signal has encountered a problem of parameter dimension, which is insufficient and unable to control accurately. So on the basis of heavy disability's EEG feature, finding the way of better feature parameter extraction to control more appropriately, quickly and accurately is indeed needful [2]. Most of the previous studies on the EEG are for normal people, using the time and frequency domain, parameter model and other methods to acquire feature signal extraction [3]. In addition, when in the different situation, we can regulate UC to get better recognition rate. We use linear discriminant analysis algorithm and adaptive linear discriminant analysis algorithm to process the signal, compare the result and regulate UC to get better result. As we all know EEG has the real-time, large information capacity and flexibility advantages, but it is very susceptible to be influenced by the external environment and also the signal filtering denoising links are very complex [4]. Therefore, choosing the appropriate classification algorithm is very important. To deal with this, use the adaptive way to process the EEG and we find that UC also has a great impact on the classification in the experiment. Denoising Processing and Feature Extraction Use the fourth BCI competition data BCICIV_calib_ds1b, BCICIV _calib_ds1c, BCICIV _calib_ds1e and BCICIV _calib_ds1g to preprocess, but the competition only provides the signal that be processed through the digital analog conversion [5]. As for this, we choose the channel T7 to do filter processing. The reason of using channel T7 was introduced in [6]. Due to the EEG contains too many noises, such as the 50/60Hz power interference artifact, the eye blink artifact, the eye International Conference on Information Sciences, Machinery, Materials and Energy (ICISMME 2015) \u00a9 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 413 movement artifact etc [6]. It finds that the motor imagery signal frequency mainly contains between 3 ~ 45Hz Fig. 1: EEG signal processing flow in the experiment, so in order to prevent non-working band signal interference frequency, we need to use the spatial filtering to reduce space fuzzy influence and aCSP algorithm to extract feature, which is widely used in the BCI system based on the motor imagery. For processing two classification of motor imagery problem and this algorithm has a good effect [7]. From a view of mathematical point, the process of aCSP algorithm is the process of solving an optimization problem [8]. Signal Classification Algorithm Time-varying EEG Signal Characteristics. Brain activity status will be influenced by external environment, such as sound, light and physical condition. The impact of factor such as emotion, attention and constant change make the EEG activity have obvious time-varying characteristic [9]. We can see from the Fig.2 to see the time-varying characteristics. Linear Discriminant Analysis. LDA algorithm using training sample for learning to get corresponding linear classification [8]. For example, suppose there is two sample set of 1 Y , 2 Y . The number of 1 Y and 2 Y is n . For each sample data has a * C N Real matrix, C is said the signal channel, N is said the sampling point. The classification training algorithm step [11] is in the following: ( ) 1 1 2 = A m m \u03c9 \u2212 \u2212 (1) ( ) 1 2 1 b = 2 T m m \u03c9 \u2217 \u2217 + (2) ( ) D T y b y \u03c9 = + \u2217 (3) In this, 1 2 A A A = + , i A is the i class sample covariance matrix. i m represents the i mean sample. i = 1, 2. w, b are the classification parameters. For a sample to be classed the feature vector is y . when 2 D(y) > 0, y Y \u2208 . when 1 D(y) < 0, y Y \u2208 . Adaptive Linear Discriminant Analysis. Adaptive LDA algorithm uses the new input data to estimate the classification parameter to adapt to the current characteristic of data and improve the rate of correcting classification [10]. Classification of device parameter depends on the covariance A and meaning vector 1 2 , m m , so this algorithm is essentially based on the meaning vector and the covariance.

It is very important to keep track and diagnose the source location(s) and notify the plant manager and emergency responders promptly to alleviate secondary and tertiary damages, improving the effectiveness of emergency responses. In this study, we propose an emergency response system that can cope with leak accidents of a chemical plant by monitoring sensor data and track down the suspected leak source using machine learning: Deep-learning and Random Forest classifiers. It is also difficult to get enough chemical leak accident scenario data or perform actual leak experiments on real plants due to high risk and cost factors. Consequently, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to derive fence monitoring data for chemical leak accident scenarios. These data are to train the machine learning models to predict leak source locations. Six time-series Deep Neural Network (DNN) structures and three Random Forest (RF) structures are trained using CFD dispersion simulation results for 640 leak accident scenarios of a real chemical plant, divided as training and test datasets. As a result, on DNN model using 25 hidden layers and on RF model using 100 decision trees, 75.43% and 86.33% prediction accuracy are achieved, respectively, classifying the most probable leak source out of 40 potential leak source locations. Analyzing the predicted leak source locations that are wrongly classified, those predicted leak sources are also quite adjacent to the actual leak location and hardly called as misclassifications. Considering the superb performance of DNN and RF classifiers for chemical leak tracking, the proposed method would be very useful for chemical emergency management and is highly recommended for real-time diagnosis of the chemical leak sources.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jlp.2018.01.011", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Loss Prevention in The Process Industries", "mag_id": "2793861084", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["209523426", "211688237", "208207040"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116313029"}

However, existing proposals may inspect the packet payload, what creates risks to IoT users\u2019 privacy, and may use several features, increasing the computational complexity for traffic classification. In addition, existing techniques may also use complex mechanisms for extracting traffic characteristics, including the creation of vectors containing data from the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sessions. This paper proposes a solution that uses packet length statistics from encrypted traffic to characterize the behavior of IoT devices and events in a smart home scenario. The solution uses only the statistical mean, the standard deviation and the number of bytes transmitted over a one-second window, which can be extracted from the encrypted traffic, making the use of TCP vectors unnecessary. The solution identifies IoT devices and events, such as voice commands to smart assistants, and also distinguishes between IoT and non-IoT devices. The solution to characterize IoT devices and events is evaluated with traffic from two real-world testbeds and five classifiers. The evaluation included the algorithms k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Majority Voting, some of the most popular algorithms for traffic classification. The results show that the Random Forest algorithm can achieve up to 96% of accuracy in the identification of devices, 99% of precision in distinguishing between IoT and non-IoT devices and 99% of accuracy in the identification of IoT device events. Hypothesis testing is used to validate the obtained results.

Each model also exhibits a separation of timescales, making them amenable to the method of multiple timescales, which is the primary dimension-reduction tool of this dissertation. In the first case, the method of multiple timescales reduces the dynamics of two coupled n-dimensional neurons into one scalar differential equation representing the slow timescale phase-locking properties of the oscillators as a function of an exogenous slowly varying parameter.

Indeed, ML algorithms can jointly examine all brain features to capture complex relationships in the data in order to make inferences at a single-subject level. To deal with such high dimensional input and the associated risk of overfitting on the training data, a proper regularization (or feature selection) is required. Standard l 2 -regularized predictors, such as Support Vector Machine, provide dense patterns of predictors. However, in the context of predictive disease signature discovery, it is now essential to understand the brain pattern that underpins the prediction. Despite l 1 -regularized (sparse) has often been advocated as leading to more interpretable models, they generally lead to scattered and unstable patterns. We hypothesize that the integration of prior knowledge regarding the structure of the input images should improve the relevance and the stability of the predictive signature. Such structured sparsity can be obtained by combining together l 1 (possibly l 2 ) and Total variation (TV) penalties. We demonstrated the relevance of using ML with structured sparsity on a large multisite dataset of schizophrenia patients and controls.

This strategy includes a coordinator (top layer), local optimizers (middle layer), and local controllers (bottom layer). The coordinator determines and coordinates set-points of production indices for each process in the plant, aiming to achieve plant-wide optimal control. The local optimizers optimize individual unit and deliver the information to the coordinator. The controllers calculate optimal control inputs for the processes according to the set-points. Model predictive control (MPC) is used in this layer. Also used are FNNs with a gradient-based learning algorithm, which are trained to represent the models of the processes that are controlled by MPC. By constructing a Lyapunov function, convergence of the FNNs is established. Experiments are carried out in the largest zinc hydrometallurgy plant in China. The results demonstrate performance of our strategy in tracking the set-points and saving processing costs.

Previous studies have characterized site-specific microbiota and shown that sample origin can be accurately predicted by microbial content. However, these studies were usually restricted to single datasets with consistent experimental methods and conditions, as well as comparatively small sample numbers. The effects of study-specific biases and statistical power on classification performance and biomarker identification thus remain poorly understood. Furthermore, reliable detection in mixtures of different body sites or with noise from environmental contamination has rarely been investigated thus far. Finally, the impact of ecological associations between microbes on biomarker discovery was usually not considered in previous work. Here we present the analysis of one of the largest cross-study sequencing datasets of microbial communities from human body sites (15,082 samples from 57 publicly available studies). We show that training a Random Forest Classifier on this aggregated dataset increases prediction performance for body sites by 35% compared to a single-study classifier. Using simulated datasets, we further demonstrate that the source of different microbial contributions in mixtures of different body sites or with soil can be detected starting at 1% of the total microbial community. We apply a biomarker selection method that excludes indirect environmental associations driven by microbe-microbe associations, yielding a parsimonious set of highly predictive taxa including novel biomarkers and excluding many previously reported taxa. We find a considerable fraction of unclassified biomarkers (\u201cmicrobial dark matter\u201d) and observe that negatively associated taxa have a surprisingly high impact on classification performance. We further detect a significant enrichment of rod-shaped, motile, and sporulating taxa for feces biomarkers, consistent with a highly competitive environment. Our machine learning model shows strong body site classification performance, both in single-source samples and mixtures, making it promising for tasks requiring high accuracy, such as forensic applications.

Unlike the required training conditions often assumed there, far less labeled data is available for training emotion classification systems. In addition, current feature learning is typically performed on an entire face image without considering the dependency between features. These approaches ignore the fact that faces are structured and the neighboring features are dependent. Thus, the learned features lack the power to describe visually coherent facial images. Our method is therefore designed with the goal of simplifying the problem domain by removing expression-irrelevant factors from the input images, with a key region-based mechanism, which is an effort to reduce the amount of data required to effectively train the feature-learning methods. Meanwhile, we can construct geometric constraints between the key regions and its detected positions. To this end, we introduce a Spatially Coherent featurelearning method for Pose-invariant Facial Expression Recognition (SC-PFER). In our model, we first perform face frontalization through a 3D pose-normalization technique, which could normalize poses while preserving the identity information through synthesizing frontal faces for facial images with arbitrary views. Subsequently, we select a sequence of key regions around 51 key points in the synthetic frontal face images for efficient unsupervised feature learning. Finally, we introduce a linkage structure over the learning-based features and the corresponding geometry information of each key region to encode the dependencies of the regions. Our method, on the whole, does not require training multiple models for each specific pose and avoids separating training and parameter tuning for each pose.

In contrast to classification, where only a limited number of distinct classes is given, the regression task is defined as predicting continuous labels for a given dataset. Semi-supervised learning is of vital importance for the applications where a small number of labeled samples is available, or labeling samples is difficult or expensive to collect. A case in point is autonomous driving in which obtaining sufficient labeled samples covering all driving conditions is costly. In this context, we can take advantage of semi-supervised learning techniques with groundbreaking generative models, such as generative adversarial networks. However, almost all proposed GAN-based semi-supervised techniques in the literature are focused on solving the classification problem. Hence, developing a GAN-based semi-supervised method for the regression task is still an open problem. In this work, two different architectures will be proposed to address this problem. In summary, our introduced method is able to predict continuous labels for a training dataset which has only a limited number of labeled samples. Moreover, the application of this technique for solving the end-to-end task in autonomous driving will be presented. We performed several experiments over a publicly available driving dataset to evaluate our proposed method, and the results are very promising.

This disease is characterized by motor and non-motor manifestations that are progressive and ultimately refractory to therapeutic interventions. The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons emanating from the substantia nigra is largely responsible for the motor manifestations. Thus, understanding the behaviour related to this disease is an added value for the diagnosis and treatment of PD. Also, in vivo models are essential tools for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underpinning the neurodegenerative process. Zebrafish has several features that make this species a good candidate to study PD. In particular, the occurrence of behavioural phenotypes of treated animals with neurotoxin drugs that mimic the disease has been investigated. And, an electric biosensor, Marine On-line Biomonitor System (MOBS) is being used for the real-time quantification of such behaviour. This equipment allows quantifying the fish movements through signal processing algorithms. Specifically, the algorithm is used for the evaluation of fish locomotion detected by a series of bursts in the domain of MOBS that correspond to the zebrafish tail-flip activity. In this thesis we proceeded to the development of an algorithm affording a electrical signal discrimination between \"healthy\" and \"ill\" zebrafish and consequently improving the detection of parkinsonism-like phenotypes in zebrafish. The first approach was the improvement of the existent algorithm. However, the first analysis failed to distinguish between different behavioural phenotypes when fish were treated with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Consequently, we generated a new algorithm based on Machine Learning techniques. As a result, the novel algorithm provided a classification over the health condition of the fish, if the same is \"healthy\" or \"ill\" with its respective probability and the level of activity of the fish in number of tail-flips per minute. The method Support Vector Machine (SVM) was useful for the classification of the fish events.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2254626484", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59426038"}

The network intrusion may bring disaster to the network users. It is therefore critical to monitor the network intrusion to prevent the computers from attacking. The intrusion pattern identification is the key point in the intrusion detection. The use of the support vector machine (SVM) can provide intelligent intrusion detection even using a small amount of training sample data. However, the intrusion detection efficiency is still influenced by the input features of the ANN. This is because the original feature space always contains a certain number of redundant data. To solve this problem, a new network intrusion detection method based on nonlinear dimensionality reduction and least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) is proposed in this work. The Isometric Mapping (Isomap) was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the original intrusion feature vector. Then the LS-SVM detection model with proper input features was applied to the intrusion pattern recognition. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated with the real intrusion data. The analysis results show that the proposed approach has good intrusion detection rate, and is superior to the traditional LSSVM method with a 5.8 % increase of the detection precision.

The suggested pre-processing method is called the Mean Shift Clustering-Based Attribute Weighting (MSCBAW) and is based primarily on mean shift clustering algorithm finding the number of the sets automatically. In this study, we have used two different datasets including lumbar disc diseases (with two classes-our database) and vertebral column disorders datasets (with two or three classes) taken from UCI (University of California at Irvine) machine learning database to test the proposed approach. The MSCBAW method is working as follows: first of all, the centres of the sets automatically for each characteristics in dataset by using the mean shift clustering algorithm are computed. And then, the mean values of each property in dataset are calculated. The weighted datasets by multiplying these mean values by each property value in the dataset that have been obtained by dividing the above mentioned mean values by the centres of the sets belonging to the relevant property are achieved. After the data weighting stage, three different classification algorithms that included the k -NN ( k -Nearest Neighbour), RBF\u2013NN (Radial Basis Function\u2013Neural Network) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifying algorithms have been used to classify the datasets.

The aim of this research was to develop a predictive model to identify the occurrence of cyberbullying tweets on Twitter. The paradigm shift in the Internet of Things was observed a decade ago, which resulted in enormous growth in the number of active Internet users. Today, this number has exceeded three billion. Social networking websites are classic examples of Internet applications that have large numbers of active users. Twitter, for instance, is one of the most famous social networking portals, with more than 300 million active users at any given time. However, unfortunately it is also a stage for users who are involved in unethical use of the Internet, such as cyberbullying. With such a staggering number of active users on the Internet, cyberbullying has become a widespread global phenomenon. It has extremely adverse effects on its victims. In some cases victims have committed suicide in response to the shame and hatred that is associated with cyberbullying. In this research, 1313 unique tweets were collected from Twitter. With the help of psychological studies referring to, the behavior of individuals and the use of dialects pertaining to verbal aggressiveness, 376 tweets were manually tagged as cyberbullying tweets in the first phase. In the next phase, every word in a tweet was individually categorised based on the pragmatics of language. In order to achieve this, tweets were categorised using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a psychometric evaluation tool that categorises text based on Linguistic Processes, Psychological Processes, Personal Concerns and Spoken Categories. Collectively, they add up to 67 sub-wordcategories. In the next step of the psychometric evaluation, LIWC calculated the degree to which different word-categories were used by people in cyberbullying. Psychometric evaluation therefore aided in effective text categorisation and quantifying the degree of word usage, which was observed to be a gap in previous studies. As a result, tweets were converted to a multi-dimensional attribute relational numeric dataset. This dataset was very rich in terms of the information that it carried. This dataset was then used to train machine learning classifiers in Weka to develop a predictive model to detect cyberbullying. The data was randomly segmented 66% for training the predictive model and 34% for testing it. It was seen that the Random Forest classifier built the predictive model with a precision value of 0.97, indicating that binary classifiers outperformed the multiclass classifiers in detecting cyberbullying tweets. 1 http://nobullying.com/amanda-todd-story/", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2177931787", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52984176", "16569068", "206823112", "211196972", "52985964"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59060475"}

To solve the abovementioned characteristics of a MEL time series, the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVR) hybridizing with meta-heuristic algorithms is applied to simulate the nonlinear system of a MEL time series. As it is known that the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) has several embedded drawbacks that lead to problems, this paper applies a quantum computing mechanism (QCM) to empower each fruit fly to possess quantum behavior during the searching processes, i.e., a QFOA algorithm. Eventually, the cat chaotic mapping function is introduced into the QFOA algorithm, namely CQFOA, to implement the chaotic global perturbation strategy to help fruit flies to escape from the local optima while the population\u2019s diversity is poor. Finally, a new MEL forecasting method, namely the LS-SVR-CQFOA model, is established by hybridizing the LS-SVR model with CQFOA. The experimental results illustrate that, in three datasets, the proposed LS-SVR-CQFOA model is superior to other alternative models, including BPNN (back-propagation neural networks), LS-SVR-CQPSO (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm), LS-SVR-CQTS (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum tabu search algorithm), LS-SVR-CQGA (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum genetic algorithm), LS-SVR-CQBA (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum bat algorithm), LS-SVR-FOA, and LS-SVR-QFOA models, in terms of forecasting accuracy indexes.

To accelerate the GRF learning and promote its discrimination power, we propose a Group-Group Loss (GGL) to optimize the distance within and across vehicle image groups.

By avoiding traversing numerous sample combinations, GGL makes the model training easier and more efficient.

This paradigm typically has the assumptions that the underl ying distribution and the true input\u2013output dependency do not change. However, these assumptions often fail to hold, especially in data streams. This phenomenon is known as concept drift. We propose a new model combining algorithm for tracking concept drift in data streams. The final predictive ensemble model has a form of a weighted average and ridge regression combiner. The coefficients of the combiner are determined by ridge regression with the constraints such that the coefficients are nonnegative and sum to 1.

In present study, the effects of temperature and nanoparticle on selectivity performance and permeability of gases has been investigated. It is shown that the presence of silica nanoparticles not only disrupts the original polymer chain packing but also alters the chemical affinities of penetrants in polyethersulfone matrices. Because, in the presence of hydrophilic silica, CO2 affinity filler, hydrogen-bond interactions between the oxygen atoms of carbon dioxide and the hydrogen atoms of hydroxyl group on the nanosilica surface would take place at the interface and thus solubility and consequently permeability towards CO2 are higher in comparison with CH4 for the membranes. Furthermore, in present study, a novel mathematical approach has been proposed to develop a model for permeation flux and selectivity performance of the membrane using Support Vector Machine. SVM is employed to develop model to estimate process output variables of a nanocomposite membrane including permeation flux and selectivity performance. Model development that consists of training, optimization and test was performed using randomly selected 80%, 10%, and 10% of available data respectively. Test results from the SVM based model showed to be in better agreement with operating experimental data compared to other developed mathematical model.

They have demonstrated that machines can display a significant level of learning ability, though the boundaries of this ability are far from being clearly defined. The availability of reliable learning systems is of strategic importance, as there are many tasks that cannot be solved by classical programming techniques, since no mathematical model of the problem is available. So for example it is not known how to write a computer program to perform hand-written character recognition, though there are plenty of examples available. It is therefore natural to ask if a computer could be trained to recognise the letter \u2018A\u2019 from examples \u2013 after all this is the way humans learn to read. We will refer to this approach to problem solving as the learning methodology The same reasoning applies to the problem of finding genes in a DNA sequence, filtering email, detecting or recognising objects in machine vision, and so on. Solving each of these problems has the potential to revolutionise some aspect of our life, and for each of them machine learning algorithms could provide the key to its solution. In this chapter we will introduce the important components of the learning methodology, give an overview of the different kinds of learning and discuss why this approach has such a strategic importance. After the framework of the learning methodology has been introduced, the chapter ends with a roadmap for the rest of the book, anticipating the key themes, and indicating why Support Vector Machines meet many of the challenges confronting machine learning systems. As this roadmap will descibe the role of the different chapters, we urge our readers to refer to it before delving further into the book.", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1017/CBO9780511801389.003", "venue": "An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods", "journal": "An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods", "mag_id": "2503302184", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63491437"}

Recently, compressive sensing-based strategies for multi-spectral imaging via wavelength filtering at the pixel level on the imaging detector have been proposed for simultaneous acquisition of multi-spectral imaging data greatly reducing the acquisition times. To utilize such compressive sensing strategies for multi-spectral imaging, strong reconstruction algorithms that can reconstruct dense multi-spectral image cubes from the sparse compressively sensed observations are required. This paper proposes a comprehensive inter-spectral multi-layered conditional random field (IS-MCRF) sparse reconstruction framework for multi-spectral compressively sensed data captured using such acquisition strategies. The IS-MCRF framework leverages the information between neighboring spectral bands to better utilize the available information for reconstruction. The proposed framework was evaluated using compressively sensed multi-spectral acquisitions ranging from visible to near infrared spectral bands obtained by a simulated compressive sensing-based multi-spectral imaging system.

An additional layer of security can be obtained by verifying the identity of users who wish to access confidential resources only within restricted, small, indoor trusted zones. The objective of this paper is to construct highly secure indoor areas primarily by detecting only legitimate users within their work cubicles. In this paper, we present a fine-grained location-based authentication system (LocAuth) which ensures the physical presence of the user within his/her small trusted zone (2 meters area). To do this, LocAuth exploits the ambient wireless network characteristics (e.g., BSSID, SSID, and RSSI) of nearby Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices observed from each trusted zone. We propose a novel technique called Top-Ranked Network Nodes (TRNNs) to accurately overcome the fluctuations in wireless signals and enhance the ability to distinguish targeted trusted zone from neighboring areas. In addition, we developed an application to implement LocAuth on Android-based smartphones and tested it in a real indoor environment. The tested area is composed of seven adjacent and closely spaced work cubicles located in our lab. We evaluated LocAuth in two ways: through RSSI-based nearest neighbors (RSSI-based NN) and through supervised machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machines). The results of the experiment show the effectiveness of LocAuth by achieving a high classification accuracy (above 98%).

As a result, an automatic/semi-automatic method for mapping urban functional zones is highly required. Hierarchical semantic cognition (HSC) is presented in this study, and serves as a general cognition structure for recognizing urban functional zones. Unlike traditional classification methods, the HSC relies on geographic cognition and considers four semantic layers, i.e., visual features, object categories, spatial object patterns, and zone functions, as well as their hierarchical relations. Here, we used HSC to classify functional zones in Beijing with a very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite image and point-of-interest (POI) data. Experimental results indicate that this method can produce more accurate results than Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with a larger overall accuracy of 90.8%. Additionally, the contributions of diverse semantic layers are quantified: the object-category layer is the most important and makes 54% contribution to functional-zone classification; while, other semantic layers are less important but their contributions cannot be ignored. Consequently, the presented HSC is effective in classifying urban functional zones, and can further support urban planning and management.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2017.09.007", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2754939259", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207955732", "208827136", "201349394", "215729103", "195735157", "158448994", "202918347", "197581068", "4020929", "84180283", "208035009", "207959252", "174821044", "77393275", "208633111", "102489078", "52111661"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125593173"}

We investigated the accuracy of both separate-domain and combined-domain models and probed model portability. We established relevant baselines by training Decision Trees (DT) and Random Forests (RF), and using MetaMap Lite, a clinical natural language processing tool. Results We show that the LSTM-RNNs accurately classify veterinary and human text narratives into top-level categories with an average weighted macro F1 score of 0.74 and 0.68 respectively. In the \u201cneoplasia\u201d category, the model built with veterinary data has a high accuracy in veterinary data, and moderate accuracy in human data, with F1 scores of 0.91 and 0.70 respectively.

A border between cancerous and non-cancerous areas on endoscopic images was established from post-treatment pathological findings, and 2000 pixels with equivalent luminance values were randomly extracted from each image of cancerous and non-cancerous areas. Each pixel was represented as a three-dimensional vector with RGB values and defined as a sample. We evaluated the Mahalanobis distance using RGB values, indicative of color differences between cancerous and non-cancerous areas. We then conducted diagnosis test using a support vector machine (SVM) for each image. SVM was trained using the 100 training samples per class and determined which area each of 1900 test samples per class came from. The means of the Mahalanobis distances for WL, Indigo, and AIM were 1.52, 1.32, and 2.53, respectively and there were no significant differences in the three modalities. Diagnosability per endoscopy technique was assessed using the F1 measure. The means of F1 measures for WL, Indigo, and AIM were 0.636, 0.618, and 0.687, respectively. AIM images were better than WL and Indigo images for the diagnosis of GC. Objective assessment by SVM found AIM to be suitable for diagnosis of early GC based on color differences.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6675770", "pubmed_id": "29504086", "doi": "10.1007/s12029-018-0083-6", "venue": "Journal of Gastrointestinal Cancer", "journal": "Journal of Gastrointestinal Cancer", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2792906738", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["41283957", "45661862", "46049446", "31042468", "3284263", "8878068", "45363463", "43067302", "3081074", "6764829", "25888240", "27003308", "24343536", "35253659", "215165399", "117765088", "961425", "3770261", "1300804", "4404386", "206433218"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3684934"}

The Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ) is a vessel-free area located at the center of the fovea whose shape characteristics are used to diagnose eye-related diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. Segmentation of the FAZ in FA therefore plays an important role in clinical decision making. However, manual delineation is costly and time-consuming. Current methods for automated FAZ segmentation either rely on segmenting the vasculature first, require manual initialization or are tailored to specific image properties. Hence, they often fail when dealing with images from clinical routine, which were usually acquired using multiple devices and at different imaging settings. In this paper we propose to overcome these limitations by means of a multitask learning approach. Our method exploits an additional Euclidean distance map prediction task to better deal with variable imaging conditions, by benefiting from its regularization effect. Our method is empirically evaluated using a data set of FA scans from large multicenter clinical trials with diverse qualities and image resolutions.

To solve this problem, in this work a combined pixel-wise characterization framework is applied to hyperspectral image samples.

The proposed work comprises of three major steps: Spectral gradient enhancement, spectral\u2013spatial classification obtained from the Support vector machine-Fuzzy Sigmoid Kernel (SVM-FSK) and probability estimation based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM). To improve the gradient level of spatial information, this work uses Improved Empirical Mode Decomposition (IEMD) with PSO (IEMD-PSO) to increase the mixed pixel wise SVM -FSK classification accuracy. Apply EMD method to enhance the gradient level of spatial data to separately identifiable of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of every one of spectral band, weight values of IMFs are calculated by using Particle swarm optimization (PSO).The obtained spectral and spatial information learns the probability value from HMM and mixed pixel-wise SVM-FSK characterization methods to find number of mixed components in each pixel.

To quantify changes in tree communities and density in the Missouri Plains, a grassland-forest landscape, we used historical surveys from 1815 to 1864 and current surveys from 2004 to 2008. To estimate density for historical communities, we used the Morisita plotless density estimator and applied corrections for surveyor bias. To estimate density for current forests, we used Random Forests, an ensemble regression tree method, to predict densities from known values at plots using terrain and soil predictors. Oak species decreased from 62% of historical composition to 30% of current composition and black and white oaks historically were dominant species across 93% of the landscape and currently were dominant species across 42% of the landscape. Current forest density was approximately two times greater than historical densities, demonstrating loss of savanna and woodlands and transition to dense forest structure. Average tree diameters were smaller than in the past, but mean basal area and stocking remained similar over time because of the increase in density in current forests. Nevertheless, there were spatial differences; basal area and stocking decreased along rivers and increased away from rivers. Oak species are being replaced by other species in the Missouri Plains, similar to replacement throughout the range of Quercus. Long-term commitment to combinations of prescribed burning and silvicultural prescriptions in more xeric sites may be necessary for oak recruitment. Restoration of open oak ecosystems is a time-sensitive issue because restoration will become increasingly costly as oaks are lost from the overstory and the surrounding matrix becomes dominated by non-oak species.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24496032", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.01.048", "venue": "The Science of the total environment", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1969325469", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["86472904", "107617679", "85380020", "10527281", "127554590", "88435333", "20690665", "85349275", "128243398", "4954178", "41294166", "89141", "86350192", "28797592", "6631111", "84084893", "3626971", "29991556", "85060844", "85228353", "86561626", "84306067", "208580417", "84633244", "83863110", "17260694", "52086176", "2980499", "18646557", "86609509", "163866919", "85132604", "202020900", "89262814", "83892715", "84058087", "18278352", "84888155", "36556426", "85668674", "38714201", "84934798", "86376130", "84885975", "86180707", "82605771", "84913332", "15869783", "163025118", "53073682", "40021593", "1842177", "56457442", "85436168", "85030893", "86712299", "87791279", "127765890", "8359835"], "inbound_citations": ["90620957", "145838873", "4435032", "131434826", "2134579", "61932254", "56717361", "204145894", "76653102", "45817341", "10572517", "191130151"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26012577"}

A time series of high resolution UAS imagery was collected to cover the growing season from leaf flush to leaf fall. Full benefit was taken of the temporal resolution of UAS acquisition, one of the most promising features of small drones. The disparity in forest tree phenology is at the maximum during early spring and late autumn. But the phenology state that optimized the classification result is the one that minimizes the spectral variation within tree species groups and, at the same time, maximizes the phenologic differences between species. Sunlit tree crowns (5 deciduous species groups) were classified using a Random Forest approach for monotemporal, two-date and three-date combinations. The end of leaf flushing was the most efficient single-date time window. Multitemporal datasets definitely improve the overall classification accuracy.

However, the ambiguity and the lack of sufficient abnormal ground truth data makes end-to-end training of large deep networks hard in this domain. In this paper we propose to use Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), which are trained to generate only the normal distribution of the data. During the adversarial GAN training, a discriminator (D) is used as a supervisor for the generator network (G) and vice versa.

To achieve superpixel-wise discriminative ability, we propose a joint appearance model that consists of two random forest-based models, i.e. , the background-target discriminative model (BTM) and the distractor-target discriminative model (DTM). More specifically, the BTM effectively learns discriminative information between the target object and the background. In contrast, the DTM is used to suppress distracting superpixels, which significantly improves the tracker\u2019s robustness and alleviates the drifting problem. A novel online random forest regression algorithm is proposed to build the two models. The BTM and DTM are linearly combined into a joint model to compute a confidence map. Tracking results are estimated using the confidence map, in which the position and scale of the target are estimated orderly. Furthermore, we design a model updating strategy to adapt the appearance changes over time by discarding degraded trees of the BTM and DTM and initializing new trees as replacements. We test the proposed tracking method on two large tracking benchmarks, the CVPR2013 tracking benchmark and VOT2014 tracking challenge.

It is impractical to collect and annotate every non-native speech corpus considering different language pairs. In this work, we address non-native acoustic modeling (both on phonetic and articulatory level) based on transfer learning. In order to effectively train acoustic models of non-native speech without using such data, we propose to exploit two large native speech corpora of learner's native language (L1) and target language (L2) to model cross-lingual phenomena. This kind of transfer learning can provide a better feature representation of non-native speech. Experimental evaluations are carried out for Japanese speakers learning English. We first demonstrate the proposed acoustic-phone model achieves a lower word error rate in non-native speech recognition.

This work analyses the potential of human population density (HPD), nighttime lights and vegetation cover as indicators of urban impact on sandy beach biodiversity. Each indicator was tested against a large-scale 2-yr study of macrofaunal richness and physical characteristics along a strong environmental gradient defined by the widest estuary of the world, the Rio de la Plata. A negative linear relationship between HPD and the number of species was found. The amount of light recorded at night peaked at the most urbanized area in the coast, Montevideo city, and showed a negative relationship with macrofaunal richness. Vegetation cover, expressed through a normalized difference vegetation index, showed a weak positive relationship with species richness. Multiple linear regressions, combining urban indicators and physical characteristics as explanatory variables of macrofaunal richness, showed the best results when HPD and salinity range were combined. A regression tree explained 65% of deviance and had a structure coherent with previous results. Salinity was the dominant ecological driver: beaches with salinity \u226527.2 showed higher species richness, while beaches with less salinity and higher nighttime lights showed the lowest species richness. Random Forests selected salinity (mean and range) and HPD as the most informative variables to discriminate groups of beaches according to their macrobenthic richness. These results reflect that the salinity gradient is a macroscale driver that shapes species richness patterns along this coast, whereas the effects of urbanization are confined within the dominant large-scale environmental gradient.

In this paper, the remitting behavior of immigrants have been addressed by a classification approach that predicts the remittance levels sent by immigrants according to their individual characteristics, thereby identifying the most profitable customers within this group. To do so, five nominal and two ordinal classifiers were applied to an immigrant sample and their resulting performances were compared. The ordinal classifiers achieved the best results; the Support Vector Machine with Ordered Partitions (SVMOP) yielded the best model, providing information needed to draw remitting profiles that are useful for financial institutions. The Support Vector Machine with Explicit Constraints (SVOREX), however, achieved the second best results, and these results are presented graphically to study misclassified patterns in a natural and simple way.

Diseases understanding, therapeutic followups of patients, etc. rely on discriminating the muscles in MRI anatomical images. However, delineating the muscle contours manually is an extremely long and tedious task, and thus often a bottleneck in clinical research. Typical automatic segmentation methods rely on finding discriminative visual properties between objects of interest, accurate contour detection or clinically interesting anatomical points. Skeletal muscles show none of these features in MRI, making automatic segmentation a challenging problem. In spite of recent advances on segmentation methods, their application in clinical settings is difficult, and most of the times, manual segmentation and correction is still the only option. In this thesis, we propose several approaches for segmenting skeletal muscles automatically in MRI, all related to the popular graph-based Random Walker (RW) segmentation algorithm. The strength of the RW method relies on its robustness in the case of weak contours and its fast and global optimization. Originally, the RW algorithm was developed for interactive segmentation: the user had to pre-segment small regions of the image \u2013 called seeds \u2013 before running the algorithm which would then complete the segmentation. Our first contribution is a method for automatically generating and labeling all the appropriate seeds, based on a Markov Random Fields formulation integrating prior knowledge of the relative positions, and prior detection of contours between pairs of seeds. A second contribution amounts to incorporating prior knowledge of the shape directly into the RW framework. Such formulation retains the probabilistic interpretation of the RW algorithm and thus allows to compute the segmentation by solving a large but simple sparse linear system, like in the original method. In a third contribution, we propose to develop a learning framework to estimate the optimal set of parameters for balancing the contrast term of the RW algorithm and the different existing prior models. The main challenge we face is that the training samples are not fully supervised. Specifically, they provide a hard segmentation of the medical images, instead of the optimal probabilistic segmentation, which corresponds to the desired output of the RW algorithm. We overcome this challenge by treating the optimal probabilistic segmentation as a latent variable. This allows us to employ the latent Support Vector Machine (latent SVM) formulation for parameter estimation. All proposed methods are tested and validated on real clinical datasets of MRI volumes of lower limbs.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "4567138", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["209449230"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59734374"}

While promising, clinical translation has been hindered by the impracticalities of using infrared transmissive substrates which are both fragile and prohibitively very expensive. Recently, glass has been proposed as a potential replacement which, although largely opaque in the infrared, allows unrestricted access to the high wavenumber region (2500-3800 cm-1). Recent studies using unstained tissue on glass have shown that despite utilising only the amide A band, good discrimination between histological classes could be achieved, and suggest the potential of discriminating between normal and malignant tissue. However unstained tissue on glass has the potential to disrupt the pathologist workflow, since it needs to be stained following infrared chemical imaging. In light of this, we report on the very first infrared Spectral Histopathology SHP study utilising coverslipped H&E stained tissue on glass using samples as received from the pathologist. In this paper we present a rigorous study using results obtained from an extended patient sample set consisting of 182 prostate tissue cores obtained from 100 different patients, on 18 separate H&E slides. Utilising a Random Forest classification model we demonstrate that we can rapidly classify four classes of histology of an independent test set with a high degree of accuracy (>90%). We investigate different degrees of staining using nine separate prostate serial sections, and demonstrate that we discriminate on biomarkers rather than the presence of the stain.

Unlike Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), RVFLNN exploits connection between the input layer and the output layer which means that RVFLNN are higher class of networks. Although RVFLNN has been proposed more than two decades ago (Pao, Park, Sobajic, 1994), the nonlinear expansion of the input vector into set of orthogonal functions has not been studied. The Orthogonal Polynomial Expanded Random Vector Functional Link Neural Network (OPE-RVFLNN) utilizes advantages from expansion of the input vector and random determination of the input weights. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation by using 30 UCI regression datasets, we tested four orthogonal polynomials (Chebyshev, Hermite, Laguerre and Legendre) and three activation functions (tansig, logsig, tribas). Rigorous non-parametric statistical hypotheses testing confirms two major conclusions made by Zhang and Suganthan for classification (Zhang and Suganthan, 2015) and Ren et al. for timeseries prediction (Ren, Suganthan, Srikanth, Amaratunga, 2016) in their RVFLNN papers: direct links between the input and output vectors are essential for improved network performance, and ridge regression generates significantly better network parameters than Moore-Penrose pseudoinversion. Our research shows a significant improvement of network performance when one uses tansig activation function and Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial for regression problems. Conclusions drawn from this study may be used as guidelines for OPE-RVFLNN development and implementation for regression problems.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2017.10.010", "venue": "Appl.

Depending on the kind of diabetes and sometimes on the stage of the illness, diabetic patients have to inject some amount of artificial insulin, namely bolus, before the meals, to make up the absence or malfunctioning of their natural insulin. This decision is a difficult task since they need to estimate the number of carbohydrates they are going to ingest, take into account the past and future circumstances, know the past values of glucose, evaluate if the effect of previously injected insulin has already finished and any other relevant information. In this paper, we present and compare a set of methodologies to automate the decision of the insulin bolus, which reduces the number of dangerous predictions. We combine two different data enrichment techniques based on Markov chains with grammatical evolution engines to generate models of blood glucose, and univariate marginal distribution algorithms and bagging techniques to select the set of models to assemble. In particular, we propose the Random-GE procedure, an adaptation of Random Forests to Grammatical Evolution, which leads to excellent prediction models, with a simple configuration and a reduced execution time. The ensemble gives the prediction of glucose for a duple of food and insulins, helping patients in the selection of the appropriate bolus to maintain healthy glucose levels after the meals.

This study proposes a methodology to improve the production of biodiesel based on the use of soft computing techniques to predict several features of biodiesel production. The method selected a group of regression models based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) techniques to perform a prediction of several properties of a biodiesel sample taking into account a configuration of 7 test inputs. This test inputs were: molar ratio, dosage of catalyst, temperature, mixing speed, mixing time, humidity and impurities. Then and based on these inputs, the features to predict were: yield, turbidity, density, viscosity and high heating to obtain a better understanding of the process.

The present study investigated the variation of geometric and topographic characteristics of dune bedforms and flow features as measured in laboratory studies (data sets from laboratory experiments) to estimate the roughness coefficient and characteristics of dune height. The Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), which was optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), was used as the Meta model approach to predict the values of interest. Developed models were separated into three categories: modeling using flow characteristics, modeling of flow and bedform characteristics, and modeling by using flow and sediment characteristics. It was found that for estimation of the roughness coefficient in open channels with dune bedforms, models developed based on flow and sediment characteristics performed more successfully. The model with input parameters of flow and grain Reynolds numbers ( Re and R b , respectively) and the ratio of the hydraulic radius ( R ) to the median grain diameter (D 50 ) yields a squared correlation coefficient ( R 2 ) of 0.8609, a coefficient of determination (DC) of 0.7361, and a root mean square error ( RMSE ) of 0.0034 for a test series of Manning's roughness coefficient which was the most accurate model. Results proved the key role of flow Reynolds number ( Re ) values as an input feature for all models predicting the roughness coefficient.

Empirical results show that, when selecting two parameter values, this process can reduce the number of training iterations required by a factor of 10 or more, while suffering no loss of precision in minimizing the radius-margin ratio.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2010.100", "venue": "2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining", "journal": "2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2128030491", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "194951", "1753032", "9988056", "14607075", "6546675", "1689546", "28637672", "14727192", "10930726", "17983784", "16029995", "3144723"], "inbound_citations": ["10930726"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10930726"}

The confusion degrees among different subcategories are extremely different, and we should focus on learning the difference among the confusing subcategories. However, current methods treat all subcategories by equal cost, which causes the learned model good power for classifying subcategories that are not easy to confuse, but limited power for confusing ones. For addressing the above problem, we propose a cost-sensitive deep metric learning (CDML) approach, which integrates confusion driven deep metric learning and weighted softmax for learning the difference among the confusing subcategories. Confusion driven deep metric learning is proposed to focus on learning the difference among subcategories with small variance emphatically via triplet loss. The sampled ratio for triplets between two subcategories is adaptively and automatically set by confusing degrees, where the confusing subcategories are over-sampled for improving the ability to distinguish them. Weighted softmax is proposed to learn more discriminative features for easily mis-classification subcategories, which are assigned with high weights on them according to their mis-classification rates.

Perceptions of pain and its consequent disabling effects are often heightened under the conditions of greater uncertainty and unpredictability associated with pain volatility. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: This study aimed to use data mining and machine learning methods to (1) define a new measure of pain volatility and (2) predict future pain volatility levels from users of the pain management app, Manage My Pain, based on demographic, clinical, and app use features. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Pain volatility was defined as the mean of absolute changes between 2 consecutive self-reported pain severity scores within the observation periods. The k-means clustering algorithm was applied to users' pain volatility scores at the first and sixth month of app use to establish a threshold discriminating low from high volatility classes. Subsequently, we extracted 130 demographic, clinical, and app usage features from the first month of app use to predict these 2 volatility classes at the sixth month of app use. Prediction models were developed using 4 methods: (1) logistic regression with ridge estimators; (2) logistic regression with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator; (3) Random Forests; and (4) Support Vector Machines. Overall prediction accuracy and accuracy for both classes were calculated to compare the performance of the prediction models. Training and testing were conducted using 5-fold cross validation. A class imbalance issue was addressed using a random subsampling of the training dataset. Users with at least five pain records in both the predictor and outcome periods (N=782 users) are included in the analysis. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: k-means clustering algorithm was applied to pain volatility scores to establish a threshold of 1.6 to differentiate between low and high volatility classes. After validating the threshold using random subsamples, 2 classes were created: low volatility (n=611) and high volatility (n=171). In this class-imbalanced dataset, all 4 prediction models achieved 78.1% (611/782) to 79.0% (618/782) in overall accuracy. However, all models have a prediction accuracy of less than 18.7% (32/171) for the high volatility class. After addressing the class imbalance issue using random subsampling, results improved across all models for the high volatility class to greater than 59.6% (102/171). The prediction model based on Random Forests performs the best as it consistently achieves approximately 70% accuracy for both classes across 3 random subsamples. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: We propose a novel method for measuring pain volatility.

The present work introduces, also, a new hypothesis of the optimum HVAC airside system design of the surgical operating theatres to achieve the comfort and hygiene levels. The present work is devoted to propose and formulate a new scale capable of adequately evaluating the airflow pattern in the surgical operating theatres. The proposed new scale is proposed to cover the local and overall air quality evaluations. The present new hypothesis is developed to overcome the difficulties experienced using other IAQ evaluations for typical surgical operating theatres. A new Neuro fuzzy technique was applied to derive measures for indoor air quality indices. Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is more critical in healthcare facilities due to the dangerous microbial and chemical agents present and the increased susceptibility of the patients. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities are complex environments that require ventilation for comfort and to control hazardous emissions. Surgical operating theatre is the most important and complex zone in the hospital, and requires more careful control of the aseptic conditions of the environment. Most of the previous researches aiming at evaluating the IAQ were based on the evaluation of the air distribution depending on the residence and leaving age of the air supplied to the enclosure. Other attempts were also reported to indicate the effectiveness of contaminant removal by the entire airflow pattern as an indication to the IAQ. This paper presents some recommended designs of the supply air outlets to provide the vertically downward airflow as a practical solution. The near ceiling and near floor extract ports are to be used instead of the hypothetical complete floor extract as a practical solution.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2514/6.2008-1178", "venue": "46th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit", "journal": "46th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit", "mag_id": "2334642004", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111836040"}

This paper shows a comparative study of rainfall-runoff modeling between a SVM-based approach and the EPA\u2019s Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The SVM is applied in the variant called Support Vector regression (SVR). Two different experimental basins located in the north of Italy have been considered as case studies. Two criteria have been chosen to assess the consistency between the recorded and predicted flow rates: the root-mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination. The two models showed comparable performance. In particular, both models can properly model the hydrograph shape, the time to peak and the total runoff. The SVR algorithm tends to underestimate the peak discharge, while SWMM tends to overestimate it.

The main methods by means of which IE has been tackled rely on supervised learning;the best-performing such methods belong to the class of probabilistic graphical models, and, in particular, to the class of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). In this thesis we investigate two major aspects related to textual IE via CRFs: (a) the creation of CRFs models that can outperform the commonly adopted linear- chain CRFs, and the creation of methods for ensuring the quality of training data and for assessing the impact of training data quality on the accuracy of CRFs systems for IE. We start by facing the task of IE from medical documents written in the Italian language. We propose two novel approaches: (i) a cascaded, two-stage method composed by two layers of CRFs, and (ii) a confidence-weighted ensemble method that combines standard linear-chain CRFs and the proposed two-stage method. Both the proposed models are shown to outperform a standard linear-chain CRFs system. We then investigate aspect-oriented sentence-level opinion mining from product reviews, that consists in predicting, for all sentences in the review, whether the sentence expresses a positive, neutral, or negative opinion (or no opinion at all) about a specific aspect of the product. We propose a set of increasingly powerful models based on CRFs, including a hierarchical multi-label CRFs scheme that jointly models the overall opinion expressed in a product review and the set of aspect-specific opinions expressed in each of its sentences. The proposed CRFs models are shown to obtain better results than linear-chain CRFs. We then study the impact that the quality of training data has on the accuracy of an IE system via experiments performed on a dataset in which inter-coder agreement data are available. Finally, we investigate active learning techniques for a type of semi-supervised CRFs specifically devised for partially labeled sequences.

This thesis addresses the problem of video content understanding in the context of action recognition. The major challenge faced by this research problem is the variations of the spatio-temporal patterns that constitute each action category and the difficulty in generating a succinct representation encapsulating these patterns. This thesis considers two important aspects of videos for addressing this problem: (1) a video is a sequence of images with an inherent temporal dependency that defines the actual pattern to be recognized; (2) not all spatial regions of the video frame are equally important for discriminating one action category from another. The first aspect shows the importance of aggregating frame level features in a sequential manner while the second aspect signifies the importance of selective encoding of frame level features. The first problem is addressed by analyzing popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures for video representation generation and concludes that Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), a variant of the popular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNN unit, is suitable for encoding spatio-temporal patterns occurring in a video sequence. The second problem is tackled by developing a spatial attention mechanism for the selective encoding of spatial features by weighting spatial regions in the feature tensor that are relevant for identifying the action category. Detailed experimental analysis carried out on two video recognition tasks showed that spatially selective encoding is indeed beneficial. Inspired from the two aforementioned findings, a new recurrent neural unit, called Long Short-Term Attention (LSTA), is developed by augmenting LSTM with built-in spatial attention and a revised output gating.

This thesis, motivated by the needs of Dyfed-Powys Police, focuses on developing a series of predictive tools that can be used directly within a live setting in order to improve efficiency across the force. With an area of coverage that spans four socioeconomically diverse yet sparsely populated counties, Dyfed-Powys Police face a unique set of challenges in managing an increasingly limited set of resources such that offenders can be properly managed. The issue of personnel management is first addressed in the construction of a recommender system, which investigates the use of clustering techniques to exploit a stable pattern in the times at which crimes occur in various locations across the region. This is then followed with the development of a Recurrent Neural Network, which aims to predict the time to next offence within a particular narrowly-defined partition of the area. ::: ::: By developing a series of tools that make use of existing data to predict which offenders within their database are most likely to reoffend, we aim to assist Dyfed-Powys in monitoring and preventing recidivism across the area. Firstly, we investigate the use of Random Forests and XGBoost algorithms, as well as Feedforward Neural Networks to predict an offender's likelihood of reoffence from a series of diverse factors. Secondly, we develop the aforementioned Random Forests algorithm into a survival model that aims to predict an offender's time to reoffence. Lastly, we develop a stacked model, which uses publicly available data to construct an Area Classifcation score for use as a factor within the original reoffence classification model. Insightful results are obtained, indicating a clear case for the use of many of these techniques in a live setting.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2975068421", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204096174"}

Manual segmentation in OCT images based on the combination of VH-IVUS image and OCT image were given by experts as the gold standard.

Recent epigenomic studies have shown that the length of a DNA region covered by an epigenetic mark is not just a byproduct of the assaying technologies and has functional implications for that locus. For example, expanded regions of DNA sequences that are marked by enhancer-specific histone modifications, such as acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) domains coincide with cell-specific enhancers, known as super or stretch enhancers. Similarly, promoters of genes critical for cell-specific functions are marked by expanded H3K4me3 domains in the cognate cell type, and these can span DNA regions from 4-5kb up to 40-50kb in length. These expanded H3K4me3 domains are known as buffer domains or super promoters. Methods. To ask what correlates with-and potentially regulates-the length of loci marked with these two important histone marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, we built Random Forest regression models. With these models, we computationally identified genomic and epigenomic patterns that are predictive for the length of these marks in seven ENCODE cell lines. Results. We found that certain epigenetic marks and transcription factors explain the variability of the length of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks across different cell types, which implies that the lengths of these two epigenetic marks are tightly regulated in a given cell type. Our source code for the regression models and data can be found at our GitHub page: https://github.com/zubekj/broad_peaks. Discussion. Our Random Forest based regression models enabled us to estimate the individual contribution of different epigenetic marks and protein binding patterns to the length of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac deposition patterns, therefore potentially revealing genomic signatures at cell specific regulatory elements.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4793332", "pubmed_id": "26989607", "doi": "10.7717/peerj.1750", "venue": "PeerJ", "journal": "PeerJ", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2278098490", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["4141642", "2722988", "206541578", "3251201", "6626940", "4356140", "13902510", "967613", "4376406", "5057", "25505889", "23853502", "10659969", "9476999"], "inbound_citations": ["4302161", "4708123", "2705005"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22460999"}

Previous studies showed that the regulatory activities of miRNAs could be involved in many biological processes, such as organ development1,2, metabolism3, immune response4 and tumorigenesis5,6. Certain miRNAs also showed great potential of being biomarkers for specific diseases7,8. In addition to mechanistic studies on already known miRNAs, discovery of novel miRNAs is becoming a major task and a hot research topic for thoroughly understanding of the miRNA world. ::: ::: With the advances of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques, a number of bioinformatics tools have been developed for systematical discovery of novel miRNAs based on different principles9, including the miRNA biogenesis mechanism10,11,12, the homology from known miRNAs13,14,15, the energy distribution pattern and Random Forest algorithm16. Although each of these approaches has its own merit and serviceability, several tools were included for performance comparison, in order to provide valuable information for selection of the ideal tool to meet different research needs9. However, accurate detection and quantification of these available tools are challenged by complex properties of the miRNAs and their precursors17, including the existence of miRNA variants (called isomRs), the secondary structures of the miRNA precursors9, and the Dicer-mediated processing of the miRNA precursors18,19. Therefore, thoroughly prediction and identification of the miRNAs, especially for the novel miRNAs, from the huge pool of HTS data remains a challenge for the following functional studies on miRNAs. ::: ::: Degradome sequencing is a widely used approach for direct and global identification of miRNA-mediated target cleavages20,21,22. The miRNA-mediated cleavage sites could be mapped by using degradome signatures20, and a reversed framework for novel plant miRNA detection has been developed in our previous work, based on the degradome-supported miRNA cleavage loci and the highly complementarity of miRNA and the targets in plants22. Interestingly, several recent reports have showed that a portion of the degradome signatures could be mapped to the ends of the miRNA- and/or the miRNA*-coding loci on the miRNA precursors. Thus, it was speculated that these degradome signatures might be evidences for Dicer-mediated processing of the miRNA precursors20,23. However, no further investigation was conducted. In our previous work, mapping of degradome signatures onto the plant genomes has uncovered massive cleavage signals22. Intriguingly, a portion of the degradome signatures were found to locate on the known miRNA precursors. Although several miRNAs were indicated to regulate their own precursors by cleavages24, it could not explain the existence of the degradome signatures mapped to the ends of the miRNA- and/or the miRNA*-coding loci on the precursors. Further investigations revealed that a great number of degradome signatures on the newly identified miRNA precursors in Arabidopsis were resulted from DCL1 (Dicer-like 1)-mediated cleavages, suggesting that the processing of miRNA precursors could be supported by degradome signatures25. In this regard, degradome sequencing data could be utilized for the systematical identification of DCL1-dependent miRNA and miRNA* loci on their precursors in plants. Notably, as the miRNA-miRNA* duplexes are released by Dicer-mediated processing of miRNA precursors in animals26, the miRNA and miRNA* loci could also be supported by degradome signatures theoretically. In this scenario, the degradome-based evidences of Dicer-mediated cleavages could increase the reliability of systematical detection of novel miRNA loci in both animals and plants. ::: ::: In this study, the miRNA precursors of Mus musculus and Arabidopsis thaliana registered in miRBase (release 21) were included for degradome-based scanning of Dicer-mediated cleavage signals. We demonstrated that Dicer-mediated processing of miRNA-miRNA* duplexes could be well supported by degradome signatures. Based on the results, a publicly available software, miRNA Digger, was developed for genomic-wide discovery of novel miRNA/miRNA* loci on specific precursors in plants and animals. To demonstrate its sensitivity and reliability, miRNA Digger was applied for the identification of already known and novel miRNAs from different tissues of Arabidopsis.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4702050", "pubmed_id": "26732371", "doi": "10.1038/srep18901", "venue": "Scientific reports", "journal": "Scientific reports", "mag_id": "2226902049", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["206336924", "61156584"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14624693"}

This necessitates intelligent approaches to address the emergency situations that will inevitably arise for all classes of UAV operations as defined by EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency). Hardware limitations for these small vehicles point to the utilization of analytical redundancy, rather than to the usual practice of hardware redundancy in manned aviation. In the course of this study, machine learning practices are implemented in order to diagnose faults on a small fixed-wing UAV to avoid the burden of accurate modeling needed in model-based fault diagnosis. A supervised classification method, SVM (Support Vector Machines) is used to classify the faults. The data used to diagnose the faults are gyro and accelerometer measurements. The idea to restrict the data set to accelerometer and gyro measurements is to check the method\u2019s classification ability, with a small and inexpensive chip set and without the need to access the data from the autopilot, such as the control input information. ::: ::: ::: This work addresses the faults in the control surfaces of a UAV. More specifically, the faults considered are the control surface stuck at an angle and the loss of effectiveness. First, a model of an aircraft is simulated. This model is not used for the design of Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) algorithms, but is instead utilized to generate data. Simulated data are used instead of flight data in order to isolate the probable effects of the controller on the diagnosis, which may complicate a preliminary study on FDD for drones. The results show that for simulated measurements, SVM gives very accurate results on the classification of the loss of effectiveness faults on the control surfaces. These promising results call for further investigation so as to assess SVM performance on fault classification with flight data. Real flights were arranged to generate faulty flight data by manipulating the open source autopilot, Paparazzi. All data and the code are available in the code sharing and versioning system, Github. Training is held offline due to the need for labeled data and the computational burden of the tuning phase of the classifiers. Results show that from the flight data, SVM yields an F1 score of 0.98 for the classification of control surface stuck faults. For the loss of efficiency faults, some feature engineering, involving the addition of past measurements is needed in order to attain the same classification performance. A promising result is discovered when spinors are used as features instead of angular velocities. Results show that by using spinors for classification, there is a vast improvement in classification accuracy, especially when the classifiers are untuned. Using spinors and a Gaussian Kernel, an untuned classifier gives an F1 score of 0.9555, which was 0.2712 when gyro measurements were used as features. In summary, this work shows that SVM gives a satisfactory performance for the classification of faults on the control surfaces of a drone using flight data.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2969822109", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201877841"}

Within the field of machine learning this process of gaining knowledge is achieved by applying a number of techniques, mainly those relying on heuristic search algorithms, rule-based systems, neural networks and genetic algorithms. This short report focuses on the learning of regular grammars (those languages accepted by finite state machines) by making use of heuristic search algorithms to direct the search. The process of learning grammars from a given set of data is referred to as grammatical inference (GI). Automata learning is the process of generalizing from a finite set of labelled examples, the language (FSA) which generated them. Let us say that we\u2019ve got the +ve example set {10, 20, 30, 80}. Positive since these examples are labelled \u201daccepted\u201d by the target language. We can immediately infer that the target language is that of integers divisible by 10 (or rather strings whose length is divisible by 10). However, by overgeneralizing we can also infer that the language is that of even integers (strings whose length is divisible by 2). Both are correct; however as we\u2019ll be outlining in the next section, this example illustrates how vital the training sample is (both +ve and -ve samples), for efficient, correct grammatical inference. The field of grammatical inference finds practical applications within areas such as syntactic pattern recognition, adaptive intelligent agents, computational biology, natural language acquisition and knowledge discovery as illustrated in [6]. In the next section we will be discussing some theoretical background. 2 Preliminaries Automata learning or identification can be formally expressed as a decision problem. 100 Sandro Spina Given an integer n and two disjoint sets of words D+ and D\u2212 over a finite alphabet \u03a3, does there exist a DFA consistent with D+ and D\u2212and having a number of states less than or equal to n The most classical and frequently used paradigm for language learning is that proposed by Gold [3], namely language identification in the limit. There are two main variations of this paradigm. In the first one the learner can make use of as much data as necessary. The learning algorithm is supplied with a growing sequence of examples compatible with the target automata. At each step the learner proposes a hypothesis DFA, representing the guessed solution. The algorithm is said to have the the identification in the limit property if the hypothesis (consistent with all learning data) remains unchanged for a finite number of guesses. In the second case the number of available learning examples is fixed and the learning algorithm must propose one hypothesis from this set of examples. This algorithm is said to have the identification in the limit property if, for any target machine A, it is possible to define a set D A of training examples called the representative sample (characteristic set) of L(A) [4]. Our work currently focuses on this second variation, were we\u2019re currently focusing on determining any lower bounds for the sparsity of the training data in order to be able to identify certain classes of regular languages. Gold [3] has proved that this decision problem is NP-complete, however if the sets D+ and D\u2212 are somehow representative of the target automaton, there exist a number of algorithms that solve the considered problem in deterministic polynomial time. In the next section we\u2019ll be describing two main GI algorithms. 3 Learning Algorithms The first algorithm is due to Trakhtenbrot and Barzdin [5]. A uniformly complete data set is required for their algorithm to find the smallest DFA that recognizes the language. Their algorithm was rediscovered by Gold in 1978 and applied to the grammatical inference problem, however in this case uniformly complete samples are not required. A second algorithm, RPNI (Regular Positive and Negative Inference) was proposed by Oncina and Garcia in 1992. Lang [5] proposed another algorithm that behaves exactly in the same way as RPNI during the same year. The RPNI algorithm is based on merging states in the prefix tree acceptor of the sample. Both algorithms are based on searching for equivalent states. These algorithms had a major impact in the field, since now languages of infinite size became learnable. Lang proved empirically that the average case is tractable. Different control strategies (heuristics) can be adopted to explore the space of DFA constructions. At each step a number of possible merges are possible, thus the merging order of equivalent states determines the correctness of the generated target language hypothesis. To make things clear let us consider the regular expression ab\u2217a, with D+ = {aba, aa, abbbba} and D\u2212 = {b, ab, abbb}. The Augmented Prefix Tree Acceptor (APTA) for these training sets is shown in figure 1. Note that final (accepting) states are labelled 1, non-final (rejecting) states are labelled 0 and unknown states are marked ?. The task of the learning algorithms is to determine the correct labelling for the states marked with a ?. The learning algorithm proceeds by merging states in the APTA, until no more merges are possible. Rodney Price [2] proposed an evidence driven heuristic for merging states. Essentially this algorithm (EDSM) works as follows : 1.

In recent years, multi-view graph partitioning has attracted more and more attention, but most efforts have been made to develop graph partitioning approaches directly in the original topological structure. In many real-world applications, graph may contain noisy links and the distance metric may not be so discriminative for revealing cluster structure. This paper addresses the problem of discriminative metric learning for multi-view graph partitioning. In particular, we propose a novel method called Multi-view DML (abbr. of Multi-view Discriminative Metric Learning) to transform the metric space in the original graph into a more discriminative metric space, in which better graph partitioning results will be obtained. We envision the multi-view graph as an adaptive dynamic system, where both the intra-view connections and the inter-view couplings are interplayed to gradually update the relation metric among nodes. On the one hand, the inter-view coupling will be influenced by the intra-view connection between two nodes. On the other hand, the inter-view coupling will also affect the intra-view connection. Such interplay eventually makes the whole graph reach a steady state which has a stronger cluster structure than the original graph.

As a result, in the last decades, the development of computerised methods for diagnostic data processing and management has attracted a lot of interest and effort within medical imaging and diagnostic radiology, becoming in some cases a practical clinical approach. The basic concept of these methods is to provide a second opinion or a second reader that can aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and consistency of the diagnostic, prognostic and follow-up processes. Actually, the clinical interpretation of diagnostic data and their findings largely depends on the reader\u2019s subjective point of view, knowledge and experience. The presence of noise or the vast amount of data, generated by some devices, can make the detection of potential diseases a burdensome task and may cause oversight errors. Hence, computer-aided methods, able to make this interpretation reproducible and consistent, are fundamental for reducing subjectivity while increasing accuracy. ::: ::: Moreover, the amount and complexity of data and information to be analyzed and managed strongly demand for the development of computerised decision aiding systems able to cope with the increasing bulk of clinical data by providing an integrated approach to analysis, foster adherence to guidelines, prevent omissions and disseminate up-to-date specialist knowledge. ::: ::: In this respect, the aim of this Special Issue is to gather new research and application trends in eHealth including intelligent signal and image processing, advanced systems for medical ontologies, medical knowledge discovery, representation and management, efficient clinical decision support systems, multilevel modeling of pathologies, therapy simulation and virtualization of the human physiology; all methods that are becoming an essential component in supporting clinicians\u2019 decision making during their clinical routine workflow. ::: ::: The issues related to the development of specialized platforms and tools to speed up the process of biomedical data analysis are faced by Skounakis et al. in the first paper. The authors present Doctor Eye, a novel, open access interactive platform which is devoted to 3D medical image analysis, simulation and visualization. Currently focused on oncological application, the platform allows clinicians managing a large number of 3D tomographic datasets by providing them methods for efficiently annotating multiple regions of interest, and quickly and accurately delineating tumors by manual and semi-automatic segmentation techniques, combined with integrated correction tool. ::: ::: The potential of acoustic emission is investigated by Shark et al. for osteoarthritis diagnosis. There is a fundamental weakness that characterized all common imaging techniques usually employed in aiding such a diagnosis, and it comes from the assessment of a dynamic anatomical structure, such as knee joints, in a static mode. A pilot study has been carried out by the authors to assess the effectiveness of acoustic emission in osteoarthritis diagnosis. A four-phase model of the sit-stand-sit movement and a two-feature descriptor of acoustic emission signals have been used to discover the differences in acoustic emission between healthy and osteoarthritis knee joints in the same age group. To enable the rapid visualization of the acoustic feature profile of a knee an image based visual display has been created based on a combination of multiple 2D colour histograms. ::: ::: The localization of epicardial fat has recently become an urgent problem in cardiology for it has been proved its correlation with cardiovascular diseases, cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic syndrome and its possible role in secreting hormones, cytokines and chemokine that cause atherogenesis. In their paper, Coppini et al. present a method for the analysis of epicardial fat in single-frame 3D images, obtained by the standard acquisition protocol used for coronary calcium scoring. A two step segmentation algorithm, based on a course-to-fine approach, is used for identifying the volume of interest, while significant parameters are computed for the evaluation of epicardial fat volume and regional distribution. The method has been developed paying much attention to the minimization of user intervention, thus fostering the reproducibility and quantitatively effectiveness of the analysis. ::: ::: In the last paper, Candelieri and Conforti discuss a hyper-solution framework for the development of decisional models based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). The framework has been specifically defined and applied to the prediction of acute events (i.e., destabilization or decompensation events) in chronic heart failure patients. Actually, this is a hot issue in the management of chronic patients and currently there are no sharp and objective prediction criteria. Computational reasoning methods appear, then, as a viable solution and, in particular, SVM which are powerful learning paradigms able to provide accurate and reliable decisional functions. The framework presented by the authors is devoted to solve the crucial issue in SVM learning task of parameters tuning (i.e., regularization, kernel type and its internal parameters).

Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems can offer a second opinion to radiologists, thereby increasing the overall diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound imaging. Although current CAD systems exhibit promising results, their use in clinical practice is limited. Some of the main limitations are that the majority use direction dependent features so, they are only compatible with static images in just one plane (axial or longitudinal), requiring precise segmentation of a nodule. Our intention has been to design a CAD system which will use only direction independent features i.e., not dependent upon the orientation or inclination angle of the ultrasound probe when acquiring the image. In this study, 60 thyroid nodules (20 malignant, 40 benign) were divided into small patches of 17 \u00d7 17 pixels, which were then used to extract several direction independent features by employing Two-Threshold Binary Decomposition, a method that decomposes an image into the set of binary images.

In this paper, we propose an effective BFE algorithm utilizing Random Forest (RF) to automatically select the optimal feature subset and try to predict the EGFR mutations using CT images. Firstly, the whole dataset was shuffled and the features were ranked by RF importance measures. Then, LASSO regression was iteratively used to perform both regularization and accuracy calculation in the BFE, ending when any further removals do not result in an improvement, to gain a series of feature subsets. Lastly, we gathered all the feature subsets in a feature counter and final feature subset was determined by hard voting with equal weight.

On the one hand, the traditional empirical mode decomposition is extended to its 3-D version, which naturally treats the HSI as a cube and effectively decomposes the HSI into several 3-D intrinsic mode functions (TIMFs). To accelerate the fTEMD, 3-D Delaunay triangulation is adopted to determine the distances of extrema, whereas separable filters are implemented to generate the envelopes. On the other hand, cMTL is performed on the TIMFs by taking those TIMFs as features of different tasks.

In this paper, we propose two novel techniques in the generative adversarial networks to produce photo-realistic images for image super-resolution. Firstly, instead of producing a single score to discriminate images between real and fake, we propose a variant, called Fine-grained Attention Generative Adversarial Network for image super-resolution (FASRGAN), to discriminate each pixel between real and fake. FASRGAN adopts a Unet-like network as the discriminator with two outputs: an image score and an image score map. The score map has the same spatial size as the HR/SR images, serving as the fine-grained attention to represent the degree of reconstruction difficulty for each pixel. Secondly, instead of using different networks for the generator and the discriminator in the SR problem, we use a feature-sharing network (Fs-SRGAN) for both the generator and the discriminator. By network sharing, certain information is shared between the generator and the discriminator, which in turn can improve the ability of producing high-quality images. Quantitative and visual comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods. The application of super-resolution images to object recognition further proves that the proposed methods endow the power to reconstruction capabilities and the excellent super-resolution effects.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1911.10773", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2989679403", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["24238404", "9971732", "59526970", "6540453", "206594692", "484327", "3619954", "49657846", "211227", "1033682", "155609399", "52154773", "3719281", "206593506", "21618854", "9893011", "975170", "7037846", "52502154", "1543021", "26229170", "202772331", "2141622", "159042885", "85501306", "67855809", "207761262", "206771333", "206593710", "3625846", "14989939", "12663716", "49868472", "52269780", "49559335", "52309063", "980236", "14124313", "5250573", "64193", "8282555", "8887614", "3938062", "6628106", "40027675"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208267877"}

In addition, it can provide their spatial distributions as \u2018molecular maps\u2019. These features make MSI well suited for studying the molecular makeup of tumor tissue. Currently, there is an interest in using MSI to predict cancer progression and treatment response, which often remains a challenge in today\u2019s clinical practice. Experimental evidence shows that tumor heterogeneity plays an important role in tumor biology and therefore in response to treatment. The molecular profiles generated by MSI reveal part of this heterogeneity. We describe the combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI, histological tissue staining and multivariate data analysis to investigate inter- and intratumor heterogeneity. The first part of this thesis focuses on the generation and use of MALDI-MSI data to predict treatment response and disease progression. Small pieces of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue were used, typically referred to as tissue microarrays (TMAs). We present an approach that combines MALDI-MSI on tissue microarrays with Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis (PCA-LDA) to predict treatment response. The feasibility of this approach is evaluated on a set of 22 patient-derived xenograft models of triple-negative breast cancer. PCA-LDA is used to predict response to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin based on the proteomic information obtained with MALDI-MSI. A small predictive power is observed. In addition, the feasibility to predict lymph node metastasis and disease-specific survival from a sample set of 240 head and neck cancers is tested. We discuss how MALDI-MSI data from these samples is processed so that it could be used in five different classifiers: Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, a Naive Bayes classifier, Decision Tree classifier and Support Vector Machine. Only for some of the classifiers a small predictive power for disease-specific survival is shown. The second part of this thesis focuses on intratumor heterogeneity. It presents a new method to detect and visualize hypoxic tumor regions and hypoxia-associated molecules in a breast tumor xenograft model. In hypoxic cells, the 2-nitroimidazole pimonidazole is reduced and forms reactive products that bind to cellular nucleophiles. We demonstrate that a reductively activated pimonidazole metabolite can be detected by MALDI-MSI. This pimonidazole metabolite is used to image hypoxic tissue regions and hypoxia-associated lipids and metabolites. Pimonidazole is a widely used hypoxia marker. We expect that the presented MALDI-MSI approach might be also applicable to other tissues from pimonidazole-injected animals or humans. Perspectives for future research include further optimization of the sample preparation for FFPE tissue and the use of a modified chemical marker for the detection of hypoxia.

As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that each product receives grows rapidly. As a result, the problem of automatically mining reviews to extract useful information has recently attracted many researchers. In the last decade, several works have been presented for identifying product aspects from reviews. Product aspects are components or attributes of the product that have been commented on in the review, e.g. 'zoom' and 'battery life' for a digital camera. In this paper, we propose a novel method for mining user opinions, which aims at extracting not only the opinions of users on product aspects, but also a finer level of information indicating the usage type of the aspect. In other words, we try to find out how the reviewer used the aspect. In this work, we focus on the task of identifying product aspects, corresponding opinions, and related usages as a sequence tagging problem. We employ Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to solve the stated problem and propose techniques for defining and filtering features to enhance the accuracy.

Given that training a neural network is computationally expensive, channel approximation networks-and more generally the autoencoder systems-should be evaluated in communication environments that are traditionally difficult. To that end, our investigation focuses on channels that contain a combination of non-linear amplifier distortion, pulse shape filtering, intersymbol interference, frequency-dependent group delay, multipath, and non-Gaussian statistics. Each of our models are trained without any prior knowledge of the channel. We show that the trained models have learned to generalize over an arbitrary amplifier drive level and constellation alphabet.

To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical prostate MR segmentation method, with the main contributions lying in the following aspects: First, the most salient features are learnt from atlases based on a subclass discriminant analysis (SDA) method, which aims to find a discriminant feature subspace by simultaneously maximizing the inter-class distance and minimizing the intra-class variations. The projected features, instead of only voxel-wise intensity, will be served as anatomical signature of each voxel. Second, based on the projected features, a new multi-atlases sparse label fusion framework is proposed to estimate the prostate likelihood of each voxel in the target image from the coarse level. Third, a domain-specific semi-supervised manifold regularization method is proposed to incorporate the most reliable patient-specific information identified by the prostate likelihood map to refine the segmentation result from the fine level. Our method is evaluated on a T2 weighted prostate MR image dataset consisting of 66 patients and compared with two state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

A variety of machine-learners (CART, CART with bagging, Random Forest, k- nearest neighbor, nearest shrunken centroid, artificial neural network, multinomial logistic regression, logistic model trees, and support vector machine) were tested in the extraction of the complex relationships between soil taxonomic units (great groups and orders) from a conventional soil survey and a suite of 20 environmental covariates representing the topography, climate, and vegetation of the study area. Methods used to extract training data from a soil survey included by-polygon, equal-class, area-weighted, and area-weighted with random over sampling (ROS) approaches. The fitted models, which consist of the soil-environmental relationships, were then used to predict soil great groups and orders for the entire study area at a 100 m spatial resolution.

Lidar data have proven particularly useful for measuring or estimating a suite of forest structural attributes such as canopy height, basal area, and LAI.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of lidar data for characterizing forest successional stages across a structurally diverse, mixed-species forest in Northern Idaho. We used a variety of lidar-derived metrics in conjunction with an algorithmic modeling procedure (Random Forests) to classify six stages of three-dimensional forest development and achieved an overall accuracy>95%. The algorithmic model presented herein developed ecologically meaningful classifications based upon lidar metrics quantifying mean vegetation height and canopy cover, among others.

Earlier methods of incremental learning tackle this problem by either using a part of the old dataset, by generating exemplars or by using memory networks. Although, these methods have shown good results but using exemplars or generating them, increases memory and computation requirements. To solve these problems we propose an adversarial discriminator based method that does not make use of old data at all while training on new tasks. We particularly tackle the class incremental learning problem in image classification, where data is provided in a class-based sequential manner. For this problem, the network is trained using an adversarial loss along with the traditional cross-entropy loss. The cross-entropy loss helps the network progressively learn new classes while the adversarial loss helps in preserving information about the existing classes.

In this paper, we propose Cross-generating Generative Adversarial Network (CG-GAN) to generate rotated faces while extracting discriminative identity. CG-GAN is allowed to learn a network to exchange poses and illuminations of two different subjects' picture. Within the network, each input image is resolved into a variation code and a identity code at the representation layer; then these codes are randomly combined for generating corresponding pictures. Not only does CG-GAN synthesis vivid face under desired pose from one picture, but also the represention layer is very suitable for face recognition task.

Firstly, 3500 PD samples are obtained based on the PD testing of five types of artificial defects of ethylene-propylene (EPR) cables in the high voltage lab. Secondly, PD data pre-processing is carried out and 34 types of PD features are extracted from the raw data. Thirdly, the principles of GBDT and RF based PD pattern recognition are presented in details.

Synergy graph patterns refer to those graphs, where the relationships among the nodes are highly inseparable. Compared with the general graph patterns, synergy graph patterns which have much higher discriminative powers are more suitable as the classification features. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a simple and efficient Single-hidden Layer Feedforward neural Networks (SLFNs) algorithm with extremely fast learning capacity. In this paper we propose the problem of extending ELM to non-redundant synergy pattern based graph classification.The graph classification framework being widely used consists of two steps, namely feature generation and classification. The first issue is how to quickly obtain significant graph pattern features from a graph database. The next step is how to effectively build a graph classification model with these graph pattern features. An efficient depth-first algorithm, called GINS, was presented to find all non-redundant synergy graph patterns. Also, based on the proposed Support Graph Vector Model (SGVM) and ELM algorithm, the graph classification model was constructed. Extensive experiments are conducted on a series of real-life datasets. The results show that GINS is more efficient than two representative competitors.

Finally, we discuss the lessons learned from these experimental settings w.r.t. addressing the following key research questions such as whether there is an appropriate type of social media repository to incorporate contextual information, whether extending the pool of the selected features could improve context incorporation into SA systems and which is the best performing feature combination to achieve such improved performance.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-70407-4_38", "venue": "ESWC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2767604130", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["23280108", "52920015"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33764232"}

Support Vector Machine (SVM) has important properties such as a strong mathematical background and a better generalization capability with respect to other classification methods. On the other hand, the major drawback of SVM occurs in its training phase, which is computationally expensive and highly dependent on the size of input data set. In this study, a new algorithm to speed up the training time of SVM is presented; this method selects a small and representative amount of data from data sets to improve training time of SVM.

Due to the intermittent and uncertain characteristic of the electrical load, many research studies have been directed to nonlinear prediction methods. In this paper, a hybrid prediction algorithm comprised of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Modified Firefly Algorithm (MFA) is proposed to provide the short term electrical load forecast. The SVR models utilize the nonlinear mapping feature to deal with nonlinear regressions. However, such models suffer from a methodical algorithm for obtaining the appropriate model parameters. Therefore, in the proposed method the MFA is employed to obtain the SVR parameters accurately and effectively. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methodology, it is applied to the electrical load demand in Fars, Iran. The obtained results are compared with those obtained from the ARMA model, ANN, SVR-GA, SVR-HBMO, SVR-PSO and SVR-FA.

At present, many machine learning methods are used to predict protein crystallization. In this work, we propose a Fuzzy Support Vector Machine based on Linear Neighborhood Representation (FSVM-LNR) to predict the crystallization propensity of proteins.

RFA predicts the control signals of the voltage source inverter (VSI) based on the active and reactive power variations in the load side. With this control technique, the system parameter variations and external disturbances are reduced and the load demands are satisfied optimally. The proposed strategy is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink working platform with three different case studies and compared with existing techniques. With these case studies, the proposed technique generates the optimal PV power of 2.1 kW.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.12.071", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Hydrogen Energy", "mag_id": "2997076375", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214458380"}

Existing deep network models require a large amount of labeled data. However, obtaining accurate pixel-wise labeling in X-ray images relies heavily on skilled clinicians due to the large overlaps of anatomy and the complex texture patterns. On the other hand, organs in 3D CT scans preserve clearer structures as well as sharper boundaries and thus can be easily delineated. In this paper, we propose a novel model framework for learning automatic X-ray image parsing from labeled CT scans. Specifically, a Dense Image-to-Image network (DI2I) for multi-organ segmentation is first trained on X-ray like Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) rendered from 3D CT volumes. Then we introduce a Task Driven Generative Adversarial Network (TD-GAN) architecture to achieve simultaneous style transfer and parsing for unseen real X-ray images. TD-GAN consists of a modified cycle-GAN substructure for pixel-to-pixel translation between DRRs and X-ray images and an added module leveraging the pre-trained DI2I to enforce segmentation consistency. The TD-GAN framework is general and can be easily adapted to other learning tasks. In the numerical experiments, we validate the proposed model on 815 DRRs and 153 topograms. While the vanilla DI2I without any adaptation fails completely on segmenting the topograms, the proposed model does not require any topogram labels and is able to provide a promising average dice of 85% which achieves the same level accuracy of supervised training (88%).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1806.07201", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-00934-2_67", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2809397050,2949477454", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6776058", "3719281", "2127515", "4357800", "206595056", "206770979", "9433631", "206594692", "12803511"], "inbound_citations": ["67769470", "204743865", "210942712", "214624672", "54446473", "202540533", "199008150", "59222756", "204800565", "201660427", "62913361", "90261806", "202760162", "182953207", "203593647", "56475938", "201786869", "184483982", "52901563", "199501994", "201125162", "52305483", "195657974", "207756503", "195882347", "102353234", "214743343", "211043990", "195820454", "201650055", "53432181", "202699299"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49317508"}

We can represent the effects of teleconnections using existing tools and covariates, but we cannot easily infer or identify their controls, landscape processes or landscape units. We consider that an ability to identify the relevant controls in teleconnected systems would greatly improve pedological interpretation and understanding. Such understanding relates to the interaction of environmental factors and processes in the spatial context, which is relevant for environmental mapping generally. Here we show that teleconnected systems can be disassembled and interpreted using contextual modelling in such a way that the controls, i.e. the cause, can be localized in space. We present examples of how teleconnected systems can be deciphered. The methodology is based on the previously described ConMap approach in combination with Random Forest's measures of local feature importance. ConMap uses elevation differences, computed along multiple rays radiating out from a center grid cell, as predictors instead of complex surface derivatives or decomposed scales of a digital elevation model (DEM) or terrain attribute. Using synthetic and real-world data sets, we show how to identify and interpret teleconnections in soil environmental systems. In the synthetic example, elevation peaks are shown to produce larger values of soil properties, while, in contrast, a valley-mountain system is the main control of soil texture in the real-world example.

Traditional machine learning algorithms, such as Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc. output simple, bare predictions without an indication (confidence) of how likely each prediction is of being correct. However, in real-world problem domains, it is highly desirable to have predictions complemented with a tolerance interval to assess their credibility and accuracy. CP can be thought of as a strategy built on top of a machine learning algorithm to hedge its predictions with valid confidence. In this paper, a NN Regression (NNR) model is used to derive a decision rule for the inverse prediction of non-linear pavement layer moduli from Non-Destructive Test (NDT) deflection data. A CP is then implemented for the NNR decision rule and tested on an independent data set to demonstrate its error calibration properties. It is shown that CP can be used to derive reliable pavement moduli predictions without compromising the accuracy of the NNR decision rule but with control of the risk of error.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.scient.2011.11.018", "venue": null, "journal": "Scientia Iranica", "mag_id": "2047505851", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["73670392", "111527063"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:120570856"}

The optimization process accomplished by commanding an L1-norm as a regulation term. Meanwhile, a non-negative constraint on the kernel combination weights is used.

These contain abundant patient-specific information, which has so far remained largely under-utilized in powering CDSS applications. In this paper, we attempt to build one such CDSS system for patient mortality prediction, using unstructured clinical records. Effectiveness of such prediction models largely depends on optimally capturing latent concept features, thus, word representation quality is of utmost importance. We experiment with three popular word embedding models - Word2Vec, FastText and GloVe for generating word embeddings of unstructured nursing notes of patients from a standard, open dataset, MIMIC-III. These word representations are used as features to train machine learning classifiers to build ICU mortality prediction models, a critical CDSS in ICUs of hospitals.

Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist binds to CCR5 receptor. Thus, it is important to identify the coreceptor used by the HIV strains dominating in the patient. In past, a number of experimental assays and in-silico techniques have been developed for predicting the coreceptor tropism. The prediction accuracy of these methods is excellent when predicting CCR5(R5) tropic sequences but is relatively poor for CXCR4(X4) tropic sequences. Therefore, any new method for accurate determination of coreceptor usage would be of paramount importance to the successful management of HIV-infected individuals. ::: Results ::: The dataset used in this study comprised 1799 R5-tropic and 598 X4-tropic third variable (V3) sequences of HIV-1. We compared the amino acid composition of both types of V3 sequences and observed that certain types of residues, e.g., Asparagine and Isoleucine, were preferred in R5-tropic sequences whereas residues like Lysine, Arginine, and Tryptophan were preferred in X4-tropic sequences. Initially, Support Vector Machine-based models were developed using amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, and split amino acid composition, which achieved accuracy up to 90%. We used BLAST to discriminate R5- and X4-tropic sequences and correctly predicted 93.16% of R5- and 75.75% of X4-tropic sequences. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, a Hybrid model was developed that achieved 91.66% sensitivity, 81.77% specificity, 89.19% accuracy and 0.72 Matthews Correlation Coefficient. The performance of our models was also evaluated on an independent dataset (256 R5- and 81 X4-tropic sequences) and achieved maximum accuracy of 84.87% with Matthews Correlation Coefficient 0.63. ::: Conclusion ::: This study describes a highly efficient method for predicting HIV-1 coreceptor usage from V3 sequences.

If we could combine that data more effectively, we might well develop a deeper understanding of biomedical problems and their solutions. Compared to traditional machine learning techniques, transfer learning techniques explicitly model differences among origins of data to provide a smooth transfer of knowledge. Most techniques focus on the transfer of data, while more recent techniques have begun to explore the possibility of transfer of models. Model-transfer techniques are especially appealing in biomedicine because they involve fewer privacy risks. Unfortunately, most model-transfer techniques are unable to handle heterogeneous scenarios where models differ in the features they contain, which occur commonly with biomedical data. This dissertation develops an innovative transfer learning framework to share both data and models under a variety of conditions, while allowing the inclusion of features that are unique to and informative about the target context. I used both synthetic and real-world datasets to test two hypotheses: 1) a transfer learning model that is learned using source knowledge and target data performs classification in the target context better than a target model that is learned solely from target data; 2) a transfer learning model performs classification in the target context better than a source model. I conducted a comprehensive analysis to investigate conditions where these two hypotheses hold, and more generally the factors that affect the effectiveness of transfer learning, providing empirical opinions about when and what to share. My research enables knowledge sharing under heterogeneous scenarios and provides an approach for understanding transfer learning performance in terms of differences of features, distributions, and sample sizes between source and target. The model-transfer algorithm can be viewed as a new Bayesian network learning algorithm with a flexible representation of prior knowledge. In concrete terms, this work shows the potential for transfer learning to assist in the rapid development of a case detection system for an emergent unknown disease. More generally, to my knowledge, this research is the first investigation of model-based transfer learning in biomedicine under heterogeneous scenarios.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2923826117", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108345957"}

Ensemble methods are meta algorithms that combine several machine learning algorithms into one predictive model, and thereby decreases variance and bias and improve classifiers prediction capability.

It makes use of S transform for feature extraction. We extract only the significant components of the time-series data. Earlier wavelets based approach that extracts features from the time-series data has been applied for detecting anomalies in combination with various classifiers like Self Organizing Maps and SVM (Support Vector Machine). The wavelet based approach considerably reduces the processing time of Anomaly Detection System (ADS) as the data size is considerably reduced. However these methods are characterized by high computational complexity. It has been observed that the S-transform could give better frequency resolution than wavelet based approaches. The application of S-Transform to the time series data considerably reduces the data size. Therefore, the proposed method does not makes use of huge amount of data in processing the information sought, and hence can efficiently detect and classify different types of fault with little processing time. It aims at detecting and classifying anomalies at node level according to the characteristics of data collected by each individual sensor. These features obtained from S-transform when integrated with SVM can classify data into class 1(Original Signal) and class 2(Anomalous Signal).

According to the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, the patterns of bodily disharmony are described in terms of eight major parameters: yin and yang, external and internal, hot and cold, and excess and deficiency. Additional systems such as qi, blood, and body-fluid differentiation and zang fu (organ) differentiation are also used. To enhance wider acceptance, these TCM categories have to have sufficient reliability and validity. There are interrater and test-retest reliability and four major types of validity: concurrent, predictive, construct, and content. As the TCM theory originated from ancient medical texts and the classification is based on symptoms and signs, the key shortcomings are the highly subjective diagnostic process and the lack of scientific support for the TCM classification. In this special issue, the evidence base of the TCM classification was investigated. ::: ::: In the paper \u201cAdvances in Patient Classification for Traditional Chinese Medicine: A Machine Learning Perspective,\u201d the authors introduced the machine learning algorithms for sign classification, syndrome differentiation, and disease classification. Clinical features, as derived from inspection, auscultation, olfaction, and palpation, and patients' dataset from medical records could be analyzed by k nearest neighbor, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, naive bayes, decision tree, artificial neural network, graphical models, multilabel learning, deep learning, or clustering analysis. The use of machine learning algorithms is a step toward enhancing data reliability, but the accuracy, as compared to experienced TCM practitioners, is still suboptimal. We believe that the machine learning algorithms are best used to deal with large and complex dataset, while the application in sign classification merits further investigation. ::: ::: With the help of computer technology, the paper \u201cSignificant Geometry Features in Tongue Image Analysis\u201d categorized five different tongue shapes: rectangular, acute triangle, obtuse triangle, circle, and square. The authors found that tongue shape can be used to distinguish healthy and disease states, with an average accuracy of 76%. Further testing of the role of tongue shape in TCM classification is needed. ::: ::: Two papers introduced novel statistical approaches to assist TCM classification. In the paper \u201cMining Symptom-Herb Patterns from Patient Records Using Tripartite Graph,\u201d the authors designed a data mining approach to examine the relationship between symptom, syndrome, and herb. This tripartite information network derives more accurate information than linking symptom and herb alone. In the paper \u201cA Novel Classification Method for Syndrome Differentiation of Patients with AIDS,\u201d the authors found that a novel machine learning algorithm, minimum reference set-based multiple instance learning, was superior to other machine learning algorithms for TCM classification. ::: ::: A few papers examined the clinical application of TCM classification. In the paper \u201cYang Deficiency Body Constitution Acts as a Predictor of Diabetic Retinopathy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: Taichung Diabetic Body Constitution Study,\u201d 673 patients with diabetes were examined using a body constitution questionnaire. The authors showed that yang deficiency was an independent predictor of a lower risk of diabetic retinopathy, suggesting that TCM classification may have predictive validity on disease complication. As the study design was cross-sectional, the causal relationship between TCM pattern and diabetic complication should be further examined in longitudinal studies. ::: ::: The paper \u201cCerebral Activity Changes in Different Traditional Chinese Medicine Patterns of Psychogenic Erectile Dysfunction Patients\u201d showed that, compared to patients with liver-qi stagnation and spleen deficiency, patients with kidney-yang deficiency showed an increased activity in bilateral brainstem, cerebellum, hippocampus, and the right insula, thalamus, and middle cingulate cortex and a decreased activity in bilateral putamen, medial frontal gyrus, temporal pole, and the right caudate nucleus, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex. As the main difference in cerebral activity between the TCM patterns is in the brain regions that are responsible for emotional modulation, the authors believed that TCM classification might help disease subclassification, which could be used to provide personalized treatment. ::: ::: In the paper \u201cAnalysis and Recognition of Traditional Chinese Medicine Pulse Based on the Hilbert-Huang Transform and Random Forest in Patients with Coronary Heart Disease,\u201d the authors introduced an objective pulse measurement, which could distinguish patients with coronary heart disease and healthy controls. Further studies are needed to test the reliability and validity of the pulse characteristics. Another paper titled \u201cCorrelations between Phlegm Syndrome of Chinese Medicine and Coronary Angiography: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\u201d showed that phlegm syndrome can help to determine the severity of coronary heart disease. ::: ::: Lastly, in the paper \u201cPrescription of Chinese Herbal Medicine in Pattern-Based Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment for Depression: A Systematic Review,\u201d the authors found that liver qi depression, liver depression and spleen deficiency, dual deficiency of the heart and spleen, and liver depression and qi stagnation were the most common TCM patterns in people with depression. The authors identified several pattern-based TCM treatments that could be further examined. Xiaoyao decoction was the most frequently used herbal formula for the treatment of liver qi depression and liver depression with spleen deficiency, while Chaihu Shugan decoction was often used for liver depression and qi stagnation. The authors called for more high quality studies incorporating TCM pattern differentiation and treatment principle to examine the efficacy of TCM treatments and the additional benefit of pattern differentiation. Future studies incorporating expertise in various disciplines are needed to further examine the evidence base of TCM classification in patient care.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4523680", "pubmed_id": "26265922", "doi": "10.1155/2015/168343", "venue": "Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM", "journal": "Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1958397568", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["215315883", "211055402", "84834833"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16749593"}

Ultrasound imaging, including acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging, is the first-line examination technique used to locate breast lesion tissue, which can then be quantitated by virtual touch tissue imaging (VTI). ARFI-VTI elastography is a breast imaging modality that creates two-dimensional (2D) images to visualize the texture details, elasticity, and morphological features of a region of interest (ROI). The 2D Harris corner convolution is applied during digital imaging to remove speckle noise and enhance the ARFI-VTI images for extrapolation of lesion tissue in a ROI. Then, 2D Harris corner convolution, maximum pooling, and random decision forests (RDF) are integrated into a machine vision classifier to screen subjects with benign or malignant tumors. A total of 320 ARFI-VTI images were collected for experiments.

This work investigates the potential use of microarray technology and gene expression profile analysis to screen common bottlenose dolphins for exposure to environmental contaminants through the immunological and/or endocrine perturbations associated with these agents. A dolphin microarray representing 24,418 unigene sequences was used to analyze blood samples collected from 47 dolphins during capture-release health assessments from five different US coastal locations (Beaufort, NC, Sarasota Bay, FL, Saint Joseph Bay, FL, Sapelo Island, GA and Brunswick, GA). Organohalogen contaminants including pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners were determined in blubber biopsy samples from the same animals. A subset of samples (n = 10, males; n = 8, females) with the highest and the lowest measured values of PCBs in their blubber was used as strata to determine the differential gene expression of the exposure extremes through machine learning classification algorithms. A set of genes associated primarily with nuclear and DNA stability, cell division and apoptosis regulation, intra- and extra-cellular traffic, and immune response activation was selected by the algorithm for identifying the two exposure extremes. In order to test the hypothesis that these gene expression patterns reflect PCB exposure, we next investigated the blood transcriptomes of the remaining dolphin samples using machine-learning approaches, including K-nn and Support Vector Machines classifiers. Using the derived gene sets, the algorithms worked very well (100% success rate) at classifying dolphins according to the contaminant load accumulated in their blubber.

Conceptually, the sensitivity reflects a network's output behavior at a given data point, for example, the trend of the network's output nearby. So the sensitivity can be helpful to explicitly measure the output diversity among individuals in the pool.

However, satisfactory ER performance within a bi-dimensional and non-discrete emotional space using single-trial EEG data remains a challenging task. To address this issue, we propose a three-layer scheme for single-trial EEG-ER. In the first layer, a set of spectral powers of different EEG frequency bands are extracted from multi-channel single-trial EEG signals. In the second layer, the kernel Fisher's discriminant analysis method is applied to further extract features with better discrimination ability from the EEG spectral powers. The feature vector produced by layer 2 is called a kernel Fisher's emotion pattern (KFEP), and is sent into layer 3 for further classification where the proposed imbalanced quasiconformal kernel support vector machine (IQK-SVM) serves as the emotion classifier. The outputs of the three layer EEG-ER system include labels of emotional valence and arousal. Furthermore, to collect effective training and testing datasets for the current EEG-ER system, we also use an emotion-induction paradigm in which a set of pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) are employed as emotion induction stimuli. The performance of the proposed three-layer solution is compared with that of other EEG spectral power-based features and emotion classifiers.

We explore the predictive performance of model stacking and the effect of stacking on the predictive bias and squared error.

The framework is tested on a setup including gene expression, drug target, physical properties and drug response information for a set of drugs and cell lines. The performance of individual and stacked models are compared.

For the proposed method, first, the data that are processed are grouped by the k-means clustering method. The membership of arbitrary input for each fuzzy rule is then derived through an ELM, followed by a normalization method. At the same time, the consequent part of the fuzzy rules is obtained by multiple ELMs. At last, the approximate prediction value is determined by a weight computation scheme. For the ELM-based TSK fuzzy inference system, two extensions are also proposed to improve its accuracy.

A data set was created from the NFI-3 data for analysis purposes which contained variables relevant to the habitat requirements of native forest bird species. Information on the distribution and abundance of 20 native forest bird species was taken from the Atlas of German Breeding Birds (2005\u20132009, 3003 grid cells). They form two important ecological groups: cavity-nesting and deciduous forest birds. For the first time, this data was combined with NFI-3 data and analysed using Random Forest models and partial dependence plots to determine which forest variables recorded by the NFI-3 were most closely related to forest bird species richness and diversity in temperate forests. It was shown that changes in forest bird species diversity and richness correlate with the NFI data but the different sampling methods of the NFI and bird species data also created methodological challenges which are discussed. The most important drivers of the richness and diversity of deciduous forest and cavity-nesting bird species are forest stand age and forest ownership. Deciduous forest and cavity-nesting birds show a preference for the way state, federal and municipal forests are managed over private forests. Private forests have significantly lower deadwood volumes and high proportions of coniferous trees, both of which are forest characteristics that lower the richness and diversity of bird species. Our findings show that efforts to protect forest birds should target managed forests older than 100 and 200 years and forests with total deadwood volumes >46.3 m3/ha. Protected areas also exhibited higher diversity and richness of forest birds which highlight their importance as suitable target areas for the protection of forest birds.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.foreco.2018.10.012", "venue": null, "journal": "Forest Ecology and Management", "mag_id": "2897608386", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91932759"}

This study proposes an ensemble classification method called AdaWELM ensemble algorithm for fault diagnosis in wastewater treatment which builds up individual classifiers by using weighted extreme learning machine (WELM) and combines them with Adaboost ensemble algorithm. The weight matrix in WELM can be updated adaptively along with the iteration of Adaboost learning. The simulations based on 25 benchmark datasets from KEEL repository are arranged at first and the results show the proposed classifier outperforms the other comparative classifiers for most of the evaluated datasets. And then, a practical fault diagnosis model in wastewater treatment plant based on AdaWELM ensemble algorithm is built and the simulations verifies that, comparing with several classifiers, this fault diagnosis model can efficiently improve the performance of WWTP, especially improve the accuracy of faulty class and G-mean value.

Firstly, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is employed to obtain the pre-processed representations of raw vibration signals.

Thanks to the advancement in technology, the quality of phonocardiography signals is no longer an issue.

The recent application of deep learning approaches for network intrusion detection has shown promising. However, the challenges remain on how to deal with imbalance data and small samples as well as reducing false alarm rate (FAR). To address these issues, this work has proposed a multiple-layer representation learning model for accurate end-to-end network intrusion detection by combining deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) with gcForest. The contributions of this work lie in 1) a new data encoding scheme based on P-Zigzag to encode network traffic data into two-dimensional gray-scale images for representation learning without loss of original information; 2) The combination of gcForest and CNN allows accurate detection on imbalanced data and small scale data with fewer hyperparamters comparing to most existing deep learning models, which increase computational efficiency. The proposed approach is based on a multiple-layer approach consisting of a coarse layer and a fine layer, in which the coarse layer with the improved CNN model (GoogLeNetNP) focuses on identification of N abnormal classes and a normal class. While in the fine layer, an improved model based on gcForest (caXGBoost) further classifies the abnormal classes into N-1 subclasses. This ensures fine-grained detection of various attacks. The proposed framework has been compared with the existing deep learning models using three real datasets (a new dataset NBC, a combination of UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017 consisting of 101 classes). The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms other single deep learning methods (i.e., AlexNet, VGG19, GoogleNet, InceptionV3, ResNet18) in terms of accuracy, detection rate, and FAR, which demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting fine-grained attacks and handling imbalanced datasets with high-precision and low FAR.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2927465", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2959392253", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["29605054", "20262312", "1230317", "206551254", "207616703", "9768720", "2088679", "27739613", "53016938", "116649162", "28205811", "19713317", "31835902", "15087039", "9156200", "62195333", "2617020", "3306364", "12522725", "53008167", "16852251", "1946600", "5865851", "25331286", "206592484", "6447277", "3441568", "1388344", "19232355", "89141", "1241550", "5956609", "33785750", "3162284", "53014953", "60442955", "57754242", "206619973", "5808102", "16636683", "4650265", "18965349", "27653988", "4707749", "67685915", "1799558", "6287870", "14124313", "206593880"], "inbound_citations": ["209393624", "211298591"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198929523"}

Data used for network training, validation and testing was generated by the Simulink model consisting mainly of modulator, transceiver AD9361 and AWGN to generate the signal with SNR ranging from 1 to 30 dB.

The highest average classification accuracy of 86.9% was achieved by Support Vector Machines with Fine Gaussian kernel, however with demonstrated classification speed of 790 objects per second it was considered unable to meet target application's real-time operation requirement of 2000 objects per second.

To address this issue, we propose a multilabel classification framework based on a joint learning approach called label graph learning (LGL) driven weighted Support Vector Machine (SVM). In principle, the joint learning approach explicitly models the inter-label correlations by LGL, which is jointly optimized with multilabel classification in a unified learning scheme. As a result, the learned label correlation graph well fits the multilabel classification task while effectively reflecting the underlying topological structures among labels. Moreover, the inter-label interactions are also influenced by label-specific sample communities (each community for the samples sharing a common label). Namely, if two labels have similar label-specific sample communities, they are likely to be correlated. Based on this observation, LGL is further regularized by the label Hypergraph Laplacian.

Accurate and reliable prediction of tree diameter distributions is critical for optimizing forest structure compositions, scheduling silvicultural operations and promoting sustainable management. In this study, we investigated the potential of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for predicting tree diameter distributions using a bimodal finite mixture model (FMM) and a multimodal k-nearest neighbor (KNN) model (compared to the unimodal Weibull model (UWM)) over a subtropical planted forest in southern China. To do so, we first evaluated the capability of various LiDAR predictions (i.e., the bimodality coefficient (BC) and Lorenz-based indicators) to stratify forest structural types into unimodal and multimodal stands. Once the best LiDAR prediction for the differentiation was determined, the parameters of UWM (in non-specific and species-specific models) and FMM (in structure-specific models) were estimated by LiDAR-derived metrics and the tree diameter distributions of stands were generated by the estimated LiDAR parameters. When KNN was applied for constructing diameter distributions, optimal KNN strategies, including number of neighbors k, response configurations and imputation methods (i.e., Most Similar Neighbor (MSN) and Random Forest (RF)) for different species were heuristically determined. Finally, the predictive performance of estimated LiDAR the parameters of UWM, FMM and KNN for predicting diameter distributions were assessed. The results showed that LiDAR-predicted Lorenz-based indicators performed best for differentiation. Parameters of UWM and FMM were predicted well and the species-specific models had higher accuracies than the non-specific models.

Most existing methods for network representation adopt shallow models which have relatively limited capacity to capture highly non-linear network structures, resulting in sub-optimal network representations. Therefore, it is nontrivial to explore how to effectively capture highly non-linear network structure and preserve the global and local structure in NRL. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a new graph convolutional autoencoder architecture based on a depth-based representation of graph structure, referred to as the depth-based subgraph convolutional autoencoder (DS-CAE), which integrates both the global topological and local connectivity structures within a graph. Our idea is to first decompose a graph into a family of K-layer expansion subgraphs rooted at each vertex aimed at better capturing long-range vertex inter-dependencies. Then a set of convolution filters slide over the entire sets of subgraphs of a vertex to extract the local structural connectivity information. This is analogous to the standard convolution operation on grid data. In contrast to most existing models for unsupervised learning on graph-structured data, our model can capture highly non-linear structure by simultaneously integrating node features and network structure into network representation learning.

The proposed CNN adopts a modified Inception-v3 architecture to provide efficient feature extraction in ABUS imaging. Because the ABUS images can be visualized in transverse and coronal views, the proposed CNN provides an efficient way to extract multiview features from both views. The proposed CNN was trained and evaluated on 316 breast lesions (135 malignant and 181 benign). An observer performance test was conducted to compare five human reviewers' diagnostic performance before and after referring to the predicting outcomes of the proposed CNN. Our method achieved an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.9468 with five-folder cross-validation, for which the sensitivity and specificity were 0.886 and 0.876, respectively. Compared with conventional machine learning-based feature extraction schemes, particularly principal component analysis (PCA) and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), our method achieved a significant improvement in classification performance. The proposed CNN achieved a >10% increased AUC value compared with PCA and HOG. During the observer performance test, the diagnostic results of all human reviewers had increased AUC values and sensitivities after referring to the classification results of the proposed CNN, and four of the five human reviewers\u2019 AUCs were significantly improved.

Patients and Methods: 277 LACC patients treated with NACT followed by surgery/radiotherapy were included in this multi-institution retrospective study. 1294 radiomic features were extracted from venous contrast enhanced and non-enhanced CT imaging for each patient. Five combined methods of feature selection were used to reduce dimension of features. Radiomics signature was constructed by Random Forest (RF) method in a primary cohort of 221 patients. A combined model incorporating radiomics signature with clinical factors was developed using multivariable logistic regression. Prediction performance was then tested in a validation cohort of 56 patients. Results: Radiomics signature containing pre and post contrast imaging features can adequately distinguish chemotherapeutic responders from non-responders in both primary and validation cohorts [AUCs: 0.773 (95% CI, 0.701-0.845) and 0.816 (95% CI, 0.690-0.942), respectively].

Numerous enzymes have been found and characterized according to their functions and/or three-dimensional structures. Directed Evolution (DE) is a field of research in biocatalysis, where mutations are made in the sequence of a native or what can be called a wild-type enzyme. These mutations are made at random, with the purpose of finding an alternate sequence or a variant to the wild-type enzyme, which shows an improvement over it for a specific property. The sequence space of an enzyme refers to all the possible variants, which can be created from it. Due to an immensely large number of such sequences, making mutations at random is definitely not an optimal strategy. However, due to the absence of a proper understanding of how the sequence of a protein translates into its function, or a sequence-to-function map, DE is usually the only available option. ::: In this thesis, a computational approach to improving the process of DE is presented, which involves using machine learning algorithms. When any enzyme is subjugated to DE, a large number of its variants are created, which are analyzed through high-throughput screening methods. The screening results provide us the measure of the property of interest, like catalytic activity towards a specific reaction, for each of these variants. This data can be utilized to search for patterns in the sequence space, which can lead us to an understanding of how the function is related to an enzyme's sequence. However, the critical limitation to this approach is the scarcity to data because sequencing the created variants is a sizeable task and only a relatively small number can be expected to be available. Most machine learning methods, on the other hand, usually required a large number of examples in the data set. To circumvent this constraint, a simplifying assumption was made, whereby, each variant was divided into two classes---positive and negative. This criteria for this division can be selected based on the measured property of interest for the variant, according to the screening method. Such an assumption reduces the problem to a case of non-linear classification into binary classes. Efficient algorithms have been developed for such problems, which may be able to give pertinent results from the available data. ::: Chapters 1 and 2 of this thesis introduce the basic concepts of protein engineering and Directed Evolution. The suggested approach of using machine learning to analyze the sequence space of any protein or enzyme is described. Chapter 2 also provides background information on the different experimental procedures, which are performed during a DE process. It also mentions the research done in the field of applying different computational strategies to improve DE. Background is provided on the different machine learning algorithms, which were used with the data available from DE. ::: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a recently developed class of algorithms, which are primarily used for non-linear classification. An SVM was formulated to identify important amino acids in the sequence of a protein, which is described in Chapter 3. An important amino acid residue was defined as one, which, if mutated, will result in an inactive variant. The data used were the variant sequences containing random mutations created by using different protocols of DE. Based on their screening, they were classified as positive, if they had any catalytic activity, or negative, if they had none. This algorithm was applied to the TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase sequence. The reason for this choice was the availability of known significant amino acid residues for the TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase sequence, which were found through extensive experiments. In silico or computer-generated variants were created by simulating the different protocols of DE. It was shown that the SVM can efficiently identify such residues from relatively small number (of the order of 102) of variant sequences. ::: Chapter 4 extends the framework described in Chapter 3 to identify pairs of amino acids, which interact with each other. Only interactions that contribute significantly to the function or structural stability of the protein need to be identified. Boolean Learning, which is another class of machine learning problems, was used for this purpose. The specific algorithm used was called OCAT (One Clause At a Time). The data assumed in this case were the variant sequence created specifically from the recombinant protocols (described in Chapter 2) of DE. The definition for positive and negative variants were catalytically active or inactive respectively. It was shown through simulations that the OCAT algorithm can identify the interacting pairs in the sequence. This result was also shown to be independent of where the individual amino acids, involved in the interaction, exist in the primary sequence of the protein. A novel way of combining the OCAT algorithm with SVMs was also introduced. It was shown that the results obtained for the combination of these two algorithms, which was referred to as BLSVM, were better than OCAT alone. It was also suggested that the results obtained by using these algorithms on the variants generated in one round of DE can help improve the fraction of active or positive variants in the subsequent rounds. This was done by not permitting any mutations to occur in the amino acids, which interact with each other. ::: To show the applicability of the algorithm described in Chapter 4, an experimental study is presented in Chapter 5. Two fluorescent proteins---mRFP and DsRed---were subjected to different recombinant protocols and 83 unique variants were generated. The positive variants were defined as ones that fluoresce with at least 10% of the intensity of the two parent enzymes. Using the OCAT algorithm on these sequences, a pair of possibly interacting residues was identified. The three-dimensional structure of DsRed showed that these two residues were very close to each other and were also close to the chromophore, which imparts the fluorescence to the two parent enzymes. The interaction between these residues was experimentally confirmed with the help of point mutations. The claim that this result can help increase the fraction active sequences in the variants of subsequent rounds, was also justified by doing further recombinant experiments where the two identified amino acids were not allowed to be mutated. The results showed close to 20% improvement in the fraction positive variants when compared with the recombinant variants of the two parent sequences. ::: On analyzing the variants created in Chapter 5, it was observed that often the screening procedure can give erroneous results. Thus, there is a finite probability of misclassifying a variant, which is known as classification error of classification noise. Unfortunately, the OCAT algorithm, which was used in Chapters 4 and 5 is highly sensitive to classification noise and does not perform well. Thus, an alternate algorithm was presented in Chapter 6, which was derived from OCAT but is tolerant to classification noise. This algorithm, which was termed Modified OCAT or mOCAT, was theoretically analyzed. Using the PAC learning theory for Boolean Learning, it was shown that mOCAT is efficient and can be used for sample sets with classification noise less than 50%. An expression was developed for the number of examples required, which will ensure that the learning is going to be accurate. mOCAT was simulated for the same problem, which was described in Chapter 4. It was shown that in the presence of classification noise, mOCAT can outperform, not only OCAT, but also another existing algorithm. ::: In conclusion, Chapter 7 provides the significant findings and overall achievements of this thesis.

We can further improve the performance of determining the number of spoofing attackers using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) method to accurately predict the number of attackers. In addition, we developed an integrated detection and localization system that can localize the positions of multiple attackers. Two test beds like 802.11 (WiFi) network and an 802.15.4 (ZigBee) network are be used to evaluate our techniques.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2181759410", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:40431862"}

The bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) model with partition learning is incorporated into the system to extract informative features for representing the image contents. Furthermore, a distance metric learning algorithm called the Rank Error-based Metric Learning (REML) is proposed to reduce the semantic gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic concepts. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on a brain T1-weighted CE-MR dataset with three types of brain tumors (i.e., meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumor). Using the BoVW model with partition learning, the mean average precision (mAP) of retrieval increases beyond 4.6% with the learned distance metrics compared with the spatial pyramid BoVW method. The distance metric learned by REML significantly outperforms three other existing distance metric learning methods in terms of mAP. The mAP of the CBIR system is as high as 91.8% using the proposed method, and the precision can reach 93.1% when the top 10 images are returned by the system.

First, the events of the ECG signal are detected and delineated using a robust wavelet-based algorithm. Then, using Binary Neyman-Pearson Radius test, an appropriate classifier is designed to categorize ventricular complexes into \"Normal + Premature Atrial Contraction (PAC)\" and \"Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC)\" beats. Afterwards, an innovative measure is defined based on wavelet transform of the delineated P-wave namely as P-Wave Strength Factor (PSF) used for the evaluation of the P-wave power. Finally, ventricular contractions pursuing weak P-waves are categorized as PAC complexes; however, those ensuing strong P-waves are specified as normal complexes. The discriminant quality of the PSF-based feature space was evaluated by a modified learning vector quantization (MLVQ) classifier trained with the original QRS complexes and corresponding Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) dyadic scale. Also, performance of the proposed Neyman-Pearson Classifier (NPC) is compared with the MLVQ and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers using a common feature space. The processing speed of the proposed algorithm is more than 176,000 samples/sec showing desirable heart arrhythmia classification performance. The performance of the proposed two-lead NPC algorithm is compared with MLVQ and SVM classifiers and the obtained results indicate the validity of the proposed method. To justify the newly defined feature space (\u03c3i1, \u03c3i2, PSFi), a NPC with the proposed feature space and a MLVQ classification algorithm trained with the original complex and its corresponding DWT as well as RR interval are considered and their performances were compared with each other. An accuracy difference about 0.15% indicates acceptable discriminant quality of the properly selected feature elements. The proposed algorithm was applied to holter data of the DAY general hospital (more than 1,500,000 beats) and the average values of Se = 99.73% and P+ = 99.58% were achieved for sensitivity and positive predictivity, respectively.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "iranian journal of electrical and electronic engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2134904400", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["1575291", "68549389", "29385371", "17962867", "11107886", "19355955", "2050335", "58491922", "18117141", "18186570", "26605818", "10898035", "21883482", "37340179", "7051427", "35552643", "21555773", "7295102", "7832643", "6983696", "14081296", "7729507", "7728183", "23271977", "29385371", "41104519", "3032933", "22650954", "16587529", "28823666", "206764015", "54497001", "982541", "22522813", "7153167", "8980911", "10226710", "5573324", "28590716", "28088473", "61648077", "62755830", "2863817", "6498483", "32539424", "44708240", "27712754", "119650550", "7165567"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54977525"}

And we make a combined dataset and on this combined dataset we apply several supervised techniques to find the actual estimated cost and the accuracy of several techniques. In this paper three supervised techniques are used like as K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and Least Squared Support Vector Machine. It is a comparative study which tells the accuracy of training proposed model and error rate. The accuracy of training model should be higher and error rate should be minimum. And the proposed model is able to give the actual cost of estimated crop yield and it is label like as LOW, MID, and HIGH.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Advance Research, Ideas and Innovations in Technology", "mag_id": "2992390234", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213448229"}

We design an argumentation framework named Arena as a communication platform for knowledge integration. Through argumentation based joint learning, high quality individual knowledge can be extracted, and thus a refined global knowledge base can be generated and used independently for classification.

Molecular level investigation of the basis for OGT's substrate specificity should aid understanding how O-GlcNAc contributes to diverse cellular processes. Due to an increasing number of O-GlcNAcylated peptides with site-specific information identified by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, we were motivated to characterize substrate site motifs of O-GlcNAc transferases. In this investigation, a non-redundant dataset of 410 experimentally verified O-GlcNAcylation sites were manually extracted from dbOGAP, OGlycBase and UniProtKB. After detection of conserved motifs by using maximal dependence decomposition, profile hidden Markov model (profile HMM) was adopted to learn a first-layered model for each identified OGT substrate motif. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was then used to generate a second-layered model learned from the output values of profile HMMs in first layer. The two-layered predictive model was evaluated using a five-fold cross validation which yielded a sensitivity of 85.4%, a specificity of 84.1%, and an accuracy of 84.7%. Additionally, an independent testing set from PhosphoSitePlus, which was really non-homologous to the training data of predictive model, was used to demonstrate that the proposed method could provide a promising accuracy (84.05%) and outperform other O-GlcNAcylation site prediction tools.

Here the coupled machine learning based FE model is found to reduce the computational time and cost significantly without compromising the accuracy of results. In the stochastic approach, both individual and compound effect of depth-wise source-uncertainty in material properties of FGM shells are considered taking into account the influences of different critical parameters such as the power-law exponent, temperature, thickness and variation of shell geometries. A moment-independent sensitivity analysis is carried out to enumerate the relative significance of different random input parameters considering depth-wise variation and collectively. The presented numerical results clearly indicate that it is imperative to take into account the relative stochastic deviations (including their probabilistic characterization) of the global dynamic characteristics for different shell geometries to ensure adequate safety and serviceability of the system while having an economical structural design.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.111870", "venue": null, "journal": "Composite Structures", "mag_id": "3000364171", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213541671"}

Recent efforts have now started investigating their utility for diagnosis purposes. This line of research has shown promising results where methods from machine learning (such as Support Vector Machines) have been used to identify AD-related patterns from images, for use in diagnosing new individual subjects. In this paper, we propose a new framework for AD classification which makes use of the Linear Program (LP) boosting with novel additional regularization based on spatial \u201csmoothness\u201d in 3D image coordinate spaces. The algorithm formalizes the expectation that since the examples for training the classifier are images, the voxels eventually selected for specifying the decision boundary must constitute spatially contiguous chunks, i.e., \u201cregions\u201d must be preferred over isolated voxels. This prior belief turns out to be useful for significantly reducing the space of possible classifiers and leads to substantial benefits in generalization. In our method, the requirement of spatial contiguity (of selected discriminating voxels) is incorporated within the optimization framework directly. Other methods have made use of similar biases as a pre- or post-processing step, however, our model incorporates this emphasis on spatial smoothness directly into the learning step.

One of the major advantages of using these satellite data is that the data are free with very good temporal resolution; while, one drawback is that these have low spatial resolution (i.e., approximately 1.1 km at nadir). Therefore, it is important to do research by applying some efficient optimization techniques along with the image analysis techniques to rectify these drawbacks and use satellite images for efficient hotspot detection and monitoring. For this purpose, SVM and multi-threshold techniques are explored for hotspot detection. The multi-threshold algorithm is developed to remove the cloud coverage from the land coverage. This algorithm also highlights the hotspots or fire spots in the suspected regions. SVM has the advantage over multi-thresholding technique that it can learn patterns from the examples and therefore is used to optimize the performance by removing the false points which are highlighted in the threshold technique. Both approaches can be used separately or in combination depending on the size of the image. The RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel is used in training of three sets of inputs: brightness temperature of channel 3, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Global Environment Monitoring Index (GEMI), respectively. This makes a classified image in the output that highlights the hotspot and non-hotspot pixels. The performance of the SVM is also compared with the performance obtained from the neural networks and SVM appears to detect hotspots more accurately (greater than 91% classification accuracy) with lesser false alarm rate. The results obtained are found to be in good agreement with the ground based observations of the hotspots.

In this paper, for the purpose of improve prediction accuracy of air pollutant concentration, a deep neural network model with multitask learning (MTL-DBN-DNN), pretrained by a deep belief network (DBN), is proposed for forecasting of nonlinear systems and tested on the forecast of air quality time series. MTL-DBN-DNN model can solve several related prediction tasks at the same time by using shared information contained in the training data of different tasks. In the model, DBN is used to learn feature representations. Each unit in the output layer is connected to only a subset of units in the last hidden layer of DBN. Such connection effectively avoids the problem that fully connected networks need to juggle the learning of each task while being trained, so that the trained networks cannot get optimal prediction accuracy for each task. The sliding window is used to take the recent data to dynamically adjust the parameters of the MTL-DBN-DNN model. The MTL-DBN-DNN model is evaluated with a dataset from Microsoft Research.

In this paper we propose to utilize deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract high level features from raw data and show that they are effective for speech emotion recognition. We first produce an emotion state probability distribution for each speech segment using DNNs. We then construct utterance-level features from segment-level probability distributions. These utterancelevel features are then fed into an extreme learning machine (ELM), a special simple and efficient single-hidden-layer neural network, to identify utterance-level emotions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively learns emotional information from low-level features and leads to 20% relative accuracy improvement compared to the stateof-the-art approaches.

In this method, we used a new neighborhood shape for obtaining LBP as its representation of texture is superior than traditional LBP. We compute the proposed LBP on each non-overlapping blocks of a face image and a histogram of these LBPs is computed.

{"paper_id": "26736998", "title": "Scaling Conditional Random Fields for Natural Language Processing", "authors": [{"first": "Trevor", "middle": [], "last": "Cohn", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This thesis deals with the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs; Lafferty et al. (2001)) for Natural Language Processing (NLP). CRFs are probabilistic models for sequence labelling which are particularly well suited to NLP. They have many compelling advantages over other popular models such as HiddenMarkovModels andMaximum Entropy Markov Models (Rabiner, 1990; McCallum et al., 2001), and have been applied to a number of NLP tasks with considerable success (e.g., Sha and Pereira (2003) and Smith et al. (2005)). Despite their apparent success, CRFs suffer from two main failings. Firstly, they often over-fit the training sample. This is a consequence of their considerable expressive power, and can be limited by a prior over the model parameters (Sha and Pereira, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004). Their second failing is that the standard methods for CRF training are often very slow, sometimes requiring weeks of processing time. This efficiency problem is largely ignored in current literature, although in practise the cost of training prevents the application of CRFs to many new more complex tasks, and also prevents the use of densely connected graphs, whichwould allow formuch richer feature sets. This thesis addresses the issue of training efficiency. Firstly, we demonstrate that the asymptotic time complexity of standard training for a linear chain CRF is quadratic in the size of the label set, linear in the number of features and almost quadratic in the size of the training sample. The cost of inference in cyclic graphs, such as lattice structured Dynamic CRFs (Sutton et al., 2004), is even greater. The complexity of training limits the application of CRFs to large and complex tasks. We compare the accuracy of a number of popular approximate training techniques, which can greatly reduce the training cost. However, for most tasks this saving is coupled with a substantial loss in accuracy. For this reason we propose two novel training methods, which both reduce the resource requirements and improve the scalability of training, such that CRFs can be applied to substantially larger tasks. The first method uses error-correcting output coding, a method originally devised for classifier combination (Freund and Schapire, 1996). This method decomposes the task of training a multiclass CRF (modelling a problem with three or more labels) into a series of simpler binary labelling tasks. Each of these sub-tasks are modelled with a CRF and are trained in the standard manner. Overall, these constituent models are considerably faster to train than a full multiclass CRF; critically, this can also reduce the complexity of training. Once trained these constituent models can be combined to decode unlabelled test instances and this results in similar accuracy to standard training. We introduce a second alternative training method which uses feature constraints to improve the time cost of inference. These constraints tie groups of features in the model which are exploited in sum-product and max-product belief propagation (Pearl, 1988). This leads to faster training and decoding. Overall, even simple tying strategies", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "196969749", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["1133965", "14871180", "212434175", "18532502", "7582119", "1139733", "17482423", "8211418", "18531843", "33858820", "8292557", "7562019", "15205419", "18874775", "5974948", "63937571", "6816078", "23940455", "15348857", "2258964"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26736998"}

In this variant, the gambler is only told whether the optimal arm lies to the \u201cleft\u201d or to the \u201cright\u201d of the one pulled, with the feedback being erroneous with probability 1 \u2212 p. Our novel scheme for this problem is based on a Bayesian representation of the solution space, and combines this representation with Thompson sampling to balance exploration against exploitation. Furthermore, we introduce the possibility of traitorous environments that lie about the direction of the optimal arm (adversarial learning problem). Empirical results show that our scheme deals with both traitorous and non-traitorous environments, significantly outperforming competing algorithms.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-23868-5_22", "venue": "AIAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2395860274", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52299396", "14571004"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:39557989"}

In this model, a set of 836 odorants described by 184 chemical properties is used to span a virtual chemical space. A set of virtual receptors, i.e. codebook vectors moving in this space, is then trained using a self-organizing map [2], mimicking sensor evolution with the assumption that the receptors are tuned to represent the chemical space as good as possible. It has been shown that this architecture is less sensitive to the network size when using lateral inhibition as a pattern processing method. Furthermore, in this work the activity patterns show a nice similarity to well-known experimental recordings of bulbar activity in rodents [3]. ::: ::: Historically, the idea of SOMs is biologically motivated by the topology conserving structure as it is well-known for the somatotopic organization of the cerebrum. On the other hand, if the data really is high-dimensional, i.e. the intrinsic dimension is >>2D \u2013 unlike the almost 2D organization of the skin \u2013 then we will have strong topological defects on the map. In this case, the chemical space is 184-dimensional (the number of properties used) \u2013 far more complex than the 2D SOM. SOMs have the benefit that they can learn topologies in high-dimensions and still are very easily displayed in 2D, as all the virtual receptors are lying independently of the input space in a fixed 2D-grid. But without doubt, better visibility is not a fitness criterion likely to be found in the chemotopic evolution of odorant receptors. ::: ::: Other topology conserving algorithms are known to be much better suited to learn such high-dimensional topologies, like e.g. Neural Gas [4], a soft-competitive learner that learns the chemical space position of the virtual receptors similar to the SOM. But the neighborhood relations are not based on a fixed receptor grid but rather dependent on the receptor similarities in the chemical space. The net\u2019s connectivity during sensor evolution is induced using a Hebbian-like learning of co-activation by the virtual receptors. ::: ::: We will discuss in this work the differences of the NG-tuned compared against the SOM-tuned virtual receptors for the following aspects: classification performance, topology conserving properties, scalability of the architecture, and the effect of insect-like pattern processing by lateral inhibition. Just the same, we propose that NG is better suited to learn the topology, i.e. mimic the evolutionary tuning of the virtual receptors, while SOMs are very useful in providing a visual interface for bulbus-like display of odorant stimulation images. ::: ::: As an outlook, we want to motivate how one could check not only for topological defects in the given chemical space but also check for experimental data. E.g. is there a correlation between experimental uptake images as published by Johnson & Leon [3] and one of the proposed sets of virtual receptors? Is there something we can learn about the tuning strategies of the olfactory system?", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3240396", "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1186/1471-2202-12-S1-P286", "venue": "BMC Neuroscience", "journal": "BMC Neuroscience", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2137909307", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2483975", "198120309", "13402642"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7443419"}

Currently, no tests are available that predict at early stage who will develop asthma and who will be a transient wheezer. Diagnostic tests of asthma are reliable in adults but the same tests are difficult to use in children, because they are invasive and require active cooperation of the patient. A non-invasive alternative is needed for children. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) excreted in breath could yield such non-invasive and patient-friendly diagnostic. The aim of this study was to identify VOCs in the breath of preschool children (inclusion at age 2\u20134 years) that indicate preclinical asthma. For that purpose we analyzed the total array of exhaled VOCs with Gas Chromatography time of flight Mass Spectrometry of 252 children between 2 and 6 years of age. Breath samples were collected at multiple time points of each child. Each breath-o-gram contained between 300 and 500 VOCs; in total 3256 different compounds were identified across all samples. Using two multivariate methods, Random Forests and dissimilarity Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, we were able to select a set of 17 VOCs which discriminated preschool asthmatic children from transient wheezing children. The correct prediction rate was equal to 80% in an independent test set. These VOCs are related to oxidative stress caused by inflammation in the lungs and consequently lipid peroxidation.

Conventional methods typically utilize the \u201cslack\u201d spatial-temporal model to locally ensure the smoothness of the computed video saliency, yet they could easily encounter the performance tradeoff dilemma (i.e., detection\u2019 accuracy and integrity). In contrast, our novel approach proposes the bilevel learning strategy to globally exploit the saliency consistency while overcoming the aforementioned difficulty. Our method first starts with the contrast computation of low-level saliency clues in a frame-wise manner. Then, based on such obtained saliency clues, we devise a novel bilevel Markov Random Field (bMRF) solution to conduct semantic labelling, which can explicitly indicates both the salient salient foregrounds and nonsalient nearby surroundings with high confidence while shrinking the low confidence remains. In such a way, the spatial-temporal consistency constraint is embedded intrinsically into the above explicit semantic labels, and we prevent the performance tradeoff problem from occurring. Next, based on those semantic labels made by our bMRF method, we further propose learnng multiple nonlinear feature transformations to enlarge the feature margin between the salient foregrounds and the non-salient nearby surroundings, whose key rationale is to resort to long-term common consistencies to enforce the spatial-temporal smoothness. Thus, we can utilize these learned non-linear feature transformations to simultaneously suppress those short-term false-alarms and correct those hollow effects. To validate our new approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five publicly available benchmarks, and make comprehensive, quantitative evaluations between our method and 17 state-of-the-art techniques.

That being said, the data still includes relatively small numbers of samples and tens of thousands of variables/gene expression. A variety of different approaches have been developed for searching these gene spaces in order to select the most informative variables that can accurately distinguish one class of subjects/ samples from another. However, there is still a need for new approaches that can accurately distinguish biologically different classes of subjects with similar gene expression profiles. We describe a new and promising approach for selecting the most informative differentially expressed genes that addresses this problem. We describe a method for identifying significant differentially expressed clusters of genes using a process of Recursive Cluster Elimination (RCE) that is based on an ensemble clustering approach. We refer to this approach as SVM-RCE-EC (Ensemble Clustering). We show that SVM-RCE-EC improves gene selection, classification accuracy as compared to other methods including the traditional SVM-RCE approach, and that this is particularly evident when applied to difficult data sets that are poorly resolved by other approaches. ::: Methods: To implement SVM-RCE-EC we first applied an ensemble-clustering method, to identify robust gene clusters. We then applied Support Vector Machines (SVMs), with cross validation to score (rank) those clusters of genes based on their contributions to classification accuracy. The clusters of genes that are least significant are progressively removed by the procedure of RCE with the most significant clusters being retained until one identifies the most robust, significantly differentially expressed genes between the two classes. We compare the classification performance of SVM-RCE-EC to a variety of published classification algorithms. ::: Results and Conclusion: Utilization of gene clusters selected using the ensemble method enhances classification performance as compared to other methods and identifies sets of significant genes that appear to be more biologically meaningful to the system being analyzed. We show that SVM-RCE-EC outperforms several other methods on data that represent highly similar sample classes that are difficult to distinguish and is comparable to other methods when applied to data where the classes are more easily separated. The improved performance of SVM-RCE-EC on difficult data sets is likely due to the fact that the significant clusters, as determined by the ensemble approach, capture the native structure of the data while SVM-RCE leaves that determination to the user. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that the performance of the clusters generated by SVM-RCE-EC is more robust. ::: Availability: The Matlab version of SVM-RCE-EC is available upon request to the first author and at GitHub (https://github.com/malikyousef/svm-rce-ec).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4172/jpb.1000439", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Proteomics & Bioinformatics", "mag_id": "2756338890", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67197088"}

To this aim, a split function considering the uniform property of the LBP feature is developed to move sample blocks to the left or the right children nodes.

Learning and validation of the multiclass model is performed using the correspondences between MSG satellite data and radar data. To do this, six classifiers were first combined in order to exploit the full potential of each of these classifiers. These are Random Forest (RF1), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayesian (NB), Weighted k-Nearest Neighbors (WkNN), and the Kmeans ++ algorithm (Kmeans). The application of these classifiers makes it possible to carry out a classification at level 1. A pixel can therefore be assigned to more than one class by the different classifiers. We calculated six certainty coefficients from these classification results. To refine these results, in a second step, a classification at level 2 was performed using the Random Forest classifier (RF2) taking the certainty coefficients as input parameters. Six classes of precipitation intensities are thus obtained: very high precipitation intensities, moderate to high precipitation intensities, moderate precipitation intensities, light to moderate precipitation intensities, light precipitation intensities and no rain. Comparisons between the results of the multi-classifiers model and those obtained by the classifiers used separately show a clear improvement in the quality of classification. Using multiple linear regressions, precipitation rates for the different classes were determined using data from the rain gauges. To validate the model, precipitation amounts were estimated and compared to actual rain gauge data and then compared to the results of a few precipitation estimation methods. The results are very interesting and show superior performance for the elaborated model. Indeed, the coefficient of correlation has a value of 0.93 for developed scheme against 0.46 to 90 for the different techniques presented here for comparison.

Conventional methods in dealing with missing values usually employ estimation and imputation approaches whose efficiency is tied to the assumptions of data features. Recently, algorithm of surrogate decisions in RF was developed and this paper proposes a random forests algorithm with modified surrogate splits (Adjusted Weight Voting Random Forest, AWVRF) which is able to address the incomplete data without imputation.Differing from the present surrogate method, in AWVRF algorithm, when the primary splitting attribute and the surrogate attributes of an internal node are all missing, the undergoing instance is allowed to exit at the current node with a vote. Then the weight of the vote is adjusted by the strength of the involved attributes and the final decision is made by weighted voting. AWVRF does not comprise imputation step, thus it is independent of data features.AWVRF is compared with the methods of mean imputation, LeoFill, knnimpute, BPCAfill and conventional RF with surrogate decisions (surrRF) using 50 times repeated 5-fold cross validation on 10 acknowledged datasets. In a total of 22 experiment settings, the method of AWVRF harvests the highest accuracy in 14 settings and the largest AUC in 7 settings, exhibiting its superiority over other methods.

For this, we present a Social Regularized Collaborative Metric Learning model (SRCML) for item recommendation.

To obtain insights into the history of this relict biota, we modelled the spatial distribution of habitats during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Russian Altai. We prepared a map of the current vegetation of this area based on the ground-truthed remote sensing data, and modelled the distribution of the current vegetation types using the Random Forest technique with climatic predictors. The models were projected onto the CCSM3 model of the LGM climate for the Russian Altai and interpreted for 72% of its area because the remaining part is supposed to have been glaciated during the LGM. The models projected LGM predominance of desert-steppe across most of the non-glaciated area of the Russian Altai, probably associated with areas of typical steppe, tundra grasslands and some other habitat types, including forest patches in stream valleys. It is likely that during the LGM, these habitats supported the cold-adapted open-landscape biota. In the Holocene, most of the previous grassland area changed into forest or forest-steppe and the Pleistocene biota retreated, with the exception of the Chuya Basin and the Ukok Plateau in the southeast, where the habitat change was very small and desert-steppe and associated vegetation types remained preserved. This refugial area is currently rich in the relict Pleistocene species. A different history was suggested for the precipitation-rich area in the northernmost Altai (north of Lake Teletskoye), where the LGM models suggested occurrence of patches of open forest of Larix sibirica and Pinus sibirica in forest-tundra and forest-steppe landscapes. These forests may have provided the LGM refugium for the temperate forest species that currently occur in this precipitation-rich area.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.07.037", "venue": null, "journal": "Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1055857568", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["128822975", "82937772", "129033255", "130269317", "89141", "60993494", "3626971", "90677687", "85131287", "40960434", "18497479", "85890145", "85599753", "84899653", "83557980", "18278352", "128444930", "85648250", "128630181", "128588136", "129289692", "128480762", "86176790", "129767666", "41096227", "6823681", "140575374", "83805256"], "inbound_citations": ["189763667", "211133554", "215432568", "90182604", "134584036", "89724969", "3273996", "46978485"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126883093"}

A general neural network with multiple hidden layers for extracting useful speech features is first trained with pooled, training data, and then phone-dependent, 2-class logistic regression classifiers are trained as individual, phoneme specific nodes at the output layer. This new NN-based classifier with shared hidden layers streamlines the time-consuming work needed in training multiple individual classifiers separately, i.e., one for a specific phoneme, and learns common feature representation via the shared hidden layers.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is recently emerging as a powerful tool for prostate cancer diagnosis. To clinically diagnose prostate cancer, doctors need to segment the prostate area in the MR image. However, manual segmentation is time consuming and influenced by the physician\u2019s experience. Computer-aided diagnosis and decision-making systems have shown great effectiveness in assisting doctors for this purpose. At the same time, deep learning based on Generative Adversarial Networks can be applied to the segmentation of prostate MR images. In this paper, we propose a new computer-aided diagnosis and decision-making system based on a deep learning model to automatically segment the prostate region from prostate MR images. Additionally, receptive field block (RFB) was integrated into the model to enhance the discriminability and robustness of the extracted multi-scale features. We also introduced dense upsampling convolution instead of the traditional bilinear interpolation to capture and recover fine-detailed information.

During the last two decades, the kernel idea itself has been extracted from SVM and is now widely studied as an independent subject. Essentially, kernel methods are nonlinear transformation techniques that take data from an input set to a high (possibly infinite) dimensional vector space, called the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), in which linear models can be applied. The original input set could be data from different domains and applications, such as tweets, ratings of movies, images, medical measurements, etc. The two spaces are connected by a Positive-Semi Definite (PSD) kernel function and all computations in the RKHS are evaluated on the low dimensional input set using the kernel function. ::: ::: Kernel methods are proven to be efficient on various applications. However, the computational complexity of most kernel algorithms typically grows cubically, or at least quadratically, with respect to the training size. This is due to the fact that a Gram kernel matrix needs to be constructed and/or inverted. To improve the scalability for large-scale training, kernel approximation techniques are employed, where the kernel matrix is assumed to have a low-rank structure. Essentially, this is equivalent to assuming a subspace model spanned by a subset of the training data in the RKHS. The task is hence to estimate the subspace with respect to some criteria, such as the reconstruction error, the discriminative power for classification tasks, etc. ::: ::: Based on these motivations, this thesis focuses on the development of scalable kernel techniques for supervised classification problems. Inspired by the idea of the subspace classifier and kernel clustering models, we have proposed the CLAss-specific Subspace Kernel (CLASK) representation, where class-specific kernel functions are applied and individual subspaces can be constructed accordingly. In this thesis work, an automatic model selection technique is proposed to choose the best multiple kernel functions for each class based on a criterion using the subspace projection distance. Moreover, subset selection and transformation techniques using CLASK are developed to further reduce the model complexity with an enhanced discriminative power for kernel approximation and classification. Furthermore, we have also proposed both a parallel and a sequential framework to tackle large-scale learning problems.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2535206775", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125201058"}

Segmenting these signals, extracting features to obtain the important properties of the signal and classification are key aspects of detecting epileptic seizures. Despite the introduction of several techniques, it is very challenging when multiple EEG channels are involved. When many channels exist, a spatial filter is required to eliminate noise and extract relevant information. This adds a new dimension of complexity to the frequency feature space. In order to stabilize the classifier of the channels, feature selection is very important. Furthermore, and to improve the performance of a classifier, more data is required from EEG channels for complex problems. The increase of such data poses some challenges as it becomes difficult to identify the subject dependent bands when the channels increase. Hence, an automated process is required for such identification. The proposed approach in this work tends to tackle the multiple EEG channels problem by segmenting the EEG signals in the frequency domain based on changing spikes rather than the traditional time based windowing approach. While to reduce the overall dimensionality and preserve the class-dependent features an optimization approach is used. This process of selecting an optimal feature subset is an optimization problem. Thus, we propose an adaptive multi-parent crossover Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimizing the features used in classifying epileptic seizures. The GA-based approach is used to optimize the various features obtained. It encodes the temporal and spatial filter estimates and optimize the feature selection with respect to the classification error. The classification was done using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed technique was evaluated using the publicly available epileptic seizure data from the machine learning repository of the UCI center for machine learning and intelligent systems. The proposed approach outperforms other ones and achieved a high level of accuracy. These results, indicate the ability of a multi-parent crossover GA in optimizing the feature selection process in EEG classification.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2018.11.012", "venue": "Appl.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce an experimental contribution in the direction of multi-script off-line signature identification and verification using a novel technique involving off-line English, Hindi (Devnagari) and Bangla (Bengali) signatures. In the first evaluation stage of the proposed signature verification technique, the performance of a multi-script off-line signature verification system, considering a joint dataset of English, Hindi and Bangla signatures, was investigated. In the second stage of experimentation, multi-script signatures were identified based on the script type, and subsequently the verification task was explored separately for English, Hindi and Bangla signatures based on the identified script result. The gradient and chain code features were employed, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) along with the Modified Quadratic Discriminate Function (MQDF) were considered in this scheme. From the experimental results achieved, it is noted that the verification accuracy obtained in the second stage of experiments (where a signature script identification method was introduced) is better than the verification accuracy produced following the first stage of experiments.
