Most methods applied in the past to predict business failure in non-life insurance companies are traditional statistical techniques, which use financial ratios as explicative variables. However, these variables do not usually satisfy statistical assumptions, what complicates the application of the mentioned methods. Emergent statistical learning methods like neural networks or SVMs provide a successful approach in terms of error rate, but their character of black-box methods make the obtained results difficult to be interpreted and discussed. In this paper, we propose an approach to predict insolvency of non-life insurance companies based on the application of genetic programming (GP). GP is a class of evolutionary algorithms, which operates by codifying the solution of the problem as a population of LISP trees. This type of algorithm provides a diagnosis output in the form of a decision tree with given functions and data. We can treat it like a computer program which returns an answer depending on the input, and, more importantly, the tree can potentially be inspected, interpreted and re-used for different data sets. We have compared the performance of GP with other classifiers approaches, a Support Vector Machine and a Rough Set algorithm. The final purpose is to create an automatic diagnostic system for analysing non-insurance firms using their financial ratios as explicative variables.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cor.2003.08.015", "venue": "Comput.

Firstly, the wavelet coefficients of event related potential (ERP) in delta, theta, alpha and beta bands are extracted as useful features of brain activity responded to different stimulus information. Next, a Fisher discriminant criterion is applied to reduce the feature vector dimensions. Finally, a SVM classifier is employed to classify the data and the leave-one-out cross validation method is used for accuracy assessment. For the evaluation of the method, 16 subjects went through the designed CIT paradigm and their respective brain signals were recorded. The experimental results show that SVM classifier can effectively differentiate between concealed information and irrelevant information, and it achieves the maximum classification accuracy of 90.63%.

Accuracy of the system is enhanced by calculating the flexion angle of the head through the utilization of a microcontroller and flex sensors. In case of rotated face images, the face can be rotated back to zero degrees through the flexion angle calculation.

Comprehension of cerebral processes is made by means of data obtained through several techniques such as: electrocorticography, magnetoencephalography, functional and structural imaging, and electroencephalography (EEG).

However, recording of cerebral information through EEG is affected by different artifactual sources, which influence their posterior data processing. Inside non-cerebral sources, the potentials caused by ocular movements during tracking and fixing tasks have the greatest impact. For this reason, a procedure to identify and subtract the ocular artifacts from EEG signals is needed. In this work, an automatic method to remove artifacts is presented. The algorithm is compounded of four main stages: a) the separation of the EEG and artifacts sources by means of Independent Component Analysis (ICA); b) the characterization of the EEG and artifact components using complexity features; c) the components classification through a Hybrid Support Vector Machine (SVM)-External clustering; and d) the reconstruction of the EEG free of artifacts.

In this paper, we propose a novel yet simple unsupervised video summarization method with attentive conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Firstly, we build our framework upon Generative Adversarial Networks in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, the generator produces high-level weighted frame features and predicts frame-level importance scores, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between weighted frame features and raw frame features. Furthermore, we utilize a conditional feature selector to guide GAN model to focus on more important temporal regions of the whole video frames. Secondly, we are the first to introduce the frame-level multi-head self-attention for video summarization, which learns long-range temporal dependencies along the whole video sequence and overcomes the local constraints of recurrent units, e.g., LSTMs. Extensive evaluations on two datasets, SumMe and TVSum, show that our proposed framework surpasses state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin, and even outperforms most of the supervised methods.

There are several options for a modeller to consider, for example: the type of input data to be used, the length of model calibration (training) data and whether or not the input data be treated as signals with different frequency bands so that they can be modelled separately. This paper describes a new hybrid modelling scheme to answer the above mentioned questions. The proposed methodology is based on a hybrid model integrating wavelet transformation, a modelling engine (Artificial Neural Network) and the Gamma Test. First, the Gamma Test is used to decide the required input data dimensions and its length. Second, the wavelet transformation decomposes the input signals into different frequency bands. Finally, a modelling engine (ANN in this study) is used to model the decomposed signals separately. The proposed scheme was tested using the Brue catchment, Southwest England, as a case study and has produced very positive results. The hybrid model outperforms all other models tested. This study has a wider implication in the hydrological modelling field since its general framework could be applied to other model combinations (e.g., model engine could be Support Vector Machines, neuro-fuzzy systems, or even a conceptual model.

To overcome this problem, we present another approach to create ensembles that combines the existing ensemble methods with the kernel machine philosophy. In this approach, kernel features are created and concatenated with the original features. The classifiers of an ensemble are trained on these extended feature spaces.

Among these methods, classification-based tracking methods exhibit excellent performance while their speeds are heavily limited by the expensive computation for massive proposal feature extraction. In contrast, matching-based tracking methods (such as Siamese networks) possess remarkable speed superiority. However, the absence of online updating renders these methods unadaptable to significant object appearance variations. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time visual tracking method, which adopts an object-adaptive LSTM network to effectively capture the video sequential dependencies and adaptively learn the object appearance variations. For high computational efficiency, we also present a fast proposal selection strategy, which utilizes the matching-based tracking method to pre-estimate dense proposals and selects high-quality ones to feed to the LSTM network for classification. This strategy efficiently filters out some irrelevant proposals and avoids the redundant computation for feature extraction, which enables our method to operate faster than conventional classification-based tracking methods. In addition, to handle the problems of sample inadequacy and class imbalance during online tracking, we adopt a data augmentation technique based on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to facilitate the training of the LSTM network. Extensive experiments on four visual tracking benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method in terms of both tracking accuracy and speed, which exhibits great potentials of recurrent structures for visual tracking.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2002.02598", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2019.12.022", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3004688067,2995160632", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["14542261", "973101", "6583681", "15703426", "1188600", "10520310", "647942", "15287463", "1915014", "2763403", "6094550", "10184155", "3710195", "54437027", "206752068", "14618384", "51611872", "206668836", "4349265", "195674074", "6951247", "21686599", "57374659", "8304060", "5378407", "780697", "126046884", "13410144", "23027818", "59526182", "8689055", "25011406", "52959623", "52255840", "202690009", "52045903", "56305074", "3446654", "206726827", "21727227", "3209523", "686328", "195347602", "3989638", "49476505", "11758569", "7164794", "6628106", "4319958", "32367668", "7993679", "10288645", "47346364", "17704601", "9857301", "13028371", "394290", "484894", "14017201", "206770621", "206687104", "14958161", "6506474", "121541933", "11063271", "4727713"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211066229"}

In order to process matrix patterns and to tackle the imbalance problem, this paper proposes an entropy-based matrix learning machine for imbalanced data sets, adopting the Matrix-pattern-oriented HoKashyap learning machine with regularization learning (MatMHKS) as the base classifier. The new leaning machine is named EMatMHKS and its contributions are: (1) proposing a new entropy-based fuzzy membership evaluation approach which enhances the importance of patterns, (2) guaranteeing the importance of positive patterns and get a more flexible decision surface. Experiments on real-world imbalanced data sets validate that EMatMHKS outperforms compared learning machines.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patrec.2017.01.014", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.

Accordingly, several ontology alignment techniques have been proposed and used for discovering correspondences between the concepts (or entities) of different ontologies. Most alignment techniques depend on string-based similarities which are unable to handle the vocabulary mismatch problem. Also, determining which similarity measures to use and how to effectively combine them in alignment systems are challenges that have persisted in this area. In this work, we introduce a random forest classifier approach for ontology alignment which relies on word embedding for determining a variety of semantic similarity features between concepts. Specifically, we combine string-based and semantic similarity measures to form feature vectors that are used by the classifier model to determine when concepts align. By harnessing background knowledge and relying on minimal information from the ontologies, our approach can handle knowledge-light ontological resources. It also eliminates the need for learning the aggregation weights of a composition of similarity measures. Experiments using Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) dataset and real-world ontologies highlight the utility of our approach and show that it can outperform state-of-the-art alignment systems.

The key objective of our work is to develop an adjunct Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique that uses ultrasound images of the ovary and image mining algorithms to accurately classify benign and malignant ovarian tumor images.

Our technique was validated using 1000 benign and 1000 malignant images, and we obtained a high accuracy of 99.9% using a SVM classifier with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The high accuracy can be attributed to the determination of the novel combination of the 16 texture based features that quantify the subtle changes in the images belonging to both classes. The proposed algorithm has the following characteristics: cost-effectiveness, complete automation, easy deployment, and good end-user comprehensibility.

The unique feature of the proposed network is that it forms stable state representations during learning-previous work has shown that conventional analog recurrent networks can be inherently unstable in that they cannot retain their state memory for long input strings. The authors have previously introduced the discrete recurrent network architecture for learning finite-state automata. Here they extend this model to include a discrete external stack with discrete symbols. A composite error function is described to handle the different situations encountered in learning. The pseudo-gradient learning method (introduced in previous work) is in turn extended for the minimization of these error functions. Empirical trials validating the effectiveness of the pseudo-gradient learning method are presented, for networks both with and without an external stack. Experimental results show that the new networks are successful in learning some simple pushdown automata, though overfitting and non-convergent learning can also occur. Once learned, the internal representation of the network is provably stable; i.e., it classifies unseen strings of arbitrary length with 100% accuracy. >", "year": 1994, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "18267800", "doi": "10.1109/72.279194", "venue": "IEEE transactions on neural networks", "journal": "IEEE transactions on neural networks", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2152080463", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["7741931", "2763403", "15720720", "15375627", "420250", "14711886", "159635"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:518523"}

The proposed method uses Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Kernal based ELM for fault detection and classification. The approach of ELM is characterized by a unified formulation used for regression, binary, and multiclass classification problems, and the related solution is given in an analytical compact form. ELM is a single hidden layer feed forward neural network (SLFN) which chooses input weight randomly and computes the output weight analytically. The fault dictionary constructed from the features of the CUT is used for fault detection and classification. Fault detection for the state variable filter is considered as the bench mark circuit and the transfer function is derived and simulated for finding the features gain, pole selectivity and quality factor with and without fault conditions. ELM algorithm is applied for fault classification in the state variable filter. Efficient time saving is possible through random fixing of weights and bias value and calculating the output weight in single iteration. A new test generation algorithm based on machine learning called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) with much lower time cost and simple process has been proposed in this paper.

By fitting the distribution of the spatial frequency spectra of human brain tissues as a Gaussian function, the standard deviation, \u03c3, can be obtained, which was used to generate a criterion to differentiate human brain cancerous tissues from the normal ones using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This SFS-SVM analysis on micrograph images presents good results with sensitivity (85%), specificity (75%) in comparison with gold standard reports of pathology and immunology. The dual-modal advantages of SFS combined with RR spectroscopy method may open a new way in the neuropathology ::: applications.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2213287", "venue": "SPIE BiOS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2294169934", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["120963135", "122750737", "44716748", "99970684", "40622190", "22498132", "9246269", "95368402", "23136534", "28744121", "206434766", "215221562", "122201315", "23192959", "122201315", "27913208", "52874011", "19421313"], "inbound_citations": ["125256524"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123739202"}

When we used distortions of the training set we obtained error rates below 0.6%. To achieve this performance, we introduce several methods for enhancing ELM implementation, which individually and in combination can significantly improve performance, to the point where it is nearly indistinguishable from deep network performance. The main innovation is to ensure each hidden-unit operates only on a randomly sized and positioned patch of each image. This form of random 'receptive field' sampling of the input ensures the input weight matrix is sparse, with about 90 percent of weights equal to zero, which is a potential advantage for hardware implementations. Furthermore, combining our methods with a small number of iterations of a single-batch backpropagation method can significantly reduce the number of hidden-units required to achieve a particular performance. Our close to state-of-the-art results for MNIST suggest that the ease of use and accuracy of ELM should cause it to be given greater consideration as an alternative to deep networks applied to more challenging datasets.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": "1412.8307", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1505186732", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2309950", "116858", "15037168", "33344986", "5769519", "4659176", "15230674", "9761831", "207147662", "7028394", "15983716"], "inbound_citations": ["211021042", "15893707", "5984495"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195346036"}

Surveys on habitat suitability of vulnerable species and integration of protected areas have raised alarm over potential species extinction and geographical isolation of populations. Reducing the threats of human activities on sensitive terrestrial and coastal ecosystems requires integrated planning and management of terrestrial and coastal protected areas, however many of these areas have been selected and managed independently. Selecting coastal protected areas network require a systematic conservation planning approach, to reduce the development impacts on sensitive habitats. Therefore, this study aimed to identify an optimized integrative network of terrestrial and coastal protected areas in southeast Iran. An attempt was made to maximize biodiversity conservation, reduce the isolation of populations, and increase the resilience of the region\u2019s natural habitats to new development plans by including coastal habitats meeting the requirements of key species. Firstly, suitable habitats for seven key species were simulated by Species Distribution Models (SDMs) performed via Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Boosted Model (GBM), Random Forest (RF), and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models fitted with 20 ecological and anthropogenic variables. A habitat suitability map was produced by integrating the SDM-derived habitat suitability maps with the suitable extents identified for egg-laying green sea turtle and potential habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic birds. An attempt was then made for selecting new terrestrial and coastal protected areas using the simulated annealing algorithm under six scenarios. All SDMs exhibited promising performances in predicting the distribution of suitable habitats with AUC values of above 0.8 and the discrimination power of GBM and RF was higher than that of the other SDMs. In total, more than 34 percent of the study area, along the coastline, was categorized as sensitive or extremely sensitive habitat. An east-west habitat corridor presently unprotected playing an important role in connecting habitats needs to be safeguarded to maintain regional biodiversity. Moreover, our study revealed that the majority of suitable habitats with high potential for sensitive species are not currently protected by the existing protected area network.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.006", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Indicators", "mag_id": "2936114543", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:146087214"}

The experimental results indicate that our proposed methods can adapt to different types of entity search queries, and outperform the current state-of-the-art methods based on keyword matching and vanilla word2vec models.

Recent research obtains their respective new representations using some predefined statistics. However, they usually formulate the class-wise statistics using the pseudo hard labels due to no labeled target data, such as class-wise MMD and class scatter matrice. The probabilities of data points belonging to each class given by the hard labels are either 0 or 1, while the soft labels could relax the strong constraint of hard labels and provide a random value between them. Although existing work have noticed the advantage of soft labels, they either deal with thoes class-wise statistics inadequately or introduce those small irrelevant probabilities in soft labels. Therefore, we propose the filtered soft labels to discard thoes confusing probabilities, then both of the class-wise MMD and class scatter matrice are modeled in this way. In order to obtain more accurate filtered soft labels, we take advantage of a well-designed Graph-based Label Propagation (GLP) method, and incorporate it into the DA procedure to formulate a unified framework.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1912.12209", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2998261812", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["740063", "51613426", "4936510", "6318297", "46932755", "23629495", "13798326", "788838", "47588", "7923833", "52453713", "19107232", "19598463", "1726265", "13752992", "164209498", "118638514", "19127636", "85499473", "53095472", "3172259", "51613426", "6755881", "49547920", "13841056", "4445132", "9238949", "2777306", "26286062", "556999", "12757870", "407822", "6480652", "9728005", "888650", "13888866", "44436760", "17010591", "7176806", "14456120", "206742596", "6742009", "1993257", "54560829", "3479574", "67069111", "9440223", "12671882", "501451", "14536072", "207763512", "206594692", "2928248", "2871880", "46784066", "14240373", "745350"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209500974"}

However, existing named entity recognition (NER) systems deal with text that is structured, formal, well written, with a good grammatical structure and few spelling errors, which cannot be directly used for bug-specific named entity recognition.

Although a large amount of human PPI data has been generated by high-throughput experimental techniques, they are very limited compared to the estimated 130 000 protein interactions in humans. Hence, automatic methods for human PPI-detection are highly desired. This work proposes a novel framework, i.e., Low-rank approximation-kernel Extreme Learning Machine (LELM), for detecting human PPI from a protein's primary sequences automatically.

Microarray technology provides an ideal example of imbalanced data problem. Microarray technology provides quantitative information about the complete transcription profile of cells and monitors the expression levels of thousands of genes at one time. This facilitates drug development, disease diagnosis, and understanding the basic cell biology capability. The imbalanced data problem occurs due to the fact that number of samples in each class not equal also the number of attributes is extremely greater than number of samples. In this paper, a new ensemble method based on informative attributes namely Ensample Learning Based on Ranking Attribute Value (ELBRAV) was proposed, to resolve the imbalanced microarray data problem. The proposed method contains from three main steps. First: an active attributes evaluation algorithm to ranks the attributes according to its informative. By default is information gain ratio attributes evaluation was used. Second: building several classification models from subset of higher informative attributes, that chosen according to several strategies. Decision tree (C4.5) classifier was used as models generator. Third: two voting techniques for predictive unseen class label. ELBRAV integrate the attribute evaluation with classifier that generate the models. ELBRAV was evaluated on seven real cancerous DNA microarray datasets, and its performance evaluated with the most five popular classification method (C45, Bagging(C4.5), AdaBoost(C4.5), random forest and Support Vector Machine SVM ). The proposed method ELBRAV outperforms C4.5 and the traditional ensample methods Bagging(C4.5), AdaBoost(C4.5) and random forest, between (9.67%4.16%) on average.

Groups of characters are repeatedly highlighted while the user is asked to count silently when the attended symbol is flashed. This elicits an increase in the potential difference recorded in the EEG, ~300 ms after a target stimulus is presented. By discriminating between the presence or absence of this so-called P300 waveform, it is possible to determine the target symbol. ::: Typically, the decoder which performs the classification is trained in a supervised manner and requires a tedious and time consuming calibration session. In contrast, we use an unsupervised machine learning technique to train the classifier. This technique eliminates the need for a calibration session and allows the speller to be used instantly. The calibration is omitted by training the classifier with the data recorded during actual use and correcting previously spelled characters when more data is received. It has been shown that this method can compete with state of the art supervised methods on an auditory event-related potential paradigm [1] when high quality amplifiers are used [2]. ::: We investigate the use of the Emotiv EPOC, which is a low-cost, 14 channel device, to build a plug and play BCI. The P300 speller application is implemented in the BCPy2000 framework. In our experiments 7 subjects were asked to spell 44 characters making use of the original row-column paradigm. For every character a sequence of stimuli, in which every row and column of the grid is intensified once in random order, is repeated for 15 iterations. ::: Despite of the low signal to noise ratio of the Emotiv EPOC headset and the resulting decrease in accuracy for classifying P300 waveforms, reported in [3], a decent spelling accuracy is achieved making use of unsupervised machine learning. On average 81.8% (std. 11.74%) of the characters is correctly spelled after correction. Before correction 73% of the characters is correctly spelled. The majority of the originally misspelled and corrected characters are situated in the beginning of the sentence, where the data availble for training is still scarce. This scarcity can be solved making use of transfer learning to initialize the speller with basic information [4]. ::: The exclusion of the calibration session makes the speller more attractive for use. Besides that, the results show that it is possible to build a speller with an affordable EEG recording system. We can conclude that we are one step closer to building a reliable, user friendly and affordable BCI system. ::: ::: References: ::: [1] M. Schreuder, T. Rost and M. Tangermann.

In this thesis, I will introduce a number of statistical machine learning methods to build accurate alignments between a protein sequence and its template structures, especially for proteins having only distantly related templates. For a protein with only one good template, we develop a regression-tree based Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model for pairwise protein sequence/structure alignment. By learning a nonlinear threading scoring function, we are able to leverage the correlation among different sequence and structural features. We also introduce an information-theoretic measure to guide the learning algorithm to better exploit the structural features for low-homology proteins with little evolutionary information in their sequence profile. For a protein with multiple good templates, we design a probabilistic consistency approach to thread the protein to all templates simultaneously.

The design of an ensemble is based on the individual accuracy of the predictors and also how different they are from one another. There is a significant body of literature on how to design and measure diversity in classification ensembles. Most of these metrics are not directly applicable to regression ensembles since the regression task inherently deals with continuous valued labels for learning. To measure diversity in regression ensembles, Krogh and Vedelsby show that the quadratic error of an ensemble estimator is guaranteed to be less than or equal to average quadratic error of components. However, this does not give a way to measure or create diverse regression ensembles. This paper presents metrics (correlation coefficient, covariance, dissimilarity measure, chi-square and mutual information) that can be used for measuring diversity in regression ensembles.

Crop classification of homogeneous landscapes and phenology is a common requirement to estimate land cover mapping, monitoring, and land use categories accurately. In recent missions, classification methods using medium or high spatial resolution data, which are multi-temporal with multiple frequencies, have become more attractive. A new mode of incorporating spatial and temporal dependence in a homogeneous region was tried using the Random Forest (RF) classifier for crop classification. A time-series of medium spatial resolution enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and its summary statistics obtained from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (Landsat 7 ETM+) were used to develop a new technique for crop type classification. Eight classes were studied: alfalfa, asparagus, avocado, cotton, grape, maize, mango, and tomato. Evaluation was based on several criteria: sensitivity to training dataset size, the number of variables, and mapping accuracy. Results showed that the training dataset size strongly affects the classifier accuracy, but if the training data increase, the rate of improvement decreases. The RF algorithm yielded overall accuracy of 81% and a Kappa statistic of 0.70, indicating high model performance. Additionally, the variable importance measures demonstrated that the mode and sum of EVI had extremely important variables for crop class separability. RF had computationally good performance.

Our HMM method leverages trajectories to train a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with which we estimate the probability density function of each activity using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.

Our experiments on large-scale image collections have also obtained very positive results.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "18270128", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2008.916999", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2098020658", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2910032", "1817614", "15391781", "2052396", "12531858", "195700942", "9479207", "7410808", "14715074", "9590512", "1951197", "1188030", "8522062", "1569463", "16037331", "6071438", "12014229", "2432623", "130535382", "14100761", "7869961", "3028284", "59881353", "6387937", "13121800", "2185716", "14723701", "11194336", "18646677", "627438", "16193644", "13650160", "29136678", "207251944", "6709166", "15287631", "959448", "277918", "10743717", "10160463", "18648233", "7138354", "56563878", "1261712", "719551", "17115672", "18648233", "15394380", "2032275", "9246135", "16398174", "7511403", "3190877", "10367708", "8167136", "6979297", "12508411", "26960541", "5745749", "13044872", "14029378", "7831590", "573509", "60033325", "15530649"], "inbound_citations": ["7686278", "13528577", "697589", "62706272", "3707049", "10707857", "18559878", "392265", "14503841", "182680", "14523869", "4961580", "10053151", "209466498", "17142034", "598316", "10526229", "15396573", "18486310", "7214235", "13251619", "7190417", "7886749", "51611747", "16654792", "15148324", "16026443", "20906919", "16791222", "15670649", "15588047", "1796064", "7279804", "12319379", "209459575", "121034273", "55623019", "16505321", "47017672", "14992472", "2115702", "10232291", "15594815", "16160402", "10785541", "208633240", "18057617", "17920026", "7107246", "27878942", "7872314", "11960396", "5973755", "15359303", "7400712", "15174388", "21518137", "2685899", "14428253", "2271964", "13085752", "15644585", "34005801", "15335142", "432812", "17243587", "6627566", "1899011", "6452557", "14665370", "612803", "17713739", "15844613", "24511566", "49538414", "38908251", "6415663", "17089940", "2491101", "8451088", "38618928", "7918246", "3442057", "16106620", "20328307", "18772873", "9402966", "8095818", "17980262", "15262524", "8167218", "202641083"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58997"}

Quantification of such induced changes in intrinsic motion is important because it provides a basis for relating thermodynamic changes to changes in molecular motion. This task is, however, challenging because it requires comparing two high-dimensional data sets. Traditionally, when analyzing molecular simulations, this problem is circumvented by first reducing the dimensions of the two ensembles separately, and then comparing summary statistics from the two ensembles against each other. However, since dimensionality reduction is carried out prior to ensemble comparison, such strategies are susceptible to artifactual biases from information loss. Here, we introduce a method based on support vector machines that yields a normalized quantitative estimate for the difference between two ensembles after comparing them directly against one another. While this method can be applied to any molecular system, including nonbiological molecules and crystals, here, we show how it can be applied to identify the specific regions of a paramyxovirus G protein that are affected by the binding of its preferred human receptor, Ephrin B2. This protein-protein interaction initiates the fusion of the virus with the host cell. Specifically, for every residue in the G protein, we obtain separately a quantitative difference between the ensemble of configurations they sample in the presence and in the absence of Ephrin B2. These ensembles were generated using molecular dynamics simulations. Rank-ordering and then mapping the residues that undergo the greatest change in motion onto the 3-D structure of the G protein reveals that they are clustered primarily on a single contiguous facet of the protein and include the set that is known experimentally to play a vital role in regulating viral fusion.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26588730", "doi": "10.1021/ct300694e", "venue": "Journal of chemical theory and computation", "journal": "Journal of chemical theory and computation", "mag_id": "2333360454", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10345899", "7474321", "19715554", "215588593"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5885377"}

It can also reduce the time of sample collection and make learning efficient. In this paper, we receive significant improvement effect using SVM as the basic learner in TrAdaBoost during four consecutive dust storm days, and correct one error classification in PDF. As a result, dust aerosol in high altitude can even spread to stratosphere. Moreover, in the process of dust aerosol transportation, it is highly affected by anthropogenic aerosol, for example, the color ratio (CR) changes from 0.728 to 0.460 and finally reaches 0.466, while depolarization ratio (DR) changes from 0.308 to 0.081 and finally reaches 0.156. It is indicated that the big size and non-spherical aerosol particles reduce obviously after dust aerosol deposition, but small size and spherical anthropogenic aerosol also produce a certain effect, and on March 22, 2010 had a small recovery above the ocean following the reduction of DR and CR. Due to the MODIS resolution not meeting the observation requirement and layer identification being different between CALIPSO and CloudSat, a problem such as stratocumulus cloud in low altitude still exists in aerosol and cloud classification.

In this article, a methodology for classification of Not From Concentrate (NFC) juices was presented. During research samples of 100% orange juice, 100% apple juice, as well as mixtures of these juices with known percentage of base juices were tested. Classification of juice samples was carried out using unsupervised and supervised statistical methods.

We also show that the variance of the CCE remains as a potential parameter for detecting covert traffic.

Existing Cross-Age Face Recognition (CAFR) methods have two limitations. Firstly, many CAFR approaches require both age labels and identity labels for training. However, it is difficult to collect images under a large age span from each individual. Secondly, many works are based on the assumption that age and identity information are independent of each other, which may not satisfy various conditions. In this paper, a Cycle Age-Adversarial Model (CAAM) is proposed for CAFR, which only uses the age labels for training without considering independence hypothesis. CAAM includes two different branch networks. Firstly, the branch of Age-robust Feature Extracting Model (AFEM) is designed to adaptively learn age-invariant features by adversarial learning scheme, which includes an age discriminator network and a feature generator network. The age discriminator network is trained to discriminate the age information, and the generator extracts age-invariant features through adversarial learning with discriminator. Secondly, a branch of the Identity Preserving Network (IPN) is proposed to keep identity information, which introduces Unsupervised Identity Loss (UIL) to enlarge the inter-class distance, and decrease the loss of identity information in the learning process. Finally, the features of the two branches are cyclically optimized through minmizing Feature Consistency Loss (FCL), which integrates age invariance learning and identity discrimination learning into final feature representation. Different from existing CAFR networks, our adversarial learning strategy for age-robust feature learning can be generalized to other attributes including pose and expression. Moreover, we introduce cycle optimization strategy to merge the advantages of two branch networks, which is a novel strategy to fuse multi-task features.

This thesis applies the Random Forest model to predict the amount of this claim severity on car insurance. Furthermore, analysis of the effect of the number of features used on model accuracy is conducted. The simulation result shows that the Random Forest model can be applied in cases of prediction of claim severity, which is a case of regression in the context of machine learning. Only by using 1/3 of the overall features, the accuracy of the Random Forest model can produce accuracy that is comparable to that obtained when using all features which is around 99%.

The task is to label each pixel as belonging to the foreground or the background. We pose the problem as that of finding the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation in a modified form of Conditional Random Field model that we call a Nonparametric Inhomogeneous CRF (NICRFs). An NICRF, like a conventional CRF, has nodes representing pixels and pairwise links connecting neighboring pixels; however, both the unary and pairwise energy terms are inhomogeneous in the sense of being dependent on pixel positions to account for prior information of the known object class. It differs from earlier methods in that position information is in form of unique term functions for each individual pixel, rather than the same parametric function but with varying parameters. Unary terms are given by a learned boosted classifier based on novel Adaptive Edgelet Features (AEFs) for inferring probability of a pixel being foreground; pairwise terms are learned by joint probabilities for neighboring pixels as a function of contrast; a monotonicity constraint is used to reduce possible over-fit effects. We expand the neighborhood used for pairwise terms, and add inhomogeneous weighting factors for different pairwise terms. We use the Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) algorithm for MAP estimation. A local search process is proposed to deal with inaccurate detection windows.

In addition, to estimate the flood quantile of ungauged sites, there could be only a limited number of stations with complete dataset are available from hydrologically similar, surrounding catchments. Besides traditional regression based RFFA methods, recent applications of machine learning algorithms such as the artificial neural network (ANN) have shown encouraging results in regional flood quantile estimations. Another novel machine learning technique that is becoming widely applicable in the hydrologic community is the Support Vector Regression (SVR). In this study, an RFFA model based on SVR was developed to estimate regional flood quantiles for two study areas, one with 26 catchments located in southeastern British Columbia (BC) and another with 23 catchments located in southern Ontario (ON), Canada. The SVR-RFFA model for both study sites was developed from 13 sets of physiographic and climatic predictors for the historical period. The Ef (Nash Sutcliffe coefficient) and R 2 of the SVR-RFFA model was about 0.7 when estimating flood quantiles of 10, 25, 50 and 100 year return periods which indicate satisfactory model performance in both study areas. In addition, the SVR-RFFA model also performed well based on other goodness-of-fit statistics such as BIAS (mean bias) and BIASr (relative BIAS ). If the amount of data available for training RFFA models is limited, the SVR-RFFA model was found to perform better than an ANN based RFFA model, and with significantly lower median CV (coefficient of variation) of the estimated flood quantiles. The SVR-RFFA model was then used to project changes in flood quantiles over the two study areas under the impact of climate change using the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate projections of five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) GCMs (Global Climate Models) for the 2041\u20132100 period. The results suggest that due to a projected increase in the mean annual precipitation, and rainfall of a given return period, the flood quantile is projected to increase by about 7% for the southeastern BC and 29% for southern ON region in the mid- and late 21st century.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.04.041", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "2344727205", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202565156", "135363178", "102619105", "54074439", "53374318", "134958450", "134524889", "209331147", "134230001", "134036113", "134482356", "189972062", "210953307", "189951246"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131742053"}

Then the experimental procedure employed a full factorial design with these foresaid parameters as factors, each of first three terms at three levels and the last at two levels, are carried out and 54 groups of data are obtained. Furthermore, the data are analyzed by different experiments in contrast: SVR based models and BP based model respectively. The experimental results have indicated that SVR based model outperforms its main competitors-BP model in the limited training data, and the mean absolute error of which is only 20%-30% of the latter. Lastly, This prediction model provides a better understanding of the influence of milling conditions on machined surface hardness. In sum, the proposed model is faster in speed, higher in accuracy, and more suitable for prediction of the machined surface hardness.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICNC.2008.258", "venue": "2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation", "journal": "2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2131475205", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["137004437", "42340844", "136598524", "7138354", "109749717", "15151137", "30036885", "7207077"], "inbound_citations": ["14608705"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:45393849"}

Methane and nitrous oxide are the key pollutions among greenhouse gases being a major contribution to climate changes because of their high potential global impact. Using statistical clustering (k-means and Ward\u2019s method), five meaningful clusters of countries with similar level of greenhouse gases emission were identified. Neural modeling using multi-layer perceptron networks was performed for countries placed in particular groups. The parameters that characterize the quality of a network are the predictive errors (mainly validation and test) and they are high (0.97\u20130.99). The use of sensitivity analysis allowed for identifying the variables that have a significant influence on the greenhouse gases emissions. The sensitivity analysis of the designed artificial neural network models shows a few dominant variables, affecting emissions with varied intensity: cattle and buffaloes, sheep and goat populations, afforestation as well as electricity consumption. The observed values were compared with those predicted by the models.

The purpose of this thesis is to assess the governmental targets in comparing with the global objectives of various allocation methods, which correspond to different carbon equity principles.In order to evaluate the technology roadmaps which are necessary to achieve these reductions of CO2 emissions, a flexible modeling framework is proposed for policy makers. Our sectoral model avoids the complex computing operations. It can be customized according to different requirements and situations. We simulate the model up to the horizon 2050, which is often seen as a turning point in energy use patterns worldwide \u2013 forced by the probable decline in hydrocarbons extraction.In the thesis, the technology roadmaps for the governmental targets on CO2 emissions are studied for three typical countries: China, France, and the United States. The model covers the sectors responsible for the greatest part of CO2 emissions: power, transport, residence and industry sector, in studying the impacts of the principle energy technologies, such as energy mix, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), electric vehicles and energy efficiency.Various methods and approaches are used in our modeling. IPAT identity - which assumes the environment Impact is the results of Population, Affluence and Technology - is employed in the power sector emission decomposition. Besides STIRPAT - for Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology - model is used for the projection of CO2 emissions in the Business-as-Usual scenario. Then SVR - for Support Vector Regression - is used to forecast electricity production. Finally, the Theil index is employed as the measurement of per capita CO2 emission inequality. Different from classic cost-effective energy system models, our model provides the technology pathways for different criteria, such as balanced development of energy technology across sectors, availability of energy resources, etc. Besides, the carbon equity is employed as one of the constraints in the multi-objective optimization, under the consideration of the convergence of technologies in sectors in the long-term.Our results show that the governmental targets in France and the United States prove very strict, as they require all sectors to make large efforts in reducing CO2 emissions. In contrast, the governmental target in China seems more easily achievable, as the necessary advances of technologies are less demanding. More precisely: if the energy mix is expected to be kept unchanged in China and in the United States of America, the CCS prove indispensable in the power sector. In France, 80% of automobiles are required to be changed into electric vehicles, in order to get the target of CO2 emissions.However, under the sectoral carbon equity consideration, coal combustion is projected to be reduced by two thirds in China, and it will have to be almost eliminated in the United States to achieve their CO2 reduction target. But gas is encouraged to be used in the power sector, especially in the United States. Regarding the transport sector, more than 60% of vehicles should be replaced to electric vehicles in China, and this share will be about up to 90% in France and the United States.Finally the sensitivity of parameters in the model is tested for a robust simulation, at each step of the work, and for all technology roadmaps. The results of the sensitivity tests show that electricity production and the emission intensity of production are the two parameters with the most important influence on CO2 emissions. Thus improving the efficiency of coal combustion and the energy efficiency of electricity will play an important role in the CO2 emission reductions.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2620253289", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113794533"}

For human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the third most common cause of cancer related deaths, molecular classification can be useful to discriminate between patient subgroups with different biological and clinical features. Especially chromosomal instability (CIN) represents one determinant for poor overall survival of HCC patients; however, a respective molecular signature has not been defined so far. In order to stratify HCC patients into groups with CIN we utilized a gene expression signature (termed CIN25 signature) that has been shown to correlate with CIN in other tumor entities such as glioma and breast cancer (Carter et al. 2006). In this study we examined the presence of the CIN25 signature in HCC patients and its correlation with overall survival. Moreover, the most important genes for patient classification were determined. Methods Gene expression data from 242 HCC patients (Roessler et al., 2010) was quantile discretized into ten bins and the patients were clustered into 3 groups using the k-means algorithm. The differential expression between these groups was visualized as a heatmap, while cluster specific changes in overall survival were shown using Kaplan-Meier curves. Statistical significance of survival was assessed using the log-rank-test and cox proportional hazard models. The Boruta method, which makes use of Random Forest classification models, was used to determine the most important genes for patient subgroup clustering. Results for CIN25 gene expression were confirmed in an independent cohort (n = 20) using quantitative real-time PCR. Results Gene expression analysis of HCC patients revealed the presence of the CIN25 signature. Patients could be clustered into three different groups with low (32%), moderate (35%) and high (33%) expression levels of the CIN signature genes. Survival data analysis showed that patients with high expression levels had a significantly worse overall survival in comparison to patients with low expression levels (p = 0.01). Moreover, the elevated expression of 19 out of the 25 CIN genes was significantly correlated to poor survival. The Boruta method identified MAD2L1, TTK, TPX2 and MCM2 as possible risk stratification markers of HCC patients. In an independent cohort the expression levels of selected CIN genes (n = 9) were measured and revealed significant upregulation in 57-82% of HCC patients. Conclusion These data demonstrate that the presence of the CIN25 signature correlates with poor prognosis in HCC patients and could be used to predict overall survival. The determination of genes that classify patients into different subgroups may lead to the establishment of new biomarkers for HCC in the clinics.

While previous research has successfully applied standard machine-learning algorithms to accurately predict substrate cleavage by other similar types of proteases, their approach does not extend well to calpain, possibly due to its particular mode of proteolytic action and limited amount of experimental data. Through the use of Multiple Kernel Learning, a recent extension to the classic Support Vector Machine framework, we were able to train complex models based on rich, heterogeneous feature sets, leading to significantly improved prediction quality (6% over highest AUC score produced by state-of-the-art methods). In addition to producing a stronger machine-learning model for the prediction of calpain cleavage, we were able to highlight the importance and role of each feature of substrate sequences in defining specificity: primary sequence, secondary structure and solvent accessibility. Most notably, we showed there existed significant specificity differences across calpain sub-types, despite previous assumption to the contrary. Prediction accuracy was further successfully validated using, as an unbiased test set, mutated sequences of calpastatin (endogenous inhibitor of calpain) modified to no longer block calpain's proteolytic action.

Existing methods for representing graphs can result in difficulties such as the loss of structural information, which can be overcome using specifically designed graph kernels. In this paper, we propose two novel graph kernels, mapping distance kernel with stars (MDKS) and mapping distance kernel with vectors (MDKV), to classify labeled graphs more accurately than existing methods. The MDKS is based on the graph edit distance using star structures, and the MDKV is based on the graph edit distance using the linear sum assignment problem and graph relabeling. Because MDKS uses only small local structures that consist of adjacent vertices of each vertex in graphs, it is not substantially superior to conventional graph kernels. However, the MDKV uses local structures that consist of vertices that are reachable within a small number of steps from each vertex in graphs and, unlike existing methods, do not require isomorphism matching.

In this letter, for the first time, we propose a technique based on the use of SVR analysis to obtain the reflection coefficients to accelerate the design of a very large shaped-beam reflectarray for direct broadcast satellite in a 15% bandwidth. An in-house method of moments based on local periodicity is employed to generate samples to train the SVRs for each considered frequency. Then, the surrogate model is used for a design at central frequency, which is used as starting point for a wideband design procedure that is accelerated more than an order of magnitude without a significant loss of accuracy.

In this paper, a new supervised classification algorithm, called neural dynamic classification (NDC), is presented with the goal of: 1) discovering the most effective feature spaces and 2) finding the optimum number of features required for accurate classification using the patented robust neural dynamic optimization model of Adeli and Park. The new classification algorithm is compared with the probabilistic neural network (PNN), enhanced PNN (EPNN), and support vector machine using two sets of classification problems. The first set consists of five standard benchmark problems. The second set is a large benchmark problem called Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology database of handwritten digits. In general, NDC yields the most accurate classification results followed by EPNN. A beauty of the new algorithm is the smoothness of convergence curves which is an indication of robustness and good performance of the algorithm.

A connectionist account supposes that this transition can occur in a single mechanism (in the form of a neural network) driven by gradual quantitative changes in the size of the training set to which the network is exposed. In this paper, a series of simulations is reported in which a multi-layered perceptron learns to map verb stems to past tense forms analogous to the mappings found in the English past tense system. By expanding the training set in a gradual, incremental fashion and evaluating network performance on both trained and novel verbs at successive points in learning, we demonstrate that the network undergoes reorganizations that result in a shift from a mode of rote learning to a systematic treatment of verbs. Furthermore, we show that this reorganizational transition is contingent upon a critical mass in the training set and is sensitive to the phonological sub-regularities characterizing the irregular verbs. The optimal levels of performance achieved in this series of simulations compared to previous work derives from the incremental training procedures exploited in the current simulations. The pattern of errors observed are compared to those of children acquiring the English past tense, as well as children's performance on experimental studies with nonsense verbs. Incremental learning procedures are discussed in light of theories of cognitive development. It is concluded that a connectionist approach offers a viable alternative account of the acquisition of English verb morphology, given the current state of empirical evidence relating to processes of acquisition in young children.", "year": 1991, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/B978-1-4832-1448-1.50027-5", "venue": "Connectionist Models", "journal": "Connectionist Models", "mag_id": "2746818399", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53344824", "64017359", "201651467", "142056573", "11378976", "27023528", "10921675", "18648016", "44048850", "32384303", "86862916", "60424695", "55453313", "14237194", "201694949", "144101439", "144554482", "59795826"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:66971008"}

The intermittent and uncontrollable characteristics of photovoltaic power generation have a huge impact on the stability of the power system. To reduce the occurrence of such conditions, it is necessary to improve the prediction accuracy of photovoltaic power generation. However, in the traditional modeling process, the accuracy of the model is often poor due to excessive noise in the original data or improper parameter adjustment. In this paper, Principal Component Analysis and K-means clustering algorithm combined with random forest algorithm optimized by Differential Evolution Grey Wolf Optimizer are used to model the photovoltaic power generation in three regions. Principal Component Analysis and K-means clustering are used to obtain the hourly point features similar to the predicted time points, and then the input data is filtered to reduce the noise data interference. At the same time, the popular optimization algorithm quickly selects the Random Forest parameters, which greatly avoids the artificial filtering factors and causes the error to be generated. Through the establishment of comparative experiments, it is found that the recommended model has higher prediction accuracy and robustness.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.energy.2019.115940", "venue": null, "journal": "Energy", "mag_id": "2968516859", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202090241"}

In this regard, a new adaptive local binary pattern (ALBP) descriptor is presented in order to carry out the local description. It is built by adding oriented standard deviation information to an ALBP descriptor in order to achieve a more complete representation of the images and hence it has been called ALBPS. Regarding semen vitality assessment, ALBPS outperformed previous literature works with an 81.88% of accuracy and it also yielded higher hit rates than the LBP and ALBP base-line methods. Concerning the global description of sperm heads, several classical texture algorithms were tested and a descriptor based on Wavelet transform and Haralick feature extraction (WCF13) obtained the best results. Both local and global descriptors were combined and the classification was carried out with a Support Vector Machine. Therefore, our proposal is novel in three ways. First, a new local feature extraction method ALBPS is introduced.

Specifically, the proposed method consists of a deep recognition network R and a discriminator D. The deep recognition network is used to learn the shared middle-level image representation and conducts multiple face analysis tasks simultaneously. Through multi-task learning mechanism, the recognition network explores the dependencies among multiple face analysis tasks, such as facial landmark localization, head pose estimation, gender recognition and face attribute estimation from image representation-level. The discriminator is introduced to enforce the distribution of the multiple face analysis tasks to converge to that inherent in the ground-truth labels. During training, the recognizer tries to confuse the discriminator, while the discriminator competes with the recognizer through distinguishing the predicted label combination from the ground-truth one.

In total, 3476 mouse candidates and 3441 human candidates were found. These hairpins are more similar to known miRNAs than to negative controls in several aspects not considered by the prediction algorithm.

The messages are combined with financial data on all trades completed in a three-year period. A Conditional Random Field is trained on the textual data and used to extract important features.

To address these limitations, this paper presents a new visionbased method for automated action recognition of construction equipment from different camera viewpoints. This is particularly a challenging task as construction equipment can be partially occluded and they usually come in wide variety of sizes and appearances. The scale and pose of the equipment action can also significantly vary based on the camera configurations. In the proposed method, first a video is represented as a collection of spatio-temporal features by extracting space-time interest points and describing each feature with a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG). The algorithm automatically learns the probability distributions of the spatiotemporal features and action categories using a multiple binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This strategy handles noisy feature points arisen from typical dynamic backgrounds. Given a novel video sequence, the multiple binary SVM classifier recognizes and localizes multiple equipment actions in long and dynamic video sequences containing multiple equipment actions.

Downscaling models were calibrated over the period 1950\u20131991 and validated over the period 1992\u20132014 for each calendar month, for each station, using 4 machine learning techniques, (1) Genetic Programming (GP), (2) Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), (3) Support Vector Machine (SVM), and (4) Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). It was found that, irrespective of the climate regime and the machine learning technique, downscaling models tend to better simulate the average (compared to other statistics) and under-estimate the standard deviation and the maximum of the observed precipitation. Also, irrespective of the climate regime and the machine learning technique, at the majority of stations downscaling models showed an over-estimating trend of low to mid percentiles (i.e. below the 50th percentile) of precipitation and under-estimating trend of high percentiles of precipitation (i.e. above the 90th percentile). The over-estimating trend of low to mid percentiles of precipitation was more pronounced at stations located in dryer climate, irrespective of the machine learning technique. Based on the results of this investigation the use of RVM or ANN over SVM or GP for developing downscaling models can be recommended for a study such as flood prediction which involves the consideration of high extremes of precipitation. Also, RVM can be recommended over GP, ANN or SVM in developing downscaling models for a study such as drought analysis which involves the consideration of low extremes of precipitation.

Results of cross-validation showed that the effect of spiking of local samples collected from a field into an European dataset when combined with RF has resulted in the highest coefficients of determination (R2) values of 0.97 and 0.98, the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.01% and 0.10%, and the highest residual prediction deviations (RPD) of 5.58 and 7.54, for TN and TC, respectively. Results for laboratory and on-line predictions generally followed the same trend as for cross-validation in one field, where the spiked European dataset-based RF calibration models outperformed the corresponding GBM and ANN models. In the second field ANN has replaced RF in being the best performing. However, the local field calibrations provided lower R2 and RPD in most cases. Therefore, from a cost-effective point of view, it is recommended to adopt the spiked European dataset-based RF/ANN calibration models for successful prediction of TN and TC under on-line measurement conditions.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5677209", "pubmed_id": "29064411", "doi": "10.3390/s17102428", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2766300505", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["41870733", "140684578", "129928259", "128666765", "62834667", "96180541", "43469897", "73545281", "140599887", "140648084", "32922094", "55896316", "129686532", "99668816", "89141", "14327012", "88517140", "16190154", "16507039", "128117748", "54015196", "101332507", "121894516", "23543407", "85862276", "1113678", "14953216", "9417065", "13967931", "98363377", "131855286", "128426277", "131074478", "2961765", "97441648", "129279000", "53367939"], "inbound_citations": ["195776320", "204096608", "215317748", "209321691", "211543738", "155233698", "210945308", "209091908", "105465059", "201669455", "207814363"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:643185"}

Among the proposed extensions to multiclass (three classes or more), the one-versus-one and one-versus-all approaches are the most popular ones. This work presents an alternative approach to extending the original SVM method to multiclass. A tree of SVMs is built using a recursive learning strategy, achieving a linear worst-case complexity in terms of number of classes for classification. During learning, at each node of the tree, a bi-partition of the current set of classes is determined to optimally separate the current classification problem into two sub-problems. Rather than relying on an exhaustive search among all possible subsets of classes, the partition is obtained by building a graph representing the current problem and looking for a minimum cut of it.

Conventional recommendation models hardly defend adversaries due to the natural noise like misclicking. Recent researches on GAN-based recommendation systems can improve the robustness of the learning models, yielding the state-of-the-art performance. The basic idea is to adopt an interplay minimax game on two recommendation systems by picking negative samples as fake items and employ reinforcement learning policy. However, such strategy may lead to mode collapse and result in high vulnerability to adversarial perturbations on its model parameters. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative framework, namely Collaborative Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), which adopts Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) as the generator and performs adversarial training in the continuous embedding space. The formulation of CGAN has two advantages: 1) its auto-encoder takes the role of generator to mimic the true distribution of users preferences over items by capturing subtle latent factors underlying user-item interactions; 2) the adversarial training in continuous space enhances models robustness and performance. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world benchmark recommendation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our CGAN in comparison with the state-of-the-art GAN-based methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDEW.2019.00-16", "venue": "2019 IEEE 35th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW)", "journal": "2019 IEEE 35th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2954634733", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17638609", "1145979", "9540398", "109217282", "1033682", "10894094", "13907106", "10537313", "208021274", "1306420", "14726061", "47141157", "10795036", "19140125", "14730159", "3331356", "50776993", "6392154", "930035"], "inbound_citations": ["212415110"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195775752"}

Our first goal was to develop neurally specific hypotheses for how the Mauthner system discriminates right from left in the onset of a sound. Our model was consistent with the phase model for directional hearing underwater, the prevalent theory for sound source localization by fishes. Our second goal was to demonstrate how the neural mechanisms that permit sound localization according to the phase model can coexist with the mechanisms that permit the Mauthner system to discriminate between stimuli based on amplitude. Our results indicate possible computational roles for elements of the Mauthner system, which has provided us a theoretical context within which to consider past and future experiments on the cellular physiology.

Materials and methods A retrospective evaluation of 412 cervical nodes from 5 different patient groups (50 patients in total) having undergone DECT of the neck between 2013 and 2015 was performed: (1) HNSCC with pathology proven metastatic adenopathy, (2) HNSCC with pathology proven benign nodes (controls for (1)), (3) lymphoma, (4) inflammatory, and (5) normal nodes (controls for (3) and (4)). Texture analysis was performed with TexRAD\u00ae software using two independent sets of contours to assess the impact of inter-rater variation. Two machine learning algorithms (Random Forests (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)) were used with independent training and testing sets and determination of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUC. Results In the independent testing (prediction) sets, the accuracy for distinguishing different groups of pathologic nodes or normal nodes ranged between 80 and 95%. The models generated using texture data extracted from the independent contour sets had substantial to almost perfect agreement. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for correctly classifying a lymph node as malignant (i.e. metastatic HNSCC or lymphoma) versus benign were 92%, 91%, 93%, 95%, 87%, respectively.

Compressive strength of concrete is a complex nonlinear function of its ingredients. Prediction of Concrete compressive strength plays a vital role in pre design phases of the structure and quality control of construction. The conventional methods of compressive strength determination are time consuming, so the use of data mining methods to predict the strength beforehand is helpful. Data mining techniques of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been used by the researchers for predicting strength of concrete. This paper discusses the use of tree based models like Random Forest (RF) and Model Trees (MT) for prediction of concrete strengths at various ages of concrete from 3 to 365 days. The model tree techniques give regression equations that are transparent as they give insight about the processes as compared to ANN. The paper also explores application of models to study the significance of various constituents of concrete using sensitivity analysis. Two ways to determine strength of concrete at various ages has been studied. In first method models have been proposed for different ages of concrete from 3 to 365 days. MT and RF have predicted compressive strength of concrete satisfactorily.

Most sampling-based path planners often produce poor-quality roadmaps as they focus on improving the speed of constructing roadmaps without paying much attention to the quality. Poor-quality roadmaps can cause problems such as poor-quality paths, time-consuming path searching and failures in the searching. This paper presents a K-order surrounding roadmap (KSR) path planner which constructs a roadmap in an incremental manner. The planner creates a tree while answering a query, selects the part of the tree according to quality measures and adds the part to an existing roadmap which is obtained in the same way when answering the previous queries. The KSR path planner is able to construct high-quality roadmaps in terms of good coverage, high connectivity, provision of alternative paths and small size. Comparison between the KSR path planner and Reconfigurable Random Forest (RRF), an existing incremental path planner, as well as traditional probabilistic roadmap (PRM) path planner shows that the roadmaps constructed using the KSR path planner have higher quality that those that are built by the other planners.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10846-013-9861-3", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems", "mag_id": "2060743914", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["24114608", "111823725", "25045489"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207173654"}

In the low-data regime, parameters are underdetermined, and learnt networks generalise poorly. Data Augmentation \\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet} alleviates this by using existing data more effectively. However standard data augmentation produces only limited plausible alternative data. Given there is potential to generate a much broader set of augmentations, we design and train a generative model to do data augmentation. The model, based on image conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, takes data from a source domain and learns to take any data item and generalise it to generate other within-class data items. As this generative process does not depend on the classes themselves, it can be applied to novel unseen classes of data.

However, current computerized systems are mainly based on the group analysis, discrete classification of disease stages, or expensive and not readily accessible biomarkers, while current clinical practice relies relatively heavily on cognitive and functional assessments (CFA). In this study, we developed a computational framework using a suite of machine learning tools for identifying key markers in predicting the severity of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) from a large set of biological and clinical measures. Six machine learning approaches, namely Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNNreg) for regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNNclass) for classification, were used for the development of predictive models. We demonstrated high predictive power of CFA. Predictive performance of models incorporating CFA was shown to be consistently higher accuracy than those based solely on biomarker modalities. We found that KRR and SVM were the best performing regression and classification methods respectively. The optimal SVM performance was observed for a set of four CFA test scores (FAQ, ADAS13, MoCA, MMSE) with multi-class classification accuracy of 83.0%, 95%CI = (72.1%, 93.8%) while the best performance of the KRR model was reported with combined CFA and MRI neuroimaging data, i.e., R2 = 0.874, 95%CI = (0.827, 0.922). Given the high predictive power of CFA and their widespread use in clinical practice, we then designed a data-driven and self-adaptive computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) prototype for evaluating the severity of AD of an individual on a continuous spectrum. The system implemented an automated computational approach for data pre-processing, modelling, and validation and used exclusively the scores of selected cognitive measures as data entries.

The high resolution offers specialist physicians high-quality visual information, enabling them to identify dysplastic tissue leading to Early Adenocarcinoma (EAC). The detection and removal of these early types of cancer drastically increases the survival chances of the patient. However, even for an experienced specialist it remains an arduous task to identify the patterns associated with early cancer. Therefore, a computer-aided detection system that supports the physician seems highly attractive. We present a novel algorithm for automatic detection of early cancerous tissue in HD endoscopic images. The algorithm computes local color- and texture features based on the original and on the Gabor-filtered image. We explore the spectral characteristics of the image regions that contain early cancer and we design appropriate filters based on this analysis. The features are classified by a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) after which additional post-processing techniques are applied in order to annotate the image region containing early cancer. For 7 patients, we compare 32 annotations made by the algorithm with the corresponding delineations made by an expert gastroenterologist.

One of the most important challenges in learning from data streams is reacting to concept drift, i.e., unforeseen changes of the stream's underlying data distribution. Several classification algorithms that cope with concept drift have been put forward, however, most of them specialize in one type of change. In this paper, we propose a new data stream classifier, called the Accuracy Updated Ensemble (AUE2), which aims at reacting equally well to different types of drift. AUE2 combines accuracy-based weighting mechanisms known from block-based ensembles with the incremental nature of Hoeffding Trees. The proposed algorithm is experimentally compared with 11 state-of-the-art stream methods, including single classifiers, block-based and online ensembles, and hybrid approaches in different drift scenarios. Out of all the compared algorithms, AUE2 provided best average classification accuracy while proving to be less memory consuming than other ensemble approaches.

In most areas, the causal agent of disease is Fusarium graminearum. This disease not only decreases product quality and efficiency but also has harmful effects on humans and animals by mycotoxin production. FHB discrimination requires experimental work in special conditions and also experts, but these facilities may not be available at customs and other related grain health testing centers. In this study, discriminating healthy wheat grains and the grains infected with F. graminearum was performed with an image-processing technique, an accurate, rapid, and nondestructive method. First, healthy and infected wheat grains were selected, and then digital images of samples were prepared in randomized mass method using cameras and lightening chamber. Then using the image-processing technique, a total of 21 texture characteristics were obtained for each grain. Discrimination and classification of healthy and infected grains were done with 100% accuracy using extracted texture characteristics and two techniques mentioned above.

The capability to detect out-of-distribution images is therefore crucial for many real-world applications. We divide out-of-distribution detection between novelty detection ---images of classes which are not in the training set but are related to those---, and anomaly detection ---images with classes which are unrelated to the training set. By related we mean they contain the same type of objects, like digits in MNIST and SVHN. Most existing work has focused on anomaly detection, and has addressed this problem considering networks trained with the cross-entropy loss. Differently from them, we propose to use metric learning which does not have the drawback of the softmax layer (inherent to cross-entropy methods), which forces the network to divide its prediction power over the learned classes.

By mapping the extracted regions from EUV observations onto HMI line-of-sight magnetograms we also include their magnetic characteristics. We computed shape measures from the segmented binary maps as well as first order and second order texture statistics from the segmented regions in the EUV images and magnetograms. These attributes were used for data mining investigations to identify the most performant rule to differentiate between coronal holes and filament channels. We applied several classifiers, namely Support Vector Machine, Linear Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest and found that all classification rules achieve good results in general, with linear SVM providing the best performances (with a true skill statistic of ~0.90). Additional information from magnetic field data systematically improves the performance across all four classifiers for the SPoCA detection.

Thanks to the file system which is a rich source of digital evidence that may prove or deny a digital crime. Yet, although there are many tools that can be used to extract potentially conclusive evidence from the file system, there is still a need to develop effective techniques for evaluating the extracted evidence and link it directly to a digital crime. Machine learning can be posed as a possible solution looming in the horizon. This article proposes an Enhanced Multiclass Support Vector Machine (EMSVM) model that aims to improve the classification performance. The EMSVM suggests a new technique in selecting the most effective set of parameters when building a SVM model. In addition, since the DF is considered a multiclass classification problem duo to the fact that a file system might be accecced by more than one application, the EMSVM enhances the class assignment mechanism by supporting multi-class classification. The article then investigates the applicability of the proposed model in analysing incriminating digital evidence by inspecting the historical activities of file systems to realize if a malicious program manipulated them.

Then the SVM( Support Vector Machine) is employed to merge the user's behavior characteristic values into the local search algorithm. And the ranking algorithm is optimized. The average accuracy rate of the local search rank results and the top ten documents correlation have improved to some extent,after integrated into the user behavior features.

While a number of image set based face recognition methods have been proposed in recent years, most of them model each face image set as a single linear subspace or as the union of linear subspaces, which may lose some discriminative information for face image set representation. To address this shortcoming, we propose exploiting statistics information as feature representations for face image sets and develop a localized multikernel metric learning algorithm to effectively combine different statistics for recognition. Moreover, we propose a localized multikernel multimetric learning method to jointly learn multiple feature-specific distance metrics in the kernel spaces, one for each statistic feature, to better exploit complementary information for recognition.

In this paper, the Support Vector Regression(SVR) methodology was adopted to estimate the true location of target based upon the measurement results of multi-source radar.

The objective of this research was to develop and introduce three new ensemble models, which were based on Complex Proportional Assessment of Alternatives (COPRAS), Logistic Regression (LR), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Random Forest (RF), and Frequency Ratio (FR) for spatial prediction of gully erosion with a case study at the Najafabad watershed (Iran). For this purpose, a total of 290 head-cut of gullies and 17 conditioning factors were collected and used to establish a geospatial database. Subsequently, FR was used to determine the spatial relationship between the conditioning factors and the head-cut of gullies, whereas RF, BRT, and LR were used to quantify the relative importance of these factors. In the next step, three ensemble gully erosion models, named COPRAS-FR-RF, COPRAS-FR-BRT, and COPRAS-FR-LR were developed and verified.

The spatial distributions of 12 periglacial landforms types were recorded in sub-Arctic landscape of northern Finland in 2032 grid squares at a resolution of 25 ha. First, three topographic variables were implemented into the eight modelling techniques (simple model), and then six other variables were added (three soil and three vegetation variables; complex model) to reflect the environmental conditions of each grid square. The predictive accuracy was measured by two methods: the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot, and the Kappa index (\u03ba), based on spatially independent model evaluation data. The mean AUC values of the simple models varied between 0\u00b7709 and 0\u00b7796, whereas the AUC values of the complex model ranged from 0\u00b7725 to 0\u00b7825. For both simple and complex models GAM, GLM, ANN and GBM provided the highest predictive performances based on both AUC and \u03ba values. The results encourage further applications of the novel modelling methods in geomorphology.

Such expert system has a promising prospect in various applications, including smart houses, gaming, healthcare, and robotics. However, recognizing human gestures in videos is one of the most challenging topics in computer vision, because of some irrelevant environmental factors like complex background, occlusion, lighting conditions, and so on. With the recent development of deep learning, many researchers have addressed this problem by building single deep networks to learn spatiotemporal features from video data. However, the performance is still unsatisfactory due to the limitation that the single deep networks are incapable of handling these challenges simultaneously. Hence, the extracted features cannot efficiently capture both relevant shape information and detailed spatiotemporal variation of the gestures. One solution to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks is to fuse multiple features from different models learned on multiple vision cues. Aiming at this objective, we present in this paper an effective multi-dimensional feature learning approach, termed as MultiD-CNN, for human gesture recognition in RGB-D videos. The key to our design is to learn high-level gesture representations by taking advantages from Convolutional Residual Networks (ResNets) for training extremely deep models and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (ConvLSTM) for dealing with time-series connections. More specifically, we first construct an architecture to simultaneously learn the spatiotemporal features from RGB and depth sequences through 3D ResNets which are then linked to a ConvLSTM to capture the temporal dependencies between them, and we show that they better combine appearance and motion information effectively. Second, to alleviate distractions from background and other variations, we propose a method that encodes the temporal information into a motion representation, while a two-stream architecture based on 2D-ResNets is then employed to extract deep features from this representation. Third, we investigate different fusion strategies at different levels for blending the classification results, and we show that integrating multiple ways of encoding the spatial and temporal information leads to a robust and stable spatiotemporal feature learning with better generalization capability. Finally, we perform different experiments to evaluate the performance of the investigated architectures on four kinds of challenging datasets, demonstrating that our approach is particularly impressive where it outperforms prior arts in both accuracy and efficiency.

However, Wrappers suffer from the fact that they only use a single classifier when selecting the features. The problem of using a single classifier is that each classifier is of a different nature and will have its own biases. This means that each classifier will select different feature subsets. To address this problem, this thesis aims to investigate the effects of using different classifiers for Wrapper feature selection. More specifically, it aims to investigate the effects of using different number of classifiers and classifiers of different nature. This aim is achieved by proposing a new data mining method called Wrapper-based Decision Trees (WDT). The WDT method has the ability to combine multiple classifiers from four different families, including Bayesian Network, Decision Tree, Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machine, to select relevant features and visualise the relationships among the selected features using decision trees. Specifically, the WDT method is applied to investigate three research questions of this thesis: (1) the effects of number of classifiers on feature selection results; (2) the effects of nature of classifiers on feature selection results; and (3) which of the two (i.e., number or nature of classifiers) has more of an effect on feature selection results. Two types of user preference datasets derived from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) are used with WDT to assist in answering these three research questions. The results from the investigation revealed that the number of classifiers and nature of classifiers greatly affect feature selection results. In terms of number of classifiers, the results showed that few classifiers selected many relevant features whereas many classifiers selected few relevant features. In addition, it was found that using three classifiers resulted in highly accurate feature subsets. In terms of nature of classifiers, it was showed that Decision Tree, Bayesian Network and Nearest Neighbour classifiers caused signficant differences in both the number of features selected and the accuracy levels of the features. A comparison of results regarding number of classifiers and nature of classifiers revealed that the former has more of an effect on feature selection than the latter. The thesis makes contributions to three communities: data mining, feature selection, and HCI. For the data mining community, this thesis proposes a new method called WDT which integrates the use of multiple classifiers for feature selection and decision trees to effectively select and visualise the most relevant features within a dataset. For the feature selection community, the results of this thesis have showed that the number of classifiers and nature of classifiers can truly affect the feature selection process. The results and suggestions based on the results can provide useful insight about classifiers when performing feature selection. For the HCI community, this thesis has showed the usefulness of feature selection for identifying a small number of highly relevant features for determining the preferences of different users.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "114302531", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8785253"}

Classification result of supervised SVM contained mixed objects and misclassifications of impervious surfaces and other urban features. This classification achieved 85.02% overall accuracy. Rule-based classifier performed better than supervised SVM resulting in finer discrimination of spatially and spectrally similar objects. The overall accuracy of rule-based classification was 93.07%.

For the three segmentation schemes, ten segmentation scale parameters were adopted (25-250, step 25), and modified Euclidean distance 3 index was further used to evaluate the segmented results to determine the optimal segmentation scheme and segmentation scale.

We apply a hybrid strategy which combines the strengths of top-down and bottom-up methods. The main contribution is the introduction of an active sampling strategy which applies a cascade of filters focusing on promising samples in an early stage and avoiding the pitfalls of RANSAC based approaches. Such filters are based on prior knowledge represented by (non-parametric) density distributions. Samples are pairs of surflets, i.e. 3D points together with normal vectors derived from a plane approximation of their neighborhood. Surflet pairs imply immediately important roof parameters such as azimuth, inclination and ridge height, as well as parameters for internal precision and consistency, giving a good base for assessment and ranking. Ranking of samples leads to a small number of promising hypotheses. Model selection is based on predictions for example of ridge positions which can easily be falsified based on the given observations.

For this reason, we explore the capabilities of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach to semantically enrich textured urban triangle meshes as generated from LiDAR or Multi-View Stereo (MVS). For each face within a mesh, a feature vector is computed and fed into a multi-branch 1D CNN. Ordinarily, CNNs are an end-to-end learning approach operating on regularly structured input data. Meshes, however, are not regularly structured. By calculating feature vectors, we enable the CNN to process mesh data. By these means, we combine explicit feature calculation and feature learning (hybrid model). Our model achieves close to 80% Overall Accuracy (OA) on dedicated test meshes.

A commonly used notion of similarity is the number of matches between $k$-mers ($k$-length subsequences) in the two sequences. Extending this definition, by considering two $k$-mers to match if their distance is at most $m$, yields better classification performance. This, however, makes the problem computationally much more complex. Known algorithms to compute this similarity have computational complexity that render them applicable only for small values of $k$ and $m$. In this work, we develop novel techniques to efficiently and accurately estimate the pairwise similarity score, which enables us to use much larger values of $k$ and $m$, and get higher predictive accuracy. This opens up a broad avenue of applying this classification approach to audio, images, and text sequences. Our algorithm achieves excellent approximation performance with theoretical guarantees. In the process we solve an open combinatorial problem, which was posed as a major hindrance to the scalability of existing solutions.

In many scenarios, stereo images quality could be affected by various degradations, such as asymmetric distortion. Accordingly, to guarantee the best quality of experience, robust and accurate reference-less metrics are required for quality assessment of stereoscopic content. Most existing stereo no-reference Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are not consistent with asymmetrical distortions. This paper presents a new no-reference stereoscopic image quality assessment metric using a human visual system (HVS) modeling and an advanced machine-learning algorithm. The proposed approach consists of two stages. In the first stage, cyclopean image is constructed considering the presence of binocular rivalry in order to cover the asymmetrically distorted part. In the second stage, gradient magnitude, relative gradient magnitude, and gradient orientation are extracted. These are used as a predictive source of information for the quality. In order to obtain the best overall performance against different databases, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) idea of machine learning combined with artificial neural network model has been adopted. The benchmark LIVE 3D phase-I, phase-II, and IRCCyN/IVC 3D databases have been used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed metric performance achieves high consistency with subjective assessment and outperforms the blind stereo IQA over various types of distortion.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.image.2019.115772", "venue": "Signal Process.

Each recording is represented by a third-order feature tensor generated by the auditory model. Thus, the ensemble of recordings is represented by a fourth-order data tensor created by stacking the third-order feature tensors associated to the recordings. To handle large data tensors and derive compact feature vectors suitable for classification, three multilinear subspace techniques are examined, namely the Non-Negative Tensor Factorization (NTF), the High-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), and the Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). Classification is performed by a Support Vector Machine. Stratified cross-validation tests on the GTZAN dataset and the ISMIR 2004 Genre one demonstrate the advantages of NTF and HOSVD versus MPCA.

We extract 4 CGT features from 56 regions across 40 intermediate grade CaP patients and evaluated the ability of CGT features to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) within 5 years of radical prostatectomy. Intermediate Gleason score 7 cancers represent the predictive borderline for BCR cases, where 50% of cases develop BCR. We found that CGT features outperformed 5 different sets of QH features, previously shown to be effective in CaP grading, when evaluated via a Random Forest classifier (66% accuracy for CGT features versus 55% for the next closest QH feature set), all comparisons being statistically significant.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISBI.2013.6556425", "venue": "2013 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging", "journal": "2013 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2124983997", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16459849", "2864393", "687983", "745031", "13693454", "206786900", "17498788", "72725084", "19898884", "39920243", "25464880"], "inbound_citations": ["21732359", "15501835", "121536083", "15326183", "8802865"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1754626"}

To address this issue, we propose a simple but effective strategy, that is, we propose a dual-discriminator (dual-D) adversarial learning system, in which, a global-D is used to make an overall evaluation for the synthetic image, and a local-D is proposed to densely evaluate the local regions of the synthetic image. More importantly, we build an adversarial attention mechanism which targets at better modeling hard-to-synthesize regions (e.g., tumor or lesion regions) based on the local-D. Experimental results show the robustness and accuracy of our method in synthesizing fine-grained target images from the corresponding source images. In particular, we evaluate our method on two datasets, i.e., to address the tasks of generating T2 MRI from T1 MRI for the brain tumor images and generating MRI from CT.

Although numerous studies exist to measure UBP of cross-country skiers, to date, no study has ever attempted to predict UBP of cross-country skiers. The purpose of this paper was to develop prediction models for estimating 10-s UBP \\({({\\rm UBP}_{10})}\\) and 60-s UBP \\({({\\rm UBP}_{60})}\\) of cross-country skiers using support vector machines (SVM). Four types of SVMs have been considered, they are as follows: SVM using the radial basis function kernel (SVM-RBF), SVM using the sigmoid kernel, SVM using the polynomial kernel, and SVM using the linear kernel. For comparison purposes, UBP prediction models based on multilayer perceptron and multiple linear regression have also been developed. The dataset used in this study includes data of 77 subjects. Age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, maximal heart rate, maximal oxygen uptake, and exercise time are the predictor variables, and \\({{\\rm UBP}_{10}}\\) and \\({{\\rm UBP}_{60}}\\) are the target variables. Several UBP prediction models have been developed by using the combination of the predictor variables to predict \\({{\\rm UBP}_{10}}\\) and \\({{\\rm UBP}_{60}}\\). By using 10-fold cross-validation on the datasets, the performance of the models has been evaluated by calculating their standard error of estimates (SEEs) and multiple correlation coefficients (Rs). The results show that SVM-RBF-based UBP prediction models perform much better (i.e., yield lower SEEs and higher Rs) than the prediction models developed by other regression methods and can be safely used for the prediction of UBP of cross-country skiers.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s13369-015-1588-y", "venue": null, "journal": "Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2065493084", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1841429", "9375156", "23480741", "24398471", "128783907", "22162588", "19196574", "1971062", "18315563", "195912689", "14561315", "12512548", "18073068", "19393235", "62688042", "8778548", "19520039"], "inbound_citations": ["212702668", "113633701", "8320105"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18929248"}

Person re-identification involves two main steps: feature representation and metric learning. Although the keep it simple and straightforward (KISS) metric learning method for discriminative distance metric learning has been shown to be effective for the person re-identification, the estimation of the inverse of a covariance matrix is unstable and indeed may not exist when the training set is small, resulting in poor performance. Here, we present dual-regularized KISS (DR-KISS) metric learning. By regularizing the two covariance matrices, DR-KISS improves on KISS by reducing overestimation of large eigenvalues of the two estimated covariance matrices and, in doing so, guarantees that the covariance matrix is irreversible. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analyses for supporting the motivations. Specifically, we first prove why the regularization is necessary.

In order to solve the illumination variation problem, a new feature set is formed by extracting features using histogram of gradients (HoG) and linear phase quantization (LPQ) techniques, which are combined to form a single feature-set to describe features in illumination variant natural scenes. Pre-processing is applied to reduce the search space and improve results, and as the humans are in constant motion in the frames, a search space pruning algorithm is applied to reduce the search space and improve detection accuracy. Non-maximal suppression is also applied for improved performance. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier is used for fast and accurate detection. Most of the current state-of-the-art detectors face numerous problems including false, missed, and inaccurate detections. The proposed detector model shows good performance, which was validated using relevant UCF and CDW test data-sets. In order to compare the performance of the proposed methodology with the state-of-the-art detectors, some selected detected frames were chosen considering their Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. These curves are plotted to compare and evaluate the results based on miss rates and true positives rates. The results show the proposed model achieves best results.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSEng.2017.18", "venue": "2017 25th International Conference on Systems Engineering (ICSEng)", "journal": "2017 25th International Conference on Systems Engineering (ICSEng)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2773964117", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206590483", "2559322", "61571454", "8356979", "2161048", "7370064", "62667786", "7800101", "219903", "206764948", "2451341", "14166959", "41369870", "6735187"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9091209"}

Then, vibration measurements, resulting from the machine under condition monitoring, can be imported and processed directly by the already trained SVM, eliminating thus the need of training the SVM with experimental data of the specific defective bearing. A key aspect of the method is the data preprocessing approach, which among others, includes order analysis, in order to overcome problems related to sudden changes of the shaft rotating speed. Moreover, frequency domain features both from the raw signal as well as from the demodulated signal are used as inputs to the SVM classifiers for a two-stage recognition and classification procedure. At the first stage, a SVM classifier separates the normal condition signals from the faulty signals. At the second stage, a SVM classifier recognizes and categorizes the type of the fault. The effectiveness of the method tested in one literature established experimental test case and in three different industrial test cases, including a total number of 34 measurements.

The novelty of our DFA-SVM method comes from the integration of DFA, face class modeling, and SVM for face detection. First, DFA derives a discriminating feature vector by combining the input image, its 1-D Haar wavelet representation, and its amplitude projections. While the Haar wavelets produce an effective representation for object detection, the amplitude projections capture the vertical symmetric distributions and the horizontal characteristics of human face images. Second, face class modeling estimates the probability density function of the face class and defines a distribution-based measure for face and nonface classification. The distribution-based measure thus separates the input patterns into three classes: the face class (patterns close to the face class), the nonface class (patterns far away from the face class), and the undecided class (patterns neither close to nor far away from the face class). Finally, SVM together with the distribution-based measure classifies the patterns in the undecided class into either the face class or the nonface class. Experiments using images from the MIT-CMU test sets demonstrate the feasibility of our new face detection method.

Central to the phosphorylation process is the recognition of specific target sites by protein kinases followed by the covalent attachment of phosphate groups to the amino acids serine, threonine, or tyrosine. The experimental identification as well as computational prediction of phosphorylation sites (P-sites) has proved to be a challenging problem. Computational methods have focused primarily on extracting predictive features from the local, one-dimensional sequence information surrounding phosphorylation sites.ResultsWe characterized the spatial context of phosphorylation sites and assessed its usability for improved phosphorylation site predictions. We identified 750 non-redundant, experimentally verified sites with three-dimensional (3D) structural information available in the protein data bank (PDB) and grouped them according to their respective kinase family. We studied the spatial distribution of amino acids around phosphorserines, phosphothreonines, and phosphotyrosines to extract signature 3D-profiles. Characteristic spatial distributions of amino acid residue types around phosphorylation sites were indeed discernable, especially when kinase-family-specific target sites were analyzed. To test the added value of using spatial information for the computational prediction of phosphorylation sites, Support Vector Machines were applied using both sequence as well as structural information. When compared to sequence-only based prediction methods, a small but consistent performance improvement was obtained when the prediction was informed by 3D-context information.ConclusionWhile local one-dimensional amino acid sequence information was observed to harbor most of the discriminatory power, spatial context information was identified as relevant for the recognition of kinases and their cognate target sites and can be used for an improved prediction of phosphorylation sites.

We incorporate both known and predicted user anchors across the networks as constraints to facilitate the transfer of context information to achieve accurate user alignment. Both network embedding and user alignment are inferred under a unified optimization framework with negative sampling adopted to ensure scalability. Also, variants of the proposed framework, including the incorporation of higher-order structural features, are also explored for further boosting the alignment accuracy.

For addressing the above issues, it is reasonable to establish a transitional space with interpretable representation as a bridge to associate text and image. So we propose a text-to-image synthesis approach named Bridge-like Generative Adversarial Networks (Bridge-GAN). Its main contributions are: (1) A transitional space is established as a bridge for improving content consistency, where the interpretable representation can be learned by guaranteeing the key visual information from given text descriptions. (2) A ternary mutual information objective is designed for optimizing the transitional space and enhancing both the visual reality and content consistency.

People get uneducated and that is how they follow a pattern that could lead to a variety of diseases difficult and expensive to treat. The problem addressed in this research is that must Mexicans do not know how nor what to eat. The research is trying to avoid people having to start medical treatment by suggesting to change an unhealthy meal for a similar healthy meal that provides the energy and the nutrients necessary. Preventing is the first step to achieving the purpose of this project; if Mexicans adopt a healthy food regimen many food-related diseases could be prevented. The solution developed is a multi-platform mobile application that integrates a chat using a Natural Language Understanding API. The chat is a bot with whom users can message about food related topics and the purpose of the bot is to provide users with a suggestion to replace meals by giving them ideas of new meals and healthy recipes. Recipes given to the user are based on a whole-foods plant-based diet; this diet suggest meals based on fruits, vegetables, tubers, whole grains, and legumes. Researchers from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (2013) state that plant-based diets may work better for weight loss, because they do not focus on portion control or calorie counting. The research executed an evaluation on Mexican volunteers who believe the solution was good and they may continue to use it if they could, they found the interface easy to use and understand, but the arrangement of the sections was confusing due to the order of actions. However, results on a change of their food regimen could not be recorded since in order to see changes on a user food-regimen the application must be user for a longer period of time.

To avoid generating vague details, a novel residual structure is designed in the sub-confrontation GAN to deliver richer original image information to the deeper layers. The parent-confrontation GAN includes an image generation part and a discrimination part. The discrimination part of parent-confrontation GAN includes global and local discriminator, which benefits the reconstruction of overall coherency of the repaired image while obtaining local details.

Computational identification of glycosylation sites in protein sequences becomes increasingly important in the post-genomic era. A new encoding scheme was employed to improve the prediction of mucin-type O-glycosylation sites in mammalian proteins.ResultsA new protein bioinformatics tool, CKSAAP_OGlySite, was developed to predict mucin-type O-glycosylation serine/threonine (S/T) sites in mammalian proteins. Using the composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (CKSAAP) based encoding scheme, the proposed method was trained and tested in a new and stringent O-glycosylation dataset with the assistance of Support Vector Machine (SVM). When the ratio of O-glycosylation to non-glycosylation sites in training datasets was set as 1:1, 10-fold cross-validation tests showed that the proposed method yielded a high accuracy of 83.1% and 81.4% in predicting O-glycosylated S and T sites, respectively. Based on the same datasets, CKSAAP_OGlySite resulted in a higher accuracy than the conventional binary encoding based method (about +5.0%). When trained and tested in 1:5 datasets, the CKSAAP encoding showed a more significant improvement than the binary encoding. We also merged the training datasets of S and T sites and integrated the prediction of S and T sites into one single predictor (i.e. S+T predictor). Either in 1:1 or 1:5 datasets, the performance of this S+T predictor was always slightly better than those predictors where S and T sites were independently predicted, suggesting that the molecular recognition of O-glycosylated S/T sites seems to be similar and the increase of the S+T predictor's accuracy may be a result of expanded training datasets. Moreover, CKSAAP_OGlySite was also shown to have better performance when benchmarked against two existing predictors.ConclusionBecause of CKSAAP encoding's ability of reflecting characteristics of the sequences surrounding mucin-type O-glycosylation sites, CKSAAP_ OGlySite has been proved more powerful than the conventional binary encoding based method. This suggests that it can be used as a competitive mucin-type O-glycosylation site predictor to the biological community.

For removing snowflakes from a single image, we proposed a composition generative adversarial network. Different from the previous generative adversarial networks, our generator network comprises clean background module and a snow mask estimate module. The clean background module aims to generate a clear image from an input snowy image, and snow mask estimate module is used to produce the snow mask in an input image. During the training step, we put forward a composition loss between the input snowy image and composition of the generated clean image and estimated snow mask.

Instead, we use a fully convolutional neural network as the segmentor to generate segmentation label maps, and propose a novel adversarial critic network with a multi-scale L1 loss function to force the critic and segmentor to learn both global and local features that capture long- and short-range spatial relationships between pixels. In our SegAN framework, the segmentor and critic networks are trained in an alternating fashion in a min-max game: The critic is trained by maximizing a multi-scale loss function, while the segmentor is trained with only gradients passed along by the critic, with the aim to minimize the multi-scale loss function. We show that such a SegAN framework is more effective and stable for the segmentation task, and it leads to better performance than the state-of-the-art U-net segmentation method. We tested our SegAN method using datasets from the MICCAI BRATS brain tumor segmentation challenge.

The application of neural networks and neurocomputing to problems in robotics and control is a goal pursued by several research groups(e.g. Bavarians, Anderson2 and his references) There are several reasons for this interest. Viewed asa problem that seeks a solution, questions in adaptive control and in robot control can potentially beaddressed effectively by systems that can learn from example, learn from experience, and possessrobustness. Several neural network models have demonstrated such properties. Viewed as solutionsthat seek a problem, neural networks, which at present are ineffective as large -scale systems becauseof scaling problems, could potentially be effective in handling small -scale problems.

In this paper, we propose a global relative position space based pooling (GRPSP) method to replace the absolute position information with global relative position information, by which the discriminative features can be well aligned and thereby the intra-class variation is reduced effectively. Specifically, the discriminative features containing both absolute position information and appearance information are extracted by a convolution neural network (CNN). We then transform the absolute positions into global relative positions, and estimate position probabilities of locating at discrete representatives of global relative position space. Accordingly, the joint probabilities of different kinds of features locating at different representative positions can be calculated, and constitute the pooling vector. Lastly, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained for classification. Experimental results on public and self-building challenging datasets both show that our proposed method can improve various CNNs and is the state-of-the-art.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2019.07.098", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2967060476", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202143190"}

With the growth of new credit applicants and financial markets, the possibility of credit problem occurrence also become higher. Thus, it becomes important for a financial institution to conduct a preliminary selection to the credit applicants. In order to do that, credit scoring becomes one of the models used by a financial institution to perform a preliminary selection of potential customer. One of the most common techniques used to develop a credit scoring model is data mining classification task. However, this technique provides difficulties in classifying imbalanced data distribution. It is because imbalanced data problem may lead the classifier to perform misclassification by classified all of the data into majority class and perform poorly on minority class. In the case of credit scoring, credit data also have imbalanced data distribution. Therefore, classifying a credit data with imbalanced data distribution using unappropriated technique may lead the classification provides a wrong decision result for a financial institution. In this study, several methods for handle imbalanced data problem are ::: identified. Moreover, an improvement of credit scoring model with imbalanced data problem in a financial institution using SMOTE-SVM model is also proposed in this study. This study is conducted in five phases which are data collection, data pre-processing, feature selection, ::: classification, validation, and evaluation. For the experiments using SMOTE-SVM model, the experiments are conducted by taking a consideration in different data ratio and nearest neighbours used in SMOTE. The result of experiments provides that the accuracy and performance result are improved along with the balanced data using SMOTE-SVM model. The performance measurement using 10-fold cross validation and confusion matrix shows that SMOTE-SVM model can correctly classify most of the data in each class with the good result of accuracy, class precision, and class recall.

In this paper, problems related to the geo-referenciation of census data are considered.

The formulation of a new method based on a multi-relational data mining approach is proposed. It takes advantage of the representation and inference techniques developed in the field of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). In particular, the expressive power of predicate logic is profitably used to represent both spatial relations and background knowledge, such as spatial hierarchies and rules for spatial qualitative reasoning. The logical notions of generality order and of the downward refinement operator on the space of patterns are profitably used to define both the search space and the search strategy. The proposed method has been implemented in the ILP system SPADA (Spatial Pattern Discovery Algorithm). SPADA has been interfaced both to a module for the extraction of spatial features from a spatial database and to a module for numerical attribute discretization.

Unsurprisingly, it is notably more difficult to reliably representthe sparser regions of such multivariate distributions and in particular combinations of attributes which are absent from the original sample. In the literature this is commonly known as sampling zeros for which no systematic solution has been proposed so far. In this paper, two machine learning algorithms, from the family of deep generative models,are proposed for the problem of population synthesis and with particular attention to the problem of sampling zeros. Specifically, we introduce the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and the Variational Autoencoder(VAE), and adapt these algorithms for a large-scale population synthesis application. The models are implemented on a Danish travel survey with a feature-space of more than 60 variables. The models are validated in a cross-validation scheme and a set of new metrics for the evaluation of the sampling-zero problem is proposed. Results show how these models are able to recover sampling zeros while keeping the estimation of truly impossible combinations, the structural zeros, at a comparatively low level. Particularly, for a low dimensional experiment, the VAE, the marginal sampler and the fully random sampler generate 5%, 21% and 26%, respectively, more structural zeros per sampling zero generated by the WGAN, while for a high dimensional case, these figures escalate to 44%, 2217% and 170440%, respectively.

At present, environmental air quality measurement mainly adopts the method that setting air quality detector at specific monitoring points in cities and timing sampling analysis, which is easy to be restricted by time and space factors. Some air quality measurement algorithms related to deep learning mostly adopt a single convolutional neural network to train the whole image, which will ignore the difference of different parts of the image. In this paper, we propose a method for air quality measurement based on double-channel convolutional neural network ensemble learning to solve the problem of feature extraction for different parts of environmental images. Our method mainly includes two aspects: ensemble learning of double-channel convolutional neural network and self-learning weighted feature fusion. We constructed a double-channel convolutional neural network, used each channel to train different parts of the environment images for feature extraction. We propose a feature weight self-learning method, which weights and concatenates the extracted feature vectors, and uses the fused feature vectors to measure air quality. Our method can be applied to the two tasks of air quality grade measurement and air quality index (AQI) measurement.

Yet, their accuracy drops dramatically as the number of reasoning steps increases. We present the first formal framework to study such empirical observations, addressing the ambiguity, redundancy, incompleteness, and inaccuracy that the use of language introduces when representing a hidden conceptual space. Our formal model uses two interrelated spaces: a conceptual meaning space that is unambiguous and complete but hidden, and a linguistic symbol space that captures a noisy grounding of the meaning space in the symbols or words of a language. ::: We apply this framework to study the connectivity problem in undirected graphs---a core reasoning problem that forms the basis for more complex multi-hop reasoning. We show that it is indeed possible to construct a high-quality algorithm for detecting connectivity in the (latent) meaning graph, based on an observed noisy symbol graph, as long as the noise is below our quantified noise level and only a few hops are needed. On the other hand, we also prove an impossibility result: if a query requires a large number (specifically, logarithmic in the size of the meaning graph) of hops, no reasoning system operating over the symbol graph is likely to recover any useful property of the meaning graph. This highlights a fundamental barrier for a class of reasoning problems and systems, and suggests the need to limit the distance between the two spaces, rather than investing in multi-hop reasoning with \"many\" hops.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1901.02522", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2909295022", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2854390", "7771402", "207167677", "798501", "1255845", "2941443", "172064600", "6829589", "12416658", "18985848", "62066129", "15197674", "2498076", "10741411", "3623373", "7145148", "20638934", "957320"], "inbound_citations": ["195357275", "88501934"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57759341"}

In this context, two common learning algorithms, plain k-NN classification and Random Forest are compared with two distance function learning-based techniques, learning from equivalence constraints and the intrinsic Random Forest similarity on a set of genetic benchmark datasets.

Build the relational model of equal-voltage drop discharge time and actual capacity and the prediction model of the equal-voltage drop discharge time are built based on GAAA-ELM. GAAA is applied to optimize the weight and threshold of ELM. Lithium-ion battery RUL is predicted by the proposed method based on NASA lithium-ion battery data sets.

Facial expression recognition models have shown good performance in a facial expression image dataset that expresses emotion without considering speaking effect. However, in reality, humans often express emotions by speaking and moving the muscles around the mouth. Therefore, the lack of consideration of speech leads to unsatisfactory emotion recognition results. In this paper, we investigated two points to be considered in learning a facial expression recognition model. First, we confirmed whether the information around a mouth induces the recognition model in speech act to misrecognition like the case of a facial expression recognition in non-speech acts or it has valid information for facial expression recognition. Second, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based data augmentation has been performed to cover the problem in which the accuracy of the recognition model in speech acts is low because of the relatively small variance about the subject in RML dataset. The results showed that the information around the mouth made facial expression recognition in speech acts exhibit higher performance, unlike the case of facial expression recognition in non-speech acts.

This monitoring method reduces the overall maintenance cost of machinery and prevents the occurrence of failure by prediction. This prior detection of tool wear, in turn, reduces the machine downtime and enhances machining efficiency. The progressive wear of a cutting tool can be detrimental to the quality of the machined surface, tolerances, dimensional accuracy and also adversely change the work or tool geometry. So the requirement of a diagnosing system with consistency is vital. Method/Analysis: This study deals with acquiring vibrational signals using accelerometer during turning operation performed on a lathe machine with good and fault simulated single point cutting tool. From the acquired signals, certain statistical features such as standard deviation, kurtosis etc. were extracted and substantial features were recognised using a decision tree algorithm. Those recognised features were deliberated in classifying data using random forest classifier. Findings: The accuracy of classification by the random forest classifier for all the signals combined together yields 74.4%. When considering feed rate and depth of cut as varying parameters yields an accuracy around 84%. Further an accuracy of around 88% was observed when considering depth of cut as varying parameter. When considering every experiment as a separate model yields around 95% classification accuracy. Applications/Improvements: This research work analysed the utilization of random forest classifier to identify the tool wear. It can be used in identifying the tool wear which affects surface finish, dimensional accuracy and tolerance of the part during machining. This work can be improved by analysing with different classifier algorithms to efficiently predict the tool wear.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.17485/ijst/2016/v9i33/101339", "venue": null, "journal": "Indian journal of science and technology", "mag_id": "2521434683", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64272643"}

In the context of GUIs, a test case is a sequence of events to be executed which may detect faults in the application. However, a test case may be infeasible if one or more of the events in the event sequence are disabled or made inaccessible by a previously executed event (e.g., a button may be disabled until another GUI widget enables it). These infeasible test cases terminate prematurely and waste resources, so software testers would like to modify the test suite execution to run only feasible test cases. Current techniques focus on repairing the test cases to make them feasible, but this relies on executing all test cases, attempting to repair the test cases, and then repeating this process until a stopping condition has been met. We propose avoiding infeasible test cases altogether by predicting which test cases are infeasible using two supervised machine learning methods: support vector machines (SVMs) and grammar induction. We experiment with three feature extraction techniques and demonstrate the success of the machine learning algorithms for classifying infeasible GUI test cases in several subject applications.

Thus, it is used to assist the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Like other neuroimaging modalities used for PD diagnosis, most of the total intensity of 18F-DMFP-PET images is concentrated in the striatum. However, other regions can also be useful for diagnostic purposes. An appropriate delimitation of the regions of interest contained in 18F-DMFP-PET data is crucial to improve the automatic diagnosis of PD. In this manuscript we propose a novel methodology to preprocess 18F-DMFP-PET data that improves the accuracy of computer aided diagnosis systems for PD. First, the data were segmented using an algorithm based on Hidden Markov Random Field. As a result the voxels of each neuroimage was divided into 4 maps according to the intensity and the neighborhood of the voxels. The maps were then individually normalized so that the shape of their histograms could be modeled by a Gaussian distribution with equal parameters for all the neuroimages. This approach was evaluated using a dataset with 87 neuroimages from parkinsonian patients. After these preprocessing steps, a Support Vector Machine classifier was used to separate idiopathic and non-idiopathic PD.

By defining two convolutional neural networks (G-Network and D-Network) and introducing an adversarial procedure between them during the training process, GAN has ability to generate good quality images that look like natural images from a random vector. Besides image generation, GAN may have potential to deal with wide range of real world problems. In this paper, we follow the basic idea of GAN and propose a novel model for image saliency detection, which is called Supervised Adversarial Networks (SAN). Specifically, SAN also trains two models simultaneously: the G-Network takes natural images as inputs and generates corresponding saliency maps (synthetic saliency maps), and the D-Network is trained to determine whether one sample is a synthetic saliency map or ground-truth saliency map. However, different from GAN, the proposed method uses fully supervised learning to learn both G-Network and D-Network by applying class labels of the training set. Moreover, a novel kind of layer call conv-comparison layer is introduced into the D-Network to further improve the saliency performance by forcing the high-level feature of synthetic saliency maps and ground-truthes as similar as possible. Experimental results on Pascal VOC 2012 database show that the SAN model can generate high quality saliency maps for many complicate natural images.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "1704.07242", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2557190", "venue": "International Conference on Graphic and Image Processing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2998480043,2609774157", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["641747", "63581535", "13002849", "2329405", "4246903", "8620299", "17274074", "1033682", "13740328", "6200260", "16991836", "16489696", "12803511", "1099052", "14155902", "24883084", "1872130", "11758569", "1687220", "1450294", "207224096", "195455410", "11982950", "195451538", "15876696", "14102203"], "inbound_citations": ["202786964", "53569876", "13312544", "5081394"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14670434"}

Accurate Chinese LPR (CLPR) is determined by three factors: training dataset, feature extractor, and classifier. Most license plates with benchmark dataset contain only letters and numbers; thus, the authors build a large dataset for CLPR. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to extract inherent image features, on all levels of abstraction. CNNs can be used for classification if they have a sufficient number of fully connected layers. This implies that CNNs must be trained using gradient descent-based methods, which often yields sub-optimal results. Extreme learning machines (ELMs) demonstrate impressive performance on classification, with good generalisation. Therefore, the authors propose a novel deep architecture for CLPR which combines a CNN and an ELM. Firstly, a CNN without fully connected layers, working as a feature extractor, learns deep features associated with characters in written Chinese. Then, a kernel-based ELM (KELM) classifier, which accepts CNN features as input, is utilised for classification.

With patterns we mean any relations, regularities or structures that are present within a source of data. By detecting significant patterns in the data, a system can make predictions about new data coming from the same source. We can say that the system has acquired generalisation power by learning a pattern in the data from that source. There are many important problems that can only be solved using this approach, ranging from bio informatics to web retrieval. In recent years, pattern analysis has become a standard method for software engineering, and is used in many commercial products. This thesis describes several algorithms and compares their performances on different datasets. This to research the possibilities that we have when we want to extract possibly interesting relationships between datapoints. The improvement of these kind of techniques can be important for future research because with increasing computational power, increasingly larger datasets can be analyzed, so that we can find relationships we never knew existed. One of these datasets is called SCOP, or the Structured Classification of Proteins, which we can analyze to better understand how our body works and how different proteins are related. To detect these relationships we use an algorithm called Regularized Least Squares. Also its performance is compared to a very similar algorithm, called SVMLight, and several other machine learning techniques, namely Naive Bayes, KStar and Random Forest. We show that the performance depends on the problem that is analyzed, where things like linear separability and the number of examples in the dataset have a notable influence. Nevertheless, the results are stable on most datasets, resulting in a prediction system that can be considered as a reliable advise-tool for making decisions about that dataset. A rapidly developing field within this research is multiclass classification, which extends the binary classification into a method that can handle problems with multiple classes. The multiclass extension for the algorithm that we consider is a joint kernel approach which also provides stable results and could be optimized to improve performance even more.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2107478220", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9790719", "2594118", "89141", "47109072", "45944920", "10097148", "1115550", "35730151", "2912265", "13391792", "17424444", "60488836", "53940663", "43772422", "3048092"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16567375"}

TL uses a well-trained feature space in a specific task domain to improve performance in new tasks with insufficient training data. TL with rich feature representations, such as features of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), shows high generalization ability across different task domains. However, such TL is still insufficient in making machine learning attain generalization ability comparable to that of the human brain. To examine if the internal representation of the brain could be used to achieve more efficient TL, we introduce a method for TL mediated by human brains. Our method transforms feature representations of audiovisual inputs in CNNs into those in activation patterns of individual brains via their association learned ahead using measured brain responses. Then, to estimate labels reflecting human cognition and behavior induced by the audiovisual inputs, the transformed representations are used for TL. We demonstrate that our brain-mediated TL (BTL) shows higher performance in the label estimation than the standard TL. In addition, we illustrate that the estimations mediated by different brains vary from brain to brain, and the variability reflects the individual variability in perception. Thus, our BTL provides a framework to improve the generalization ability of machine-learning feature representations and enable machine learning to estimate human-like cognition and behavior, including individual variability.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1905.10037", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2998664092,2945310593", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["2915490", "53819217", "382735", "9267175", "6161478", "11745796", "4447458", "15979590", "1241368", "140099951", "10505383", "3129522", "5084719", "8435667", "79003", "16447573", "6105164", "27072109", "5043815", "10788863", "146121034", "206592191", "740063", "6383532", "14124313", "5929952", "206592152", "17806137", "10224573", "2807360", "7823841", "20617083"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:165163922"}

We perform an extensive experimental evaluation between ReForeSt and MLlib by taking advantage of the Google Cloud Platform1. We test the performances and the scalability of ReForeSt and MLlib on several real world datasets. Results confirm that ReForeSt outperforms MLlib both in terms of memory and computational efficiency, and classification performances.

In this study, new PPG sensors were proposed and developed successfully to provide portable and inexpensive solutions for AVF assessments. To develop the sensor, at first, by combining the dimensionless number analysis and the optical Beer Lambert's law, five input features were derived for the SVM classifier. In the next step, to increase the signal-noise ratio (SNR) of PPG signals, the front-end readout circuitries were designed to fully use the dynamic range of analog-digital converter (ADC) by controlling the circuitries gain and the light intensity of light emitted diode (LED). Digital signal processing algorithms were proposed next to check and fix signal anomalies. Finally, the class-weighted SVM classifiers employed five different kernel functions to assess AVF quality. The assessment results were provided to doctors for diagonosis and detemining ensuing proper treatments.

In this work we propose a generic iterative framework for fine-grained categorization and dataset bootstrapping that handles these three challenges. Using deep metric learning with humans in the loop, we learn a low dimensional feature embedding with anchor points on manifolds for each category. These anchor points capture intra-class variances and remain discriminative between classes. In each round, images with high confidence scores from our model are sent to humans for labeling. By comparing with exemplar images, labelers mark each candidate image as either a \"true positive\" or a \"false positive\". True positives are added into our current dataset and false positives are regarded as \"hard negatives\" for our metric learning model. Then the model is retrained with an expanded dataset and hard negatives for the next round.

Converging with this shift, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach in the literature that: 1) fuses facial expression, shoulder gesture, and audio cues for dimensional and continuous prediction of emotions in valence and arousal space, 2) compares the performance of two state-of-the-art machine learning techniques applied to the target problem, the bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (BLSTM-NNs), and Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR), and 3) proposes an output-associative fusion framework that incorporates correlations and covariances between the emotion dimensions. Evaluation of the proposed approach has been done using the spontaneous SAL data from four subjects and subject-dependent leave-one-sequence-out cross validation. The experimental results obtained show that: 1) on average, BLSTM-NNs outperform SVR due to their ability to learn past and future context, 2) the proposed output-associative fusion framework outperforms feature-level and model-level fusion by modeling and learning correlations and patterns between the valence and arousal dimensions, and 3) the proposed system is well able to reproduce the valence and arousal ground truth obtained from human coders.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/T-AFFC.2011.9", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2164186291", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["41742629", "31293145", "15343954", "60236821", "25116121", "14139252", "61207648", "753606", "16894759", "6177301", "27236993", "17596374", "5962753", "14727192", "743542", "84224", "207146090", "17641251", "18997887", "1856462", "19032295", "1222436", "38824611", "14184285", "2342702", "5644118", "17979447", "141647890", "9678394", "5463660", "12469750", "9903828", "143333487", "2970361", "7551359", "41741618", "143238419", "15751455", "7824415", "2373348", "8274232", "8736789", "145278842", "142543849", "143219855", "64543020", "18375389", "3529762", "306118", "6198122", "11717268", "18025567", "482012"], "inbound_citations": ["40287641", "145035207", "10736337", "88508944", "195884177", "12519170", "56169926", "39637496", "9022610", "3328591", "109935496", "174800827", "207902087", "4176780", "239954", "17894996", "8246064", "7468171", "59063532", "164785904", "30291958", "7961100", "2306365", "206651806", "18400336", "17870359", "2301292", "195848105", "203642086", "4405559", "4654993", "17715113", "8794437", "157057606", "14040703", "11062513", "211078313", "13521970", "1880480", "34374894", "1473293", "52896590", "145832359", "54442741", "52860504", "195883717", "19166588", "7051771", "9779424", "70039949", "3401278", "17511150", "29111448", "11082065", "204785105", "53034519", "204838070", "2567695", "13708738", "15384385", "198229728", "1146833", "151269848", "5326415", "59524350", "11954891", "1814294", "11288368", "16471884", "19210180", "8275347", "13492318", "16028962", "56629792", "21892822", "16262181", "30547896", "3441087", "18146524", "11510950", "198315717", "1324483", "10137425", "16075942", "69177", "4358006", "3401289", "10052420", "51941941", "14765650", "23477696", "37515850", "182173418", "40793365", "12130556", "21698484", "205398802", "7100544", "9275216", "184478824", "14014383", "18014114", "54475671", "16167260", "38063358", "37836983", "17587414", "1734037", "55073919", "16883804", "121298049", "35602792", "2698859", "12654277", "4571872", "254728", "14484213", "203621373", "3671174", "16502262", "3220161", "40126767", "3419803", "4751652", "9533362", "6293489", "34492191", "64337120", "2092520", "15022227", "84187199", "198930941", "49208121", "18584781", "52127545", "211010737", "28891511", "18288644", "10264826", "50774072", "207941491", "21700697", "35197124", "55761918", "1136704", "17152613", "2468004", "15462777", "6718698", "18384216", "54220833", "59395696", "6813870", "198930267", "49565742", "14116122", "17665184", "13598132", "215476049", "34761137", "85537", "52192205", "201693248", "57761115", "202687743", "47019543", "198981322", "198345179", "219176", "207930285", "44859968", "9819568", "1884509", "24563400", "70350023", "11326074", "755370", "8963509", "16086080", "162168529", "14829012", "18163217", "53040520", "52016785", "869652", "59945339", "143424119", "7263451", "46960891", "46960891", "5985466", "737702", "2855149", "1012438", "4129626", "9490684", "155980590", "51748797", "210176182", "14674936", "16052627", "201058721", "28918305", "3606261", "209320956", "3084800", "18555233", "10469148", "842530", "53809508", "17563438", "14374619", "21729394", "11739806", "450048", "39504153", "23050053", "207880225", "211003712", "49876", "1985740", "202778036", "52980643", "5787933", "3393506", "29282613", "201069157", "3559264", "10712305", "17666758", "289318", "52985198", "51691641", "13815535", "1272805", "5038576", "24788233", "13374232", "8909542", "10285213", "13741765", "208205914", "53138215", "3399725"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9296806"}

Also, we describe, for the first time, an effective way to combine the individual predictors, at will, to a single consensus prediction method.ResultsWe assess the statistical significance of the performance of each prediction scheme and conclude that Hidden Markov Model based methods, HMM-B2TMR, ProfTMB and PRED-TMBB, are currently the best predictors, according to either the per-residue accuracy, the segments overlap measure (SOV) or the total number of proteins with correctly predicted topologies in the test set. Furthermore, we show that the available predictors perform better when only transmembrane \u03b2-barrel domains are used for prediction, rather than the precursor full-length sequences, even though the HMM-based predictors are not influenced significantly. The consensus prediction method performs significantly better than each individual available predictor, since it increases the accuracy up to 4% regarding SOV and up to 15% in correctly predicted topologies.ConclusionsThe consensus prediction method described in this work, optimizes the predicted topology with a dynamic programming algorithm and is implemented in a web-based application freely available to non-commercial users at http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/ConBBPRED.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC545999", "pubmed_id": "15647112", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-6-7", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1821139715", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["43775174", "8383706", "27594992", "12110158", "12524030", "19913796", "32431958", "34498304", "45141265", "22980638", "19911015", "34206232", "8671861", "205229665", "31866940", "8538784", "24830340", "6923178", "39301639", "14923627", "16583832", "9162671", "43395726", "8453980", "16403569", "19393385", "27834265", "45243536", "26407325", "6829315", "2558294", "4412566", "45663016", "12320886", "20231287", "86844549", "24883519", "10409385", "13117696", "24055196", "19618918", "18250438", "15267366", "9730905", "13627354", "6831936", "25104096", "4025084", "123997496", "10408361", "18376554", "12707692", "8615985", "20809403", "14601289", "196604757", "30380108", "9175018", "20782744", "33901650", "17354352", "14018504", "16656940"], "inbound_citations": ["14206681", "17919975", "15138822", "37207716", "6560384", "196632952", "23307511", "166221342", "208521159", "54631333", "25372443", "12172609", "205624975", "14344091", "214709487", "215538278", "16374498", "8348978", "1716530", "46236241", "18826032", "14348839", "724110", "6441558", "18857489", "6606123", "2059868", "113406029", "36281943", "55370070", "7666553", "8178775", "10787245", "885356", "1816446", "2430777", "215544284", "499054", "14231582", "16204448", "8168047", "15827219", "10400455", "16675389", "17742491", "52311834", "14687217", "5068710", "214846932", "15184168"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15390763"}

The existing methods solve the problem by spatial interpolation based on geographical statistics methods, without considering that urban vehicle emission varies by locations non-linearly and depends on many complex external factors. To tackle the spatial sparsity of vehicle remote sensing data, we design a data augmentation strategy based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which leverages prior model COPERT with conditional measurement data to filling the missing entries at other locations. With this strategy, we can generate realistic emission data while accelerating the training process.

Using Support Vector Machines, the best accuracies range from 84.36% (openness to experience) to 70.51% (neuroticism).

We take these findings to suggest that both the structure of the text and the presence of common words are important.

A number of deep metric learning methods, which ensure that similar examples are mapped close to each other and dissimilar examples are mapped farther apart, have been proposed to construct effective structures for loss functions and have shown promising results. In this paper, different from the approaches on learning the loss structures, we propose a robust SNR distance metric based on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for measuring the similarity of image pairs for deep metric learning. By exploring the properties of our SNR distance metric from the view of geometry space and statistical theory, we analyze the properties of our metric and show that it can preserve the semantic similarity between image pairs, which well justify its suitability for deep metric learning. Compared with Euclidean distance metric, our SNR distance metric can further jointly reduce the intra-class distances and enlarge the inter-class distances for learned features. Leveraging our SNR distance metric, we propose Deep SNR-based Metric Learning (DSML) to generate discriminative feature embeddings. By extensive experiments on three widely adopted benchmarks, including CARS196, CUB200-2011 and CIFAR10, our DSML has shown its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods.

On the other hand, applying 2D CNN with generalizable features to 2D slices ignores between-slice information. Coupling 2D network with LSTM to further handle the between-slice information is not optimal due to the difficulty in LSTM learning. To overcome the above challenges, 3D anisotropic hybrid network (AH-Net) transfers convolutional features learned from 2D images to 3D anisotropic volumes. Such a transfer inherits the desired strong generalization capability for within-slice information while naturally exploiting between-slice information for more effective modeling.

Different properties about the training data are encoded in graph structures, in the form of pairwise data relationships. Then, they are incorporated to the SVM optimization problem, as modified graph-regularized basekernels, each highlighting a different property about the training data. The contribution of each graph-regularized kernel to the SVM classification problem, is estimated automatically. Thereby, the solution of the proposed modified SVM optimization problem lies in a regularized space, where data similarity is expressed by a linear combination of multiple single-graph regularized kernels. The proposed method exploits and extends the findings of Multiple Kernel Learning and graph-based SVM method families. It is shown that the available kernel options for the former can be broadened, and the exhaustive parameter tuning for the latter can be eliminated. Moreover, both method families can be considered as special cases of the proposed formulation, hereafter. Our experimental evaluation in visual data classification problems denote the superiority of the proposed method. The obtained classification performance gains can be explained by the exploitation of multiplex data relationships, during the classifier optimization process.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2018.07.032", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.", "journal": "Pattern Recognit.", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2886379096", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4338802", "15874442", "2110475", "15480929", "16902615", "5687381", "1170314", "4970179", "2552688", "17976032", "12429280", "8496665", "11984112", "2426049", "7942188", "9352153", "11390956", "17908460", "26701961", "2568567", "27681296", "11469785", "15152736", "47456013", "1533984", "7161206", "46598491", "8172552", "961425", "10450851", "57227467", "2153469", "18268744", "2156851", "7658142", "6055435", "7211257", "17209773", "3900423", "14779543", "64711781", "5401052", "3736096", "3429496", "8897751", "7553535", "17257979"], "inbound_citations": ["209481499", "86729068"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53360353"}

DNMAD is essentially a web-based interface for the Bioconductor package limma [7]. DNMAD has been designed to provide a simple and at the same time robust and fast way for normalization of microarray data. We provide global and print-tip loess normalization [9]. We also ofier options for the use of quality \u221eags, background adjustment, input of compressed flles with many of arrays, and slide-scale normalization. Finally, to enable a fully featured pipeline of analysis, direct links to the central hub of GEPAS, the Preprocessor [5] are provided. The tool, help flles, and tutorials are available at http://dnmad.bioinfo.cnio.es. The second tool we present is called Tnasas for \\This is not a substitute for a statistician\". Tnasas performs class prediction (using either SVM, KNN, DLDA, or Random Forest) together with gene selection, including cross-validation of the gene selection process to account for \\selection bias\" [1], and cross-validation of the process of selecting the number of genes that yields the smallest error. This tool has mainly an exploratory and pedagogical purpose: to make users aware of the widespread problem of selection bias and to provide a benchmark against some (overly) optimistic claims that occasionally are attached to new methods and algorithms; Tnasas can also be used as a \\quick and dirty\" way of building a predictor. Tnasas uses packages e1071 [2], randomForest [6], and class (part of the VR bundle [8]). The tool, help flles, and tutorials are available at http://tnasas.bioinfo.cnio.es. Both tools use a Perl-CGI script that checks all the data input by the user and, once checked, sends it to an R script that performs the actions requested by the user.

What's more, there exists a difficult problem in software reliability modeling that the prediction capability of a model varies with failure data change. This inconsistency problem limits the promotion and application of software reliability techniques; mainly because the assumptions the models are based on may not be suitable for most cases. In addition, there exists a contradiction in traditional software reliability prediction methods.

This study aims to analyze the relation between soil moisture and drought and predict agricultural drought in Xiangjiang River basin. The agriculture droughts are presented with the Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The Support Vector Regression (SVR) model incorporating climate indices is developed to predict the agricultural droughts. Analysis of climate forcing including El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation and western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) are carried out to select climate indices. The results show that SPEI of six months time scales (SPEI-6) represents the soil moisture better than that of three and one month time scale on drought duration, severity and peaks. The key factor that influences the agriculture drought is the Ridge Point of WPSH, which mainly controls regional temperature.

The capabilities that generative adversarial networks offer can be leveraged to examine these anomalies and help alleviate the challenge that imbalanced datasets propose via creating synthetic anomalies.

One method for handling this problem is transfer learning, which uses a network tuned for an arbitrary task as the initial network for a target task.

Although significant results have been achieved in simple scenarios, HAR is still a challenging task due to issues associated with view independence, occlusion and inter-class variation observed in realistic scenarios. In previous research efforts, the classical bag of visual words approach along with its variations has been widely used. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Bag of Expressions (D-STBoE) model for human action recognition without compromising the strengths of the classical bag of visual words approach. Expressions are formed based on the density of a spatio-temporal cube of a visual word. To handle inter-class variation, we use class-specific visual word representation for visual expression generation. In contrast to the Bag of Expressions (BoE) model, the formation of visual expressions is based on the density of spatio-temporal cubes built around each visual word, as constructing neighborhoods with a fixed number of neighbors could include non-relevant information making a visual expression less discriminative in scenarios with occlusion and changing viewpoints.

To calculate the instantaneous frequency of IMFs, an algorithm was developed using the Generalized Zero Crossing method. From the resulting frequencies, two different novel features were generated: the median instantaneous frequencies and the number of instantaneous frequency changes during a 30s segment for seven IMFs. The sleep stage classification for the daytime sleep of 20 healthy babies was determined using the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm. The results were evaluated using the cross-validation method to achieve an approximately 90% accuracy and with new examinee data to achieve 80% average accuracy of classification. The obtained results were higher than the human experts' agreement and were statistically significant, which positioned the method, based on the proposed features, as an efficient procedure for automatic sleep stage classification.

A manual analysis showed that 96.7% of all outcomes can be captured using a noun phrase representation. With respect to the machine learning classifiers, the Support Vector Machine produced higher precision, F1-score, and accuracy than the General Linear Model when evaluated with respect to the initial gold standard of survivorship seed terms and a manual gold standard that considered all outcomes. However, the best model does not employ machine learning, but rather leverages list structure and resulted in 90.14 precision, 60.69 recall, 75.41 F1-score, and 92.60 accuracy with respect to the manual gold standard of all outcomes. Finally we developed a silver standard with a precision of 89.28 and recall of 86.77 compared to the manual gold standard and used the silver standard to identify all outcomes reported for five breast cancer treatments.

Firstly, functional connectivity matrix was obtained as classify patterns. Secondly, Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient was applied to select features with high discriminative power, while KPCA was applied to find the abnormal pattern of ADHD in a much lower mainfold. Finally, the two groups of ADHD and normal participants were classified by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Experimental results showed that SVM based on KPCA can produce a correct classification rate of 81% using a leave-one-out cross validation, which indicate that KPCA is an effective method that can greatly improve the final discriminative performance. Moreover, we examined the brain regions with statistically significant difference, like the frontal cortex, insula, cingulate cortex, postcentral gyrus, thalamus, middle temporal cortex, well confirmed with previous findings on ADHD.

The mitotic spindle plays a pivotal role in chromosome alignment and segregation during metaphase and anaphase. Structural or functional errors of this spindle can cause aneuploidy, a hallmark of many cancers. To investigate if a given protein associates with the mitotic spindle and regulates its assembly, stability, or function, fluorescence microscopy can be performed to determine if disruption of that protein induces phenotypes indicative of spindle dysfunction. Importantly, functional disruption of proteins with specific roles during mitosis can lead to cancer cell death by inducing mitotic insult. However, there is a lack of automated computational tools to detect and quantify the effects of such disruption on spindle integrity.ResultsWe developed the image analysis software tool MatQuantify, which detects both large-scale and subtle structural changes in the spindle or DNA and can be used to statistically compare the effects of different treatments. MatQuantify can quantify various physical properties extracted from fluorescence microscopy images, such as area, lengths of various components, perimeter, eccentricity, fractal dimension, satellite objects and orientation. It can also measure textual properties including entropy, intensities and the standard deviation of intensities. Using MatQuantify, we studied the effect of knocking down the protein clathrin heavy chain (CHC) on the mitotic spindle. We analysed 217 microscopy images of untreated metaphase cells, 172 images of metaphase cells transfected with small interfering RNAs targeting the luciferase gene (as a negative control), and 230 images of metaphase cells depleted of CHC. Using the quantified data, we trained 23 supervised machine learning classification algorithms. The Support Vector Machine learning algorithm was the most accurate method (accuracy: 85.1%; area under the curve: 0.92) for classifying a spindle image. The Kruskal-Wallis and Tukey-Kramer tests demonstrated that solidity, compactness, eccentricity, extent, mean intensity and number of satellite objects (multipolar spindles) significantly differed between CHC-depleted cells and untreated/luciferase-knockdown cells.ConclusionMatQuantify enables automated quantitative analysis of images of mitotic spindles. Using this tool, researchers can unambiguously test if disruption of a protein-of-interest changes metaphase spindle maintenance and thereby affects mitosis.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5751558", "pubmed_id": "29297284", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-017-1966-4", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2779118454", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["205494124", "2033917", "8205125", "12981218", "20143853", "15326934", "11278430", "13051471", "215691903", "1557231", "17556365", "3327168", "215633032", "27328482", "1550185", "27458866"], "inbound_citations": ["201133778", "5984185"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10925383"}

Recent progress and more widespread availability of 6 and higher color flow cytometry leads to complex, information-rich datasets which are very challenging to analyze. Here, we validate a novel approach to multi-parameter flow data analysis in MRD flow data sets from 39 ALL patients (including 23 patients from the I-BFM list mode data (LMD) ring trial). The approach combines hierarchical clustering (HCA) using a newly developed algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) learning. The algorithm employs a scale-invariant Mahalanobis distance measurement for merging clusters. This reflects the extended ellipsoid shape of the populations and is better suited for flow cytometric data compared with standard HCA metrics. The resulting hierarchical tree, combined with the heatmap of the CD marker expression allows visualization of hierarchically clustered data of all analyzed parameters displayed in a single plot. The clusters from HCA (representing the ALL blast population at diagnosis) were used to train SVM classifiers which were then applied to test for presence of a matching population in the test sample (follow-up sample). All work was carried out in MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc.). Using HCA, we have been able to detect the leukemic blast population in diagnostic and follow-up datasets (n=81) from three centers. The correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.98) between HCA and the standard gating approach was highly comparable to inter-laboratory comparisons within the I-BFM LMD ring trial (Dworzak MN et al; Cytometry B Clin Cytom. 2008 Jun 11.). To further improve sensitivity and exact quantification of low MRD levels and to automate MRD detection, we combined HCA with SVM learning. We have analyzed 21 samples from 5 patients with MRD levels between 0.004 to 57.54%.

The major limitation of PLDA lies in that, in the original formulation, the modeling part and the prediction part require the inversion of large matrices, whose sizes are proportional to the number of training vectors in a class. The original formulation of PLDA is not scalable if there are many training vectors, because the matrices will become too large to be inverted. In the literature, some scalable versions for the modeling part have been proposed. In this paper, we propose the scalable version for the prediction part, which completes the scalable version of PLDA. This makes PLDA able to handle a large number of training data, enabling PLDA to be used as a general-purpose classifier for different classification tasks.

The experimental results on the TanCorp data set show that SRSMTC algorithm can achieve the state-of-the-art performance at greatly reduced space-time requirements.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3977423", "pubmed_id": "24778587", "doi": "10.1155/2014/517498", "venue": "The Scientific World Journal", "journal": "The Scientific World Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1977579924", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3091", "202719165", "2737268", "59472188", "6340813", "11920487", "13278614", "9155618", "14895712", "14174949", "44971656", "207158957"], "inbound_citations": ["14443396", "87004291", "99804", "215306840", "13764568"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16389128"}

Secondly, in encoding stage, we propose Outlier-Resistant VLAD (OR-VLAD), a novel higher order statistics-based feature encoding, to improve the original VLAD performance. In classification, efficient Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) is employed. The performance of the proposed pipeline is evaluated with three popular violent action datasets.

These include inter-person hand shape and size variations, intra-person pose and style variations and self-occlusion due to varying hand orientation. Given a hand orientation dataset containing these variations, a single regressor proves to be limited for learning the mapping of hand silhouette images onto the orientation angles. We address this by proposing a staged probabilistic regressor (SPORE) which consists of multiple expert regressors, each one learning a subset of variations from the dataset. Inspired by Boosting, the novelty of our method comes from the staged probabilistic learning, where each stage consists of training and adding an expert regressor to the intermediate ensemble of expert regressors. Unlike Boosting, we marginalize the posterior prediction probabilities from each expert regressor by learning a marginalization weights regressor, where the weights are extracted during training using a KullbackLeibler divergence-based optimization. We extend and evaluate our proposed framework for inferring hand orientation and pose simultaneously. In comparison to the state-of-the-art of hand orientation inference, multi-layered Random Forest marginalization and Boosting, our proposed method proves to be more accurate. Moreover, experimental results reveal that simultaneously learning hand orientation and pose from 2D monocular images significantly improves the pose classification performance.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cviu.2017.05.009", "venue": "Comput.

It is, however, still difficult to accurately detect coal rock bursts due to the complex mechanism of AE propagation underground. Therefore, this study proposes a new Multi-Resolution Feature Fusion SVM recognition (MRFF-SVM) approach to compute a comprehensive feature vector for coal rock burst hazard recognition and forecasting. The proposed approach contains the following three improved processes: the Coiflet Wavelet Transform (CWT) to decompose AE waveforms into multiple perspectives for feature vectors extraction, the Multi-Resolution Feature Fusion (MRFF) method to fuse these selected feature vectors into an enhanced MRFF feature vector and the following Support Vector Machines (SVM) to recognize the coal rock burst conditions. Several innovative experiments are carried out to evaluate the coal rock conditions according to the safe, crisis and burst categories. The results indicate that the proposed MRFF feature vectors can retain AE signatures well to recognize coal rock conditions and forecast sandstone failure. Thus, MRFF-SVM provides an effective analysis tool for coal rock burst hazard detection.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2017.01.010", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "mag_id": "2567958130", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208191018", "55757372", "134217659"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113692636"}

Different classifiers are used for smartphone with different position categories. SVMs are trained for different position categories using accelerometer data.

The concept of smart city has supported a higher quality of urban spaces and a better offering of public services. Smart grid is an important component and the energy supply of smart city. The health of the smart grid will directly affect the health of the smart city. Efficient and accurate prediction about icing level of transmission lines provides a reliable basis for anti-icing and deicing of power grids. The prediction can not only significantly enhance the reliability, safety and stability of transmission networks, but also timely provide the state monitoring of ice on wires to the workers to make proper decisions and to prevent freezing disasters so as to effectively protect people\u2019s safety and build a stable and friendly society. To reduce catastrophic damages caused by the iced transmission lines of the grid, this paper proposed a novel hybrid model called PR-KELM, an integration of Principal Component Analysis, ReliefF and Kernel based ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) method to predict the icing level of transmission lines. This hybrid model covered two stages including: 1) structured and unstructured data feature extraction by local binary patterns, principal component analysis and ReliefF; 2) radial basis function Kernel based ELM predicting the processed data.

This makes it time-consuming and difficult to encompass all tasks and conditions during training. In this paper, we propose a discriminative transfer learning method that incorporates formal proximal optimization and discriminative learning for general image restoration. The method requires a single-pass discriminative training and allows for reuse across various problems and conditions while achieving an efficiency comparable to previous discriminative approaches.

In this paper, a detailed example of model analysis is presented for two representative databases with different promotional behaviour, namely, a non-seasonal category (milk) and a heavily seasonal category (beer). The performance of four well-known machine learning techniques with increasing complexity is analyzed in detail here. In particular, k-Nearest Neighbours, General Regression Neural Networks, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are differentially compared. Present paper evaluates these techniques along the experiments described for both categories when applying the methodological findings obtained in the companion paper. We conclude that some elements included in the architecture are not essential for a good performance of the machine learning promotional models, such as the semiparametric nature of the kernel in SVM models, whereas other can be strongly dependent of the database, such as the convenience of multiple output models in MLP regression schemes.

An inaccurate diagnosis could have fatal consequences, particularly in operating rooms and intensive care units. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been traditionally used, as a gold standard, to diagnose patients by evaluating those brain functions that might correspond to epilepsy and other brain disorders. This research therefore focuses on developing new classification techniques for multichannel EEG recordings. Two time-series classification techniques, namely, Support Feature Machine (SFM) and Network-Based Support Vector Machine (SVM) (NSVM), are proposed in this paper to predict from EEG readings whether a person is epileptic or nonepileptic. The SFM approach is an optimization model that maximizes classification accuracy by selecting a group of electrodes (features) that has strong class separability based on time-series similarity measures and correctly classifies EEG samples in the training phase. The NSVM approach integrates a new network-based model for multidimensional time-series data with traditional SVMs to exploit both the spatial and temporal characteristics of EEG data. The proposed techniques are tested on two EEG data sets acquired from ten and five patients, respectively.

The input to the program consisted of 12 non-homologous proteins (1612 residues) of known structure, together with a background knowledge describing the chemical and physical properties of the residues. Golem learned a small set of rules that predict which residues are part of the a-helices\u2014based on their positional relationships and chemical and physical properties. The rules were tested on four independent non-homologous proteins (416 residues) giving an accuracy of 81% (\u00b12%).

Supervised machine learning algorithms were trained on a randomly selected subset of the data and validated using an independent test dataset. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: A total of 5,050 patients with 8,869 admissions were included in the study. One-hundred patients were mechanically restrained in the period between one hour and three days after the admission. A Random Forest algorithm predicted MR with an area under the curve of 0.87 (95% CI 0.79-0.93). At 94% specificity, the sensitivity was 56%. Among the ten strongest predictors, nine were derived from the clinical notes. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: These findings open for the development of an early warning system that may guide interventions to reduce the use of MR.

Previous work in this area is extended in two important directions. First, a large margin training of sentence-level log linear models is proposed for automatic speech recognition (ASR). This form of model is shown to be similar to the recently proposed structured Support Vector Machines (SVM). Second, based on the designed joint features, efficient lattice-based training and decoding are performed.

Creating lifestyle clusters for a population is a compromise between the two. On the one hand, it has taken into account travel-activity patterns in the development of the clusters. On the other hand, the clusters represent homogenous groups of individuals and simple activity-based travel demand models can be developed for each cluster. However, the development of such clusters requires knowledge of activity-travel patterns of individuals, which can only be obtained from a large-scale survey. It is still an open question how to create travel/activity-related lifestyle clusters using readily available socio-demographic data (such as census data) alone. This paper attempts to answer this question by proposing a procedure of lifestyle classification that moves from specific surveys to a general population. This paper first studies issues related to the development of homogeneous clusters using socio-economic, demographic and activity-travel data. The second part of the paper addresses the issue of data insufficiency and points out that in order to use the clusters developed for travel demand estimation, it is important to know how to allocate individuals in the population to the developed clusters. As a first attempt, this paper proposes to use a recently developed technique called, Support Vector Machine (SVM), to develop classification functions that based on readily available information only. The methodologies proposed are applied to a sub-urban area in Hong Kong. Six lifestyle clusters are first produced using factor analysis and cluster analysis.

The growing need for resilience measurements motivates this research, measurements that reflect the complex, dynamic features of welfare among populations living in shock-prone contexts. It presents insights from three measurement approaches to explore the dynamic, intra-annual effects of shocks on household well-being, mediated by household characteristics; one based on shock persistence, one based on the stochastic distribution of well-being, and one driven by machine learning algorithms and based on predictive power. The insights gained from the comparison of measurement approaches offer a fuller understanding of the factors driving resilience than any single approach on its own. The paper harnesses a novel data-set from the \u2018Measuring Indicators for Resilience Analysis\u2019 project, which, each month, tracks shocks and food security indicators for one year in a highly food insecure population in Malawi. Across approaches, our study consistently finds that shocks and food insecurity are very persistent, and that households living in the flood plains are more resilient. When focusing on specific shocks such as illness, the gender of the household head matters as-well. A broader search for predictors of food insecurity using LASSO and Random Forest algorithms uncovers other characteristics that affect resilience, such as the distance to drinking-water.

To provide evidence, experiments are carried on in two phases. For all the experiments the machine learning techniques namely Least Median Square (LMS), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used. In the first phase five well-known wrapper feature selection methods are used to obtain the prediction accuracy of machine learning techniques with selected feature subsets and default parameter settings. The experiments from the first phase demonstrate that holding the default parameters, LMS, MLP and SVM provides better prediction accuracy (i.e. reduced MAE and MASE) with selected feature subsets rather than without selected feature subsets. After getting improved prediction accuracy from the first phase, the second phase continues the experiments to optimize machine learning parameters and the prediction accuracy of those machine learning techniques are re-evaluated through adopting both the optimized parameter settings and selected feature subsets. The comparison between the results of two phases clearly shows that the later phase (i.e. machine learning techniques with selected feature subsets and optimized parameters) provides substantial improvement in the accuracy for solar power prediction than the earlier phase (i.e. machine learning techniques with selected feature subsets and default parameters). Experiments are carried out using reliable and real life historical meteorological data. The machine learning accuracy of solar radiation prediction is justified in terms of statistical error measurement and validation metrics. Experimental results of this paper facilitate to make a concrete verdict that providing more attention and effort towards the feature subset selection and machine learning parameter optimization (e.g. combined effect of selected feature subsets and optimized parameters on prediction accuracy which is investigated in this paper) can significantly contribute to improve the accuracy of solar power prediction.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.12691/ajer-1-1-2", "venue": "American Journal of Energy Research", "journal": "American Journal of Energy Research", "mag_id": "2133110648", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["55685999", "61811192", "4354955", "35861557"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18692622"}

Then, the rules of length 2 are applied to compose paths accurately while the rules of length 1 are explicitly employed to create semantic associations among relations and constrain relation embeddings.

Accordingly, expressions of affect and opinion appear profusely in natural language utterances\u2014either explicitly or implicitly. Recognizing and interpreting the subjective information, beyond factual information such as topics and events thereby constitute an important aspect of natural language understanding. Indeed in recent years, there has been a great surge of research interest to help computers understand the subjective side of natural language. ::: In this dissertation, we explore computational methods that can push the envelope for sentiment analysis in text. There are two distinctive themes in our contributions: First, our focus will be on fine-grained opinion analysis, which has been relatively less explored than coarse-grained analysis (e.g., document-level classification). Second, the approaches developed in our work are structure-aware in that we design the inference and/or learning algorithms reflecting the task-specific linguistic structure. We tackle five different sets of problems under these themes, and the key results are summarized in the paragraphs below: ::: Joint extraction of opinion elements and relations. In this work, we present a system for extracting fine-grained opinion elements such as opinion expressions and the sources of opinions, and the relations among those elements, using machine learning techniques and integer linear programming. The extracted opinion elements can then be used as building blocks for various opinion applications, such as opinion summarization or opinion-oriented question answering. ::: Joint extraction of opinions and their attributes. We recognize that the task of determining polarity is related to the task of determining intensity. Based on this observation, we develop a hierarchical sequential learning technique to extract opinion expressions and their attributes\u2014polarity and intensity\u2014simultaneously. ::: Polarity inference in light of compositional semantics. In this work, we investigate methods for fine-grained polarity classification by drawing a connection to compositional semantics, one of the classic branches of research across linguistics and logic. This work attempts to bridge the gap between theories in compositional semantics and practical approaches based on machine learning techniques, by incorporating simple compositional rules based on syntactic patterns as structural inference for the learning algorithm. ::: Lexicon adaptation as constraint optimization. Although there has been plentiful research in the creation of lexical resources for sentiment analysis, most is conducted in isolation from actual applications. As a result, a purportedly better lexical resource might not lead to better performance when utilized for a specific natural language application. To address this problem, we develop a method that adapts a general-purpose polarity lexicon into a domain-specific one in the context of a specific NLP task, by casting the problem as a constraint optimization problem using integer linear programming. ::: Structured local training for coreference resolution. Once we have identified fine-grained opinion elements in text, we need to determine whether some of the extracted phrases are referring to an identical entity\u2014namely, coreference resolution. In this work, we develop \u201cstructured local training\u201d, a machine learning technique based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) that directly incorporates the interaction between local decisions and global decisions into the learning procedure. We also propose \u201cbiased potential functions\u201d that can empirically drive CRFs towards performance improvements with respect to the preferred evaluation measure.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "195852797", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58377215"}

The parameter values returned by meta-learning are then used as initial search points by a search technique, which will further explore the parameter space. In this proposal, we envisioned that the initial solutions provided by meta-learning are located in good regions of the search space (i.e. they are closer to optimum solutions). Hence, the search algorithm would need to evaluate a lower number of candidate solutions when looking for an adequate solution.

In order to improve the convergence rate and efficacy of FOA, two new mechanisms are integrated with the exploratory and exploitative strategies of the original FOA: the outpost mechanism and the multi-population mechanism. The outpost mechanism consists of two parts: greedy selection and Gaussian mutation, which is mainly used to improve the convergence rate of the algorithm. The multi-swarm mechanism divides the population of agents into several sub-swarms and selects several individuals from sub-swarm with a random probability. Then, the selected individuals are remapped into the feature space to expand the exploratory capabilities. To illustrate the performance of the proposed method, a comprehensive set of benchmark functions, including the unimodal, multimodal, and composition functions were chosen for testing tasks. Also, the proposed MOFOA is compared against the state-of-the-art improved FOA algorithms and other well-known swarm-based methods. The experimental results have shown that MOFOA can outperform all the competitors involved in this study in terms of convergence speed and solution quality in a significant manner. Furthermore, MOFOA is also employed to optimize two critical parameters of the support vector machine (SVM) for classification tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed MOFOA can also achieve a better performance than other swarm-based methods in dealing with the optimization of the SVM in dealing with several financial datasets.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2019.112999", "venue": "Expert Syst.

The density forecast model is based on a decomposition of financial returns into the absolute return and the sign of the return. We also use the maximum entropyprinciple for the out-of-sample density forecast subject to the constraintthat matches the mean forecasts from the decomposition model and a simple regression model. In Chapter 1 (joint with Professor Tea-Hwy Lee),We show that when the mean forecast from the decomposition model deviates from that of the mean return, imposing the matching mean forecast constraint will tilt the density forecast of the decomposition model and improve over the density forecast of the original decomposition model. In Chapter 2 (joint with Professor Tae-Hwy Lee and Ru Zhang), we further improve the decomposition model by using dependent copula functions, and we show that the risk forecast produced by the decomposition density forecast model is superior to RiskMetrics in terms of giving higher coverage probability and lower predictive quanitle loss in extreme events of large loss for monthly returns.Chapter 3 and 4 (joint with Professor Tae-Hwy Lee and Ru Zhang) deal with the testing of nonlinearity of time series data by using artificial neural network (ANN). In Chapter 3, we find that the original Lee, White and Granger (LWG, 1993) test is sensitive to the randomly generated activation parameters since they consider a fairly small number (10 or 20) of random hidden unit activations. To solve this problem, we simply increase the number of randomized hidden unit activations to a very large number (e.g., 1000). We show that using many randomly generated activation parameters can robustify the performance of the ANN test when it is applied to a real empirical data. This robustification is reliable and useful in practice, and can be achieved at no cost as increasing the number of random activations is almost costless given todayihs computer technology. In Chapter 4, we further consider different types of regularization of the dimensionality, such as principal component analysis (PCA), Lasso, Pretest, partial least squares (PLS), among others. We demonstrate that while these supervised regularization methods such as Lasso, Pretest, PLS, may be useful for forecasting, they may not be used for testing because the supervised regularization would create the post-sample inference or post-selection inference (PoSI) problem. Our Monte Carlo simulation shows that the PoSI problem is especially severe with PLS and Pretest while it seems relatively mild or even negligible with Lasso.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1483243742", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107051987"}

Though the earliest figures for 2009 - 2010 indicate a significant decrease, foreclosure of homes in the U.S. is still at an alarming level (Gutierrez, 2009a). Recent research at the University of Michigan suggested that many foreclosures could have been averted had there been a predictive system that did not only rely on credit scores and loan-to-value ratios (DeGroat, 2009). Furthermore, Grover, Smith & Todd (2008) contend that foreclosure prediction can enhance the efficiency of foreclosure mitigation by facilitating the allocation of resources to areas where predicted foreclosure rates will be high. ::: The primary goal of this dissertation was to develop a foreclosure prediction model that builds upon established bankruptcy and credit scoring models. The study utilized and compared the predictive accuracy of three supervised machine learning (ML) techniques when applied to mortgage data. The selected ML techniques were: ML1. Classification Trees; ML2. Support Vector Machines (SVM); ML3. Genetic Programming. The data used for the study is comprised of mortgage data, demographic metrics and certain macro-economic indicators that are available at the time of the inception of the loan. ::: The hypothesis of the study was based on the assumption that foreclosure rates, and associated actions, are dependent on critical demographic (age, gender), economic (per capita income, inflation) and regional variables (predatory lending, unemployment index). The task of the machine learning techniques was to identify a function that well approximates the relationship between these explanatory variables and the binary outcome of interest (mortgage status in +3 years from inception). ::: The predictive accuracy of ML1 through ML3 was significantly better than expected given the size of the recordset (1000) and the number of input variables (\u223c110).

Speech is different from acoustic events, when one considers its phonetic structure. Hence, frame-based speech features may not be suitable for Acoustic Event Classification (AEC). In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the extraction of robust acoustic event specific features from the spectrogram using a left singular vector for AEC. It consists of two main stages: segmentation and characterization of acoustic event spectrograms. In the first stage, symmetric Laplacian matrix of an acoustic event spectrogram is decomposed into singular values and vectors. Then, reliable region (spectral shape) of an acoustic from the spectrogram is segmented using a left singular vector. The selected prominent values of a left singular vector using the proposed threshold, automatically segment the reliable region of an acoustic event from the spectrogram. In the second stage, the segmented region of the spectrogram is used as a feature vector for AEC. Characteristics of values of singular vector belonging to reliable (event) and unreliable (non-event) regions of the spectrogram are determined. To evaluate the proposed approach, different categories of \u2018home\u2019 acoustic events are considered from the Freiburg-106 dataset. The results show that the significantly improved performance of acoustic event segmentation and classification. A singular vector effectively segments the reliable region of the acoustic event from spectrogram for Support Vector Machine (SVM) based AEC system.

In this context, I propose a common framework that combines two different and important paradigms in machine learning: global learning and local learning. Traditional global learning approaches focus on describing phenomena by attempting to estimate a distribution from data. Based on the estimated distribution, the global learning methods can then perform inferences, conduct marginalizations, and make predictions. Although enjoying a long and distinguished history and containing many good features, e.g., a relatively simple optimization, and the flexibility in incorporating global information such as structure information and invariance etc., these learning approaches usually have to assume a specific type of distribution a prior. Therefore, they are widely argued for lacking the generality. On the other hand, local learning methods do not estimate a distribution from data. Instead, they focus on extracting only the local information, which is directly related to the learning task, i.e., the classification in this thesis. Recent progress following this trend has demonstrated that local learning approaches, e.g., Support Vector Machines (SVM), outperform the global learning methods in many aspects. Despite of the success, local learning approaches actually discard plenty of important global information on data, e.g., the structure information. Therefore, this restricts the learning performance of this types of learning schemes. ::: In this thesis, I thus develop a hybrid model named Maxi-Min Margin Machine (M4), which successfully combines two largely differently but complementary paradigms. Within this new framework, I propose a hybrid model named Maxi-Min Margin Machine (M4). This model is demonstrated to contain both appealing features in global learning and local learning. It not only captures the global structure information from data, but it also provides a task-oriented scheme for the learning purpose and inherits the superior performance from local learning. As a major contribution, M 4 successfully unifies many important learning models, including Support Vector Machines, Minimax Probability Machine (MPM), and Fisher Discriminant Analysis. Another compelling feature of M4 is that it can be cast as a Sequential Second Order Cone Programming problem, yielding a polynomial time complexity.

For a proper validation of these models, an embodiment in a dynamic and rich sensory environment, where the model is exposed to a realistic sensory-motor task, is needed. Due to the complexity of these brain models that, at the current stage, cannot deal with real-time constraints, it is not possible to embed them into a real world task. Rather, the embodiment has to be simulated as well. While adequate tools exist to simulate either complex neural networks or robots and their environments, there is so far no tool that allows to easily establish a communication between brain and body models. The Neurorobotics Platform is a new web-based environment that aims to filling this gap by offering scientists and technology developers a software infrastructure allowing them to connect brain models to detailed simulations of robot bodies and environments and to use the resulting neurorobotic systems for in-silico experimentation. In order to simplify the workflow and reduce the level of the required programming skills, the platform provides editors for the specification of experimental sequences and conditions, envi-ronments, robots, and brain-body connectors. In addition to that, a variety of existing robots and environments are provided.

The RB-NE solution concept is richer than the notion of `local Nash equilibria' in that it captures not only failures of escaping local optima of gradient descent, but applies to any approximate best response computations, including methods with random restarts. To validate our approach, we solve GANGs with the Parallel Nash Memory algorithm, which provably monotonically converges to an RB-NE.

It has been applied to a wide variety of areas such as security, search, and experimental documentation.

This paper proposes an efficient provenance management system via clustering and hybrid storage. Specifically, we propose a Provenance-Based Label Propagation Algorithm which is able to regularize and cluster a large number of irregular provenance.

Using tags on wild terrestrial mammals, especially smaller species, in natural settings has been limited. Poor battery power also reduced the amount of data collected, which limits what can be derived about animal behaviour. Another challenge using wild animals, is acquiring observations of actual behaviours with which to compare tag data and create an adequate training set to reliably identify behavioural states. Brown hares were fitted with accelerometers for 5 weeks to evaluate their use in collecting detailed behaviour data and activity levels. Collared hares were filmed to associate actual behaviours with tag data. Observed behaviours were classified using Random Forests (ensemble learning method) to create a supervised model and then used to classify hare behaviour from the tags. Increased tag longevity allowed acquisition of large quantities of data from each individual and direct observation of tagged hare's behaviour. Random Forests accurately classified observed behaviours from tag data with an 11% error rate. Individual accuracy of behaviours varied with running (100% accuracy), feeding (94.7%) and vigilance (98.3%) having the highest classification accuracy. Hares spent 46% of their time being vigilant and 25% feeding when active. The combination of our tags and Random Forests facilitated large amounts of behavioural data to be collected on animals where observational studies could be limited, or impossible. The same method could be used on a range of terrestrial mammals to create models to investigate behaviour from tag data, to learn more about their behaviour and be used to answer many ecological questions. However, further development of methods for analysing tag data is needed to make the process quicker, simpler and more accurate.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/jzo.12308", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Zoology", "mag_id": "2219049689", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["1887462", "53084488", "53079407", "33062351", "213803760", "8945411"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86193798"}

In this paper, for this shortage, a semi-supervised algorithm based on generative adversarial network (GAN) with Gini-regularization is proposed, called SGAN_G, which takes borehole-side data as labeled data and seismic data as unlabeled data. First, the SGAN_G is trained by Adam (a method for stochastic optimization) algorithm and utilizes a discriminator to lithology recognition.

However, there remain barriers to break for applying the previous causality extraction methods to emergency management. The experience of emergency management inspires us that the cause of disasters should have existed in the time before the effect. Therefore, causality relations can be seen as distinct temporal relations. By utilizing the temporal characteristics of causality, this paper redefines the causality extraction as a special kind of temporality extraction and presents a method for extracting causality from emergency cases based on conditional random fields (CRFs). Then the task turns to be a sequence labeling process which can be solved by involving a CRFs model. Several typhoon-related emergency cases are chosen as the experimental dataset. To seek the impact of different features on the model performance, two feature templates are also chosen to train the model. The experimental results show that our approaches can not only deal with marked causal relations, but also work effectively on unmarked causal relations. Besides, the CRFs model can even extract causal relations between sentences.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procs.2017.08.252", "venue": "KES", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2752223904", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:41006371"}

Of particular interest are transcriptional enhancers that play critical roles in cell-type specific gene expression but are difficult to characterize because they often act in a distal manner to the gene they regulate. We developed a Random-Forest based algorithm, RFECS (Random Forest based Enhancer identification from Chromatin State) for genome- wide prediction of enhancers which allowed us to identify the most informative and robust set of three chromatin marks for enhancer prediction. In addition, RFECS was seen to have improved accuracy of prediction over previous methods. Applying this method to other genomic elements, we identified the minimal set of histone modifications required for prediction of promoters and gene bodies. Further, we elucidated the distinctive localization of histone lysine acetylations at enhancers, promoters and gene bodies, and obtained novel insights into the association of chromatin modification patterns with splicing. Using our algorithm, we predicted enhancers and promoters in 26 human primary tissues and 6 cell-lines, including 5 early developmental lineages. This lead us to the discovery of a novel class of cis-regulatory elements that can behave as enhancers in one cell-type and promoters in another. Further, we were able to associate the evolutionary conservation of regulatory sequences with properties such as tissue-specificity. RFECS is a powerful algorithm with two-fold advantage. First, we can identify the most informative set of modifications characterizing or distinguishing particular genomic elements, thus enabling an insight into the biological mechanism of function at these regions. Second, we can make accurate predictions of enhancers and promoters in a genome-wide fashion, enabling the comparison of regulatory mechanisms across various human tissues or cellular conditions.

By screening >7.6 K SNPs in 255 wild brown trout (Salmo trutta) and combining association mapping and Random Forest approaches, we identified several candidate genes for both the parasite resistance (inverse of relative parasite load; RPL) and the severe anaemic response to the parasite. The strongest RPL-associated SNP mapped to a noncoding region of the congeneric Atlantic salmon (S. salar) chromosome 10, whereas the second strongest RPL-associated SNP mapped to an intronic region of PRICKLE2 gene, which is a part of the planar cell polarity signalling pathway involved in kidney development. The top SNP associated with anaemia mapped to the intron of the putative PRKAG2 gene. The human ortholog of this gene has been associated with haematocrit and other blood-related traits, making it a prime candidate influencing parasite-triggered anaemia in brown trout.

The accuracy and information content of species maps produced using remote sensing images vary with scale, sensor (optical, microwave, LiDAR), classification algorithm, verification design and natural conditions like tree age, forest structure and density. Imaging spectroscopy reduces the inaccuracies making use of the detailed spectral response. However, the scale effect still has a strong influence and cannot be neglected. This study aims to bridge the knowledge gap in understanding the scale effect in imaging spectroscopy when moving from 4 to 30 m pixel size for tree species mapping, keeping in mind that most current and future hyperspectral satellite based sensors work with spatial resolution around 30 m or more. Two airborne (HyMAP) and one spaceborne (Hyperion) imaging spectroscopy dataset with pixel sizes of 4, 8 and 30 m, respectively were available to examine the effect of scale over a central European forest. The forest under examination is a typical managed forest with relatively homogenous stands featuring mostly two canopy layers. Normalized digital surface model (nDSM) derived from LiDAR data was used additionally to examine the effect of height information in tree species mapping. Six different sets of predictor variables (reflectance value of all bands, selected components of a Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), Vegetation Indices (VI) and each of these sets combined with LiDAR derived height) were explored at each scale. Supervised kernel based (Support Vector Machines) and ensemble based (Random Forest) machine learning algorithms were applied on the dataset to investigate the effect of the classifier. Iterative bootstrap-validation with 100 iterations was performed for classification model building and testing for all the trials. For scale, analysis of overall classification accuracy and kappa values indicated that 8 m spatial resolution (reaching kappa values of over 0.83) slightly outperformed the results obtained from 4 m for the study area and five tree species under examination. The 30 m resolution Hyperion image produced sound results (kappa values of over 0.70), which in some areas of the test site were comparable with the higher spatial resolution imagery when qualitatively assessing the map outputs. Considering input predictor sets, MNF bands performed best at 4 and 8 m resolution. Optical bands were found to be best for 30 m spatial resolution. Classification with MNF as input predictors produced better visual appearance of tree species patches when compared with reference maps. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that there is no significant effect of height information on tree species classification accuracies for the present framework and study area. Furthermore, in the examined cases there was no single best choice among the two classifiers across scales and predictors. It can be concluded that tree species mapping from imaging spectroscopy for forest sites comparable to the one under investigation is possible with reliable accuracies not only from airborne but also from spaceborne imaging spectroscopy datasets.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2013.05.017", "venue": "Int.

Convolutional Neural Networks have shown promise as baseline fixed feature extractors through transfer learning, a technique that helps minimize the training cost on visual information. Temporal information is often handled using hand-crafted features or Recurrent Neural Networks, but this can be overly specific or prohibitively complex. Building a fully trainable system that can efficiently analyze spatio-temporal data without hand-crafted features or complex training is an open challenge. We present a new neural network architecture to address this challenge, the Convolutional Drift Network (CDN). Our CDN architecture combines the visual feature extraction power of deep Convolutional Neural Networks with the intrinsically efficient temporal processing provided by Reservoir Computing. In this introductory paper on the CDN, we provide a very simple baseline implementation tested on two egocentric (first-person) video activity datasets.We achieve video-level activity classification results on-par with state-of-the art methods.

Then, WPA with good global convergence and computational robustness is employed to optimize the parameters of LSSVM. Thus, a novel hybrid load forecasting model for quick-change e-bus charging stations is built, namely FC-WPA-LSSVM.

This need is forcing economists to develop an integrated, unified and complete method of measuring, approximating and even forecast the innovation performance not only on macro level but also on micro level. In this article I intended to show that the recent methods of measuring innovation potential are obsolete, marginally used and have weak statistical performance and effectiveness. Why? Because the world has changed! There are new requirements for social and economical modelling and building expert systems, we have enormous amount of data in a stochastic reality and even the nature of data has been changed. This is especially true in the field of management. Innovation has a so plastic and ductile concept system that it cannot be measured and described (ad absurdum forecasted) by classical crisp methods. It requires soft and intelligent methods. In the article I will show my alternative for measuring innovation potential with a new method which is accurate, strict and significant at the same time, plastic and stable at the same time and simultaneously can handle linguistic variables and blurred (fuzzy) variables. This model possesses efficient studying, adaptive responding, right decision making, information granulation and lingual communication. Via these issues problem solving, pattern recognition, linguistic procession, system design and effective forecasting and estimating can be reached.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1506338869", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["7676947"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:106846682"}

An understanding about how gait patterns differ from patient to patient and are influenced by the assistive device (AD) that is prescribed is still missing. This article focuses on such purpose. Standard walker, crutches and rollator were tested. Symmetric indexes of spatiotemporal and postural control features were calculated. In order to select the important features which can discriminate the differences among the ADs, different techniques for feature selection are investigated. Classification is handled by Multi-class Support Vector Machine. Results showed that rollator provides a more symmetrical gait and crutches demonstrated to be the worst. Relatively to postural control parameters, standard walker is the most stable and crutches are the worst AD. This means that, depending on the patient's problem and the recovery goal, different ADs should be used. After selecting a set of 16 important features, through correlation, it was demonstrated that they provide important quantitative information about the functional capacity, which is not represented by velocity, cadence and clinical scales. Also, they were capable of distinguishing the gait patterns influenced by each AD, showing that each patient has different needs during recovery. Implications of Rehabilitation An understanding about how gait patterns of post-surgical patients differ from person to person and how they are influenced by the type of device that is prescribed during their recovery might help in physical therapy. Research specifically addressing these issues is still missing. Inter-limb asymmetry and postural control features can be evaluated in an outpatient setting, supplying important additional information about individual gait pattern, which is not represented by gait velocity, cadence and scales usually used. The features calculated in this study are able to provide complementary information to gait velocity, cadence and clinical scales to assess the functional capacity of patients that passed through TKA.

The proposed method TL-DeepE is applied in two stages. The first stage employs TL by fine-tuning multiple pre-trained Deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). Telecom datasets are normally in vector form, which is converted into 2D images because Deep CNNs have high learning capacity on images. In the second stage, predictions from these Deep CNNs are appended to the original feature vector and thus are used to build a final feature vector for the high-level Genetic Programming (GP) and AdaBoost based ensemble classifier. Thus, the experiments are conducted using various CNNs as base classifiers and the GP-AdaBoost as a meta-classifier. By using 10-fold cross-validation, the performance of the proposed TL-DeepE system is compared with existing techniques, for two standard telecommunication datasets; Orange and Cell2cell.

By solving this heavy compression task, the network also learns about natural image priors. However, this process requires the curation of large, labeled datasets. Meanwhile, the world provides massive amounts of raw, unlabeled pixels for free. This thesis investigates learning representations of high-dimensional input signals by mapping them to \\textit{high-dimensional} output targets. While more difficult, it is not only possible to learn a strong feature representation, but also to synthesize realistic images.Part I describes the use of deep networks for conditional image synthesis. The section begins by exploring the problem of image colorization, proposing both automatic and user-guided approaches. This section then proposes a system for general image-to-image translation problems, BicycleGAN, with the specific aim of capturing the multimodal nature of the output space.Part II explores the visual representations learned within deep networks. Colorization, as well as cross-channel prediction in general, is a simple but powerful pretext task for self-supervised learning. The representations from cross-channel prediction networks transfer strongly to high-level semantic tasks, such as image classification, and to low-level human perceptual similarity judgments. For the latter, a large-scale dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments is collected. The proposed cross-channel network method outperforms traditional metrics such as PSNR and SSIM.

The gadolinium based contrast agent accumulates in the damaged cells and leads to various enhancements in the LGE-MRI scan.

However, manual segmentation is prone to inter- and intra-observer variability and very time consuming. In this work a new texture based scar quantification is proposed. For texture characterization, segmentation based fractal analysis is used. First, the image is decomposed into a set of binary images by applying a two-threshold binary decomposition. Second, a set of features are extracted for each of the binary images, namely the fractal dimension, the mean gray value, and the size of the binary object. In addition, the local and global intensity of each patch is added to the feature vector. In the next step, the features are classified using a random forest classifier. The scar quantification is evaluated on 30 clinical LGE-MRI data sets. In addition, the results are compared to the $x$ -fold standard deviation approach and the full-width-at-half-max method, which are implemented in a fully automatic manner.

In this paper, we aim to develop an automated and effective technique for fence removal and image reconstruction using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). These networks have been successfully applied in several domains of Computer Vision focusing on image generation and rendering. Our initial approach is based on a two-stage architecture involving two cGANs that generate the fence mask and the inpainted image, respectively. Training of these networks is carried out independently and, during evaluation, the input image is passed through the two generators in succession to obtain the de-fenced image. The results obtained from this approach are satisfactory, but the response time is long since the image has to pass through two sets of convolution layers. To reduce the response time, we propose a second approach involving only a single cGAN architecture that is trained using the ground-truth of fenced de-fenced image pairs along with the edge map of the fenced image produced by the Canny Filter. Incorporation of the edge map helps the network to precisely detect the edges present in the input image, and also imparts it an ability to carry out high quality de-fencing in an efficient manner, even in the presence of a fewer number of layers as compared to the two-stage network. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results reported in the manuscript reveal that the de-fenced images generated by the single-stage de-fencing network have similar visual quality to those produced by the two-stage network.

However, there are no effective tools or biomarkers to discriminate between hvKP and nonhypervirulent K. pneumoniae (nhvKP) strains. We aimed to use a random forest algorithm to predict hvKP based on core-genome data. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: In total, 272 K. pneumoniae strains were collected from 20 tertiary hospitals in China and divided into hvKP and nhvKP groups according to clinical criteria. Clinical data comparisons, whole-genome sequencing, virulence profile analysis, and core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) were performed. We then established a random forest predictive model based on the cgMLST scheme to prospectively identify hvKP. The random forest is an ensemble learning method that generates multiple decision trees during the training process and each decision tree will output its own prediction results corresponding to the input. The predictive ability of the model was assessed by means of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Patients in the hvKP group were younger than those in the nhvKP group (median age, 58.0 and 68.0 years, respectively; P < .001). More patients in the hvKP group had underlying diabetes mellitus (43.1% vs 20.1%; P < .001). Clinically, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae was less common in the hvKP group (4.1% vs 63.8%; P < .001), whereas the K1/K2 serotype, sequence type (ST) 23, and positive string tests were significantly higher in the hvKP group. A cgMLST-based minimal spanning tree revealed that hvKP strains were scattered sporadically within nhvKP clusters. ST23 showed greater genome diversification than did ST11, according to cgMLST-based allelic differences. Primary virulence factors (rmpA, iucA, positive string test result, and the presence of virulence plasmid pLVPK) were poor predictors of the hypervirulence phenotype. The random forest model based on the core genome allelic profile presented excellent predictive power, both in the training and validating sets (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.987 and 0.999 in the training and validating sets, respectively). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: A random forest algorithm predictive model based on the core genome allelic profiles of K. pneumoniae was accurate to identify the hypervirulent isolates.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32176785", "doi": "10.1093/infdis/jiz562", "venue": "The Journal of infectious diseases", "journal": "The Journal of infectious diseases", "mag_id": "3011574844", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212741620"}

For such data, the existing state-of-the-art computer vision methods perform poorly in segmenting specific cell type. Low SNR, clutter and occlusions are basic challenges for blind segmentation approaches. In this study we propose an automated method, based on a learning framework, for detecting particular cell type in cluttered 2D phase contrast images of 3D cell cultures that overcomes those challenges.

A practical solution for these high-dimensional problems is marginal regression, where the output is regressed on each variable separately.

Although human similarity judgments are the gold standard, computational analysis is often preferable, since results are often easier to reproduce, and computational methods are much more scalable. Moreover, computation based approaches can be calculated quickly and on demand, which is a prerequisite for use with an online system. We propose StyleRank, a method to measure the similarity between a MIDI file and an arbitrary musical style delineated by a collection of MIDI files. MIDI files are encoded using a novel set of features and an embedding is learned using Random Forests. Experimental evidence demonstrates that StyleRank is highly correlated with human perception of stylistic similarity, and that it is precise enough to rank generated samples based on their similarity to the style of a corpus. In addition, similarity can be measured with respect to a single feature, allowing specific discrepancies between generated samples and a particular musical style to be identified.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.06226", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "J Ens and P Pasquier.\"Quantifying Musical Style: Ranking Symbolic Music based on Similarity to a Style\".

Businesses have already started to use Big Data Analytics, particularly predictive and prescriptive analytics, to strengthen and increase their business yields. Not only has analytics resulted in business growth, but has also provided a significant competitive edge over others. The voluminous data generated from various resources is highly unstructured in nature and adding a structure to it would leverage the actual potential of the data. New techniques and frameworks should serve as human aids in automatically and intelligently analyzing large datasets in order to acquire useful information. In this paper, we attempt to perform Big Data Analytics on data from one of the most important and growing sources, namely, Telecommunication. To keep pace with the growing telecommunication market and ever increasing demands of the consumers for quality service, the telecom service providers are required to observe and estimate various trends in customer's usage to plan future upgrades and deployments driven by real data. We have attempted to use several data mining techniques to find hidden and interesting patterns from the telecom data generated by Telecoms Italia cellular network for the city of Milano, Italy. K-means clustering is used to categorize the usage statistics while several machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and SVM are used for predicting the usage of telecom services. In the end, a performance comparison matrix is generated to rate the performance of these algorithms for the given dataset. All these experiments are performed on the big data environment set up at the supercomputing infrastructure of C-DAC.

However, the AFT imposes the restrictive log-linear relation between the survival time and the explanatory variables. In this paper, we introduce a relevance vector machine survival (RVMS) model based on Weibull AFT model that enables the use of kernel framework to automatically learn the possible nonlinear effects of the input explanatory variables on target survival times. We take advantage of the Bayesian inference technique in order to estimate the model parameters. We also introduce two approaches to accelerate the RVMS training. In the first approach, an efficient smooth prior is employed that improves the degree of sparsity. In the second approach, a fast marginal likelihood maximization procedure is used for obtaining a sparse solution of survival analysis task by sequential addition and deletion of candidate basis functions. These two approaches, denoted by smooth RVMS and fast RVMS, typically use fewer basis functions than RVMS and improve the RVMS training time; however, they cause a slight degradation in the RVMS performance. We compare the RVMS and the two accelerated approaches with the previous sparse kernel survival analysis method on a synthetic data set as well as six real-world data sets. The proposed kernel survival analysis models have been discovered to be more accurate in prediction, although they benefit from extra sparsity. The main advantages of our proposed models are: 1) extra sparsity that leads to a better generalization and avoids overfitting; 2) automatic relevance sample determination based on data that provide more accuracy, in particular for highly censored survival data; and 3) flexibility to utilize arbitrary number and types of kernel functions (e.g., non-Mercer kernels and multikernel learning).", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25910258", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2420611", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1985516812", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["120752418", "35738432", "8821348", "40959121", "6662605", "15748559", "2271776", "18260495", "3149474", "18543742", "15037168", "5117817", "19196574", "7596571", "15179374", "13229207", "1885046", "2579363", "2387364", "199133108", "13899309", "6530745", "11461514", "62248428", "13358226", "21875843", "6723676"], "inbound_citations": ["2062020", "51612647", "14707632", "203581125", "209455380", "174800523", "4348594", "204843194", "8164705"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9154943"}

Materials and Methods In this study, we retrospectively collected FFDM and DBT images of 78 biopsy-proven lesions from 76 patients. A region of interest was selected for each lesion on FFDM, synthesized 2D, and DBT key slice images. Features were extracted from each lesion using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) and served as input to a support vector machine classifier trained in the task of predicting likelihood of malignancy. Results From receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of all 78 lesions, the synthesized 2D image performed best in both the cradiocaudal view (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.81, SE = 0.05) and mediolateral oblique view (AUC = 0.88, SE = 0.04) in the task of lesion characterization. When cradiocaudal and mediolateral oblique data of each lesion were merged through soft voting, DBT key slice image performed best (AUC = 0.89, SE = 0.04). When only masses and architectural distortions (ARDs) were considered, DBT performed significantly better than FFDM (p = 0.024). Conclusion DBT performed significantly better than FFDM in the merged view classification of mass and ARD lesions. The increased performance suggests that the information extracted by the CNN from DBT images may be more relevant to lesion malignancy status than the information extracted from FFDM images. Therefore, this study provides supporting evidence for the efficacy of computer-aided diagnosis on DBT in the evaluation of mass and ARD lesions.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6355376", "pubmed_id": "30076083", "doi": "10.1016/j.acra.2018.06.019", "venue": "Academic radiology", "journal": "Academic radiology", "mag_id": "2885841583", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["209696406", "213193802", "59606795", "215306023", "92990558", "211060194", "52985642", "210860905", "207902310", "88492059"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51912077"}

A promising algorithm, known as guided policy search (GPS), is capable of handling the challenge of training samples using trajectory-centric methods. It can also provide asymptotic local convergence guarantees. However, in its current form, the GPS algorithm cannot operate in sequential multitask learning scenarios. This is due to its batch-style training requirement, where all training samples are collectively provided at the start of the learning process. The algorithm\u2019s adaptation is thus hindered for real-time applications, where training samples or tasks can arrive randomly. In this paper, the GPS approach is reformulated, by adapting a recently proposed, lifelong-learning method, and elastic weight consolidation. Specifically, Fisher information is incorporated to impart knowledge from previously learned tasks.

To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel distribution-adaptation-based method, the multi-label metric transfer learning (MLMTL), to relax these two assumptions and handle more general multi-label learning tasks effectively. In particular, MLMTL extends the maximum mean discrepancy method into multi-label classification by learning and adjusting the weights for the multi-labeled training instances. In this way, MLMTL bridges the instance distribution and label distribution divergence between training and test datasets. In addition, based on the balanced multi-label training data, we explore the intrinsic geometric information of the label space by encoding it into a distance metric learning framework.

Among the commonly used geometry features are the features that are based on triangle properties. Generally, triangle properties can be used to produce the features for image classification. To produce these features, triangle geometry need to be formed based on three coordinates which are the corners of A, B and C. However, not all triangle ::: formations can be formed from the three coordinates due to the condition where corners of A, B and C may cause a straight line problem. The straight line problem occurs when the chosen coordinates of the corners of A, B and C are in a straight line which causes the triangle geometry impossible to be formed. On the other hand, the straight line occurs when the gradient of corners A, B and C produces the equivalent value. This can be proved by the experiment conducted to identify the gradient that has equivalent value where the position of coordinates A, B and C will determine either the triangle can be formed or vice versa. The purpose of this study is to suggest an improvement on triangle geometry shape through triangle point selection. To achieve this purpose, there are two ::: objectives suggested for this study. They are: i) to propose straight line detection technique for corner A, B and C of triangle; and ii) to improve triangle shape by proposing location of corners based on dominant distribution of foreground image. In the experiment, four types of digit dataset are chosen which are IFCHDB, HODA, MNIST and BANGLA where each datasets is consisted of testing data and training data. The Detection of Triangle Point Selection (DTPS) is proposed to detect the triangle point that caused a straight line to be formed. Then, the straight line problem is solved using Triangle Geometry Based Dominant Distribution of Foreground Image (TD2FI). Next, the Triangle Features Based Summation of Gradient and Ratio (TSGR) and Enhancement of Proposed Triangle Features using Absolute Value (EFTA) are proposed in order to ::: improve the classification accuracy result. The experimental results are yielded by comparing the results of classification accuracy between the present proposed methods with a prior proposed method using the supervised machine learning (SML). The SML used are the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The ::: result of classification accuracy has shown impressive results for TD2FI, TSGR and EFTA methods through the SVM and MLP techniques whereas the datasets from IFCHDB, ::: HODA and BANGLA respectively have acquired good results through the SVM technique while MNIST dataset has acquired the highest result of classification accuracy through the ::: MLP technique. The result of classification accuracy for TD2FI is 94.723% from IFCHDB dataset, 97.295% from HODA dataset, 95.4% from MNIST dataset and 90.275% from BANGLA dataset.

{"paper_id": "61699585", "title": "Multi-graph learning", "authors": [{"first": "Jia", "middle": [], "last": "Wu", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Multi-instance learning (MIL) is a special learning task where labels are only available for a bag of instances. Although MIL has been used for many applications, existing MIL algorithms cannot handle complex data objects, and all require that instances inside each bag are represented as feature vectors (e.g. being represented in an instancefeature format). In reality, many real-world objects are inherently complicated, and an object can be represented as multiple instances with dependency structures (i.e. graphs). Such dependency allows relationships between objects to play important roles, which, unfortunately, remain unaddressed in traditional instance-feature representations. Motivated by the challenges, this thesis formulates a new multi-graph learning paradigm for representing and classifying complicated objects. With the proposed multi-graph representation, the thesis systematically addresses several key learning tasks, including Multi-Graph Learning: A graph bag contains one or multiple graphs, and each bag is labeled as either positive or negative. The aim of multi-graph learning is to build a learning model from a number of labeled training bags to predict previously unseen bags with maximum accuracy. To solve the problem, we propose two types of approaches: 1) Multi-Graph Feature based Learning (gMGFL) algorithm that explores and selects an optimal set of subgraphs as features to transfer each bag into a single instance for further learning; and 2) Boosting based Multi-Graph Classification framework (bMGC), which employs dynamic weight adjustment, at both graphand bag-levels, to select one subgraph in each iteration to form a set of weak graph classifiers. Multi-Instance Multi-Graph learning: A bag contains a number of instances and graphs in pairs, and the learning objective is to derive classification models from labeled bags, containing both instances and graphs, to predict previously unseen bags with maximum accuracy. In the thesis, we propose a Dual Embedding Multi-Instance Multi-Graph Learning (DE-MIMG) algorithm, which employs a dual embedding learning approach to (1) embed instance distributions into the informative subgraphs discovery process, and (2) embed discovered subgraphs into the instance feature selection process. Positive and Unlabeled Multi-Graph Learning: The training set only contains positive and unlabeled bags, where labels are only available for bags but not for individual graphs inside the bag. This problem setting raises significant challenges because bag-of-graph setting does not have features available to directly represent graph data, and no negative bags exits for deriving discriminative classification models. To solve the challenge, we propose a puMGL learning framework which relies on two iteratively combined processes: (1) deriving features to represent graphs for learning; and (2) deriving discriminative models with only positive and unlabeled graph bags. Multi-Graph-View Learning: A multi-graph-view model utilizes graphs constructed from multiple graph-views to represent an object. In our research, we formulate a new multi-graph-view learning task for graph classification, where each object to be classified is represented graphs under multi-graph-view. To solve the problem, we propose a Cross Graph-View Subgraph Feature based Learning (gCGVFL) algorithm that explores an optimal set of subgraph features cross multiple graph-views. In addition, a bag based multi-graph model is further used to relax the labeling by only requiring one label for each graph bag, which corresponds to one object. For learning classification models, we propose a multi-graph-view bag learning algorithm (MGVBL), to explore subgraphs from multiple graph-views for learning. Experiments on real-world data validate and demonstrate the performance of proposed methods for classifying complicated objects using multi-graph learning.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2323505830", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61699585"}

These data are known as energy big data. The analysis of big data divulges the deeper insights that help experts in the improvement of smart grid\u2019s (SG) operations. Processing and extracting of meaningful information from data is a challenging task. Electricity load and price are the most influential factors in the electricity market. For improving reliability, control and management of electricity market operations, an exact estimate of the day ahead load is a substantial requirement. Energy market trade is based on price. Accurate price forecast enables energy market participants to make effective and most profitable bidding strategies. This paper proposes a deep learning-based model for the forecast of price and demand for big data using Deep Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM). Due to the adaptive and automatic feature learning mechanism of Deep Neural Network (DNN), the processing of big data is easier with LSTM as compared to the purely data-driven methods. The proposed model was evaluated using well-known real electricity markets\u2019 data. In this study, day and week ahead forecasting experiments were conducted for all months. Forecast performance was assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). The proposed Deep LSTM (DLSTM) method was compared to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) time series forecasting methods, i.e., Nonlinear Autoregressive network with Exogenous variables (NARX) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM).

Yet an in-depth ecological and biological understanding of the significance of these metrics for tree species mapping remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of 37 frequently used LiDAR metrics derived under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions, respectively, for discriminating six different tree species in a natural forest in Germany. We firstly assessed the correlation between these metrics. Then we applied a Random Forest algorithm to classify the tree species and evaluated the importance of the LiDAR metrics. Finally, we identified the most important LiDAR metrics and tested their robustness and transferability. Our results indicated that about 60% of LiDAR metrics were highly correlated to each other (|r| > 0.7). There was no statistically significant difference in tree species mapping accuracy between the use of leaf-on and leaf-off LiDAR metrics. However, combining leaf-on and leaf-off LiDAR metrics significantly increased the overall accuracy from 58.2% (leaf-on) and 62.0% (leaf-off) to 66.5% as well as the kappa coefficient from 0.47 (leaf-on) and 0.51 (leaf-off) to 0.58. Radiometric features, especially intensity related metrics, provided more consistent and significant contributions than geometric features for tree species discrimination. Specifically, the mean intensity of first-or-single returns as well as the mean value of echo width were identified as the most robust LiDAR metrics for tree species discrimination. These results indicate that metrics derived from airborne LiDAR data, especially radiometric metrics, can aid in discriminating tree species in a mixed temperate forest, and represent candidate metrics for tree species classification and monitoring in Central Europe.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2018.02.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2789860026", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202743703", "214702717", "208224461", "208224397", "156055484", "211550185"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125415243"}

The task of semantic role labeling (SRL) is to identify the predicate-argument structures and label the relations between the predicate and each of its arguments. Researchers have been studying SRL as a machine learning problem in the past six years, after large-scale semantically annotated corpora such as FrameNet and PropBank were released to the research community. Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars (LTAGs), a tree rewriting formalism, are often a convenient representation for capturing locality of predicate-argument relations. Our work in this thesis is focused on the development and learning of the state of the art discriminative SRL systems with LTAGs. Our contributions to this field include: We apply to the SRL task a variant of the LTAG formalism called LTAG-spinal and the associated LTAG-spinal Treebank (the formalism and the Treebank were created by Libin Shen). Predicate-argument relations that are either implicit or absent from the original Penn Treebank are made explicit and accessible in the LTAG-spinal Treebank, which we show to be a useful resource for SRL. We propose the use of the LTAGs as an important additional source of features for the SRL task. Our experiments show that, compared with the best-known set of features that are used in state of the art SRL systems, LTAG-based features can improve SRL performance significantly. We treat multiple LTAG derivation trees as latent features for SRL and introduce a novel learning framework \u2013 Latent Support Vector Machines (LSVMs) to the SRL task using these latent features.

Motor imagery is one of the techniques that is usually used to command a BMI. To that end, an accurate method to classify different mental tasks is needed. In this paper, the accuracy of a SVM-based system (Support Vector Machine) is analyzed using four different procedures that include two feature extraction methods: Periodogram and Welch's method. The results show that by using a SVM-based system it is possible to obtain enough accuracy for the suggested purpose.

This problem mostly manifests in a subscriber based environment, where a user-specific ensemble needs to be stored on a personal device with strict storage limitations (such as a cellular device). In this work we introduce a novel method for lossless compression of tree-based ensemble methods, focusing on Random Forests. Our suggested method is based on probabilistic modeling of the ensemble's trees, followed by model clustering via Bregman divergence. This allows us to find a minimal set of models that provides an accurate description of the trees, and at the same time is small enough to store and maintain.

We further explore its connection to the three well-known entropy-based decision tree criteria, i.e., Shannon entropy, Gini-entropy and its modified variant, for which efficient optimization strategies are largely unknown in the extreme multiclass setting. We show theoretically that this objective can be viewed as a surrogate function for all of these entropy criteria and that maximizing it indirectly optimizes them as well. We derive boosting guarantees and obtain a closed-form expression for the number of iterations needed to reduce the considered entropy criteria below an arbitrary threshold.

With this information, the attacker can circumvent a rule-based cyber-defense system. However, after the advancements of machine learning for network anomaly, it is not easy for a human to understand how to bypass a cyber-defence system. Recently, adversarial attacks have become increasingly common to defeat machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we show that even if we build a classifier and train it with adversarial examples for network data, we can use adversarial attacks and successfully break the system.

In the end, about 61% of our images are thought to be created by human designers rather than by a computer while also being considered original per our human subject experiments, and our proposed loss scores the highest compared to existing losses in both novelty and likability.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1804.00921", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-11015-4_5", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2950879164,2796103877,2963181909", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["119058778", "5276660", "1698147", "12211154", "28319612", "1282515", "5687613", "206593710", "1033682", "489789", "8968704", "1215640", "206594692", "6200260", "980236", "61287295", "3568073", "32665336", "16842475", "147582684", "69951972", "2557710", "1099052", "11758569", "1515901", "1687220", "4565882", "515925", "1023605", "1541706", "57832010", "4872519", "1277217", "3416149", "206770979", "7352545"], "inbound_citations": ["29157404", "208202449", "195783948", "210911795", "52815143", "52076600", "197545177", "91184301", "53410211", "59599920", "54474364", "207977096", "204959997", "71151728", "209493487", "86614810", "195699395", "4565882"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4565882"}

Most design mechanisms are focused on perturbing the solution to a decent convex optimization problem under the theory of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). To preserve the accuracy, a large number of labeled data is needed for training the model. However, in most cases, the labeled data is limited. Constructing private SVMs in such cases often suffers from low accuracy. The situation gets worse if the given privacy budget is small. In this paper, we make use of Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVMs) to learn from the unlabeled data. Through minimizing the overall loss on both labeled and unlabeled data, we generate a label assignment pool. Each label assignment in the pool is first evaluated as an output candidate, then selected with uncertainty for privacy consideration.

Lifetime data are analyzed and evaluated. The occurrence of critical faults in every test is located, and a critical operational threshold is established. Multiple statistical features from the time-domain, frequency domain, and time-scale domain through a wavelet transform are extracted from the recordings of two accelerometers, and assessed for their diagnostic performance. Among those features, Wiener entropy is utilized for the first time in the condition monitoring of rolling bearings. A SVR model is trained and tested for the prediction of RUL on unseen data.

To ensure an effective and efficient spatial information assimilation, the proposed spatially-conditioned GANs take calibrated pixel coordinates in global physical space as conditioning input, and utilise residual network units and shortcuts of conditioning data in the GANs' discriminator and generator, respectively. Using optically tracked B-mode ultrasound images, acquired by an experienced sonographer on a fetus phantom, we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method by two sets of quantitative results: distances were calculated between corresponding anatomical landmarks identified in the held-out ultrasound images and the simulated data at the same locations unseen to the networks; a usability study was carried out to distinguish the simulated data from the real images.

In this paper, we propose to handle long-tail classes in the training of a face recognition engine by augmenting their feature space under a center-based feature transfer framework. A Gaussian prior is assumed across all the head (regular) classes and the variance from regular classes are transferred to the long-tail class representation. This encourages the long-tail distribution to be closer to the regular distribution, while enriching and balancing the limited training data. Further, an alternating training regimen is proposed to simultaneously achieve less biased decision boundaries and a more discriminative feature representation. We conduct empirical studies that mimic long-tail datasets by limiting the number of samples and the proportion of long-tail classes on the MS-Celeb-1M dataset. We compare our method with baselines not designed to handle long-tail classes and also with state-of-the-art methods on face recognition benchmarks.

In this paper, we use the real network-side big data from the current operated TD-LTE network owned by China Mobile to predict atmospheric duct interference via machine learning. The results shows that using machine learning can get a good prediction performance for ADI. In addition, we compare the training time of different machine learning algorithm and find RF (Random Forest) has a short training time meanwhile maintains similar prediction accuracy and is thus more practical to operators.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/GLOCOMW.2017.8269206", "venue": "2017 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)", "journal": "2017 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2786696023", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["119792727", "122537895", "62363953", "33153245", "62757018", "24272147", "18811427", "1413802", "44211994", "3922970", "8407336", "29921342", "577580", "85047150", "51789432", "24275536"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32331294"}

A World Health Organization (WHO) report estimates that in 2015, at least 561 thousand women will die of breast cancer. Although breast cancer is considered a disease of the developed world, nearly 50% of the cases and 58% of the deaths occur in the less developed countries. A mammogram is a way of discovering not just the palpable tumors that cause cancer but also other lesions that are not perceived during the physical examination performed by the expert physician or during self-exams; however, it is known that this exam is targeted for women after the age of 40 because age is one of the factors that can cause great variations in sensitivity during the exam. Besides the patient's age, the expert's experience and the quality of the images obtained during the exam are decisive factors in the detection of breast cancer. This work presents two novelties. The first is the use of Local Binary Patterns (LBPs) to generate a representation of a Region of Interest (ROI) image. Over this representation, we generate other representations using techniques such as image histograms, gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs) and gray-level run-length matrices (GLRLMs). These representations allow texture analysis through several perspectives. The second novelty uses these representations as input to the application of indexes adapted from ecology (Shannon, McIntosh, Simpson, Gleason and Menhinick) as texture descriptors. Based on this strategy, we analyze mammographic image textures to classify regions of these images as benign or malignant using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The best result achieved was of 88.31% accuracy, 85% sensitivity, 91.89% specificity, a positive probability ratio of 10.48, a negative probability ratio of 0.16, and an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.88, obtained through the Shannon index. We believe that the proposed method, with some adaptations, may also be used for image texture analysis of several different lesions such as lung nodules, glaucoma and prostates. This belief is based on the achieved results and the method's simplicity.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2016.08.070", "venue": "Expert Syst.

These climatic changes influence many unpredictable indefinite factors. This alarming situation requires a robust forecasting method that could efficiently work with incomplete and multivariate data. Most of the existing methods tend to trap into local minimum or encounter over fitting problems that mostly lead to an inappropriate outcome. The complexity of data regarding time series forecasting does not allow any one single method to yield results suitable in all situations as claimed by most researchers. To deal with the problem, a technique that uses hybrid models has also been devised and tested. The applied hybrid methods did bring some improvement compared to the individual model performance. However, most of these available hybrid models exploit univariate data that requires huge historical data to achieve precise forecasting results. Therefore, this study introduces a new hybrid model based on three layered architecture: Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), correlation (R) and Kernel Principle Components Analyses (KPCA). The three-staged architecture of the proposed hybrid model includes Wavelet-LSSVM and Wavelet-KPCA-LSSVM enabling the model to present itself as a well-established alternative application to predict the future of river flow. The proposed model has been applied to four different data sets of time series, taking into account different time series behavior and data scale. The performance of the proposed model is compared against the existing individual models and then a comparison is also drawn with the existing hybrid models. The results of WKPLSSVM obtained from Coefficient of Efficiency (CE) performance measuring methods confirmed that proposed model has encouraging data of 0.98%, 0.99%, 0.94% and 0.99% for Jhelum River, Chenab River, Bernam River and Tualang River, respectively. It is more robust for all datasets regardless of the sample sizes and data behavior. These results are further verified using diverse data sets in order to check the stability and adaptability. The results have demonstrated that the proposed hybrid model is a better alternative tool for time series forecasting. The proposed hybrid model proves to be one of the best available solutions considering the time series forecasting issues.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2976300094", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204089297"}

It has enabled a number of new machine learning applications, e.g. graph mining and link analysis. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) performs relational learning either directly by manipulating first-order rules or through propositionalization, which translates the relational task into an attribute-value learning task by representing subsets of relations as features. In this paper, we introduce a fast method and system for relational learning based on a novel propositionalization called Bottom Clause Propositionalization (BCP). Bottom clauses are boundaries in the hypothesis search space used by ILP systems Progol and Aleph. Bottom clauses carry semantic meaning and can be mapped directly onto numerical vectors, simplifying the feature extraction process. We have integrated BCP with a well-known neural-symbolic system, C-IL2P, to perform learning from numerical vectors. C-IL2P uses background knowledge in the form of propositional logic programs to build a neural network. The integrated system, which we call CILP++, handles first-order logic knowledge and is available for download from Sourceforge. We have evaluated CILP++ on seven ILP datasets, comparing results with Aleph and a well-known propositionalization method, RSD. The results show that CILP++ can achieve accuracy comparable to Aleph, while being generally faster, BCP achieved statistically significant improvement in accuracy in comparison with RSD when running with a neural network, but BCP and RSD perform similarly when running with C4.5. We have also extended CILP++ to include a statistical feature selection method, mRMR, with preliminary results indicating that a reduction of more than 90 % of features can be achieved with a small loss of accuracy.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10994-013-5392-1", "venue": "Machine Learning", "journal": "Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1986767090", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["37584572", "21222240", "7365231", "9504560", "16778948", "6930911", "27293359", "140103139", "9531857", "1831347", "28715329", "21039761", "16978675", "7278900", "63336923", "14002173", "116764021", "4617340", "379259", "60504238", "10724395", "15772014", "4428725", "14995779", "118426129", "11261417", "10227620", "2526853", "36237350", "60806909", "8029054", "12643399", "16762143", "47073917", "7005401", "45460059", "7532907", "27001489", "6868625", "29950980", "33343141", "5262555", "12698795", "62245742", "566608", "10537848", "11059482", "6492898"], "inbound_citations": ["7663461", "147518854", "12935129", "203837019", "13400018", "118641233", "204939091", "31023826", "14941215", "17173917", "210932516", "8948238", "189898023", "209412350", "2351520", "6180068", "22834293", "155092677", "1526103", "14752894", "51735042", "53417778", "13756305", "11066688", "182952646", "34568616", "9333042", "29164914", "91184006", "19218953", "14629360", "198953462", "68245906", "209421133", "52092149", "8055608", "51655609", "2453700", "133271470", "202558762", "202558640", "204832282", "152283617"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14682074"}
