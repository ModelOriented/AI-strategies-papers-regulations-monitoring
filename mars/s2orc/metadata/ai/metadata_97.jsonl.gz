They also allow for spatial variation of SOC in environmental process models. SOC is spatially highly variable. In traditional approaches, SOC concentrations and stocks have been derived from estimates for single or very few profiles and spatially linked to existing units of soil or vegetation maps. However, many existing soil profile data are incomplete and untested as to whether they are representative or unbiased. Also single means for soil or vegetation map units cannot characterize SOC spatial variability within these units. We here use the digital soil mapping approach to predict the spatial distribution of SOC. This relies on a soil inference model based on spatially referenced environmental layers of topographic attributes, soil units, parent material, and forest history. We sampled soils at 165 sites, stratified according to topography and lithology, on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, at depths of 0\u201310 cm, 10\u201320 cm, 20\u201330 cm, and 30\u201350 cm, and analyzed them for SOC by dry combustion. We applied Random Forest (RF) analysis as a modeling tool to the SOC data for each depth interval in order to compare vertical and lateral distribution patterns. RF has several advantages compared to other modeling approaches, for instance, the fact that it is neither sensitive to overfitting nor to noise features. The RF-based digital SOC mapping approach provided SOC estimates of high spatial resolution and estimates of error and predictor importance. The environmental variables that explained most of the variation in the topsoil (0\u201310 cm) were topographic attributes. In the subsoil (10\u201350 cm), SOC distribution was best explained by soil texture classes as derived from soil mapping units. The estimates for SOC stocks in the upper 30 cm ranged between 38 and 116 Mg ha \u2212 1 , with lowest stocks on midslope and highest on toeslope positions. This digital soil mapping approach can be applied to similar landscapes to refine the spatial resolution of SOC estimates.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geoderma.2008.05.008", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2081340599", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["95608476", "4640627", "83921141", "85742293", "97259408", "129052441", "131673352", "84782641", "55970222", "128701389", "207738357", "89141", "60993494", "39008803", "129013455", "5516889", "128399384", "95701228", "14915330", "129823537", "15245447", "214737703", "14346252", "1638095", "40733284", "27545358", "10992992", "129099643", "13928679", "55588425", "26426213", "96279384", "9083683", "129370037", "95106479", "128416082", "128851127", "13262019", "86310400", "54001147", "15522056", "131065960", "55559511", "14356434", "129430918", "130473907", "130119475", "131528125", "6429520", "86387895", "129711183", "14327012", "27423183", "32926961", "787741", "123059315", "86348964", "129502166", "28409267", "118141948", "31107781", "23369575", "6142858", "15301993", "128839477", "4408395", "129823695", "84365817", "53484875", "129843368", "132644702", "55622516", "129474552", "97900071", "11111763"], "inbound_citations": ["134947975", "15169936", "130360601", "214895767", "195853476", "209376325", "204542509", "55109758", "134476621", "203027438", "158331892", "130093371", "93123796", "67821363", "108464733", "49558812", "196044234", "140635916", "135053678", "117905040", "21044161", "208345704", "215382103", "215540625", "134867848", "4663124", "205145511", "211226638", "211258875", "17089006", "60441900", "54174373", "45771574", "110508860", "209352579", "208224385", "205608365", "99726336", "4229608", "201629228", "53560844", "197585260", "115204772", "53422071", "62361429", "42179358", "55724944", "199842469", "128912231", "61156451", "102796104", "21163708", "11899581", "94979180", "106294826", "26207270", "15775263", "54707745", "55354879", "13770219", "53040810", "207965671", "24378792", "55236522", "111379860", "13509055", "8964580", "129311094", "207821332", "334631", "102309539", "214689328", "54015196", "17034326", "201201447", "11933914", "206380734", "197411143", "214601619", "49258797", "54719127", "38903873", "55357817", "59127708", "14940601", "53338297", "214947808", "88524513", "134999756", "62840938", "53329693", "130495998", "16644123", "21828366", "129312459", "133159339", "44207664", "17467751", "85934330", "12436505", "198441691", "135032681", "134387445", "201117817", "15844081", "22744312", "23086600"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55920213"}

Diagnosing depression in the early stage is crucial to treatment process. However, due to depression's comorbid nature and the subjectivity in diagnosis, an early diagnosis could be challenging. Recently, machine learning approaches have been used to process Electroencephalography (EEG) and neuroimaging data to facilitate the diagnosis. In the present study, we used a multimodal machine learning approach involving EEG, eye tracking and galvanic skin response data as input to classify depression patients and healthy controls. Methods One hundred and forty-four MDD depression patients and 204 matched healthy controls were recruited. They were required to watch a series of affective and neutral stimuli while EEG, eye tracking information and galvanic skin response were recorded via a set of low-cost, portable devices. Three machine learning algorithms including Random Forests, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were trained to build dichotomous classification model. Results The results showed that the highest classification f 1 score was obtained by Logistic Regression algorithms, with accuracy = 79.63%, precision = 76.67%, recall = 85.19% and f 1 score = 80.70% Limitations No hospitalized patients were available; only outpatients were included in the present study. The sample consisted mostly of young adult, and no elder patients were included.

In the literature two major shortcomings of decision trees have been pointed out: (1) instability, and (2) high computational cost. These problems have been addressed to some extent through ensemble learning techniques such as Random Forest. Unlike decision trees where the whole attribute space of a dataset is used to discover the best test attribute for a node, in Random Forest a random subspace of attributes is first selected from which the test attribute for a node is then identified. The property that randomly selects an attribute subspace can cause the selection of all/many poor quality attributes in a subspace resulting in an individual tree with low accuracy. Therefore, in this paper we propose a probabilistic selection of attributes (instead of a random selection) where the probability of the selection of an attribute is proportionate to its quality. Although we developed this approach independently, after the research was completed we discovered that some existing techniques also took the same approach. While in this paper we use mutual information as a measure of an attribute quality, the papers in the literature used information gain ratio and a t-test as the measure.

These environments involve large variations in both geometry and appearance, challenging perception systems that rely on only a single sensor modality. Geometrically, tall grass, fallen leaves, or terrain roughness can mistakenly be perceived as nontraversable or might even obscure actual obstacles. Likewise, traversable grass or dirt roads and obstacles such as trees and bushes might be visually ambiguous. In this paper, we combine appearance- and geometry-based detection methods by probabilistically fusing lidar and camera sensing with semantic segmentation using a conditional random field. We apply a state-of-the-art multimodal fusion algorithm from the scene analysis domain and adjust it for obstacle detection in agriculture with moving ground vehicles. This involves explicitly handling sparse point cloud data and exploiting both spatial, temporal, and multimodal links between corresponding 2D and 3D regions. The proposed method was evaluated on a diverse data set, comprising a dairy paddock and different orchards gathered with a perception research robot in Australia. Results showed that for a two-class classification problem (ground and nonground), only the camera leveraged from information provided by the other modality with an increase in the mean classification score of 0.5%. However, as more classes were introduced (ground, sky, vegetation, and object), both modalities complemented each other with improvements of 1.4% in 2D and 7.9% in 3D.

The method which has been proposed in this paper is based on multiple regression trees (so called Random Forests). The splits at each node of the regression tree are sampled from a probability distribution. Several criteria are enforced at each level of splitting to ensure positive information gain and also to distinguish between behavioural and non-behavioural model representations. The latter distinction is applied in the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) and regional sensitivity analysis (RSA) framework to analyse model results and is used here to derive regression tree (model) structures. Two methods of sensitivity analysis are used: in the first method the total information gain achieved by each parameter is evaluated. In the second method parameters and parameter sets are permuted and an error rate computed. This error rate is compared to values without permutation. This latter method allows the evaluation of the sensitivity of parameter combinations and thus gives an insight into the structure of the response surface.

In this challenging environment it is critical for telcos to maintain or grow their market share, by providing users with as good an experience as possible on their network. But the task of extracting customer insights from the vast amounts of data collected by telcos is growing in complexity and scale everey day. How can we measure and predict the quality of a user's experience on a telco network in real-time? That is the problem that we address in this paper. We present an approach to capture, in (near) real-time, the mobile customer experience in order to assess which conditions lead the user to place a call to a telco's customer care center. To this end, we follow a supervised learning approach for prediction and train our Restricted Random Forest model using, as a proxy for bad experience, the observed customer transactions in the telco data feed before the user places a call to a customer care center.

As there are two different factors, i.e., bootstrap selection of instances and random selection of features, encouraging diversity in RSB-SVM, it would be advantageous to get better performance.

Usually, no attempt is made to identify sensitive parameters, and those that are used are often given \"factory-supplied\" default values, or values obtained from some non-systematic exploratory analysis. The immediate consequence of this is, of course, that it is not clear if better models could have been obtained if some form of parameter selection and optimisation had been performed. Questions follow inevitably on the experiments themselves: specifically, are all algorithms being treated fairly, and is the exploratory phase sufficiently well-defined to allow the experiments to be replicated? In this paper, we investigate the use of parameter selection and optimisation techniques grouped under the study of experimental design. Screening and response surface methods determine, in turn, sensitive parameters and good values for these parameters. Screening is done here by constructing a stepwise regression model relating the utility of an ILP system's hypothesis to its input parameters, using systematic combinations of values of input parameters (technically speaking, we use a two-level fractional factorial design of the input parameters). The parameters used by the regression model are taken to be the sensitive parameters for the system for that application. We then seek an assignment of values to these sensitive parameters that maximise the utility of the ILP model. This is done using the technique of constructing a local \"response surface\". The parameters are then changed following the path of steepest ascent until a locally optimal value is reached. This combined use of parameter selection and response surface-driven optimisation has a long history of application in industrial engineering, and its role in ILP is demonstrated using well-known benchmarks. The results suggest that computational overheads from this preliminary phase are not substantial, and that much can be gained, both on improving system performance and on enabling controlled experimentation, by adopting well-established procedures such as the ones proposed here.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-13840-9_21", "venue": "Journal of Machine Learning Research", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1568527204", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["45058654", "2715867", "124869750", "15572728", "60993494", "61127668", "19990980", "7042570", "57077449", "116764021", "125133067", "18869706", "386503", "682510", "16875156", "7594891", "5594501", "12643399", "16762143", "457364", "36402082", "18615641", "9220714", "125134461"], "inbound_citations": ["17443281", "10808461", "14697500", "49557240", "15305016", "4302025"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18229590"}

The exhaustive exploration of the matching space is replaced by considering a fixed, user-supplied, number of samples.

Nevertheless, the generic guiding information on factor selection lacks. This paper addresses the research gap to decompose building energy factor structure (i.e. the interaction structure among the factors which affect building energy performance) particularly at a nation level for factor selection. Specifically, an iterative approach is developed by integrating the technical strengths of Variable Clustering and Random Forest to remove collinearity, redundancy and nonrelevance. Based on a comprehensive source database extracted from a multiframe country-wide survey, the core energy factor space is revealed for 2779 commercial buildings in the U.S. In particular, 36 principal factors are identified to reliably explain building energy efficiency variations. These factors are of sufficient independence and heterogeneity which may benefit the development of parsimonious energy modeling frameworks. The robustness of the deciphered factor structure and the representativeness of the recognized critical factors are numerically validated.

A 2000\u20132019 literature search of articles on DSM of areas of Iran in international journals found 40 studies. These showed an increase in frequency over time, and most were completed in the arid and semi-arid regions of central Iran. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forests (RF), and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MnLR) were the most commonly applied models for predicting soil classes and properties and ANN performed best in most comparative studies. Given the scale of inquiry of most studies (local or regional), quantitative environmental variables such as terrain attributes and remote sensing data were frequently used whereas qualitative variables such as geomorphology, geology, land use, and legacy soil maps were rarely used. The literature review of CSM showed that this method is incapable of defining the spatial distribution of soils and also provides a lower accuracy than DSM method. This review has identified research gaps that need filling. In Iran, coherent national scale DSM with consistent methodology is needed to update legacy soil maps, and to apply DSM in forestlands, hillslopes, deserts, and mountainous regions which have largely been ignored in recent DSM studies.

The knowledge of gelatinous zooplankton distribution is especially challenging, because this type of plankton has a very fragile structure and cannot be directly sampled using traditional net based techniques. To overcome this shortcoming, Computer Vision techniques can be successfully used for the automatic monitoring of this group.This paper presents the GUARD1 imaging system, a low-cost stand-alone instrument for underwater image acquisition and recognition of gelatinous zooplankton, and discusses the performance of three different methodologies, Tikhonov Regularization, Support Vector Machines and Genetic Programming, that have been compared in order to select the one to be run onboard the system for the automatic recognition of gelatinous zooplankton. The performance comparison results highlight the high accuracy of the three methods in gelatinous zooplankton identification, showing their good capability in robustly selecting relevant features. In particular, Genetic Programming technique achieves the same performances of the other two methods by using a smaller set of features, thus being the most efficient in avoiding computationally consuming preprocessing stages, that is a crucial requirement for running on an autonomous imaging system designed for long lasting deployments, like the GUARD1. The Genetic Programming algorithm has been installed onboard the system, that has been operationally tested in a two-months survey in the Ligurian Sea, providing satisfactory results in terms of monitoring and recognition performances.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5191104", "pubmed_id": "27983638", "doi": "10.3390/s16122124", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2565635308", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13685436", "7435899", "34945428", "7084885", "62793057", "4831826", "41898132", "126610371", "3180571", "2570701", "6717363", "47556832", "20183683", "129884671", "32071295", "3735815", "7900085", "1835059", "210609477", "109341777", "28334029", "106614517", "13671970", "16877865", "35979467", "15070579", "27538875", "14727192", "1817621", "31978081", "112147431", "387449", "7060187", "62554673", "3154525", "12132610", "41505656", "53723323", "6422587", "2715202", "2778889", "45944920", "2702042", "7167292", "14134075", "16162039", "121589596", "60626986", "16909692", "15510371", "30996799", "5089877", "28865340", "31163938", "207720429", "13112052", "17945516", "8857622", "10659969", "215656058"], "inbound_citations": ["166228400", "189863508", "195880219", "52271968", "59604277"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17461960"}

The simplest form of ensemble learning is to train the base-level algorithms on random subsets of data and then let them vote for the most popular classifications or average the predictions of the base-level algorithms.

They are classified as benign and malignant based on their biological behaviour. Malignant ones are aggressively behaving and benign ones are non-aggressively behaving. Malignant tumors shows a number of variations in their nuclear morphological pattern which help to identify them. In this paper, we propose a method using Support Vector Machine learning for the classification of Benign and Malignant tissues based on the data obtained from the DNA ploidy analysis. We define the cancer detection process as a two-class classification using SVM, the two classes being Benign and Malignant cases. SVM is trained as a nonlinear classifier to automatically detect whether a given input data belongs to Benign tissue or a Malignant tissue. The images of aspiration tissue samples cannot be directly used for the extraction of feature values since they have uneven background and intensity variations between the nuclei and surrounding cytoplasm. Hence we apply some pre-processing on the input images before feature extraction using Intensity Thresholding and Active Contour Segmentation. Ten features were derived from the input images which helps the identification of Malignant and Benign tissues. Mean and Variance of the morphological features (area and perimeter) as well as the intensity based features (Total Optical Density, Hue and Saturation) are the selected inputs given to the SVM classfier. Datasets collected from a total of 50 input images (25 benign and 25 malignant) were used for training the classifier. The classifier performance was evaluated using a test dataset of 34 cases. 100% efficiency was obtained with a Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with the available test data cases.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICACC.2014.39", "venue": "2014 Fourth International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications", "journal": "2014 Fourth International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2087462113", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["27843037", "28822467", "62238932", "17142996", "9093151", "14228720", "22037143", "206622551", "2474873", "16639098", "72490905", "52874011"], "inbound_citations": ["215122575", "51918805", "42875101"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18978580"}

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a new malware detection method based on the control flow of executables. This method analyzes the control flow of executables and extracts execution traces from by the unit of function. This paper uses the execution traces to represent the behavior of the executables and present the execution traces by opcode sequences.

We investigated the factors underlying these distributional patterns and tested the hypothesis that species sharing similar resources tend to be spatially segregated. We characterized the niches of the species based on climatic, topographic, soil texture, landscape and hydrological predictors. The relationship between the presence of a species and the environmental gradient was assessed using distance-based linear models, and habitat suitability was modelled using Random Forests. Our results indicated that both E. orbicularis and N. astreptophora occupy extreme positions within the environmental gradient. Climate and landscape were the major factors influencing the relative occurrences of the stenotopic and eurytopic species.

On this view, selective impairments of cognitive tasks following brain damage, as evidenced by double dissociations, are naturally interpreted in terms of the loss of particular processing components. By contrast, the current investigation examines in detail a double dissociation between concrete and abstract word reading after damage to a connectionist network that pronounces words via meaning and yet has no separable components (Plaut & Shallice, 1993). The functional specialization in the network that gives rise to the double dissociation is not transparently related to the network's structure, as modular theories assume. Furthermore, a consideration of the distribution of effects across quantitatively equivalent individual lesions in the network raises specific concerns about the interpretation of single-cas...", "year": 1995, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "7629273", "doi": "10.1080/01688639508405124", "venue": "Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2022171196", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["141129341", "145547291", "10316189", "53177534", "58713480", "148525042", "16171263", "10199017", "4478274", "146923331", "140388736", "140930411", "140738982", "143761670", "141351707", "35859273", "5892527", "21975212", "1825817", "145147336", "76118906", "145340457", "197658202", "4474621", "145454435", "209396626", "141499899", "202927997", "145428950", "40228950", "145406585", "140978099", "145799181", "15557071", "140902329", "144782251", "6920027", "15118845", "7745106", "144621940", "141194653", "143670776", "14271672", "144200338", "140261593", "145803856", "58788111", "59705684", "5923001", "557347", "9520290", "143537260", "63512849", "5612467", "140855198", "125062866", "13539926", "30165868", "204326295", "145565964", "143375880", "140966434", "15642520", "143717733", "144569003", "41089024", "59761526", "20437199", "142856816", "144304713", "14498946", "29546288", "145283318", "24120691", "145451873", "9312360", "45527281", "12979634"], "inbound_citations": ["17636055", "15387014", "6778798", "1734598", "18629986", "34676316", "14769856", "7794164", "24684606", "17437628", "38180797", "100873", "35583025", "197682437", "35854055", "18234154", "12407971", "14942786", "17667558", "4956137", "15195400", "17412354", "14028158", "18771103", "1095851", "14198227", "19511216", "5660475", "118180", "53648335", "73590208", "15250126", "37168847", "41847991", "6464607", "8838693", "17232726", "15827058", "58939966", "31382431", "828026", "11295161", "7384291", "214094533", "6991934", "5043404", "24883087", "9722370", "49963361", "15181712", "9562607", "67792785", "1622120", "9496286", "6602527", "13887803", "210981545", "17310168", "15264894", "41594052", "756347", "8462198", "14838462", "822994", "12175555", "7906026", "12246419", "13886186", "17861269", "18463947", "18418209", "51703557", "17423714", "49979763", "21149840", "1093180", "18820694", "723158", "11606306", "16794832", "945823", "11773897", "17298525", "14316722", "14850688", "13708782", "54522168", "684322", "16992660", "18075721", "11538090", "16252461", "15787824", "16600576", "7603119", "45967061", "16059948", "2903657", "15285639", "26854394", "853194", "7312458", "32815255", "7111762", "16340623", "17905799", "14356610", "2746742", "46711424", "14448198", "162879", "15538486", "10771699", "391371", "52333416", "5995835", "207222250", "26038927", "4480920", "5002176", "8314193"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15713429"}

In particular, samples with missing data views (e.g., functional imaging modality) constitute a hurdle to conventional big data learning techniques which ideally would be trained using a maximum number of samples across all views. Existing works on predicting target data views from a source data view mainly used brain images such as predicting PET image from MRI image. However, to the best of our knowledge, predicting a set of target brain networks from a source network remains unexplored. To fill this gap, a multi-kernel manifold learning (MKML) framework is proposed to learn how to predict multi-view brain networks from a source network to impute missing views in a connectomic dataset. Prior to performing multiple kernel learning of multi-view data, it is typically assumed that the source and target data come from the same distribution. However, multi-view connectomic data can be drawn from different distributions. In order to build robust predictors for predicting target multi-view networks from a source network view, it is necessary to take into account the shift between the source and target domains. Hence, we first estimate a mapping function that transforms the source and the target domains into a shared space where their correlation is maximized using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Next, we nest the projected training and testing source samples into a connectomic manifold using multiple kernel learning, where we identify the most similar training samples to the testing source network. Given a testing subject, we introduce a cross-domain trust score to assess the reliability of each selected training sample for the target prediction task. Our model outperformed both conventional MKML technique and the proposed CCA-based MKML technique without enhancement by trust scores.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-00320-3_12", "venue": "PRIME@MICCAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2889639023", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["196623503"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52271933"}

The major challenge to this end however lies in the disease variability encountered over different populations, often imaged under different acquisition conditions and high heterogeneity of tumor characterization in location, size and appearance. In this work, we consider the Retinoblastoma disease, the most common eye cancer in children. To provide automated segmentations of relevant structures, a multi-sequences MRI dataset of 72 subjects is introduced, collected across different clinical sites with different magnetic fields (3T and 1.5T), with healthy and pathological subjects (children and adults). Using this data, we present a framework to segment both healthy and pathological eye structures. In particular, we make use of a 3D U-net CNN whereby using four encoder and decoder layers to produce conditional probabilities of different eye structures. These are further refined using a Conditional Random Field with Gaussian kernels to maximize label agreement between similar voxels in multi-sequence MRIs.

Conceptually, the case for using ILP to construct relational features rests on treating these features as functions, the automated discovery of which necessarily requires some form of first-order learning. Practically, there are now several reports in the literature that suggest that augmenting any existing feature with ILP-discovered relational features can substantially improve the predictive power of a model. While the approach is straightforward enough, much still needs to be done to scale it up to explore more fully the space of possible features that can be constructed by an ILP system. This is in principle, infinite and in practice, extremely large. Applications have been confined to heuristic or random selections from this space. In this paper, we address this computational difficulty by allowing features and models to be constructed in a distributed manner. That is, there is a network of computational units, each of which employs an ILP engine to construct some small number of features and then builds a (local) model. We then employ an asynchronous consensus-based algorithm, in which neighboring nodes share information and update local models. This gossip-based information exchange results in the formation of non-stationary Markov chains. For a category of models (those with convex loss functions), it can be shown (using the Supermartingale Convergence Theorem) that the algorithm will result in all nodes converging to a consensus model. In practice, it may be slow to achieve this convergence. Nevertheless, our results on synthetic and real datasets suggest that in relatively short time the \u201cbest\u201d node in the network reaches a model whose predictive accuracy is comparable to that obtained using more computational effort in a non-distributed setting (the best node is identified as the one whose weights converge first).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10994-017-5672-2", "venue": "Machine Learning", "journal": "Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2767061289", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15115468", "12242182", "6048105", "15258841", "3360925", "1419882", "60492634", "37787563", "115963355", "2120244", "59633603", "16159169", "17314819", "1680222", "10770385", "1539404", "14778859", "16674358", "7728586", "47332111", "1617976", "60574874", "2458859", "5927433", "10758418", "8510933", "35592593", "1577926", "323588", "2608879", "22809189", "15011754", "29828273", "5689705", "682510", "16875156", "10978362", "2526853", "1881928", "6334230", "60567601", "3060826", "123001559", "60061729", "3811264", "12643399", "457364", "8012912", "16395458", "39666367", "6108215", "8070691", "15996292", "2506473", "8768960", "118467251", "15781700", "3231298", "1785", "1776455", "7747592", "10621079", "117910602", "11193911", "704994", "40420741", "34028114", "15680189", "18229590", "15544052", "60318812", "771841", "53862428", "17975552", "9070073", "31688000", "15973349", "7885987"], "inbound_citations": ["54448072"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4302025"}

Lastly, for symbolic domain music generation, the targeted output is sequences of discrete musical events, not continuous values. In this paper, we propose and study three generative adversarial networks (GANs) for symbolic-domain multi-track music generation, using a data set of 127,731 MIDI bars of pop/rock music.

We show that our models can learn from the noisy MIDI files and generate coherent music of four bars right from scratch (i.e. without human inputs).

This paper described the corn yield estimation in Iowa State using four machine learning approaches such as SVM (Support Vector Machine), RF (Random Forest), ERT (Extremely Randomized Trees) and DL (Deep Learning). Also, comparisons of the validation statistics among them were presented. To examine the seasonal sensitivities of the corn yields, three period groups were set up: (1) MJJAS (May to September), (2) JA (July and August) and (3) OC (optimal combination of month). In overall, the DL method showed the highest accuracies in terms of the correlation coefficient for the three period groups. The accuracies were relatively favorable in the OC group, which indicates the optimal combination of month can be significant in statistical modeling of crop yields. The differences between our predictions and USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) statistics were about 6-8 %, which shows the machine learning approaches can be a viable option for crop yield modeling.

Five answers to this question are discussed in the paper. (1) The classicist answer: symbolic (digital) computation is required for explaining cognition; (2) The broad digital computationalist answer: digital computation broadly construed is required for explaining cognition; (3) The connectionist answer: sub-symbolic computation is required for explaining cognition; (4) The computational neuroscientist answer: neural computation (that, strictly, is neither digital nor analogue) is required for explaining cognition; (5) The extreme dynamicist answer: computation is not required for explaining cognition. The first four answers are only accurate to a first approximation. But the \"devil\" is in the details. The last answer cashes in on the parenthetical \"if any\" in the question above. The classicist argues that cognition is symbolic computation. But digital computationalism need not be equated with classicism. Indeed, computationalism can, in principle, range from digital (and analogue) computationalism through (the weaker thesis of) generic computationalism to (the even weaker thesis of) digital (or analogue) pancomputationalism. Connectionism, which has traditionally been criticised by classicists for being non-computational, can be plausibly construed as being either analogue or digital computationalism (depending on the type of connectionist networks used). Computational neuroscience invokes the notion of neural computation that may (possibly) be interpreted as a sui generis type of computation.

The core idea is to learn a unified metric matrix for the error of LSR, such that such a metric matrix can yield small distances for the same category, while large ones for the different categories. As opposed to the -dragging in DLSR, we call this the error-dragging (e-dragging). Different from DLSR and its related variants, our MLG-LSC implicitly carries out the e-dragging and can naturally reflect the roughly relative distance relationships among the categories from a metric learning perspective.

Therefore, undertaking risk studies of urban floods, especially the depth prediction of urban flood is very important for urban flood control. In this study, an urban flood data warehouse was established with available structured and unstructured urban flood data. In this study, an urban flood data warehouse was established with available structured and unstructured urban flood data. Based on this, a regression model to predict the depth of urban flooded areas was constructed with deep learning algorithm, named Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT). The flood condition factors used in modeling were rainfall, rainfall duration, peak rainfall, evaporation, land use (the proportion of roads, woodlands, grasslands, water bodies and building), permeability, catchment area, and slope. Based on the rainfall data of different rainfall return periods, flood condition maps were produced using GIS. In addition, the feature importance of these conditioning factors was determined based on the regression model. The results demonstrated that the growth rate of the number and depth of the water accumulation points increased significantly after the rainfall return period of \u2018once in every two years\u2019 in Zhengzhou City, and the flooded areas mainly occurred in the old urban areas and parts of southern Zhengzhou. The relative error of prediction results was 11.52%, which verifies the applicability and validity of the method in the depth prediction of urban floods.

Detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the proposed framework on the KITTI [1] and Cityscapes [2] datasets show that the proposed method outperforms both existing traditional and unsupervised deep VO methods providing better results for both pose estimation and depth recovery.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1809.05786", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICRA.2019.8793512", "venue": "2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2963267039,2953037638,2890860133", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["12986049", "502946", "14547347", "206775640", "9114952", "17112447", "10416499", "5936929", "206858678", "3515219", "3682948", "1033682", "206853077", "11977588", "14517241", "1336659", "206986664", "2499865", "20111669", "6267598", "3731258", "3400843", "6971184", "7378610", "3678662", "1053307", "206596513", "8758543", "62566129", "6002134", "11758569", "6287870", "6724907", "206775100", "3714620", "2255738", "15774646", "299085"], "inbound_citations": ["209495783", "212702572", "195316982", "211678206", "208248060", "173991215", "207925994", "199465757", "211252383", "210860983", "208175516", "199405345", "215548254", "199543416", "119317830", "208176445", "202577991", "212725052", "197430741", "67855656", "204798359"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52282758"}

In previous view invariant pose estimation methods based on manifold learning, there were two ways. One is modeling manifolds for all view points. The other is to extract view factors from mapping functions. But these methods do not support one by one mapping for silhouettes and corresponding body configurations because of unsupervised learning. Modeling manifold and extracting view factors are very complex. So we propose a method based on triple manifolds. These are view manifold, pose manifold, and body configuration manifold. In order to build manifolds, we employ biased manifold learning.

In this study, we used MODIS time series data to investigate the effect of the time series length on crop mapping. Eight time series with different lengths (ranging from one month to eight months) were tested. For each time series, we first used the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to calculate the importance score for all features (including multi-spectral data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and phenological metrics). Subsequently, an extension of the Jeffries\u2013Matusita (JM) distance was used to measure class separability for each time series. Finally, the RF algorithm was used to classify crop types, and the classification accuracy and certainty were used to analyze the influence of the time series length and the number of features on classification performance; the features were added one by one based on their importance scores. Results indicated that when the time series was longer than five months, the top ten features remained stable. These features were mainly in July and August. In addition, the NDVI features contributed the majority of the most significant features for crop mapping. The NDWI and data from multi-spectral bands also contributed to improving crop mapping. On the other hand, separability, classification accuracy, and certainty increased with the number of features used and the time series length, although these values quickly reached saturation. Five months was the optimal time series length, as longer time series provided no further improvement in the classification performance.

Prediction of the likely outcome and selection of patients for an enhanced management algorithm would reduce the possible harm from failed intubation attempts. Methods Adult elective patients were assessed for seven features associated with difficult direct laryngoscopy, ranked in difficulty from 0 to 3. For a patient with at least one Class 3 feature, or two or more features of class 1 or higher, the enhanced management used a channelled videolaryngoscope Airtraq\u2122 instead of a Macintosh laryngoscope. A long flexible angulated stylet and a flexible fibrescope would be used as the second and third steps. For patients with lesser difficulty scores, a Macintosh laryngoscope was used. Outcomes of enhanced management were analysed. Logistic regression and Random Forest algorithm, using the ranks of the predictive features, were used to predict difficulty during enhanced management. Results We prospectively studied 16 695 patients. We selected 1501 (9%) for enhanced management, and tracheal intubation was successful in all of them. Of these, 73% were intubated in less than 30 s, and only 4.5% required more than 4 min for intubation. Progression to the second and third steps of enhanced management was predicted by restriction of mouth opening and reduced cervical spine mobility. Conclusions An enhanced management algorithm allowed successful tracheal intubation of all patients with anticipated difficult laryngoscopy.

Because the short-term natural gas load has obvious nonlinearity and randomness, the traditional regression model is difficult to predict accurately. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid prediction model that integrates an improved whale swarm algorithm (IWOA) and relevance vector machine (RVM). In addition, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), approximate entropy (ApEn), and C-C method are introduced to aid the calculation. In this paper, the IWOA is used to test the four functions and compared with the other five algorithms. The results show that the convergence accuracy and convergence speed of the new algorithm are higher than other algorithms, indicating that it has better global optimization ability. Second, the IWOA-RVM model is used to predict the supply data of two natural gas stations in Anhui Province, China. The prediction results are compared with the five algorithms including RBFNN, GRNN, ELMANNN, LSSVM, and SMOSVM. The results show that: 1) through the test of four functions, IWOA has better ability to jump out of local optimum, has higher optimization performance, and the calculation speed is at a medium level and 2) compared with other models, the IOWA-RVM model has higher prediction accuracy when the amount of data is larger or smaller, but the calculation time is relatively long, but the calculation time is acceptable in engineering.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2918156", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2945388506", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["106410481", "116827463", "108563749", "109788444", "154723282", "151901452", "154159609", "206747299", "153995290", "13389053", "40226585", "12993509", "109156205", "199014310", "109017442", "114059865", "15835446", "153916675", "109647344", "110516377", "109959760", "150320354", "15596296", "114151352", "205296445", "29300932", "44611337", "46923052", "1262186", "121713604"], "inbound_citations": ["210931646", "214692651", "211539595", "211686736", "211539938", "215722300", "210995561", "212692585", "209473681", "211004413", "201133090", "202729962", "212712768", "204229665", "211554629", "210696250", "213183719"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198146421"}

The general scenario is as follows. Letcbe any concept; then every infinite sequence of elements exhaustingcis calledpositive presentationofc. An algorithmic learner successively takes as input one element of a positive presentation as well as its previously made hypothesis at a time and outputs a new hypothesis about the target concept. The sequence of hypotheses has to converge to a hypothesis correctly describing the concept to be learned. This basic scenario is referred to asiterative learning. Iterative inference can be refined by allowing the learner to store ana prioribounded number of carefully chosen examples resulting inbounded example memory inference. Additionally,feed-backidentification is introduced. Now, the learner is enabled to ask whether or not a particular element did already appear in the data provided so far. Our results are threefold: First, the learning capabilities of the various models of incremental learning are related to previously studied learning models. It is proved that incremental learning can be always simulated by inference devices that are both set-driven and conservative. Second, feed-back learning is shown to be more powerful than iterative inference, and its learning power is incomparable to that of bounded example memory inference which itself extends that of iterative learning, too. In particular, the learning power of bounded example memory inference always increases if the number of examples the learner is allowed to store is incremented. Third, a sufficient condition for iterative inference allowingnon-enumerativelearning is provided. The results obtained provide strong evidence that there is no unique way to design superior incremental learning algorithms.

{"paper_id": "62265299", "title": "Learning Kernels for Multiple Predictive Tasks", "authors": [{"first": "Pratik", "middle": [], "last": "Jawanpuria", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "In this thesis, we consider the paradigm of training several related learning problems (tasks) jointly. The goal is to synergize the related tasks by appropriate sharing of feature information within them and obtain a better generalization across all the tasks (as compared to learning them independently). A key concern while training multiple related tasks jointly is to learn which feature information should be shared among which tasks. Either sharing unhelpful feature information among related tasks or sharing any information with unrelated tasks may result in worsening of performance. The focus of this thesis revolves around this issue. Overall, we present a family of regularized risk minimization based convex formulations, of increasing generality, for learning features (kernels) in various settings involving multiple tasks. We begin with the question of which features to share among all the tasks. This popular setting assumes that all the tasks are related and the aim here is to learn a common feature representation shared by all the tasks. We pose this problem as that of learning a shared kernel. The kernel based framework allows us to implicitly learn task correlations in generic inner product feature spaces. The shared kernel is modeled as a linear combination of a given set of base kernels, the Multiple Kernel Learning setting. We propose a mixed-norm based formulation for learning the shared kernel as well as the prediction functions of all the tasks. We build on this approach and proceed to learn the shared kernel in a couple of richer feature spaces. Firstly, we consider a case where the tasks share low-dimensional subspaces lying in the induced feature spaces of the base kernels. We pose this problem as a mixed Schatten-norm regularized formulation that learns an optimal linear combination of such subspaces. Secondly, we consider learning the shared kernel as a polynomial combination of base kernels. In this setup, the space of possible combinations is exponential in the number of base kernels and we propose a graph based regularizer to perform a clever search in this huge space. i We next study the setting where all the tasks need not share a common feature representation. We develop a formulation that learns groups of related tasks in a given feature space. Each group of tasks is represented by a kernel and the problem of learning groups of related tasks is posed as a kernel learning problem. We generalize this setup and propose a formulation that learns which feature spaces are shared among which groups of tasks. We show that the overall performance improves considerably by learning this information. We end this thesis by discussing our exploration on the problem of computing the kernel selection path in the Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) framework. Kernel selection path is the variation in the classification accuracy as the fraction of selected kernels is varied from null to unity. We study a generic family of MKL formulations and propose a methodology for computing their kernel selection path efficiently. In addition to the models developed for learning kernels for multiple tasks, derivations of specialized dual formulations as well as the algorithms proposed for solving them efficiently are also an important contribution of this thesis. In particular, solving mixed Schatten-norm regularized problems as well as searching for optimal polynomial kernel combination in exponentially large search space call for novel optimization methodologies. We show utility of the proposed formulations in a few learning applications such as Rule Ensemble Learning where the goal is to construct an ensemble of conjunctive propositional rules.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2186862102", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62265299"}

These tools will assist us to predict space weather caused by violent solar activity. Image processing and pattern recognition techniques are applied to this system. ::: For automatic flare detection, the advanced pattern recognition techniques such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used. By tracking the entire process of flares, the motion properties of two-ribbon flares are derived automatically. In the applications of the solar filament detection, the Stabilized Inverse Diffusion Equation (SIDE) is used to enhance and sharpen filaments; a new method for automatic threshold selection is proposed to extract filaments from background; an SVM classifier with nine input features is used to differentiate between sunspots and filaments. Once a filament is identified, morphological thinning, pruning, and adaptive edge linking methods are applied to determine filament properties. Furthermore, a filament matching method is proposed to detect filament disappearance. The automatic detection and characterization of flares and filaments have been successfully applied on H\u03b1 full-disk images that are continuously obtained at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). For automatically detecting and classifying CMEs, the image enhancement, segmentation, and pattern recognition techniques are applied to Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) C2 and C3 images. ::: The processed LASCO and BBSO images are saved to file archive, and the physical properties of detected solar features such as intensity and speed are recorded in our database. Researchers are able to access the solar feature database and analyze the solar data efficiently and effectively. The detection and characterization system greatly improves the ability to monitor the evolution of solar events and has potential to be used to predict the space weather.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1958179767", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:120558903"}

The poor predictive performance suggests that for some datasets, convex approximations may not be a sufficiently accurate approximation to the problem.

At each iteration, the regularization parameters are adapted to better reflect label confidence, class proportion, and to gradually include more unlabeled points.

Often only the integration of these data allows uncovering biological insights that can be experimentally validated or mechanistically modelled, i.e. sophisticated computational approaches are required to extract the complex non-linear trends present in omics data. Classification techniques allow training a model based on variables (e.g. SNPs in genetic association studies) to separate different classes (e.g. healthy subjects versus patients). Random Forest (RF) is a versatile classification algorithm suited for the analysis of these large data sets. In the Life Sciences, RF is popular because RF classification models have a high-prediction accuracy and provide information on importance of variables for classification. For omics data, variables or conditional relations between variables are typically important for a subset of samples of the same class. For example: within a class of cancer patients certain SNP combinations may be important for a subset of patients that have a specific subtype of cancer, but not important for a different subset of patients. These conditional relationships can in principle be uncovered from the data with RF as these are implicitly taken into account by the algorithm during the creation of the classification model.

In this paper we explore an unsupervised feature learning approach to model geospatial neighborhoods for classification purposes. While pixel and object based classification approaches are widely used for satellite image analysis, often these approaches exploit the high-fidelity image data in a limited way. In this paper we extract low-level features to characterize the local neighborhood patterns. We exploit the unlabeled feature measurements in a novel way to learn a set of basis functions to derive new features. The derived sparse feature representation obtained by encoding the measured features in terms of the learned basis function set yields superior classification performance. We applied our technique on two challenging image datasets: ORNL dataset representing one-meter spatial resolution satellite imagery representing five land-use categories and, UCMERCED dataset consisting of 21 different categories representing sub-meter resolution overhead imagery. Our results are highly promising and, in the case of UCMERCED dataset we outperform the best results obtained for this dataset.

We analyze these relationships through the statistical modelling of predictor variables from patients\u2019 preoperative data and intraoperative physiological time series data, as well as the intraoperative time series of procedures performed by anesthesiologists and surgeons. In order to include this procedural data we create novel predictors to represent each patient\u2019s time series in models. Three different statistical models are described: Random Forest (RF), Generalized Linear Models (GLM), and L1 Regularized Logistic Regression (L1). We evaluate the model results using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and their corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values. The GLM model performs the best for death with an AUC value of .887, and the RF model performs best for cardiac injury, renal injury and respiratory failure, with AUC values of .857, .873 and .831, respectively. For all adverse outcomes, the L1 models minimized false negatives at a threshold of .01. This paper describes the results of these models and identifies the strongest predictors of each post-surgical adverse outcome.

The system uses a hierarchical algorithm, consisting of two layers of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to first recognize the type of exercise being performed, followed by recognition of exercise intensity. The first layer uses a single SVM to recognize the type of the performed exercise. Based on the recognized type a corresponding intensity prediction SVM is selected on the second layer, specializing in intensity prediction for the recognized type of exercise. We evaluate the system for a set of upper-body exercises using different weight loads. Additionally, we compare the most important features for exercise and intensity recognition tasks and investigate how different sliding window combinations, sensor configurations and number of training subjects impact the algorithm performance. We perform all of the experiments for two different types of features to evaluate the feasibility of implementation on resource constrained hardware.

Estimation of woody vegetation is important to rangeland scientists and land managers for assessing its impact on grass production and calculating its grazing and browsing capacity. Assessment of grazing and browsing components is often challenging because agro-ecological landscapes of this region are largely characterized by small scale and heterogeneous land-use-land-cover patterns. In this study, we investigated the utility of high spatial resolution remotely sensing data for modelling grazing and browsing capacity at landscape level. Woody tree density or Tree Equivalents (TE) and Total Leaf Mass (LMASS) data were derived using the Biomass Estimation for Canopy Volume (BECVOL) program. The Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm was assessed to establish relationships between these variables and vegetation indices (Simple Ratio and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), calculated using the red and near infrared bands of SPOT5. The RF analysis predicted LMASS with R 2 = 0.63 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1256 kg/ha compared to a mean of 2291kg/ha. TE was predicted with R 2 = 0.55 and a RMSE = 1614 TE/ha compared to a mean of 3746 TE/ha. Next, spatial distribution maps of LMASS/ha and TE/ha were derived using separate RF regression models. The resultant maps were then used as input data into conventional grazing and browsing capacity models to calculate grazing and browsing capacity maps for the study area.

The paper formalizes our developments in the area of DSP with SVM principles. The use of SVMs for DSP is already mature, and has gained popularity in recent years due to its advantages over other methods: SVMs are flexible non-linear methods that are intrinsically regularized and work well in low-sample-sized and high-dimensional problems. SVMs can be designed to take into account different noise sources in the formulation and to fuse heterogeneous information sources. Nevertheless, the use of SVMs in estimation problems has been traditionally limited to its mere use as a black-box model. Noting such limitations in the literature, we take advantage of several properties of [email protected]?s kernels and functional analysis to develop a family of SVM methods for estimation in DSP. Three types of signal model equations are analyzed. First, when a specific time-signal structure is assumed to model the underlying system that generated the data, the linear signal model (so-called Primal Signal Model formulation) is first stated and analyzed. Then, non-linear versions of the signal structure can be readily developed by following two different approaches. On the one hand, the signal model equation is written in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) using the well-known RKHS Signal Model formulation, and [email protected]?s kernels are readily used in SVM non-linear algorithms. On the other hand, in the alternative and not so common Dual Signal Model formulation, a signal expansion is made by using an auxiliary signal model equation given by a non-linear regression of each time instant in the observed time series. These building blocks can be used to generate different novel SVM-based methods for problems of signal estimation, and we deal with several of the most important ones in DSP. We illustrate the usefulness of this methodology by defining SVM algorithms for linear and non-linear system identification, spectral analysis, non-uniform interpolation, sparse deconvolution, and array processing. The performance of the developed SVM methods is compared to standard approaches in all these settings. The experimental results illustrate the generality, simplicity, and capabilities of the proposed SVM framework for DSP.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": "1311.5406", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.dsp.2013.11.009", "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2950118967,2021389328", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "15480929", "35730151", "12960671", "12851204", "7329667", "121390751", "6780654", "110602281", "2063066", "110717394", "10149763", "28121669", "27161171", "46089133", "7036341", "198120196", "7691428", "6449945", "6321931", "20837379", "125898884", "123539959", "2207754", "38233539", "14923918", "46724827", "13095502", "40115989", "18985587", "37731149", "9667783", "13063575", "164060", "125428967", "2874", "28322340", "59740146", "109017626", "2671466", "56542330", "63180999", "110047714", "42804456", "16555552", "30443041", "61100223", "1089429", "65112390", "267313", "14031708", "118328035", "5700955", "16566689", "208022464", "6674407", "32867798", "195652429", "7138354", "15480929", "35730151", "12960671", "12851204", "7329667", "121390751", "6780654", "110602281", "2063066", "110717394", "10149763", "28121669", "27161171", "46089133", "7036341", "198120196", "7691428", "6449945", "6321931", "20837379", "125898884", "123539959", "2207754", "38233539", "14923918", "46724827", "13095502", "40115989", "18985587", "37731149", "9667783", "13063575", "164060", "125428967", "2874", "28322340", "59740146", "109017626", "2671466", "56542330", "63180999", "110047714", "42804456", "16555552", "30443041", "61100223", "1089429", "65112390", "267313", "14031708", "118328035", "5700955", "16566689", "122664770", "6674407", "32867798", "1430472"], "inbound_citations": ["199605901", "49339674"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21799628"}

The proposed CBIR technique is implemented on a database having 1000 images spread across 11 categories and COIL image database having 1080 images spread across 15 categories. For each proposed CBIR technique 55 queries (5 per category) are fired on the database and net average precision and recall are computed. The results have shown performance improvement with higher precision and recall values, achieving crossover point as high as 89% with SVM technique as compared to image retrieval using Gabor Magnitude without SVM technique where the maximum crossover point is approximately 79%.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6320228", "venue": "2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems", "journal": "2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1978994912", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18475614", "9490140", "14528634", "5210739", "16395728", "125210067", "16587012", "58755950", "59916167", "16139728", "6349236", "110716", "14252817", "21031687", "5210739", "16002105", "18532193", "28637672", "194951", "59639035", "4362821", "12946615", "14727192", "2414121", "41867127"], "inbound_citations": ["13964707", "15611488", "202739799", "155097803", "9183573", "23192737", "198184299", "29062431"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12758998"}

In response, a theoretical argument is proposed to circumvent the shortcomings of previous approaches to this task, which involves abandoning the flawed status-quo of training machine learning algorithms and predictive models on outdated corpora, and instead walks the reader from conception through implementation of a rule-based algorithm with roots in both practical and theoretical Linguistics. ::: While the resulting algorithm is simply a prototype which cannot be currently verified in achieving a tagging-accuracy rate of over 98%, its multi-tiered methodology, meant to mirror aspects of human cognition in Natural Language Understanding, is meant to serve as a theoretical blueprint for a new and inevitably more-reliable way to deal with the challenges in Part-of-Speech Tagging, and provide much-needed advances in the popular area of Natural Language Processing.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2613172863", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64588194"}

Common approaches to such problems are early fusion of the initial modalities and crossmodal translation from one modality to the other. Recently, deep neural networks, especially deep autoencoders, have proven promising both for crossmodal translation and for early fusion via multimodal embedding. A particular architecture, bidirectional symmetrical deep neural networks, have been proven to yield improved multimodal embeddings over classical autoencoders, while also being able to perform crossmodal translation. In this work, we focus firstly at evaluating good single-modal continuous representations both for textual and for visual information. Word2Vec and paragraph vectors are evaluated for representing collections of words, such as parts of automatic transcripts and multiple visual concepts, while different deep convolutional neural networks are evaluated for directly embedding visual information, avoiding the creation of visual concepts. Secondly, we evaluate methods for multimodal fusion and crossmodal translation, with different single-modal pairs, in the task of video hyperlinking. Bidirectional (symmetrical) deep neural networks were shown to successfully tackle downsides of multimodal autoencoders and yield a superior multimodal representation. In this work, we extensively tests them in different settings, with different single-modal representations, within the context of video-hyperlinking. Our novel bidirectional symmetrical deep neural networks are compared to classical autoencoders and are shown to yield significantly improved multimodal embeddings that significantly (alpha=0.0001) outperform multimodal embeddings obtained by deep autoencoders with an absolute improvement in precision at 10 of 14.1% when embedding visual concepts and automatic transcripts and an absolute improvement of 4.3% when embedding automatic transcripts with features obtained with very deep convolutional neural networks, yielding 80% of precision at 10.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2983563.2983567", "venue": "iV&L-MM '16", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2530144925", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8808727", "10895747", "207216960", "5575601", "7863493", "1658773", "16295051", "207763512", "207763512", "2407601", "36672093", "16447573", "352650", "2983005", "2930547", "6383532", "14124313", "686835", "5000054", "7587705", "13567946"], "inbound_citations": ["46489715", "197645801", "4745001", "51924597", "196215445", "197660362", "52053312", "204837684", "3474564", "52897104", "52966951", "2680004", "23511995"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18779686"}

Based on moss specimens collected in 2010 throughout Europe, the statistical relation between a set of potential predictors (such as the atmospheric deposition calculated by use of two chemical transport models (CTM), distance from emission sources, density of different land uses, population density, elevation, precipitation, clay content of soils) and concentrations of HMs and nitrogen (N) in moss (response variables) were evaluated by the use of Random Forests (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Four spatial scales were regarded: Europe as a whole, ecological land classes covering Europe, single countries participating in the European Moss Survey (EMS), and moss species at sampling sites. Spatial patterns were estimated by applying a series of RF models on data on potential predictors covering Europe. Statistical values and resulting maps were used to investigate to what extent the models are specific for countries, units of the Ecological Land Classification of Europe (ELCE), and moss species. Results Land use, atmospheric deposition and distance to technical emission sources mainly influence the element concentration in moss. The explanatory power of calculated RF models varies according to elements measured in moss specimens, country, ecological land class, and moss species.

At the same time, gene selection is very difficult because of the noisy nature of microarray data. As a consequence, gene selection is often performed with machine learning methods. The Random Forest method is particularly well suited for this purpose. In this work, four state-of-the-art Random Forest-based feature selection methods were compared in a gene selection context. The analysis focused on the stability of selection because, although it is necessary for determining the significance of results, it is often ignored in similar studies.ResultsThe comparison of post-selection accuracy of a validation of Random Forest classifiers revealed that all investigated methods were equivalent in this context. However, the methods substantially differed with respect to the number of selected genes and the stability of selection. Of the analysed methods, the Boruta algorithm predicted the most genes as potentially important.ConclusionsThe post-selection classifier error rate, which is a frequently used measure, was found to be a potentially deceptive measure of gene selection quality. When the number of consistently selected genes was considered, the Boruta algorithm was clearly the best. Although it was also the most computationally intensive method, the Boruta algorithm\u2019s computational demands could be reduced to levels comparable to those of other algorithms by replacing the Random Forest importance with a comparable measure from Random Ferns (a similar but simplified classifier).

These properties make it challenging to scale ICA to high dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a robust soft reconstruction cost for ICA that allows us to learn highly overcomplete sparse features even on unwhitened data. Our formulation reveals formal connections between ICA and sparse autoencoders, which have previously been observed only empirically. Our algorithm can be used in conjunction with off-the-shelf fast unconstrained optimizers. We show that the soft reconstruction cost can also be used to prevent replicated features in tiled convolutional neural networks. Using our method to learn highly overcomplete sparse features and tiled convolutional neural networks, we obtain competitive performances on a wide variety of object recognition tasks.

During sleep, people with this condition stop breathing because the signals in the brain that tell the body to breathe don't work properly. There is no effort is made to inhale and chest movements almost come to a standstill. Central Sleep apnea is associated with a number of different neurologic problems, as well as heart or kidney failure. Existing medical sleep measurement systems are costly, disturb sleep quality, and are only suited for short-term measurement. As sleeping problems are affecting about 30% of the population[2], new approaches for everyday sleep measurement are needed. This paper presents a simple, low cost measurement technique that involves use of a Force Sensing Resistor placed over the patient's chest to record chest movements and hence record the breathing signal. Analysis of the obtained Breathing signals using signal processing and machine learning algorithms possesses high potential for the noninvasive detection of central sleep apnea, which may reduce the need for uncomfortable sleep studies. The proposed method involves using Wavelet Transform based feature extraction, followed by classification using Least Square Support Vector Machine. A 95% true detection rate was obtained using the proposed method. Finally, a real time breathing monitoring and Central Sleep Apnea diagnosis system is built using the proposed method.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IIC.2015.7150767", "venue": "2015 International Conference on Industrial Instrumentation and Control (ICIC)", "journal": "2015 International Conference on Industrial Instrumentation and Control (ICIC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1608928484", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["32586231", "4504723", "12990523", "30028494", "12055883"], "inbound_citations": ["57290140", "57290140", "166222286"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:29464899"}

Frame label acquisition is an essential step in solving this problem. High quality frame labels should be in good consistency with golden transcriptions and robust to speaker variation. We propose to improve frame label acquisition in our previously adopted deep neural network-bottleneck feature (DNN-BNF) architecture by applying the factorized hierarchical variational autoencoder (FHVAE). FHVAEs learn to disentangle linguistic content and speaker identity information encoded in speech. By discarding or unifying speaker information, speaker-invariant features are learned and fed as inputs to DPGMM frame clustering and DNN-BNF training. Experiments conducted on ZeroSpeech 2017 show that our proposed approaches achieve $2.4\\%$ and $0.6\\%$ absolute ABX error rate reductions in across- and within-speaker conditions, comparing to the baseline DNN-BNF system without applying FHVAEs.

Built atop the Cyc Knowledge Base and implemented almost entirely in the formal representation language of CycL, TextLearner is an anomaly in the way of Natural Language Understanding programs. The system operates by generating an information-rich model of its target document, and uses that model to explore learning opportunities. TextLearner uses this model to generate and evaluate hypotheses, not only about the possible contents of the target document, but about how to interpret unfamiliar natural language constructions it encounters.

If insurers lower their premiums without having a model that accurately quantifies the expected claim size, they can be in serious trouble. This research aims to accurately model the premiums and quantify the uncertainty involved using historic claims data from an insurer. The current approach, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), is compared to some Machine Learning techniques: Random Forests (RFs) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs). Insights gained from these models and other methods (MARS) are then used to improve the GLMs. Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) and Hierarchical Models (HMs) are then used to quantify the uncertainty. HMs provides the insurer with the means to make proper credible intervals for the total expected claim size of the active portfolio. The HMs also allow the use of risk premium principles that include measures of uncertainty in the pricing of premiums. All relevant models are applied on the dataset of the holdout year. It is apparent that the GLMs and HMs provide too low estimations of the premiums when the profit is tracked. It is therefore prudent to either use the HM with a risk premium principle that incorporates a percentage of the standard deviation in the estimation of the premiums or apply the RF model. The model lift shows that the Machine Learning techniques are better at recognising the risky policies from the non-risky. We recommend the insurer to use RFs to price the premiums and HMs to measure the uncertainty of the active portfolio.

Recently, deep learning models are introduced to learn hierarchical representations from raw data instead of using hand-crafted features, which exhibit excellent performance. The success of current deep learning lies in: 1) the training (source domain) and testing (target domain) datasets are from the same feature distribution; 2) Enough labeled data with fault information exist. However, because the machine operates under a non-stationary working condition, the trained model built on the source domain can not be directly applied on the target domain. Moreover, since no sufficient labeled or even unlabeled data are available in target domain, collecting the labeled data and building the model from scratch is time-consuming and expensive. Motivated by transfer learning (TL), we present a new fault diagnosis method, which generalizes convolutional neural network (CNN) to TL scenario. Two layers with regard to task-specific features are adapted in a layer-wise way to regularize the parameters of CNN. What\u2019s more, the domain loss is calculated by a linear combination of multiple Gaussian kernels so that the ability of adaptation is enhanced compared to single kernel. Through these two means, the distribution discrepancy is reduced and the transferable features are learned. The proposed method is validated by transfer fault diagnosis experiments.

This framework iterates and mutually propagates context to improve the classification results. Potentially wrong decisions can be revised at later stages. The output is a labelled point cloud as well as segments roughly corresponding to object instances. Moreover, we present two new contextual features for the segment classification: the distance and the orientation of a segment with respect to the closest road .

However, compared to the lane marking detection methods, detection of non-lane markings, such as text marks painted on the road, has been less studied so far. While some of methods for detecting non-lane markings exist, many of them are restricted to roadways only, or work poorly on AVM images. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which can robustly detect non-lane road markings on AVM images.

The Seismic Alert System of Mexico (SASMEX) has used this algorithm since 1991. The algorithm estimates the rate of seismic energy released during two times the ( t S \u2013 t P ) period. Based on the energy released, it estimates an empirical magnitude range related to m b . Depending on the estimated m b , either preventive or public alerts are issued. In this article, post facto tests are presented for 61 earthquakes for which SASMEX issued an alert. The algorithm was also tested on 31 earthquakes ( M w >6.0) that occurred in the Mexican subduction zone from 1985 to 2014. These earthquakes occurred outside the coverage of the SASMEX instruments at the time. This dataset includes the 19 September 1985 M w 8.1 Michoacan earthquake and the 9 October 1995 M w 8.0 Colima event. The algorithm was tested also on two great earthquakes: the 22 February 2010 M w 8.8 Maule, Chile, earthquake and the 11 March 2011 M w 9.0 Tohoku, Japan, event. The results of the evaluation of 144 acceleration records of the 61 earthquakes detected from the SASMEX network indicate that 92% of the accelerograms of earthquakes with m b >6.0 have errors in the prediction of magnitude of less than \u00b10.5, and 83% for m b >5.5. Also, the tests conducted on the 59 acceleration records of 31 earthquakes with M w \u22656.0 indicate that in all cases, with the exception of one strong\u2010motion record, the events are classified as M w \u22656.0. Thus, the algorithm shows a high level of reliability and robustness. Although the algorithm underestimates the magnitudes of large earthquakes, these events are identified and classified as M w \u22656.0. Thus, an alert would be issued for these great earthquakes.

One most common problem associating with contactless sensing like Kinect is the distance and indirect angle between the camera and the subject. For wearable sensor, it is limited in recognizing complex human activities. In this paper, a novel data fusion framework is proposed for combining data which are collected from both sensors with the aim of enhancing the HAR accuracy. Kinect is able to capture details of bodily movements from complex activities, but the accuracy is dependent heavily on the angle of view; wearable sensor is relatively primitive in gathering spatial data but reliable for detecting basic movements. Fusing the data from the two sensor types enables complimenting each other by their unique strengths. In particular, a new scheme using incremental learning with decision table coupled with swarm-based feature selection is proposed in our framework for achieving fast and accurate HAR by fusing data of two sensors. Our experiment results show that HAR accuracy could be improved from 23.51% to 68.35% in a case of almost 90 degrees slanted view of Kinect sensing while a wearing sensor is used at the same time. The swarm feature selection in general is shown to enhance the HAR performance compared to standard feature selection method. The experiment results reported here contribute to the possibilities of using hybridized sensors from the machine learning perspective.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.inffus.2020.02.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Information Fusion", "mag_id": "3006608982", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213802780"}

We focus on the synthesis technique and develop a conditional Generative Adversarial Network with Information Bottleneck extension (IB-cGAN) that takes MV-DRs and nonaligned KV-DRRs as input and outputs synthesized KV images. IB-cGAN is designed to address two main challenges in deep-learning-based synthesis: a) training with a roughly aligned dataset suffering from noisy correspondences; b) making synthesized images have real clinical meanings that faithfully reects MV-DRs rather than nonaligned KV-DRRs.

Towards this goal, fault detection in photovoltaic plants is essential to guarantee their reliability, safety, and to maximize operating profitability and avoid expensive maintenance. In this context, a model-based anomaly detection approach is proposed for monitoring the DC side of photovoltaic systems and temporary shading. First, a model based on the one-diode model is constructed to mimic the characteristics of the monitored photovoltaic array. Then, a one-class Support Vector Machine (1SVM) procedure is applied to residuals from the simulation model for fault detection. The choice of 1SVM approach to quantify the dissimilarity between normal and abnormal features is motivated by its good capability to handle nonlinear features and do not make assumptions on the underlying data distribution.

Most previous deep metric learning methods employ the hard negative mining strategy to alleviate the lack of informative samples for training. However, this mining strategy only utilizes a subset of training data, which may not be enough to characterize the global geometry of the embedding space comprehensively. To address this problem, we perform linear interpolation on embeddings to adaptively manipulate their hardness levels and generate corresponding label-preserving synthetics for recycled training, so that information buried in all samples can be fully exploited and the metric is always challenged with proper difficulty. As a single synthetic for each sample may still be not enough to describe the unobserved distributions of the training data which is crucial for generalization performance, we further extend HDML to generate multiple synthetics for each sample. We propose a randomly hardness-aware deep metric learning (HDML-R) method and an adaptively hardness-aware deep metric learning (HDML-A) method to sample multiple random and adaptive directions, respectively, for hardness-aware synthesis.

We develop a metric-learning-based template matching approach for this task and learn a distance metric between the captured images and the corresponding sign templates. For each sign, recognition is done via soft voting by the recognition results of its corresponding multiview images.

The results show that SVM is better than ANN in terms of recall, while the later one performed well along the dimensions of accuracy and specificity. Therefore, it is concluded that it is necessary to determine the evaluation parameters according to the criticality of the project, and then decide upon the classification model to be applied.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-10-4603-2_6", "venue": "Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing", "journal": "Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing", "mag_id": "2766373368", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202785943", "191539864", "96433310", "96433310"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64789169"}

Most of them build models only based on user item rating matrix. However, in real world, there is plenty of auxiliary information available in recommendation systems. We can utilize these information as additional features to improve recommendation performance. We refer to recommendation with auxiliary information as context-aware recommendation. Context-aware Factorization Machines (FM) is one of the most successful context-aware recommendation models. FM models pairwise interactions between all features, in such way, a certain feature latent vector is shared to compute the factorized parameters it involved. In practice, there are tens of context features and not all the pairwise feature interactions are useful. Thus, one important challenge for context-aware recommendation is how to effectively select \"good\" interaction features. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem and propose a greedy interaction feature selection algorithm based on gradient boosting.

This is achieved by incorporating registration uncertainty into an ensemble learning scheme. A probabilistic registration method is used to estimate a distribution of probable mappings between subject and atlas space. This allows the estimation of the distribution of spatially normalized feature data, e.g., grey matter probability maps. From this distribution, samples are drawn for use as training examples. This allows the creation of multiple predictors, which are subsequently combined using an ensemble learning approach. Furthermore, extra testing samples can be generated to measure the uncertainty of prediction. This is applied to separating subjects with Alzheimer's disease from normal controls using a linear support vector machine on a region of interest in magnetic resonance images of the brain. We show that our proposed method leads to an improvement in discrimination using voxel-based morphometry and deformation tensor-based morphometry over bootstrap aggregating, a common ensemble learning framework.

The accuracy of data classification depends on various aspects. Though the data classification technique has a major impact on classification accuracy, the nature of the data also matters lot. One of the main concerns that can hinder the classification accuracy is the availability of noise. Therefore, both choosing the appropriate data classification technique and the identification of noise in the data are equally important. The aim of this study is bidirectional. At first, we aim to study the influence of noise on the accurate data classification. Secondly, we strive to improve the classification accuracy by handling the noise. To this end, we compare several classification techniques and propose a novel noise removal algorithm. Our study is based on the collected data about online credit-card transactions. According to the empirical outcomes, we find that the noise hinders the classification accuracy significantly. In addition, the results indicate that the accuracy of data classification depends on the quality of the data and the used classification technique. Out of the selected classification techniques, Random Forest performs better than its counterparts. Furthermore, experimental evidence suggests that the classification accuracy of noised data can be improved by the appropriate selection of the sizes of training and testing data samples.

In order to verify the effectiveness of our proposed PEGAN, we first build one evaluation set, in which the characters are selected according to their stroke number and frequency of use, and then use both qualitative and quantitative metrics to measure the performance of our model comparing with the baseline method.

One use of the Hopfield net is as a highly parallel content addressable memory, where retrieval is possible although the input is corrupted by noise. For binary input patterns, an alternate approach is to compute Hamming distances between the input pattern and each of the stored patterns and retrieve that stored pattern with minimum Hamming distance. We first show that this is an optimum processor when the noise is statistically independent from bit to bit. We then present a Hamming Neural Net which is a highly parallel implementation of this algorithm that uses computational elements similar to those used in a Hopfield net. The Hopfield and Hamming nets are compared for several applications. For the cases considered, the Hamming net generally outperforms the Hopfield net. Also, the Hamming new requires fewer interconnects than the fully connected Hopfield net.

RE models typically assume that named entity recognition (NER) is already performed in a previous step by another independent model. Several recent efforts, under the theme of end-to-end RE, seek to exploit inter-task correlations by modeling both NER and RE tasks jointly. Earlier work in this area commonly reduces the task to a table-filling problem wherein an additional expensive decoding step involving beam search is applied to obtain globally consistent cell labels. In efforts that do not employ table-filling, global optimization in the form of CRFs with Viterbi decoding for the NER component is still necessary for competitive performance. We introduce a novel neural architecture utilizing the table structure, based on repeated applications of 2D convolutions for pooling local dependency and metric-based features, that improves on the state-of-the-art without the need for global optimization.

Some of them even with source codes. The most effective ones are based on Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO). They decompose the restricted quadratic problem into a series of smallest possible subproblems, which are then solved analytically. For large datasets, the majority of elapsed time is spent by a large amount of matrix-vector multiplications that cannot be computed efficiently on current GPUs because of limited memory bandwidth. In this paper, we introduce a novel GPU approach to the SVM training that we call Optimized Hierarchical Decomposition SVM (OHD-SVM). It uses a hierarchical decomposition iterative algorithm that fits better to actual GPU architecture. The low decomposition level uses a single GPU multiprocessor to efficiently solve a local subproblem. Nowadays a single GPU multiprocessor can run thousand or more threads that are able to synchronize quickly. It is an ideal platform for a single kernel SMO-based local solver with fast local iterations. The high decomposition level updates gradients of entire training set and selects a new local working set. The gradient update requires many kernel values that are costly to compute. However, solving a large local subproblem offers an efficient kernel values computation via a matrix-matrix multiplication that is much more efficient than the matrix-vector multiplication used in already published implementations. Along with a description of our implementation, the paper includes an exact comparison of five publicly available C++ SVM training GPU implementations. In this paper, the binary classification task and RBF kernel function are taken into account as it is usual in most of the recent papers. According to the measured results on a wide set of publicly available datasets, our proposed approach excelled significantly over the other methods in all datasets. The biggest difference was on the largest dataset where we achieved speed-up up to 12 times in comparison with the fastest already published GPU implementation.

The main object of this work is to develop the evolution of a previous heuristic approach, based on the use of Support Vector Machines, proposed in order to recognize and classify the defect starting from the measured ultrasonic echoes. In this context, a real-time approach could be exploited to solve real industrial problems with enough accuracy and realistic computational efforts. Particularly, we discuss the cross wavelet transform and wavelet coherence for examining relationships in time-frequency domains between. For our aim, a software package has been developed, allowing users to perform the cross wavelet transform, the wavelet coherence and the Fuzzy Inference System. Since the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, Fuzzy Inference has been used to regularize the system, implementing a data-independent classifier. Obtained results assure good performances of the implemented classifier, with very interesting applications.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CISIS.2010.234", "venue": "2010 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems", "journal": "2010 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2148822206", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13240062", "22084657", "108274589", "56704499", "24568612", "54923979", "15248106", "14928780", "18020930", "15757500", "62746718"], "inbound_citations": ["9580975", "211016733", "21359142", "123700420"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7019785"}

Initially, a median filter is applied to remove the inherent noise in the colored image. SIFT features of the image are then extracted and computed forming a vector, which is then quantized into visual words. Finally, the histogram of the frequency of each element in the visual vocabulary is created and fed into an SVM classifier, which categorizes the mushrooms as either healthy or unhealthy.

The system uses a 4 \u00d7 4 pixels' thermal sensor to detect any heat presence before an infrared camera is activated to capture video images. The images will be processed with a human detection algorithm based on frame differencing and orientation features. The detected human will then be verified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

In this dissertation we try to built a system that allowed to classify and generate melodies using the information from the tree encoding, capturing the inherent dependencies which are inside this kind of structure, and improving the current methods in terms of accuracy and running time. In this way, we try to find more efficient methods that is key to use the tree structure in large datasets. First, we study the possibilities of the tree edit similarity to classify melodies using a new approach for estimate the weights of the edit operations. Once the possibilities of the cited approach are studied, an alternative approach is used. For that a grammatical inference approach is used to infer tree languages.

Although some signs of aging are synthesized by these approaches, they heavily rely on the availability of paired samples which are difficult and costly to collect. Inspired by the significant success achieved by using GANs in unsupervised image transduction, in this paper, we formulate this task as an unsupervised multi-domain image-to-image translation problem, and devise a novel generative framework using only a single generative adversarial network, dubbed FaceGAN which is capable of synthesizing photo-realistic face images with aging effects without paired samples and achieves face age progression and regression in a holistic framework.

These methods rely on the assumptions that the number of clusters is known, and that there is one single partition over the data and all attributes define that partition. However, in real-world applications, prior knowledge of the number of clusters is usually unavailable and there are multiple ways to partition the data based on subsets of attributes. To resolve the issues, we propose latent tree variational autoencoder (LTVAE), which simultaneously performs representation learning and multidimensional clustering. LTVAE learns latent embeddings from data, discovers multi-facet clustering structures based on subsets of latent features, and automatically determines the number of clusters in each facet. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance and reals reasonable multifacet structures of the data.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1803.05206", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "mag_id": "2790815345", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203641795"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126058997"}

The implications in terms of lost revenue from costly industrial processes, operation of large-scale public works projects and the volume of the published literature on this topic clearly indicates the significance of the problem. Applications range from manufacturing industries (integrated circuits, automotive, etc.), to large-scale chemical plants, pharmaceutical production, power distribution grids, and avionics. In this project we investigated a new framework for building parsimonious models that are suited for diagnosis and fault estimation of complex technical systems. We used Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to model potentially time-varying parameters of a First-Principles (FP) description of the process. The combined SVM & FP model was built (i.e. model parameters were trained) using constrained optimization techniques. We used the trained models to estimate faults affecting simulated beam lifetime. In the case where a large number of process inputs are required for model-based fault estimation, the proposed framework performs an optimal nonlinear principal component analysis of the large-scale input space, and creates a lower dimension feature spacemore \u00bb in which fault estimation results can be effectively presented to the operation personnel. To fulfill the main technical objectives of the Phase I research, our Phase I efforts have focused on: (1) SVM Training in a Combined Model Structure - We developed the software for the constrained training of the SVMs in a combined model structure, and successfully modeled the parameters of a first-principles model for beam lifetime with support vectors. (2) Higher-order Fidelity of the Combined Model - We used constrained training to ensure that the output of the SVM (i.e. the parameters of the beam lifetime model) are physically meaningful. (3) Numerical Efficiency of the Training - We investigated the numerical efficiency of the SVM training. More specifically, for the primal formulation of the training, we have developed a problem formulation that avoids the linear increase in the number of the constraints as a function of the number of data points. (4) Flexibility of Software Architecture - The software framework for the training of the support vector machines was designed to enable experimentation with different solvers. We experimented with two commonly used nonlinear solvers for our simulations. The primary application of interest for this project has been the sustained optimal operation of particle accelerators at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). Particle storage rings are used for a variety of applications ranging from 'colliding beam' systems for high-energy physics research to highly collimated x-ray generators for synchrotron radiation science. Linear accelerators are also used for collider research such as International Linear Collider (ILC), as well as for free electron lasers, such as the Linear Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC. One common theme in the operation of storage rings and linear accelerators is the need to precisely control the particle beams over long periods of time with minimum beam loss and stable, yet challenging, beam parameters. We strongly believe that beyond applications in particle accelerators, the high fidelity and cost benefits of a combined model-based fault estimation/correction system will attract customers from a wide variety of commercial and scientific industries. Even though the acquisition of Pavilion Technologies, Inc. by Rockwell Automation Inc. in 2007 has altered the small business status of the Pavilion and it no longer qualifies for a Phase II funding, our findings in the course of the Phase I research have convinced us that further research will render a workable model-based fault estimation and correction for particle accelerators and industrial plants feasible.\u00ab less", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2172/992983", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "292923577", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["123169832", "62730865", "96037781", "119946677", "59452364", "14108586", "11984368", "28637672", "16096142", "13989648", "56587969", "14367633", "124347443", "682857", "55586411", "119516971", "8709419"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17985684"}

In this work, we propose hierarchical non-parametric variational autoencoders, which combines tree-structured Bayesian nonparametric priors with VAEs, to enable infinite flexibility of the latent representation space. Both the neural parameters and Bayesian priors are learned jointly using tailored variational inference. The resulting model induces a hierarchical structure of latent semantic concepts underlying the data corpus, and infers accurate representations of data instances.

Current approaches for BiogeoGraphic Ancestry (BGA) estimation using STRs profiles are usually based on Bayesian methods, which quantify the evidence in terms of likelihood ratio, supporting or not the hypothesis that a certain profile belongs to a specific ethnic group. The present study provides an alternative approach to the likelihood ratio method that involves multivariate data analysis strategies for the estimation of multiple populations. Starting from the well-known NIST US autosomal STRs dataset involving African-American, Asian, and Caucasian individuals, and moving towards further and more geographically restricted populations (such as Northern Africans vs sub-Saharan Africans, Afghans vs Iraqis and Italians vs Romanians), powerful multivariate techniques such as Sparse and Logistic Principal Component Analysis (SL-PCA), Sparse Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were employed and their discriminating power was also compared. Both sPLS-DA and SVM techniques provided robust classifications, yielding high sensitivity and specificity models capable of discriminating populations on ethnic basis.

To address this problem, we propose a joint prototype and metric learning approach. The prototypes are learned to represent each gallery image set using fewer samples without affecting the recognition performance. A Mahalanobis metric is learned simultaneously to measure the similarity between sets more accurately. In particular, each gallery set is represented as a regularized affine hull spanned by the learned prototypes. The set-to-set distance is optimized via updating the prototypes and the Mahalanobis metric in an alternating manner. To highlight the importance of representing image sets using fewer samples, we analyzed the corresponding test time complexity with respect to the number of images used per set. Experimental results using YouTube Celebrity, YouTube Faces, and ETH-80 datasets illustrate the efficiency on the task of video face recognition, and object categorization.

To address this problem, the IT2NFC-OL uses a simplified type reduction operation to reduce the hardware implementation cost without degrading the learning performance. The software-implemented IT2NFC-OL is characterized by online structure learning and parameter learning using a gradient descent algorithm. The learned fuzzy model is then implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip.

Since conventional methods rely on first-order statistics, the effort to eliminate noise using deep learning method is intensive. In the real environment, many types of noises are mixed with the target sound, resulting in difficulty to remove only noises. However, most of previous works modeled a small amount of non-stationary noise, which is hard to be applied in real world. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel deep learning model to enhance the auditory signal with adversarial learning of two types of discriminators. One discriminator learns to distinguish a clean signal from the enhanced one by the generator, and the other is trained to recognize the difference between eliminated noise signal and real noise signal. In other words, the second discriminator learns the waveform of noise. Besides, a novel learning method is proposed to stabilize the unstable adversarial learning process. Compared with the previous works, to verify the performance of the propose model, we use 100 kinds of noise. The experimental results show that the proposed model has better performance than other conventional methods including the state-of-the-art model in removing non-stationary noise. To evaluate the performance of our model, the scale-invariant source-to-noise ratio is used as an objective evaluation metric.

Firstly, the casual use of Chinese abbreviations and doctors\u2019 personal style may result in multiple expressions of the same entity, and we lack a common Chinese medical dictionary to perform accurate entity extraction. Secondly, the electronic medical record contains entities from a variety of categories of entities, and the length of those entities in different categories varies greatly, which increases the difficult in the extraction for the Chinese NER. Therefore, the entity boundary detection becomes the key to perform accurate entity extraction of Chinese EMRs, and we need to develop a model that supports multiple length entity recognition without relying on any medical dictionary. In this study, we incorporate part-of-speech (POS) information into the deep learning model to improve the accuracy of Chinese entity boundary detection. In order to avoid the wrongly POS tagging of long entities, we proposed a method called reduced POS tagging that reserves the tags of general words but not of the seemingly medical entities. The model proposed in this paper, named SM-LSTM-CRF, consists of three layers: self-matching attention layer \u2013 calculating the relevance of each character to the entire sentence; LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer \u2013 capturing the context feature of each character; CRF (Conditional Random Field) layer \u2013 labeling characters based on their features and transfer rules. The experimental results at a Chinese EMRs dataset show that the F1 value of SM-LSTM-CRF is increased by 2.59% compared to that of the LSTM-CRF. After adding POS feature in the model, we get an improvement of about 7.74% at F1. The reduced POS tagging reduces the false tagging on long entities, thus increases the F1 value by 2.42% and achieves an F1 score of 80.07%. The POS feature marked by the reduced POS tagging together with self-matching attention mechanism puts a stranglehold on entity boundaries and has a good performance in the recognition of clinical entities.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6454585", "pubmed_id": "30961622", "doi": "10.1186/s12911-019-0762-7", "venue": "BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "journal": "BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2940427621", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["53287867", "9261538", "3226443", "4008374", "15459403", "63869600", "17129586", "4735707", "12740621", "10489017", "3770767", "11212020", "12320170", "2135897", "46969079", "49890904", "20072248"], "inbound_citations": ["208646827", "214798581"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:104295255"}

Building a cloud resource demand prediction model is a challenging task because cloud consumer\u2019s demand changes over time. Most of the current works in cloud resource demand prediction study the problem from the cloud provider perspective. In this paper, we study the problem from the cloud consumer perspective with the aim to help the consumers to meet their resource needs, derive estimates for the required IT budget, select the best cloud providers, and get better pricing through the advanced reservation of required cloud resources. We develop a new Swarm Intelligence Based Prediction Approach (SIBPA) to predict with higher accuracy the resource needs of a cloud consumer in terms of CPU, memory, and disk storage utilization. The SIBPA is also able to predict the response time and throughput which in turn enables the cloud consumers to make a better scaling decision. It also takes into account the dynamic behavior of consumer requests in a long term period and the seasonal or/and trend patterns in time series. The SIBPA uses the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach for selecting the best features from the dataset and for estimating the parameters of the prediction algorithms. The experimental results reveal that the prediction accuracy of the SIBPA outperforms the current prediction models. In terms of CPU utilization prediction, the accuracy of SIBPA outperforms the accuracy of the existing cloud consumer prediction frameworks that use Linear Regression, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machines approaches by 56.95%, 80.42%, and 63.86% respectively according to RMSE, and by 72.66%, 44.24%, and 56.78% according to MAPE.

It aims to transfer the facial appearance of a reference into a target with good visual consistency. When there are considerable visual differences between a reference and a target, however, it may introduce visual artifacts into the results. To tackle this problem, we propose a facial appearance map with illumination-aware and region-aware properties that allows seamless FAT. We formulate the appearance-map generation as label propagation (LP) on a similarity graph, and propose a new regularization structure to facilitate the adaptive appearance-map diffusion. Solving the original LP model of appearance map in general requires on the order $O(kn^2)$ time for an $n$ -nodes graph where each node has $k$ neighbors. It may be computationally prohibitive for an image with a large spatial resolution. To tackle this problem, we mathematically analyze the graph-based LP model and propose a fast algorithm with smart subset sampling. It selects a subset with $m$ nodes of the graph with $n$ nodes ( $m\\ll n$ ) to approximate the solution to the original system, which significantly reduces its computational requirements from $O(kn^2)$ to $O(m^2n)$ . Based on the adaptive LP-based appearance map, we construct a framework to achieve various editing effects with FAT, including face replacement, face dubbing, face swapping, and transfiguring. Comparisons with related methods show the effectiveness of the adaptive LP model for FAT.

To handle the problem of embedding secret messages into the specific medium, we design a novel adversarial module to learn the steganographic algorithm, and simultaneously train three modules called generator, discriminator and steganalyzer. Different from existing methods, the three modules are formalized as a game to communicate with each other. In the game, the generator and discriminator attempt to communicate with each other using secret messages hidden in an image. While the steganalyzer attempts to analyze whether there is a transmission of confidential information. We show that through unsupervised adversarial training, the adversarial model can produce robust steganographic solutions, which acts like an encryption. Furthermore, we propose to utilize supervised adversarial training method to train a robust steganalyzer, which is utilized to discriminate whether an image contains secret information.

We tested two different methods for representing text documents, both in combination with the linear SVM classification algorithm. The first representation used is a standard bag-of-words approach with TFIDF weights and cosine distance used as similarity measure. We compared this to String kernels where text documents are compared not by words but by substrings. This removes the need for stemming or lemmatisation which can be an important issue when documents are in other languages than English and tools for stemming or lemmatisation are unavailable or are expensive to make or learn. In highly inflected natural languages, such as Slovene language, the same word can have many different forms, thus String kernels have an advantage here over the bag-of-words. In this paper we show that in classification of documents written in highly inflected natural language the situation is opposite and String Kernels significantly outperform the standard bag-of-words representation.

The traversal cost is defined by the proprioceptive signal of the robot traversal stability that is combined with appearance and geometric properties of the traversed terrains to construct the traversal cost model incrementally. In the motivational deployment, such a model is instantaneously utilized to extrapolate the traversal cost for observed areas that have not yet been visited by the robot to avoid difficult terrains in motion planning. The examined approaches are Incremental Gaussian Mixture Network, Growing Neural Gas, Improved Self-Organizing Incremental Neural Network, Locally Weighted Projection Regression, and Bayesian Committee Machine with Gaussian Process Regressors. The performance is examined using a dataset of the various terrains traversed by a real hexapod walking robot.

In the Reservoir characterization, one might be interested in modeling different reservoir properties like water saturation, permeability, and porosity. The direct estimation of these reservoir properties from the seismic data is a challenging and time-consuming task. Therefore, it is desirable to build a model that uses seismic attributes to measure the different lithological properties of need. In recent decades, various advancements have been done to estimate porosity from seismic attributes and well-logs effectively. However, the modeling of nonlinear porosity patterns is still underdeveloped for robust solutions as the existing methods implement linear or functional network based reduction techniques to estimate petrophysical properties. Therefore, in this study, we propose a nonlinear hybrid approach that integrates Generative Topographic Map with Machine Learning prediction models (ML) to estimate the property porosity. The approach initiates by extracting relevant attributes based on the two different feature selection strategies. Subsequently, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Random Forest regressors are used to build the training model for the target well property porosity using extracted attributes. The different combinations of wells are formed to show the variations in model training and testing error. To demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed PP-NFR approach, the prediction results of the proposed hybrid approach are compared with the linear prediction technique. Furthermore, the performance of PP-NFR approach is also evaluated by comparing the prediction results with the state-of-the-art prediction models (ANN and SVM).

In this paper we propose a family of Possibilistic Rule-based Classifiers (PRCs) to deal with such problems which are an extension and a modification of the Frank and Witten\u2019 PART algorithm. The PRCs keep the same rule learning step as PART, but differ in other respects. In particular, the PRCs learn fuzzy rules instead of crisp rules, consider weighted rules at deduction time in an unordered manner instead of rule lists. They also reduce the number of examples not covered by any rule, using a fuzzy rule set with large supports.

Furthermore, we show that generated medical images can be used for synthetic data augmentation, and improve the performance of CNN for medical image classification. Our novel method is demonstrated on a limited dataset of computed tomography (CT) images of 182 liver lesions (53 cysts, 64 metastases and 65 hemangiomas). We first exploit GAN architectures for synthesizing high quality liver lesion ROIs. Then we present a novel scheme for liver lesion classification using CNN. Finally, we train the CNN using classic data augmentation and our synthetic data augmentation and compare performance. In addition, we explore the quality of our synthesized examples using visualization and expert assessment. The classification performance using only classic data augmentation yielded 78.6% sensitivity and 88.4% specificity. By adding the synthetic data augmentation the results increased to 85.7% sensitivity and 92.4% specificity.

In particular, the recognition of human gait can be useful to identify the characteristics of the places or physical spaces, such as whether the person is walking on level ground or walking down stairs in which people move. For example, ascending or descending stairs can be a risky activity for older adults because of a possible fall, which can have more severe consequences than if it occurred on a flat surface. While portable and wearable devices have been widely used to detect Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), few research works in the literature have focused on characterizing only actions of human gait. In the present study, a method for recognizing gait activities using acceleration data obtained from a smartphone and a wearable inertial sensor placed on the ankle of people is introduced. The acceleration signals were segmented based on the automatic detection of strides, also called gait cycles. Subsequently, a feature vector of the segmented signals was extracted, which was used to train four classifiers using the Naive Bayes, C4.5, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors algorithms. Data was collected from seven young subjects who performed five gait activities: (i) going down an incline, (ii) going up an incline, (iii) walking on level ground, (iv) going down stairs, and (v) going up stairs.

It will help to get the maximum information of any land cover. Considerable amount of research work has been carried out on multisensor data fusion but getting an optimal fusion for enhancement of land cover information using random weights is still ambiguous. Therefore, there is a need of such land cover monitoring system which can provide the maximum information of the land cover, generally which is not possible with the help of single sensor data. There is a necessity to develop such techniques by which information of multisensor data can be utilized optimally. Machine learning is one of the best way to optimize this type of information. So, in this paper, the weights of each sensor data have been critically analyzed which is required for the fusion, and observed that weights are quite sensitive in fusion. Therefore, different combinations of weights have been tested exhaustively in the direction to develop a relationship between weights and classification accuracy of the fused data. This relationship can be optimized through machine learning techniques like SVM (Support Vector Machine). In the present study, this experiment has been carried out for PALSAR (Phased Array L-Band Synthetic Aperture RADAR) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data. PALSAR is a fully polarimetric data with HH, HV and VV polarizations at good spatial resolution (25m), and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is a good indicator of vegetation, utilizing different bands (Red and NIR) of freely available MODIS data at 250m resolution. First of all, resolution of NDVI has been enhanced from 250m to 25m (10 times) using modified DWT (Modified Discrete Wavelet Transform) to bring it on the same scale as that of PALSAR. Now, different polarized PALSAR data (HH, HV, VV) have been fused with resolution enhanced NDVI separately i.e. three fusions (HH & NDVI, HV & NDVI, VV & NDVI), employing different combinations of weights (fusion coefficients) like (60, 40), (70, 30) etc. for each of the three fusions such that the sum of weights is 100. Henceforth, many fusion combinations are obtained for each fusion. Exhaustively, the effect of NDVI index on PALSAR data has been tested by computing and observing accuracies of vegetation regions as it should enhance by utilizing NDVI. After that, best weighted combinations of all the three fusions are stacked together to get all the fully polarimetric and NDVI information in a single image. Obtained stacked images are classified using SVM. The proposed technique is better than traditional methods like Genetic Algorithm because of more complexity. The proposed fusion approach is able to achieve improved vegetation region accuracy than that obtained by using stacked HH, HV, VV polarized data only. Quantitative and visual results show the superiority of the proposed technique over the others. Hence, other indices such as NDWI (for water) and UI (for urban) can also be utilized further for obtaining utmost land cover information.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2364440620", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131752419"}

The relationships between LEED credit achievement and project factors like budget and schedule have already been studied. Apart from these, climate factors such as temperature and precipitation can also affect the selection of green building technologies and therefore the LEED credits achieved. However, study on the relationships between LEED credit achievement and the climate of the building location is lacking. This paper investigates the relationship between climate factors and LEED credits using data mining techniques. The LEED credits achieved and the local climate conditions of 912 LEED certified existing building projects were collected and analyzed. By setting the climate factors as variables and the credit achievements as the targets, 26 classification models were built using the Random Forests classification algorithm. The variable importance for each credit was then calculated based on the contribution to the classification performance.

Five different types of geostatistical textural measure for three different window sizes and three different lags were applied creating a total of 972 potential input variables. Madograms, rodograms and direct variograms for the univariate case and cross- and pseudo-cross variograms for the multivariate case, together with multi-seasonal spectral information, were used in a RF classifier to map the land cover types. The pseudo-cross and cross variograms were used specifically to incorporate important seasonal/temporal information. Incorporating multi-scale textural features into the RF models led to an increase in the overall index of 10.71% and, for the most accurate classification, the increase was up to 30% in some classes. The differences in the kappa coefficient for the textural classification models were evaluated statistically using a pairwise Z-test, revealing a significant increase in per-class classification accuracy compared to GLCM-based texture measures. The pseudo-cross variogram between the visible and near-infrared bands was the most important textural features for general classification, and the multi-seasonal pseudo-cross variogram had an outstanding importance for agricultural classes. Overall, the RF classifier applied to a reduced subset of input variables composed of the most informative textural features led to the highest accuracy. Highly reliable classification results were obtained when the 16 most important textural features calculated at single scales (window sizes) were selected and used in the classification.

It conducts both early diagnosis and comprehensive assessment by drawing crucial pathological links between pathogenic factors and LNFS. Automated pathogenesis-based diagnosis would simultaneously localize and grade multiple spinal organs (neural foramina, vertebrae, intervertebral discs) to diagnose LNFS and discover pathogenic factors. The automated way facilitates planning optimal therapeutic schedules and relieving clinicians from laborious workloads. However, no successful work has been achieved yet due to its extreme challenges since 1) multiple targets: each lumbar spine has at least 17 target organs, 2) multiple scales: each type of target organ has structural complexity and various scales across subjects, and 3) multiple tasks, i.e., simultaneous localization and diagnosis of all lumbar organs, are extremely difficult than individual tasks. To address these huge challenges, we propose a deep multiscale multitask learning network (DMML-Net) integrating a multiscale multi-output learning and a multitask regression learning into a fully convolutional network. 1) DMML-Net merges semantic representations to reinforce the salience of numerous target organs. 2) DMML-Net extends multiscale convolutional layers as multiple output layers to boost the scale-invariance for various organs. 3) DMML-Net joins a multitask regression module and a multitask loss module to prompt the mutual benefit between tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DMML-Net achieves high performance (0.845 mean average precision) on T1/T2-weighted MRI scans from 200 subjects.

Moreover, such a model needs to be developed and redeveloped from the ground up if there are any alterations to the feature-space distribution.

The method applies prior knowledge that has been transferred to the new model from previous steganalysis models.

When mining molecular signature data, the process of comparing samples through an adaptive distance function is fundamental but difficult, as such datasets are normally heterogeneous and high dimensional. In this article, we present kernelized information-theoretic metric learning (KITML) algorithms that optimize a distance function to tackle the cancer diagnosis problem and scale to high dimensionality. By learning a nonlinear transformation in the input space implicitly through kernelization, KITML permits efficient optimization, low storage, and improved learning of distance metric. We propose two novel applications of KITML for diagnosing cancer using high-dimensional molecular profiling data: (1) for sample-level cancer diagnosis, the learned metric is used to improve the performance of k-nearest neighbor classification; and (2) for estimating the severity level or stage of a group of samples, we propose a novel set-based ranking approach to extend KITML. For the sample-level cancer classification task, we have evaluated on 14 cancer gene microarray datasets and compared with eight other state-of-the-art approaches. The results show that our approach achieves the best overall performance for the task of molecular-expression-driven cancer sample diagnosis. For the group-level cancer stage estimation, we test the proposed set-KITML approach using three multi-stage cancer microarray datasets, and correctly estimated the stages of sample groups for all three studies.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2789212", "venue": "TKDD", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2358862191", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["124304648", "4382833", "207155154", "168956", "15164504", "4405325", "7170451", "121309410", "4321183", "75519369", "4081850", "1300054", "961425", "5246200", "2261947", "8549299", "2261947", "9941351", "7553535", "119479891", "16740132", "24304972", "1058890", "2914506", "7159780", "8281592", "13861754", "43144161", "4470709", "589598", "120349231", "17650177", "21413834", "9976047", "7233636", "9291937", "1280204", "4419580", "10103928", "5262555", "12059602", "19011676", "7534766", "12416375", "37558570", "5540354", "13241530", "17520019", "17269797", "47325215", "53662922", "34358566", "11489285", "2643381", "4594718", "850937", "8406472", "10047484", "1398236", "207101343"], "inbound_citations": ["198190510", "53588990", "119093701"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15670473"}

A temporal role has a domain, which may resolve to different entities depending on the context and especially on temporal information, e.g. CEO of Microsoft in 2000. We focus on the temporal role extraction, as a precursor for temporal role disambiguation. We propose a structured prediction approach based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to annotate temporal roles in text and rely on a rich feature set, which extracts syntactic and semantic information from text.

Moreover, continuous and smooth segmentation results can be obtained by utilizing the patch-based structured labels.

Then we designed a weighted BNI model by adding the normalized weights into a conventional BNI model. We used this model to extract the EHR values for patients with or without pancreatic cancer, which then enabled us to calculate the prior probabilities for the 20 risk factors in the BNI. The software iDiagnosis was designed to use this weighted BNI model for predicting pancreatic cancer. In an evaluation using a case-control dataset, the weighted BNI model significantly outperformed the conventional BNI and two other classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine).

Pairwise constraints restrict the distance between samples of a similar pair to be lower than a fixed upper bound, and the distance between samples of a dissimilar pair higher than a fixed lower bound. Triplet-wise constraints restrict the distance between samples of a similar pair to be smaller than that between a pair of samples from different classes.

Two consecutive images are divided into grid cells 14x14 pixels, then tracking each cell in current frame to find corresponding cells in the next frame. At least using three corresponding cells, affine transformation is performed according to each corresponding cells in the consecutive images, so that conformed optical flows are extracted.

However, the size and memory footprint of these large LMs makes them difficult to deploy in many scenarios (e.g. on mobile phones). Recent research points to knowledge distillation as a potential solution, showing that when training data for a given task is abundant, it is possible to distill a large (teacher) LM into a small task-specific (student) network with minimal loss of performance. However, when such data is scarce, there remains a significant performance gap between large pretrained LMs and smaller task-specific models, even when training via distillation. In this paper, we bridge this gap with a novel training approach, called generation-distillation, that leverages large finetuned LMs in two ways: (1) to generate new (unlabeled) training examples, and (2) to distill their knowledge into a small network using these examples. Across three low-resource text classification datsets, we achieve comparable performance to BERT while using 300x fewer parameters, and we outperform prior approaches to distillation for text classification while using 3x fewer parameters.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2002.00733", "acl_id": "D19-6114", "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.18653/v1/D19-6114", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2986380433,3003609926", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["7278297", "53451039", "351666", "52967399", "206594692", "21697629", "7200347", "40100965", "16196524", "6628106", "16803005", "3312944", "9447219", "160025533", "11816014", "14638345", "85543565", "5034059"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208050764"}

The two approaches used incremental learning based only on the previous status of the station with neither weather nor time information. The models were applied to a BSS data set for one year (2014\u20132015) in the San Francisco Bay Area for different prediction windows. Both models gave comparable results. LWR performed slightly better than MBGDLR for all prediction windows. The smallest prediction error for LWR was 0.31 bikes/station (4% prediction error) for a 15-minute prediction window and 0.32 bikes/station for MBGDLR. The 120-minute prediction window had the largest prediction error of 1.1 bikes/station and 1.2 bikes/station for LWR and MBGDLR, respectively.

The successful development of multi-modal transportation recommendation systems can help to satisfy the diversified needs of travelers and improve the efficiency of transport networks. However, existing transport recommender systems mainly focus on unimodal transport planning. To this end, in this paper, we propose a joint representation learning framework for multi-modal transportation recommendation based on a carefully-constructed multi-modal transportation graph. Specifically, we first extract a multi-modal transportation graph from large-scale map query data to describe the concurrency of users, Origin-Destination (OD) pairs, and transport modes. Then, we provide effective solutions for the optimization problem and develop an anchor embedding for transport modes to initialize the embeddings of transport modes.

In this paper, we describe a method for performing automated classification of ASC images into three mutually exclusive classes: aurora , no aurora , and cloudy . This not only reduces the amount of data to be processed, but also facilitates in building statistical models linking the magnetic fluctuations and auroral activity helping us to get a step closer to forecasting auroral activity. We experimented with different feature extraction techniques coupled with Support Vector Machines classification. Color variants of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features, specifically Opponent SIFT features, were found to perform better than other feature extraction techniques. With Opponent SIFT features, we were able to build a classification model with a cross-validation accuracy of 91%, which was further improved using temporal information and elimination of outliers which makes it accurate enough for operational data pruning purposes.

Recognizing the gestures through bio-signals generated from facial muscle movements has been recently proposed as an accurate and reliable pathway. The performance of gesture recognition-based systems directly depends on the effectiveness of classification techniques. Besides, a reasonable trade-off between recognition accuracy and computational cost is counted as the most significant factor for designing such systems. The aim of this paper was the classification of facial gestures electromyogram (EMG) signals by means of a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) algorithm. Ten predefined facial gestures EMGs were recorded from ten participants through three bi-polar channels. Acquired signals were preprocessed using a band-pass filter and a segmentation technique. Then, time-domain features mean absolute value (MAV) and root mean square (RMS) were extracted from each segment. In order to classify the features, LS-SVM was implemented by considering radial basis function kernel and two multiclass encoding schemes, one-versus-one (OVO) and oneversus- all (OVA). This research showed that LS-SVM was a robust method for classification of facial gestures with 97.1% classification accuracy and 1.37 seconds training time when utilizing the feature combination MAV+RMS and the encoding technique OVA. It was also concluded that LS-SVM outperformed SVM and fuzzy c-means classifiers in this field of study.

A search of the PubMed database indicates that the correlation between texture features from dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI and HER2 2+ status has not been investigated extensively in invasive ductal carcinoma cases. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: 71 DCE-MRI cases of HER2 2+ status verified using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were selected, including36 positive and 35negative cases. 279 texture features were derived from lesion regions of interest manually drawn onto the subtraction images between pre- and post-contrast agent. Fisher coefficient, mutual information, minimization of both classification error probability and average correlation coefficients as well as a combination of all three methods (MPF) were independently used to reduce the dimensionality of texture parameters. A popular machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine, was further applied to determine HER2 2+status. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to evaluate the classification performance. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Diagnostic accuracy was optimal when the most significant discriminatory features were selected using MPF.

Using a machine learning terminology, in our application, we have a visual training set and a tactile test set, or vice versa. To tackle this problem, we propose an approach constituted by four steps: finding a visuo-tactile common representation, defining a suitable set of features, transferring the features across the domains, and classifying the objects. We show the results of our approach using a set of 15 objects, collecting 40 visual examples and five tactile examples for each object. The proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 94.7%, which is comparable with the accuracy of the monomodal case, i.e., when using visual data both as training set and test set.

Remote sensing is a source of information for their estimation on both regional and global scales. Many algorithms have been devised to estimate LST and SST from satellite data, most of which require a priori information about the surface and the atmosphere. A recently proposed approach involves the use of support vector machines (SVMs). Based on satellite data and corresponding in situ measurements, they generate an approximation of the relation between them, which can subsequently be used to estimate unknown surface temperatures from additional satellite data. Such a strategy requires the user to set several internal parameters. In this paper, a method is proposed for automatically setting these parameters to quasi-optimal values in the sense of minimum estimation errors. This is achieved by minimizing a functional correlated to regression errors (i.e., the ldquospan-boundrdquo upper bound on the leave-one-out (LOO) error) which can be computed by using only the training set, without need for a further validation set. In order to minimize this functional, Powell's algorithm is adopted, since it is applicable also to nondifferentiable functions. Experimental results yielded by the proposed method are similar in accuracy to those achieved by cross-validation and by a grid search for the parameter configuration which yields the best test-set accuracy.

Remote sensing applications usually use information from either passive optical systems or active radar sensors. These systems have shown satisfactory results for estimating, for example, aboveground biomass in some biomes. However, they presented significant limitations for ecological applications, as the sensitivity from these sensors has been shown to be limited in forests with medium levels of aboveground biomass. On the other hand, LiDAR remote sensing has been shown to be a good technique for the estimation of forest parameters such as canopy heights and above ground biomass. Whilst airborne LiDAR data are in general very dense but only available over small areas due to the cost of their acquisition, spaceborne LiDAR data acquired from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) have low acquisition density with global geographical cover. It is therefore valuable to analyze the integration relevance of canopy heights estimated from LiDAR sensors with ancillary data (geological, meteorological, slope, vegetation indices etc.) in order to propose a forest canopy height map with good precision and high spatial resolution. In addition, estimating forest canopy heights from large-footprint satellite LiDAR waveforms, is challenging given the complex interaction between LiDAR waveforms, terrain, and vegetation, especially in dense tropical and equatorial forests. Therefore, the research carried out in this thesis aimed at: 1) estimate, and validate canopy heights using raw data from airborne LiDAR and then evaluate the potential of spaceborne LiDAR GLAS data at estimating forest canopy heights. 2) evaluate the fusion potential of LiDAR (using either sapceborne and airborne data) and ancillary data for forest canopy height estimation at very large scales. This research work was carried out over the French Guiana.The estimation of the canopy heights using the airborne showed an RMSE on the canopy height estimates of 1.6 m. Next, the potential of GLAS for the estimation of canopy heights was assessed using multiple linear (ML) and Random Forest (RF) regressions using waveform metrics and principal component analssis (PCA). Results showed canopy height estimations with similar precisions using either LiDAR metrics or the principal components (PCs) (RMSE ~ 3.6 m). However, a regression model (ML or RF) based on the PCA of waveform samples is an interesting alternative for canopy height estimation as it does not require the extraction of some metrics from LiDAR waveforms that are in general difficult to derive in dense forests, such as those in French Guiana. Next, canopy heights extracted from both airborne and spaceborne LiDAR were first used to map canopy heights from available mapped environmental data (geological, meteorological, slope, vegetation indices etc.). Results showed an RMSE on the canopy height estimates of 6.5 m from the GLAS dataset and of 5.8 m from the airborne LiDAR dataset. Then, in order to improve the precision of the canopy height estimates, regression-kriging (kriging of random forest regression residuals) was used. Results indicated a decrease in the RMSE from 6.5 to 4.2 m for the regression-kriging maps from the GLAS dataset, and from 5.8 to 1.8 m for the regression-kriging map from the airborne LiDAR dataset. Finally, in order to study the impact of the spatial sampling of future LiDAR missions on the precision of canopy height estimates, six subsets were derived from the airborne LiDAR dataset with flight line spacing of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 km (corresponding to 0.29, 0.11, 0.08, 0.05, 0.04, and 0.03 points/km\u00b2, respectively). Results indicated that using the regression-kriging approach, the precision on the canopy height map was 1.8 m with flight line spacing of 5 km and decreased to an RMSE of 4.8 m for the configuration for the 50 km flight line spacing.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2910432407", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135230662"}

Therefore, in this work, we introduce a method to resolve this problem and to enhance prediction accuracy. Firstly, the features of the protein sequence are captured by combining Improving Pseudo-Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (IM-Psepssm) with the Bidirectional Correlation Coefficient (Bid-CC) algorithm from position-specific scoring matrix. Secondly, different features of fusion and resampling strategies are used to reduce the impact of imbalance on apoptosis protein datasets. Finally, the eigenvector adopts the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to the training classification model, and the prediction accuracy is evaluated by jackknife cross-validation tests.

These systems attempt to find the perfect match between the user fingerprint and pre-defined set of grid points on the radio map. However, Fingerprints are duplicated from available Access Points (APs) and interference, which increase number of matched patterns with the user's fingerprint. In this research, the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to improve the performance and to reduce the computation cost of the WiFi indoor localization systems based on machine learning approach.

Deep learning is a machine learning (ML) technique which learns features and tasks directly from data, trying to model human abstract thinking. Since deep learning can create features without a human intervention, it allows data scientists to use more complex sets of features in comparison with traditional machine learning approaches. In addition to this, the robustness to natural variations in the data is automatically learned and the deep learning architecture is flexible, so that the same neural network based approach can be applied to many different applications and data types. Our goal is to apply DL based techniques in the context of medical imaging with the purpose of developing a workflow for diagnosing cardiovascular pathologies or cerebral aneurysms. Since a major challenge of this approach is the lack of large training databases, in this paper we are focusing on performing data augmentation by generating realistic synthetic anatomical models of blood vessels. For this task we used geometries describing vessel-like structures and also real anatomies extracted from patients. We chose to experiment with two state of the art models: Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We address the problem of employing neural network based models on three dimensional surfaces. Such surfaces typically have an unstructured representation consisting of points and polygons and are not compatible with typical neural network architectures. We propose a technique based on surface voxelization which consists on representing the unstructured surface mesh as a three-dimensional image, therefore becoming inherently compatible with a standard convolutional neural network. We performed experiments on three datasets containing both two and three dimensional surfaces representing blood vessel-like structures. We show that state of the art, deep learning based generative models, are capable of generating voxelized three dimensional surfaces of high quality that are visually indistinguishable from the training samples.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSTCC.2019.8885576", "venue": "2019 23rd International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)", "journal": "2019 23rd International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2982608753", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["31373273", "2516262", "5216145", "5257869", "4453809", "6628106", "6462244", "1360152", "15729082", "11758569", "5395254", "207614217", "20416090", "2834977", "59249031", "3248075", "27776989", "17860047"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207830743"}

Our previous studies have shown that it is difficult to distinguish disease genes from non-disease genes. To understand the molecular pathogenesis under complex clinical phenotypes during the disease progression, it is better to identify biomarkers corresponding to different disease stage. Therefore, in this study, we designed a label propagation based semi-supervised feature selection approach (LPFS) to identify disease-associated genes corresponding to different clinical phenotypes. LPFS selects disease-associated genes corresponding to different disease stage through the alternative iteration of label propagation clustering and feature selection. We then conducted an enrichment analysis to understand gene functions and affected pathways during the disease progression, thus to decode the changes in individual behavioral and mental characteristics during neurodegenerative disease progression at the gene expression level.

Even though a growing effort has been carried out by the scientific community in recent years, accurate and reliable automated PCa detection methods on multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) are still a compelling issue. In this work, a Deep Neural Network architecture is developed for the task of classifying clinically significant PCa on non-contrast-enhanced MR images. In particular, we propose the use of Conditional Random Fields as a Recurrent Neural Network (CRF-RNN) to enhance the classification performance of XmasNet, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture specifically tailored to the PROSTATEx17 Challenge. The devised approach builds a hybrid end-to-end trainable network, CRF-XmasNet, composed of an initial CNN component performing feature extraction and a CRF-based probabilistic graphical model component for structured prediction, without the need for two separate training procedures. Experimental results show the suitability of this method in terms of classification accuracy and training time, even though the high-variability of the observed results must be reduced before transferring the resulting architecture to a clinical environment. Interestingly, the use of CRFs as a separate postprocessing method achieves significantly lower performance with respect to the proposed hybrid end-to-end approach.

The density distribution map of the lung nodule image was generated after scanning all pixels in the nodule image.

Adding a text model to the deep learning model improves performance, increasing accuracy and F1-score by 2% and 6%, respectively. This indicates that textual information contributes greatly to hospital readmission predictions.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-34482-5_2", "venue": "ICSH", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2990580180", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208224751"}

However, in beef heifers, little is known about the vaginal and fecal microbiota with respect to their relationship with fertility. To this end, we followed heifers through gestation to examine the dynamics of vaginal and fecal microbial composition throughout pregnancy. Heifers were exposed to an estrus synchronization protocol, observed over a 12-day period, artificially inseminated 12 h to 18 h after observed estrus, and subsequently exposed to bulls for a 50-day breeding season. Vaginal samples were taken at pre-breeding (n = 72), during the first (n = 72), and second trimester (n = 72) for all individuals, and third trimester for individuals with confirmed pregnancies (n = 56). Fecal samples were taken at pre-breeding (n = 32) and during the first trimester (n = 32), including bred and open individuals. Next generation sequencing of the V4 region of the16S rRNA gene via the Illumina MiSeq platform was applied to all samples. Shannon indices and the number of observed bacterial features were the same in fecal samples. However, significant differences in vaginal microbiome diversity between gestation stages were observed. No differences in beta-diversity were detected in vaginal or fecal samples regarding pregnancy status, but such differences were seen with fecal microbiome over time. Random Forest was developed to identify predictors of pregnancy status in vaginal (e.g., Histophilus, Clostridiaceae, Campylobacter) and fecal (e.g., Bacteroidales, Dorea) samples. Our study shows that bovine vaginal and fecal microbiome could be used as biomarkers of bovine reproduction.

The system employs Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based soft clustering and Random Decision Forest (RDF) ensembles for hybrid indoor localization i.e., both room-level and latitude-longitude prediction. GMM-based soft clustering allows finding natural data subsets helping cascaded classifiers better learn underlying data dynamics. The RDF ensembles enhance the capabilities of decision trees providing better generalization.

Despite the success of model-based image deblurring methods where the deconvolution is a major step to recover the sharp image, its usage in practice is still limited, especially when many factors such as object motion, camera motion, non-uniform sensitivity of the imaging device contribute to imaging process. In automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) of moving vehicle, the blurred image severely reduces the accuracy of recognition. Meanwhile, though the binarized image of license plate has an important role in ALPR systems, its accuracy is largely affected by the blurred image. In this paper, we use a deep architecture based on Generative Adversarial Networks to jointly perform image deblurring and image binarization for license plate images.

Modern methods leverage deep convolutional networks, and generally require a large amount of labeled data for model training. However, obtaining accurate pixel-wise labels on X-ray images is very challenging due to the appearance of anatomy overlaps and complex texture patterns. In comparison, labeled CT data are more accessible since organs in 3D CT scans preserve clearer structures and thus can be easily delineated. In this paper, we propose a model framework for learning automatic X-ray image parsing from labeled 3D CT scans. Specifically, a Deep Image-to-Image network (DI2I) for multi-organ segmentation is first trained on X-ray like Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) rendered from 3D CT volumes. Then we build a Task Driven Generative Adversarial Network (TD-GAN) to achieve simultaneous synthesis and parsing for unseen real X-ray images. The entire model pipeline does not require any annotations from the X-ray image domain. In the numerical experiments, we validate the proposed model on over 800 DRRs and 300 topograms. While the vanilla DI2I trained on DRRs without any adaptation fails completely on segmenting the topograms, the proposed model does not require any topogram labels and is able to provide a promising average dice of 86% which achieves the same level of accuracy as results from supervised training (89%). Furthermore, we also demonstrate the generality of TD-GAN through quantatitive and qualitative study on widely used public dataset.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32120268", "doi": "10.1016/j.media.2020.101664", "venue": "Medical image analysis", "journal": "Medical image analysis", "mag_id": "3005498024", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211833046"}

The embedding positions of watermark are obtained from IAT, and the pixel values are embedded in carrier image by quantization embedding rules. Then, the watermark can be embedded in carrier image. In order to realize blind extraction of watermark, FSSVM model is used to find the embedding positions of watermark, and the pixel values are extracted by using quantization extraction rules. Through using improved Arnold inverse transformation for embedding positions, the watermark coordinates can be calculated, and the extraction of watermark is carried out. Compared with other watermarking techniques, the presented scheme can promote the security by adding more secret keys, and the imperceptibility of watermark is improved by introducing quantization rules.

In most state-of-the-art TTS systems the prediction from text of prosodic prominence relations between words in an utterance relies on features that very loosely account for the combined effects of syntax, semantics, word informativeness and salience, on prosodic prominence. To improve prosodic prominence prediction we first follow up the classic approach in which prosodic prominence patterns are flattened into binary sequences of pitch accented and pitch unaccented words. We propose and motivate statistic and syntactic dependency based features that are complementary to the most predictive features proposed in previous works on automatic pitch accent prediction and show their utility on both read and spontaneous speech. Different accentuation patterns can be associated to the same sentence. Such variability rises the question on how evaluating pitch accent predictors when more patterns are allowed. We carry out a study on prosodic symbols variability on a speech corpus where different speakers read the same text and propose an information-theoretic definition of optionality of symbolic prosodic events that leads to a novel evaluation metric in which prosodic variability is incorporated as a factor affecting prediction accuracy. We additionally propose a method to take advantage of the optionality of prosodic events in unit-selection speech synthesis. To better account for the tight links between the prosodic prominence of a word and the discourse/sentence context, part of this thesis goes beyond the accent/no-accent dichotomy and is devoted to a novel task, the automatic detection of contrast, where contrast is meant as a (Information Structure\u2019s) relation that ties two words that explicitly contrast with each other. This task is mainly motivated by the fact that contrastive words tend to be prosodically marked with particularly prominent pitch accents. The identification of contrastive word pairs is achieved by combining lexical information, syntactic information (which mainly aims to identify the syntactic parallelism that often activates contrast) and semantic information (mainly drawn from the WordNet semantic lexicon), within a Support Vector Machines classifier. Once we have identified patterns of prosodic prominence we propose methods to incorporate such information in TTS synthesis and test its impact on synthetic speech naturalness trough some large scale perceptual experiments.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1562405582", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["969135"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32558691"}

Accumulation of measured affinities of determined protein complex structures with high resolution facilitate the realization of this ambitious goal. Previous physical model based scoring functions failed to predict the affinities of diverse protein complexes. Therefore, accurate method for binding affinity prediction is still extremely challenging. Machine learning methods are promising to address this problem. However, current machine learning methods are not compatible to this task, which obstructs the effective application of these methods. We propose a Wavelet Package Transform (WPT) combined with two-layer support vector regression (TLSVR-WPT) model to implicitly capture binding contributions that are hard to model explicitly. Wavelet package transform greatly reduced the dimension of input features into machine learning model. The TLSVR circumvents both the descriptor compatibility problem and the need for problematic modeling assumptions. Input features for TLSVR first layer are eight features transformed by Wavelet Transform Package from scores of 2209 interacting atom pairs within each distance bin. The output of the first layer is combined by the next layer to infer the final affinities. A satisfactory result of R = 0.81 and SD = 1.40 was achieved when 2209 features were reduced to eight ones by 3-level Wavelet Package Transform. Results demonstrate that wavelet package transform greatly reduced the dimension of the input features into SVR without reducing the accuracy in predicting the protein binding affinity.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-63312-1_35", "venue": "ICIC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2737168774", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5916753"}

Recognizing facial expressions accurately is challenging. Approaches for solving FER (Facial Expression Recognition) problem can be categorized into 1) Static single images and 2) Image sequences. Traditionally, different techniques like Multi-layer Perceptron Model, k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines were used by researchers for solving FER. These methods extracted features like Local Binary Patterns, Eigenfaces, Face-landmark features, and Texture features. Among all these methods, Neural Networks have gained very much popularity and they are extensively used for FER. Recently, CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) have gained popularity in field of deep learning because of their casual architecture and ability to provide good results without requirement of manual feature extraction from raw image data. This paper focuses on survey of various face expression recognition techniques based on CNN. It includes state-of-the-art methods suggested by different researchers. The paper also shows steps needed for usage of CNN for FER.

The predictive models explain 63% to 88% of stock variance among the major size groups. Individual and composite maps of predicted global seafloor biomass and abundance are generated for bacteria, meiofauna, macrofauna, and megafauna (invertebrates and fishes). Patterns of benthic standing stocks were positive functions of surface primary production and delivery of the particulate organic carbon (POC) flux to the seafloor. At a regional scale, the census maps illustrate that integrated biomass is highest at the poles, on continental margins associated with coastal upwelling and with broad zones associated with equatorial divergence. Lowest values are consistently encountered on the central abyssal plains of major ocean basins The shift of biomass dominance groups with depth is shown to be affected by the decrease in average body size rather than abundance, presumably due to decrease in quantity and quality of food supply.

In this study, we applied a methodological framework to optimize the prediction of SOC stocks for the entire Brazilian territory and determine how the environmental heterogeneity of Brazil influences the SOC stocks distribution. We used a legacy dataset of 8227 soil profiles which consisted of 37,693 samples. For each profile, the vertical distribution of SOC and bulk density were interpolated to standard depths (0\u20135, 5\u201315, 15\u201330, 30\u201360 and 60\u2013100 cm) using mass preserving equal-area quadratic splines. The covariates database was composed of 74 variables including bioclimatic (temperature and precipitation) data, soil and biome maps, vegetation indexes and morphometric maps derived from a digital elevation model, with a 1 km spatial resolution. To obtain the best prediction performance, we tested four machine learning algorithms: Random Forests, Cubist, Generalized Linear Model Boosting and Support Vector Machines. Random Forests showed the best performance in predicting SOC stocks for all depths, with the highest performance at 30\u201360 cm for training (R2 = 0.32) and validation (R2 = 0.33); hence, it was selected for the spatial prediction of SOC stocks. The most important covariates selected by Random Forests using the recursive feature elimination were: soil class, sum of monthly mean temperature (SAMT), precipitation, slope height and vegetation indexes (NDVI, GPP). In total, Brazilian soils store approximately 71.3 PgC within the top 100 cm, where the first 0\u201330 cm contains almost 36 PgC. Approximately 31% of the total SOC stocks (22.2 PgC) occurs in protected areas (2.6 million km2), which are not subjected to land use pressure and carbon losses. Although the Amazon biome has the highest amount of stored SOC (36.1 PgC), its soils do not represent a good potential for carbon accumulation.

More than 57% of the total SOC was found in nutrient-poor, deep-weathered Ferralsols and Acrisols, which are the dominant soils in Brazil.

After calculating,sugar contribution value of different phenological phases was obtained,which was used to construct the weighted sensitive spectra to forecast fruit sugar content.Firstly,the visible and near infrared spectral reflectance of apple leaf samples from different phenological phases were measured using the spectrophotometric method. And the sugar content of the fruit sample growing near each leaf samples was collected and measured using laboratory method. By introducing 2-D correlation analysis technology,the fruit sugar content sensitive spectra( 530-570 nm and 700-720 nm) were achieved.Then the principal component analysis was conducted among each sensitive spectrum and the principal components were obtained in different phenological phases. The principal components were used to perform sugar content regression analysis,which quantified the contribution proportion to fruit sugar accumulation in each certain phase. And the other important information such as intensity change of photosynthesis in different physiological phases was obtained as well. By using of the sugar contribution weight in each different phenological phase,the original sensitive spectra were transformed and the weighted leaf characteristic spectra were achieved.

As the cultivation of drug type cannabis is forbidden in Switzerland law enforcement authorities regularly ask forensic laboratories to determinate the chemotype of a seized cannabis plant and then to conclude if the plantation is legal or not. This classification is mainly performed when the plant is mature as required by the EU official protocol and then the classification of cannabis seedlings is a time consuming and costly procedure. A previous study made by the authors has investigated this problematic [1] and showed that it is possible to differentiate between drug type (illegal) and fibre type (legal) cannabis at an early stage of growth using gas chromatography interfaced with mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) based on the relative proportions of eight major leaf compounds. The aims of the present work are on one hand to continue former work and to optimize the methodology for the discrimination of drug- and fibre type cannabis developed in the previous study and on the other hand to investigate the possibility to predict illegal cannabis varieties. Seven classifiers for differentiating between cannabis seedlings are evaluated in this paper, namely Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Nearest Neighbour Classification (NNC), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machines (RBF SVMs), Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The performance of each method was assessed using the same analytical dataset that consists of 861 samples split into drug- and fibre type cannabis with drug type cannabis being made up of 12 varieties (i.e. 12 classes). The results show that linear classifiers are not able to manage the distribution of classes in which some overlap areas exist for both classification problems. Unlike linear classifiers, NNC and RBF SVMs best differentiate cannabis samples both for 2-class and 12-class classifications with average classification results up to 99% and 98%, respectively. Furthermore, RBF SVMs correctly classified into drug type cannabis the independent validation set, which consists of cannabis plants coming from police seizures. In forensic case work this study shows that the discrimination between cannabis samples at an early stage of growth is possible with fairly high classification performance for discriminating between cannabis chemotypes or between drug type cannabis varieties.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.chemolab.2011.05.004", "venue": null, "journal": "Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems", "mag_id": "1983989415", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203922786", "207591394", "46744284"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:120938134"}

CBCT has been effectively used in recent years for diagnosing dental pathologies and determining their boundaries and content. Unlike other imaging techniques, CBCT provides detailed and distinctive information about the pathologies by enabling a three-dimensional (3D) image of the region to be displayed. Methods We employed 50 CBCT 3D image dataset files as the full dataset of our study. These datasets were identified by experts as periapical cyst and KCOT lesions according to the clinical, radiographic and histopathologic features. Segmentation operations were performed on the CBCT images using viewer software that we developed. Using the tools of this software, we marked the lesional volume of interest and calculated and applied the order statistics and 3D gray-level co-occurrence matrix for each CBCT dataset. A feature vector of the lesional region, including 636 different feature items, was created from those statistics. Six classifiers were used for the classification experiments. Results The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier achieved the best classification performance with 100% accuracy, and 100% F-score (F1) scores as a result of the experiments in which a ten-fold cross validation method was used with a forward feature selection algorithm. SVM achieved the best classification performance with 96.00% accuracy, and 96.00% F1 scores in the experiments in which a split sample validation method was used with a forward feature selection algorithm. SVM additionally achieved the best performance of 94.00% accuracy, and 93.88% F1 in which a leave-one-out (LOOCV) method was used with a forward feature selection algorithm.

Machine learning has been revolutionized with the emerging deep neural network approaches over recent years, making the data-related limitations even a larger problem as these novel techniques commonly require immense imaging datasets. This paper introduces constrained Generative Adversarial Network ensembles (cGANe) to address this problem by altering the representation of the imaging data, whereas containing the significant information, enabling the reproduction of similar research results elsewhere with the sharable data. Accordingly, a framework representing the generation of a cGANe is described, and the approach is validated for the generation of synthetic 3D brain metastatic region data from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI studies. For 90% brain metastases (BM) detection sensitivity, our previously reported detection algorithm produced on average 9.12 false-positive BM detections per patient after training with the original data, whereas producing 9.53 false-positives after training with the cGANe generated synthetic data. Although the applicability of the introduced approach needs further validation studies with a range of medical imaging data types, the results suggest that the BM-detection algorithm can achieve comparable performance by using cGANe generated synthetic data.

Construction of a new quasar candidate catalog from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey 2 (RCS-2), identified solely from photometric information using an automated algorithm suitable for large surveys.

The Random Forest algorithm constructs the catalog from RCS-2 point sources using SDSS spectroscopically-confirmed stars and quasars. The algorithm identifies putative quasars from broadband magnitudes (g, r, i, z) and colours. Exploiting NUV GALEX measurements for a subset of the objects, we refine the classifier by adding new information. An additional subset of the data with WISE W1 and W2 bands is also studied. Results. Upon analyzing 542,897 RCS-2 point sources, the algorithm identified 21,501 quasar candidates, with a training-set-derived precision (the fraction of true positives within the group assigned quasar status) of 89.5% and recall (the fraction of true positives relative to all sources that actually are quasars) of 88.4%. These performance metrics improve for the GALEX subset; 6,530 quasar candidates are identified from 16,898 sources, with a precision and recall respectively of 97.0% and 97.5%.

First, BridgeNet extends traditional student-teacher frameworks by providing multiple hints from a teacher network. Hints are not limited to the soft labels from a teacher network. Teacher's intermediate feature representations can better guide a student network to learn how to denoise or dereverberate noisy input.

Projections of vector and other geospatial data in these images depend on camera parameters, positions of the entities, surface terrain, and visibility. This paper presents a robust and scalable algorithm to detect inconsistencies in vector data using oblique images. The algorithm uses image descriptors to encode the local appearance of a geospatial entity in images. These image descriptors combine color, pixel-intensity gradients, texture, and steerable filter responses. A Support Vector Machine classifier is trained to detect image descriptors that are not consistent with underlying vector data, digital elevation maps, building models, and camera parameters. In this paper, we train the classifier on visible road segments and non-road data.

Doumas (alex.doumas@ed.ac.uk) University of Edinburgh, Department of Psychology 3 Charles Street, Edinburgh EH8 9AD, UK Abstract instances of less frequent classes. Indeed, this phenomena fits well with accounts relying on frequency to mediate access (e.g., Jacoby & Dallas, 1981). Recent theoretical work on the availability heuristic relies on the dual-process theory of reasoning (for a review, see Evans, 2008). Following Stanovich & West (2000), we shall refer to these processes as System 1 and System 2. System 1 processes are characterized as fast, automatic, and reflexive whereas System 2 processes are characterized as slow, controlled, and reflective (e.g., Schneider & Schiffrin, 1977; Lieberman, Gaunt, Gilbert, & Trope, 2002). An integrated account of these processes has been identified as a key element in how people reason about relations differently than non-human animals (e.g., Hummel & Choplin, 2000; Doumas, Bassok, Guthormson, & Hummel, 2006). To our knowledge, no dual-process account explains how the availability (or any other) heuristic emerges without assuming it a priori as these accounts focus on a description of System 1 and System 2 at a computational level. We simulated several classic studies of the availability heuristic in Doumas, Sandhofer, and Hummel\u2019s (2008) Discovery of Relations by Analogy (DORA) model, a theory of concept development and relational reasoning which provides an account of how such heuristics might arise as schemas developed through experience. Theories of how cognitive biases arise rely on heuristics that influence attention and reasoning. These heuristics serve as a post-hoc description of how attention and reasoning is weighted to produce the patterns of deviation in judgment. We are unaware of any process account of how these heuristics arise. In this article, we present several simulations of classic studies of the availability heuristic and describe how the availability heuristic arises through distributed symbolic representations and simple process interactions in an existing model of relational reasoning and concept development (Discovery of Relations by Analogy; Doumas, Hummel, & Sandhofer, 2008). Keywords: availability heuristic, retrievability biases, symbolic-connectionism Cognitive Biases and Heuristics Tversky & Kahneman\u2019s (1974) seminal paper on cognitive biases (patterns of deviation in judgment) identified several heuristics (rules that constrain which hypotheses are entertained) that limit how people reason in uncertain situations. These cognitive biases have captured the imagination of scientists and laypeople alike, resulting in a massive body of research and a Nobel prize for Kahneman. Three major heuristics were identified in the Tversky & Kahneman (1974) paper: representativeness (the degree to which an event is prototypical of its class or the process that generates it), availability (the ease of recall of instances or properties), and adjustment and anchoring (early experiences serve as an anchor and adjustments due to subsequent experience fall short of the mark). Despite the deep literature base and interest from fields ranging from behavioral economics to military science, the development and processing of heuristics held to account for cognitive biases remains largely unexplored. This gap in the literature seems strange given how much ink has been spilled on how such heuristics might operate, the cognitive biases that arise due to the interactions of various heuristics, and even the relative importance of each heuristic involved in a particular pattern of behavior. In this paper we focus on the availability heuristic - in short, what is easily recalled has a large influence on reasoning, especially around assessments of frequency or probability. This heuristic is intuitively satisfying, as it is likely that instances of large classes (i.e., ones which occur frequently) are recalled more quickly and completely than Methods In this section we describe two studies from Tversky & Kahneman\u2019s (1973) article on the availability heuristic, followed by a brief overview of the DORA model, and present task simulations. Task Description Tversky & Kahneman\u2019s (1973) article outlines 10 studies designed to investigate the existence of cognitive biases attributed to the availability heuristic. We simulated Studies 5 and 10. In Study 5, adolescents (N = 118) enrolled in college- preparatory high schools provided estimates of the number of distinct combinations of committees of two to eight members that could be formed from a pool of ten candidates. Although the number of distinct committees of two and eight members are the same (as any committee of eight members drawn from a pool of ten candidates defines a unique unchosen group of two), the availability heuristic suggests that estimates of number of possible committees of", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CogSci", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2403564011", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["39212150", "925372", "1989372", "148964633", "12246493", "16161218", "149152170", "41156561", "254282", "980669", "9596272", "143325932", "4605618", "125306131", "18641935", "209396626", "73644344", "197667095", "41668623", "143452957", "2674307"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11907047"}

Different from existing methods, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model for simultaneous facial expression synthesis and facial expression recognition. In our method, paired images are not required, which makes the proposed model much more flexible and general. Furthermore, different expressions are encoded in a disentangled manner in a latent space, which enables us to generate facial images with arbitrary expressions by exchanging certain parts of their latent identity features. Finally, the facial expression synthesis and facial expression recognition tasks can further boost their performance for each other via our model.

To this end, a fully convolutional network with multiple scales is used as the learnable pre-processing step to provide the pose-specific characteristics of the pressure maps to the pre-trained pose identification module. A combination of loss functions is used to model the constraints, ensuring that unclear body parts are reconstructed correctly while preventing the pre-processing block from generating arbitrary images.

Moreover, SVM also suffers from other issues like selection of kernel functions, skewed vector spaces and heterogeneity in the training examples. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method by integrating \"weak\" support vector machine classifiers using boosting techniques. The proposed model exploits classification performance of Boosting while using SVM as the base classifier, applied for sentiment based classification of online reviews. The results on movies and hotel review corpora of 2000 reviews have shown that the proposed approach has succeeded in improving the performance of SVM.

However, the single-view correspondence may prevent these algorithms from further improvement due to the problem of incorrect correlation discovery. To tackle this problem, we propose a new method for transfer learning in a multi-view correspondence perspective, which is called Multi-View Principal Component Analysis (MVPCA) approach. MVPCA discovers the correspondence between bridge features representative across all domains and specific features from different domains respectively, and conducts the transfer learning by dimensionality reduction in a multi-view way, which can better depict the knowledge transfer.

We present a method to map annual LULC at a regional spatial scale with source data and processing techniques that permit scaling to broader spatial and temporal scales, while maintaining a consistent classification scheme and accuracy. Using the Dry Chaco ecoregion in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay as a test site, we derived a suite of predictor variables from 2001 to 2007 from the MODIS 250 m vegetation index product (MOD13Q1). These variables included: annual statistics of red, near infrared, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), phenological metrics derived from EVI time series data, and slope and elevation. For reference data, we visually interpreted percent cover of eight classes at locations with high-resolution QuickBird imagery in Google Earth. An adjustable majority cover threshold was used to assign samples to a dominant class. When compared to field data, we found this imagery to have georeferencing error b5% the length of a MODIS pixel, while most class interpretation error was related to confusion between agriculture and herbaceous vegetation. We used the Random Forests classifier to identify the best sets of predictor variables and percent cover thresholds for discriminating our LULC classes. The best variable set included all predictor variables and a cover threshold of 80%. This optimal Random Forests was used to map LULC for each year between 2001 and 2007, followed by a per-pixel, 3-year temporal filter to remove disallowed LULC transitions. Our sequence of maps had an overall accuracy of 79.3%, producer accuracy from 51.4% (plantation) to 95.8% (woody vegetation), and user accuracy from 58.9% (herbaceous vegetation) to 100.0% (water).

I examine regular, generative processes which operate over the lexicon to induce verbal sense shifts, and discuss the interaction of these processes with the linguistic or discourse context. I concentrate on phenomena where only an interaction between all three linguistic knowledge sources can explain the constraints on verb use: conventionalised lexical semantic knowledge constrains productive syntactic processes, while pragmatic reasoning is both constrained by and constrains the potential interpretations given to certain verbs. The phenomena which are closely examined are the behaviour of PP sentential modifiers (specifically dative and directional PPs) with respect to the lexical semantic representation of the verb phrases they modify, resultative constructions, and logical metonymy. The analysis is couched in terms of a lexical semantic representation drawing on Davis (1995), Jackendoff (1983, 1990), and Pustejovsky (1991, 1995) which aims to capture \u201clinguistically relevant\u201d components of meaning. The representation is shown to have utility for modeling of the interaction between the syntactic form of an utterance and its meaning. I introduce a formalisation of the representation within the framework of Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Pollard and Sag 1994), and rely on the model of discourse coherence proposed by Lascarides and Asher (1992), Discourse in Commonsense Entailment.

Among the existing tracking methods, most of them mainly focus on using various cues such as color, texture, contour, features, motion as well as depth information to achieve a robust tracking performance. The tracking methods themselves are highly emphasized while properties of the objects to be tracked are usually not exploited enough. In this paper, we first propose a novel adaptive tracking selection mechanism dependent on the properties of the objects. The system will automatically choose the optimal tracking algorithm after examining the textureness of the object. In addition, we propose a robust tracking algorithm for uniform objects based on color information which can cope with real world constraints. In the mean time, we deployed a textured object tracking algorithm which combines the Lucas-Kanade tracker and a model based tracker using the Random Forests classifier.

To achieve this objective, one important factor is to capture occupancy properties for building control systems, which refers to occupancy modeling in buildings. Due to the complexity of building occupancy, previous works try to simplify the modeling with some specific assumptions which may not always hold. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework for building occupancy modeling without any prior assumptions. The GAN approach contains two key components, i.e. a generative network and a discriminative network, which are designed as two powerful neural networks. Owing to the strong generalization capacity of neural networks and the adversarial mechanism in the GAN approach, it is able to accurately model building occupancy. We perform real experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed GAN approach and compare it with two state-of-the-art approaches for building occupancy modeling. To quantify the performance of all the models, we define five variables with two evaluation criteria. Results show that our proposed GAN approach can achieve a superior performance.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.06.029", "venue": null, "journal": "Energy and Buildings", "mag_id": "2811185893", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["162176534", "56597459", "164328993", "104447704", "208117011"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115753509"}

Our recent work with IRAAMs has shown that they are capable of generating the context-free (non-regular) language for arbitrary values of . This paper expands upon that work, showing that IRAAMs are capable of generating syntac- tically ambiguous languages but seem less capable of gener- ating certain context-free constructions that are absent or dis- favored in natural languages. Together, these demonstrations support our belief that IRAAMs can provide an explanatorily adequate connectionist model of grammatical competence in natural language. Natural Language Issues In an early and extremely influential paper, Noam Chomsky (1956) showed that natural languages (NL\u2019s) cannot be mod- eled by a finite-state automaton, because of the existence of center-embedded constructions. A second and equally im- portant observation from this work was that a minimally ade- quate NL grammar must be ambiguous, assigning more than one structure (interpretation) to some sentences, for example, They are flying planes. The first observation led to the development of Chomsky\u2019s formal hierarchy of languages, based on the computational resources of the machines needed to recognize them. In this hierarchy, Chomsky\u2019s observation about center-embedding is expressed by saying that NL\u2019s are non-regular; i.e., they can- not be generated by having only rules of the form a grammar , where and are non-terminal symbols and is a terminal symbol. Whether NL\u2019s are merely non-regular, belonging in the next, context-free (CF) level of the Chomsky hierarchy, or are more powerful, belonging further up in the hierarchy, became the subject of heated debate (Higginbotham 1984; Postal and Langendoen 1984; Shieber 1985). Non-CF phenomena such as reduplication/copying (Culy 1985) and crossed serial de- pendencies (Bresnan, Kaplan, Peters, and Zaenen 1982) sug- gested that a more powerful approach, using syntactic trans- formations (Chomsky 1957) was called for, but some re- searchers criticized transformations as having arbitrary power and thus failing to constrain the types of languages that could be expressed (Gazdar 1982). Further criticism of the entire formal approach came from observing that even CF gram- mars (CFGs) had the power to generate structures, such as a sequence followed by its mirror image, that did not seem to occur in NL (Manaster-Ramer 1986), or which placed an extraordinary burden on the human parsing mechanism when they did occur (Bach, Brown, and Marslen-Wilson 1986). Connectionism and Natural Language While debates about the complexity of NL were raging, connectionism was beginning to awaken from a fifteen-year sleep. In connectionist models many researchers found a way of embodying flexibility, graceful degradation, and other non-rigid properties that seem to characterize real cognitive systems like NL. This research culminated the publication of a highly controversial paper by Rumelhart and McClel- land (1986) which provided a connectionist account of part of the grammar of English using a feed-forward neural net- work. The paper was soon criticized by more traditional cog- nitive scientists (Fodor and Pylyshyn 1988; Pinker and Prince 1988), who cited the non-generative nature of such connec- tionist models as a fundamental shortcoming of the entire field. Partly in response to these criticisms, many connection- ists have spent the past decade investigating network models which support generativity through recurrent (feedback) con- nections (Lawrence, Giles, and Fong 1998; Rodriguez, Wiles, and Elman 1999; Williams and Zipser 1989). The research we present here is an attempt to contribute to this effort while focusing as strongly as possible on the natural language is- sues described above. Such an attempt faces a number of challenges. First, despite analysis of how a network\u2019s dynamics con- tribute to its generativity, it is often uncertain whether the dynamics can support generation of well-formed strings be- yond a certain length. That is, it is unknown whether the net- work has a true \u201ccompetence\u201d for the language of which it has learned a few exemplars, or is merely capable of generating a finite, and hence regular, subset of the language. 1 Second, it is often easier to model weak, rather than strong genera- tive capacity, by building networks that generate or recognize strings having certain properties, without assigning any syn- tactic structure to the strings. Third, this lack of syntactic structure inhibits the formulation of an account of syntactic ambiguity in such networks, making them less plausible as models of NL. To be fair, not all connectionists, or cognitive scientists, take seriously the notion that human language has infinite generative ca- pacity. Though we obviously do not have the resources to argue the issue here, we are certain that a model with a provably infinite competence would be more persuasive to the cognitive science com- munity as a whole than would a model without one.", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Cognitive Modeling", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1532366611", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["58756301", "5274909", "30218561", "2852656", "86819715", "612592", "17432009", "62725044", "29043627", "122261160", "60661125", "6673581", "10888679", "2999779", "12217058", "770011", "6573501", "7080922", "56499839", "62350208", "9868915", "1971348", "11823085", "9868083", "14498946", "14711886"], "inbound_citations": ["10668315", "58583139", "12903998", "51807043", "1395781"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15704995"}

This is achieved by approximating the Support Vector Machine decision function by an over-complete Haar wavelet transformation. This provides a set of classifiers of increasing complexity that can be used in a cascaded fashion yielding excellent runtime performance. This over-complete transformation finds the optimal approximation of the Support Vectors by a set of rectangles with constant gray-level values (enabling an Integral Image based evaluation). A major feature of our training algorithm is that it is fast, simple and does not require complicated tuning by an expert in contrast to the Viola & Jones classifier. The paradigm of our method is that, instead of trying to estimate a classifier that is jointly accurate and fast (such as the Viola & Jones detector), we first build a classifier that is proven to have optimal generalization capabilities; the focus then becomes runtime efficiency while maintaining the classifier\u2019s optimal accuracy. We apply our algorithm to the problem of face detection in images but it can also be used for other image based classifications. We show that our algorithm provides, for a comparable accuracy, a 15 fold speed-up over the Reduced Support Vector Machine and a 530 fold speed-up over the Support Vector Machine, enabling face detection at 25 fps on a standard PC.", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/11550518_44", "venue": "ICPR (2)", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2117301133", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14596050", "54180861", "16806403", "2210332", "15549330", "16414651", "5736057", "32252138", "1494765", "1952800", "40120983", "118018203", "28637672", "2715202"], "inbound_citations": ["280156", "11274310", "8524593", "210125236", "1387159", "15123753", "3668879"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6609992"}

Complete response after chemoradiation is an accurate surrogate for long-term local control. Predicting complete response from pre-treatment features could represent a major step towards conservative treatment. Patients with a T2-4 N0-1 rectal adenocarcinoma treated between June 2010 and October 2016 with neo-adjuvant chemoradiation from three academic institutions were included. All clinical and treatment data was integrated in our clinical data warehouse, from which we extracted the features. Radiomics features were extracted from the tumor volume from the treatment planning CT Scan. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) was created to predict complete response, as a methodological proof-of-principle. The results were compared to a baseline Linear Regression model using only the TNM stage as a predictor and a second model created with Support Vector Machine on the same features used in the DNN. Ninety-five patients were included in the final analysis. There were 49 males (52%) and 46 females (48%). Median tumour size was 48 mm (15\u2013130). Twenty-two patients (23%) had pathologic complete response after chemoradiation. One thousand six hundred eighty-three radiomics features were extracted. The DNN predicted complete response with an 80% accuracy, which was better than the Linear Regression model (69.5%) and the SVM model (71.58%). Our model correctly predicted complete response after neo-adjuvant rectal chemoradiotherapy in 80% of the patients of this multicenter cohort.

The proposed method formulates the label propagation process as a graph-based theoretical framework, where each voxel in the input image is linked to each candidate voxel in each atlas image by an edge in the graph. The weight of the edge is estimated based on a sparse representation framework to identify a limited number of candidate voxles whose local image patches can best represent the local image patch of each voxel in the input image. The group sparsity constraint to capture the dependency among candidate voxels with the same anatomical label is also enforced. It is shown that based on the edge weight estimated by the proposed method, the anatomical label for each voxel in the input image can be estimated more accurately by the label propagation process. Moreover, we extend our group sparsity constrained patch based label propagation framework to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to capture the nonlinear similarity of patches among different voxels and construct the sparse representation in high dimensional feature space. The proposed method was evaluated on the NA0-NIREP database for automatic human brain anatomical labeling. It was also compared with several state-of-the-art multi-atlas based brain labeling algorithms.

In this study, we propose a novel ELM ensemble classifier, namely b-ELM, which leverages the Bag of Little Bootstraps technique to obtain a scalable, efficient means of classification for large-scale data. Efficiency of classification is achieved as it only requires repeated training under consideration on quantities of data that can be much smaller than the original training data.
