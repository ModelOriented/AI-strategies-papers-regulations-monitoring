During the last decade, support vector machines (SVM) have been widely used for approximation problems, including function and signal interpolation. However, the signal structure has not always been taken into account in SVM interpolation. We propose the statement of two novel SVM algorithms for signal interpolation, specifically, the primal and the dual signal model based algorithms. Shift-invariant Mercer's kernels are used as building blocks, according to the requirement of bandlimited signal. The sine kernel, which has received little attention in the SVM literature, is used for bandlimited reconstruction. Well-known properties of general SVM algorithms (sparseness of the solution, robustness, and regularization) are explored with simulation examples, yielding improved results with respect to standard algorithms, and revealing good characteristics in nonuniform interpolation of noisy signals.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSP.2007.896029", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2086297653", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["37036141", "28664282", "10657756", "9850975", "945955", "58859807", "11657280", "110047714", "32789555", "119985772", "122392734", "109553763", "7506256", "634992", "110743046", "122608011", "12960671", "59740146", "7138354", "116858", "6131560", "42804456", "198189892", "125131653", "1089429", "8018871", "580307", "5543127", "966610", "118594642"], "inbound_citations": ["3494968", "5532549", "9991481", "18960566", "3074666", "46832438", "62807231", "45011384", "11637290", "15763673", "215413739", "14227919", "195224575", "20405978", "17715817", "46060593", "7569182", "58011527", "16566689", "40872374", "21799628", "21799628"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18985587"}

Then, an ensemble of hybrid intelligent models that is useful for condition monitoring of induction motors is proposed. The review covers two parts, i.e., (i) a total of nine commonly used condition monitoring methods of induction motors; and (ii) intelligent learning models for condition monitoring of induction motors subject to single and multiple input signals. Based on the review findings, the Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) method is selected for this study owing to its online, non-invasive properties and its requirement of only single input source; therefore leading to a cost-effective condition monitoring method. A hybrid intelligent model that consists of the Fuzzy Min\u2013Max (FMM) neural network and the Random Forest (RF) model comprising an ensemble of Classification and Regression Trees is developed. The majority voting scheme is used to combine the predictions produced by the resulting FMM\u2013RF ensemble (or FMM\u2013RFE) members. A benchmark problem is first deployed to evaluate the usefulness of the FMM\u2013RFE model. Then, the model is applied to condition monitoring of induction motors using a set of real data samples. Specifically, the stator current signals of induction motors are obtained using the MCSA method. The signals are processed to produce a set of harmonic-based features for classification using the FMM\u2013RFE model. The experimental results show good performances in both noise-free and noisy environments. More importantly, a set of explanatory rules in the form of a decision tree can be extracted from the FMM\u2013RFE model to justify its predictions. The outcomes ascertain the effectiveness of the proposed FMM\u2013RFE model in undertaking condition monitoring tasks, especially for induction motors, under different environments.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2014.02.028", "venue": "Expert Syst.

We represent each KEGG pathway as an undirected graph. For each patient the vertex labels are assigned based on her altered genes. Smoothed shortest path graph kernel (smSPK) evaluates each pair of patients by comparing their vertex labeled pathway graphs. Our clustering procedure involves two steps: the smSPK kernel matrix derived for each pathway are input to kernel k-means algorithm and each pathway is evaluated individually. In the next step, only those pathways that are successful are combined in to a single kernel input to kernel k-means to stratify patients. Evaluating the procedure on simulated data showed that smSPK clusters patients up to 88\\% accuracy. Finally to identify ovarian cancer patient subgroups, we apply our methodology to the cancer genome atlas ovarian data that involves 481 patients.

The system works as follows: in a first stage a classifier examines each location in the image at different scales. Then in a second stage the system tries to eliminate false detections based on heuristics. The classifier is based on the idea that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can compress optimally only the kind of images that were used to compute the principal components (PCs), and that any other kind of images will not be compressed well using a few components. Thus the classifier performs separately the PCA from the positive examples and from the negative examples; when it needs to classify a new pattern it projects it into both sets of PCs and compares the reconstructions, assigning the example to the class with the smallest reconstruction error. The system is able to detect frontal and rear views of pedestrians, and usually can also detect side views of pedestrians despite not being trained for this task. Comparisons with other pedestrian detection systems show that our system has better performance in positive detection and in false detection rate.

An example is X-ray imagers, which have been scaling both in dimension and number of sensors, today reaching millions of pixels. However, processing of the sensor data requires interfacing thousands of signals to CMOS ICs, because implementation of complex functions in LAE has proven unviable due to the low electrical performance and inherent variability of the active devices available, namely amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin-film transistors (TFTs) on glass. Envisioning applications that perform sensing on even greater scales, this work presents an approach whereby high-quality image detection is performed directly in the LAE domain using TFTs. The high variability and number of process defects affecting both the TFTs and sensors are overcome using a machine-learning algorithm known as Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) [1] to form an embedded classifier. Through AdaBoost, we show that high-dimensional sensor data can be reduced to a small number of weak-classifier decisions, which can then be combined in the CMOS domain to generate a strong-classifier decision.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063041", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1980012398", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7110766", "44243862", "18495494", "2002861", "60726528", "12085681", "37923924", "2304887", "6644398", "13982799", "18085632", "45344928", "16745974", "379259", "119890648"], "inbound_citations": ["20424655", "13467881", "53400737", "51978589", "13708817", "40336630", "44202353", "19412018", "57190489", "44959155", "24426408", "29041763", "51949803", "35035707", "35035707", "9043768", "6261644", "12085681", "67763266", "24122162", "22177686"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12085681"}

Over the past decades, there has been a very active research in the development of Raman spectroscopy techniques for oncological applications and large scale clinical diagnosis. A major issue that has received a lot of attention in the Raman literature is the fact that variations in instrumental responses and intrinsic spectral backgrounds over different days of measurements or devices creates strong inconsistency of Raman intensity spectra over the various experimental condition, thus making the use of Raman spectroscopy on a large scale and reproductive basis difficult. We explore different methods to tackle this inconsistency and show that regular preprocessing methods such as baseline correction, normalization or wavelet transformation are inefficient on our datasets. We find that subtracting the mean background spectrum estimated by identifying non-cell regions in Raman images makes the data more consistent. As a proof of concept, we employ our single-cell Raman Imaging protocol to diagnosis challenging follicular lesions, that is known to be particularly difficult due to the lack of obvious morphological and cytological criteria for malignancy. We explore dimensionality reduction with both PCA and feature selection methods, and classification is then performed at the single cell level with standard classifiers such as k Nearest Neighbors or Random Forest. We investigate Raman hyperspectral images from FTC133, RO82W-1 and NthyOri 3-1 cell lines and show that the chemical information for the diagnosis is mostly contained in the cytoplasm.

We name this framework Facial Expression Spatial Charts (FESCs). The FESCs are created using Self\u2013 Organizing Maps (SOMs) and Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) of unsupervised neural networks. For facial images with emphasized sparse representations using Gabor wavelet filters, SOMs extract topological information in facial expression images and classify them as categories in the fixed space that are decided by the number of units on the mapping layer. Subsequently, Fuzzy ART integrates categories classified by SOMs using adaptive learning functions under fixed granularity that is controlled by the vigilance parameter. The categories integrated by Fuzzy ART are matched to Expression Levels (ELs) for quantifying facial expression intensity based on the arrangement of facial expressions on Russell\u2019s circumplex model. We designate the category that contains neutral facial expression as the basis category. Actually, FESCs can visualize and represent dynamic diversity of facial expressions consisting of ELs extracted from facial expressions.

This thesis aims to develop the simple and effective imbalanced classification algorithms by previously improving the algorithms performance of general classifiers i.e. Kernel Logistic Regression Newton-Raphson (KLR-NR) and Regularized Logistic Regression NR (RLR-NR) which are Logistic Regression (LR)based methods. Both LR-based methods have strong statistical foundation and well known classifiers which have simple solution of unconstrained optimization problem in performing the good performance as well as Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is determined as state-of-the art classifier in Kernel methodology and Data Mining community. However, the imbalanced LR-based methods are not extensively developed such as imbalanced SVM-based methods. Hence, it is required to develop effective imbalanced LR-based methods to be widely used in data mining applications. Numerical results have showed that the use of Truncated Newton method for KLR-NR and RLR-NR which respectively resulted in Newton Truncated Regularized KLR (NTR-KLR) and NTR RLR (NTR-LR), is effective in handling the numerical problems on the huge matrix of linear system of Newton-Raphson update rule i.e. the training time and the singularity problem. These results can be seen as further explanation on the success of Truncated Newton method in TR-KLR and TR Iteratively Re-weighted Least Square (TR-IRLS) algorithm respectively, because of the equivalence of iterative method used by these algorithms. Moreover, only with the use of simple solution of unconstrained optimization problem, numerical results have demonstrated that proposed NTR-KLR and proposed NTR-LR respectively have comparable classification performance with RBFSVM (SVM with Radial Basis Function Kernel). The imbalanced problem of both proposed general classification algorithms which is the limitation of accuracy performance specifically in classifying on the minority class has motivated this research to improve their classification performance on imbalanced data sets. In general, numerical results have showed that the use of adapted Modified AdaBoost methods for NTR-KLR and NTR-LR which respectively resulted in AdaBoost NTR Weighted KLR (AB-WKLR) and AB NTR Weighted RLR (AB-WLR) is significantly successful in improving the accuracy and stability performance of general classifiers i.e. NTR-KLR and NTR-LR respectively. The improvements on both error by g-means and standard deviation of g-means with 5-Fold SCV could be achieved as high as more than 60. Furthermore, numerical results have demonstrated that proposed AB-WKLR and proposed AB-WLR respectively have comparable performances with AdaBoostSVM in classifying imbalanced data sets, only with the use of simple solution of unconstrained weighted optimization problem. Thus, both proposed imbalanced LR-based methods is simple and effective for classification of imbalanced data sets and have promising results.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "161001089", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117724839"}

Quantifying and validating descriptive heuristic rules that govern someone's skills and expertise have been a known philosophical quest since the early Greek philosophers. Inherent to sport coaching is the qualitative assessment of complex human motion patterns, relying on subjective and 'hard-to-quantify' criteria that can be subject to experts/coaches disagreement. This paper presents an application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for the discovery of predictive power of swing plane heuristic rules influencing golf ball trajectories. The golf data set (531 samples from 14 golfers) utilised in the experiments was captured via a ubiquitous computing device embedded in the handle of a driver club. Out of multiple swing performance factors influencing ball trajectory, the selected subset of features for subspace modelling was linked only to the swing plane concept. Quantitative evidence supporting empirical coaching rules for swing plane assessment were obtained by supervised learning of ANN models.

This paper proposes a support vector machine (SVM) method to estimate subsurface temperature anomaly (STA) in the Indian Ocean from a suite of satellite remote sensing measurements including sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), and sea surface salinity anomaly (SSSA). The SVM estimation of STA features the inclusion of in-situ Argo STA data for training and testing. SVM, one of the most popular machine learning methods, can well estimate the STA in the upper 1000 m of the Indian Ocean from satellite measurements of sea surface parameters (SSTA, SSHA and SSSA as input attributes for SVM). The results, based on the common SVM application of Support Vector Regression (SVR), were validated for accuracy and reliability using the Argo STA data.

High density maps of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP's) as well as massive genotype data with large number of individuals and number of SNP's become publicly available. By now most analysis of the new data is undertaken by the statistics community. In this dissertation, we pursue a different line of attack on genetic susceptibility to complex disease that adheres to the computer science community with an emphasis on design rather than analytical methodology. ::: The main goal of disease association analysis is to identify gene variations contributing to the risk of and/or susceptibility to a particular disease. There are basically two main steps in susceptibility: (i) haplotyping of the population and (ii) predicting the genetic susceptibility to diseases. Although there exist many phasing methods for step (i), phasing and missing data recovery for data representing family trios is lagging behind, and most disease association studies are based on family trios. This study is devoted to the problem of assessing accumulated information targeting to predict genotype susceptibility to complex diseases with significantly high accuracy and statistical power. The dissertation proposes two new greedy and integer linear programming based solution methods for step (i). We also proposed several universal and ad hoc methods for step (ii). ::: The quality of susceptibility prediction algorithm has been assessed using leave-one-out and leave-many-out tests and shown to be statistically significant based on randomization tests. The prediction of disease status can also be viewed as an integrated risk factor. A combinatorial prediction complexity measure has been proposed for case/control studies.

The low-level feature task was to retrieve the shots in which one of the following camera motion events was present: pan, tilt and zoom. An unsupervised approach to detect shot boundaries, aimed at minimizing the impact of parameter settings, is presented (4). Frame dissimilarities are measured by motion compensated pixel differences of subsequent DC-frames and histogram intersection of DC-frames for several frame distances. A feature vector consists of the dissimilarity value and its ratio to the maximum neighbor value within a sliding window. K-means clustering is used for both cut detection and gradual transition detection. For cut detection, the best sliding window size is estimated by evaluating the clustering quality of the \"cuts\" cluster for several window sizes. Furthermore, we investigate whether an ensemble of classifiers improves the cut detection performance. For this purpose, the unsupervised learning approach is extended by two classifiers: an Adaboost-based classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). These classifiers were trained on the TRECVID 2004 shot boundary test set. To retrieve shots with camera motion events, we have modified a previously presented approach to camera motion (5). MPEG motion vectors are utilized to estimate the rotation and zoom parameters in a 3D-camera model.

Instead of counting the number of 1's in ELBP, we use the 8-bit code of the thresholded data as per the ELBP rule, and then binarize the image with a predefined threshold value, removing the small connections on the binarized image. The proposed system is currently trained with several people's face images obtained from video sequences captured by a surveillance camera. One test set contains the disjoint images of the trained people's faces to test the accuracy and the second test set contains the images of non-trained people's faces to test the percentage of the false positives. The recognition rate among 570 images of 9 trained faces is around 94%, and the false positive rate with 2600 images of 34 non-trained faces is around 1%.

We recorded tri-axial acceleration at 50Hz for each species for a full day while two fixed cameras recorded their behaviours.

We achieved a global accuracy of 81.30% for the adult turtle CART model and 71.63% for the juvenile loggerhead, identifying 10 and 12 different behaviours, respectively. Equivalent figures were 86.96% for the hawksbill and green turtle Random Forest model and 79.49% for the loggerhead, for the same behaviours.

While recent work on domain adaptation focuses on adapting a single hand-crafted feature, it is important to perform adaptation of a hierarchy of features to exploit the richness of visual data. We propose a novel framework for domain adaptation using a sparse and hierarchical network (DASH-N). Our method jointly learns a hierarchy of features together with transformations that rectify the mismatch between different domains. The building block of DASH-N is the latent sparse representation.

Those molecules are often involved in causing or treating pathological states. Automatically identifying such molecules in biomedical text is difficult due to both, the diverse morphology of chemical names and the alternative types of nomenclature that are simultaneously used to describe them. To address these issues, the last BioCreAtIvE challenge proposed a CHEMDNER task, which is a Named Entity Recognition (NER) challenge that aims at labelling different types of chemical names in biomedical text. To address this challenge we tested various approaches to recognizing chemical entities in biomedical documents. These approaches range from linear Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to a combination of CRFs with regular expression and dictionary matching, followed by a post-processing step to tag those chemical names in a corpus of Medline abstracts. We named our best performing systems CheNER. We evaluate the performance of the various approaches using the F-score statistics. Higher F-scores indicate better performance. The highest F-score we obtain in identifying unique chemical entities is 72.88%. The highest F-score we obtain in identifying all chemical entities is 73.07%. We also evaluate the F-Score of combining our system with ChemSpot, and find an increase from 72.88% to 73.83%. CheNER presents a valid alternative for automated annotation of chemical entities in biomedical documents. In addition, CheNER may be used to derive new features to train newer methods for tagging chemical entities.

Although typically investigated in primates, recent work has shown that rats can be trained in a variety of visual object and shape recognition tasks. These studies did not pinpoint the complexity of the features used by these animals. Many tasks might be solved by using a combination of relatively simple features which tend to be correlated. Alternatively, rats might extract complex features or feature combinations which are nonlinear with respect to those simple features. In the present study, we address this question by starting from a small stimulus set for which one stimulus-response mapping involves a simple linear feature to solve the task while another mapping needs a well-defined nonlinear combination of simpler features related to shape symmetry. We verified computationally that the nonlinear task cannot be trivially solved by a simple V1-model. We show how rats are able to solve the linear feature task but are unable to acquire the nonlinear feature. In contrast, humans are able to use the nonlinear feature and are even faster in uncovering this solution as compared to the linear feature.

Current label propagation algorithms cannot consistently yield satisfactory performance due to two reasons: one is the instability of single propagation method in dealing with various practical data, and the other one is the improper propagation sequence ignoring the labeling difficulties of different examples. To remedy above defects, this paper proposes a novel propagation algorithm called hybrid diffusion under ensemble teaching (HyDEnT). Specifically, HyDEnT integrates multiple propagation methods as base learners to fully exploit their individual wisdom, which helps HyDEnT to be stable and obtain consistent encouraging results. More importantly, HyDEnT conducts propagation under the guidance of an ensemble of teachers. That is to say, in every propagation round the simplest curriculum examples are wisely designated by a teaching algorithm, so that their labels can be reliably and accurately decided by the learners. To optimally choose these simplest examples, every teacher in the ensemble should comprehensively consider the examples' difficulties from its own viewpoint, as well as the common knowledge shared by all the teachers. This is accomplished by a designed optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved via the block coordinate descent method.

The $k$ nearest neighbor ( $k \\text{NN}$ ) algorithm is one of the most popular frameworks for handling multi-output problems. The performance of $k \\text{NN}$ depends crucially on the metric used to compute the distance between different instances. However, our experiment results show that the existing advanced metric learning technique cannot provide an appropriate distance metric for multi-output tasks. This paper systematically studies how to efficiently learn an appropriate distance metric for multi-output problems with provable guarantee. In particular, we present a novel large margin metric learning paradigm for multi-output tasks, which projects both the input and output into the same embedding space and then learns a distance metric to discover output dependency such that instances with very different multiple outputs will be moved far away.

In this work, we apply a multi-source feature data approach to investigate the urban area of Istanbul, Turkey which is a megacity with an approximate 15 million inhabitant, and under strong both anthropogenic and natural pressures. In order to analyse and compare the spatial pattern of the urban footprint, different techniques are applied. Speckle divergence, backscatter and repeat pass interferometric coherence values are considered for the analysis. To this aim, L-band HH and HV polarized ALOS-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were acquired from Japan Space Exploration Agency's (JAXA). Pixel based Random Forest Classification method was used for the urban mapping. During the classification, different scenarios have been applied using speckle divergence, backscatter and coherence information. Overall, user and producer accuracies were calculated from the error matrix. While comparing HH and HV polarimetry, in each scenario HH provided much higher accuracies than HV results. Speckle divergence and backscatter values yielded similar accuracies which is around 88% for urban class. However, coherence gave approximately 69% while it is classified individually. The contribution of coherence was extracted while coherence was stacked with speckle divergence, and the result was improved to 91%. The urban areas was extracted with a maximum accuracy of maximum 93% while all information was combined.

Chromatin structure is the degree of chromatin compaction at genomic loci. Chromatin organization is the spatial, three-dimensional (3D) positioning of chromatin. Here, we adapt and apply methods for next-generation sequencing analyses of chromatin structure and organization based on chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), respectively. First, we built on a previous study that sought to classify nucleosomes containing either H2A.Z or H2A/H4 arginine 3 symmetric dimethylation (H2A/H4R3me2s) from human ChIP-seq data. We hypothesized that appropriate data preprocessing \u2013 deduplication, normalization for sequencing depth, and position-finding \u2013 in conjunction with advanced algorithms for feature selection (Discriminatory Motif Feature Selection) and classification (Random Forest) would improve performance. We achieved dramatically improved classification accuracy and identified a significant and biologically meaningful DNA motif associated with H2A/H4R3me2s: \u201cTCCATT\u201d, which is part of the consensus sequence of satellite II and III DNA. Second, we tested our hypothesis that there are advantages to assessing the 3D co-localization of functional annotations (e.g., centromeres) using 3D genome reconstructions from Hi-C contact data because they enable detection of multi-level interactions (assessments using contact data are inherently limited to detecting strictly pairwise interactions). We found significant 3D co-localization of sets of genes with developmentally regulated expression in Plasmodium falciparum with 3D reconstruction-based assessment but not with contact-based assessment. Further, we developed a method for 3D reconstruction-based assessment that avoids the data dichotomization of previous approaches. Third, we tested our hypothesis that analyzing ChIP-seq data in combination with 3D reconstructions could identify functional 3D hotspots. We separately overlaid a Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3D genome reconstruction with three ChIP-seq inputs and contrasted two algorithms for identifying regions in 3-space \u2014 3D hotspots \u2013 for which mean ChIP-seq peak height is significantly elevated: k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) regression and the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM). For each ChIP-seq input, both algorithms identified significant, corresponding and biologically meaningful 3D hotspots containing distal genomic regions.

The associated elevation in intra ocular pressure leads to progressive degeneration of the optic nerve and resultant structural changes with functional failure of the visual field. Since, glaucoma is asymptomatic in the early stages and the associated vision loss is irreparable, its early detection and timely medical treatment is essential to prevent further visual damage. ::: Objective: This paper presents a novel method for glaucoma detection using digital fundus image and optical coherence tomography (OCT) image. ::: Method: The first section focuses on the features such as cup to disc ratio (CDR) and the inferior superior nasal temporal (ISNT) ratio which were obtained from fundus images.The above features were used for classifying the normal and glaucoma condition using back propagation neural network (BPN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. In the second part of the article, features such as CDR and two novel features, cup depth and retinal thickness were obtained from the OCT image.

For instance, retrieval of the records belonging to all patients with a particular outcome is often accomplished with naive methods such as exact word matching. A more advanced alternative is to employ methods of Machine Learning (ML) for text classification. Rather than requiring a set of rules, an ML-model extracts these rules by itself given sufficient example records with known annotations. Objectives To build a reliable classifier with machine learning techniques that can identify Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) cases in provided EMR entries. Methods Data was acquired from the HiX-EMR database consisting of 2,771 patients that visited the rheumatology outpatient clinic of the Leiden University Medical Centre between 2007 and 2018. This database featured a total of 38,216 entries. The first visit entry (if available) was selected per patient for annotation, resulting in a total of 1,361 entries. The annotated sample was then randomly split into an equally sized training and test set. Both sets were preprocessed and then classified with the following methods: Exact word-matching, Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting (GB), Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines (SVM), see table 1 for more information. Classification of the naive word-matching model was based on the presence of the Dutch RA-defining terms \u2018Reumatoide Artritis\u2019 and \u2018RA\u2019. Default Scikit-learn implementations [1] were used to create the ML-models. Finally, the performance of the models was evaluated with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis via the pROC R-package [2]. The Delong test was used to assess the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and to determine the difference in performance between the word-matching method and the ML-models. Results The exact word-matching approach resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.76 (CI: 0.7265-0.7783), see figure. Likewise, the ML-models resulted in relatively high AUC-scores (CI) as well: NB =0.83 (0.80-0.86), SVM=0.91 (0.89-0.93), Neural Networks=0.92 (0.90-0.94) and the GB-method with a 0.94 (0.92-0.96). The Decision Tree showed the worst performance with an AUC-ROC of only 0.51 (0.49-0.56). In comparison to the exact word-matching ROC-curve, all the ML-models showed a significant difference: Decision Tree (p Conclusion The Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, SVM and Naive Bayes models all showcased a significantly better performance than a naive exact word matching, which establishes these ML-methods as an efficient approach for data extraction from EMR.

PMUs enable a much higher data sampling rate and provide synchronized measurements of real-time phasors of voltages and currents. Depth First (DF) algorithm is used for optimally placing the PMUs. To make the ELM approach applicable for a large scale power system problem, Mutual information (MI)-based feature selection is proposed to achieve the dimensionality reduction.

One strategy to tackle this problem is to intelligently adapt the trained model from one domain with labeled data to another domain with only unlabeled data. This strategy is known as domain adaptation. However, there are two major limitations of the existing domain adaptation approaches. The first limitation is that they all separate the domain adaptation framework into two separate steps. The first step attempts to minimize the domain gap, and then the second step is to train the predictive model based on the reweighted instances or transformed feature representation. However, such a transformed representation may encode less information affecting the predictive performance. The second limitation is that they are restricted to using the first-order statistics in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to measure the distribution difference between the source domain and the target domain. In this thesis, we focus on developing solutions for those two limitations hindering the progress of domain adaptation techniques. ::: We develop a novel model to learn a low-rank shared concept space with respect to two criteria simultaneously: the empirical loss in the source domain, and the embedded distribution gap between the source domain and the target domain. Besides, we can transfer the predictive power from the extracted common features to the characteristic features in the target domain by the feature graph Laplacian. Moreover, we can kernelize our proposed method in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) so as to generalize our model by making use of the powerful kernel functions. We theoretically analyze the expected error evaluated by common convex loss functions in the target domain under the empirical risk minimization framework, showing that the error bound can be controlled by the expected loss in the source domain, and the embedded distribution gap. ::: Then we propose an improved symmetric Stein's loss (SSL) function which combines the mean and covariance discrepancy into a unified Bregman matrix divergence of which Jensen-Shannon divergence between normal distributions is a particular case. Based on our proposed distribution gap measure based on second-order statistics, we present another new domain adaptation method called Location and Scatter Matching. The target is to find a good feature representation which can reduce the embedded distribution gap measured by SSL between the source domain and the target domain, at the same time, ensure the new derived representation can encode sufficient discriminants with respect to the label information. Then a standard machine learning algorithm, such as Support Vector Machine (SYM), can be adapted to train classifiers in the new feature subspace across domains. ::: We conduct a series of experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the performance of our proposed approaches comparing with other competitive methods.

The proposed attention learning module estimates the domain specific cross-modal, fine-grained regional feature correspondence, conditioned on the classification categories, by evaluating mode relevance scores in a data-driven manner.

The bending moments generated by the piezoelectric actuator actuators are used for deflection control, i.e., to minimize the deflection. The plate-like structure is subjected to an arbitrary load which lies in an uncertainty domain with regard to its magnitude and direction. The uncertain loading studied in the present paper involves a load of unknown magnitude and direction, which should be determined to produce the arbitrary deflection. Two optimization variables are considered for each piezoelectric actuator/sensor device: the location of its center and its orientation. An optimal control algorithm and three types of artificial intelligence algorithms (AISOOL algorithm--Artificial Immune Systems for optimization of orientations and locations of actuators, ACOPSOOOL algorithm--ACO and PSO for optimization of orientations and locations of actuators, HTOOL algorithm--Hop field-Tank for optimization of orientations and locations of actuators, optimal control algorithm) are presented for the determination of the orientation and location of piezoelectric actuators/sensors in the application to shape control of plate-like structures. Numerical results show that simultaneous optimization of both orientations and locations can lead to optimum configurations that consume less electrical energy and minimizing the deflection.

An EEG data processing pipeline and a machine learning mental state detection algorithm using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method were designed and compared with k-Nearest Neighbor and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy System methods. To collect 25 h of EEG data from 5 participants, a classic EEG headset was modified. We found that the changes in EEG activity in frontal and parietal lobes occurring at 1\u20135 Hz and 10\u201315 Hz frequency bands were associated with the changes in individuals\u2019 attention state. We demonstrated the ability to use such changes to identify individuals\u2019 attention state with 96.70% (best) and 91.72% (avg.) accuracy in experimental settings using a version of continuous performance task with SVM-based mental state detector.

Commonly, the process of implementing a damage identification strategy for aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering infrastructure is referred to as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). The development of smart sensors and real-time communication technologies via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) has empowered the advancement in SHM. Recently, statistical time series models have been widely used for structural damage detection due to the sensitivity of the model coefficients and residual errors to the damages in the structure. Increasingly Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for damage detection tasks. This research sheds light on the methodologies to predict the structural damage on concrete structures with the help of sensor technology by effectively combining data science and ML strategies. Experimental test results publicly available are used, where the tests have been performed with varying stiffness and mass conditions with the assumption that these sources of variability are representative of changing operational and environmental conditions in addition to changes caused by damage. To enhance the accuracy of damage detection, instead of the traditional time series analysis, ML is used for learning from prior experience. To detect the existence and location of the damage in the structure, we use supervised learning, and for measuring the severity of the damage, unsupervised learning is used. Accuracy results are obtained with three well-known ML algorithms (KNN- k Nearest Neighbour, SVM-support vector machine and RFC random forest classifier). In this study, the Random Forest Classifier algorithm generated good predictions on damaged and undamaged conditions with good accuracy, when compared to the KNN algorithm and Support Vector Machine algorithm under the supervised mode of machine learning. The utilisation of sensor technology effectively combined with aspects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as Machine Learning has the potential to implement a more efficient SHM system.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-13-8331-1_1", "venue": "Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Damage Assessment of Structures", "journal": "Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Damage Assessment of Structures", "mag_id": "2954225798", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208974849"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198357603"}

This study presents a framework of multitask learning deep neural networks (MTLDNNs) for this question, and demonstrates that MTLDNNs are more generic than the traditional nested logit (NL) method, due to its capacity of automatic feature learning and soft constraints. About 1,500 MTLDNN models are designed and applied to the survey data that was collected in Singapore and focused on the RP of four current travel modes and the SP with autonomous vehicles (AV) as the one new travel mode in addition to those in RP. We found that MTLDNNs consistently outperform six benchmark models and particularly the classical NL models by about 5% prediction accuracy in both RP and SP datasets. This performance improvement can be mainly attributed to the soft constraints specific to MTLDNNs, including its innovative architectural design and regularization methods, but not much to the generic capacity of automatic feature learning endowed by a standard feedforward DNN architecture. Besides prediction, MTLDNNs are also interpretable. The empirical results show that AV is mainly the substitute of driving and AV alternative-specific variables are more important than the socio-economic variables in determining AV adoption. Overall, this study introduces a new MTLDNN framework to combine RP and SP, and demonstrates its theoretical flexibility and empirical power for prediction and interpretation. Future studies can design new MTLDNN architectures to reflect the speciality of RP and SP and extend this work to other behavioral analysis.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1901.00227", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2906830530", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["154049925", "158551926", "18100525", "5996904", "125472478", "110445539", "152623212", "157762168", "8577357", "10175374", "127253102", "153853840", "53067695", "2757547", "109827319", "85530475", "54615532", "11758569", "8217340", "16285624", "8306765", "113397476", "207763512", "12713052", "12227989", "11688126", "15700257", "740063"], "inbound_citations": ["211011292", "209444621"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57373836"}

In this work, we present the use of two Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) techniques to construct rules for extracting instances of various named entity classes thereby reducing the efforts of a linguist/developer. Using ILP for rule development not only reduces the amount of effort required but also provides an interactive framework wherein a linguist can incorporate his intuition about named entities such as in form of mode declarations for refinements (suitably exposed for ease of use by the linguist) and the background knowledge (in the form of linguistic resources). We have a small amount of tagged data - approximately 3884 sentences for Marathi and 22748 sentences in Hindi. The paucity of tagged data for Indian languages makes manual development of rules more challenging, However, the ability to fold in background knowledge and domain expertise in ILP techniques comes to our rescue and we have been able to develop rules that are mostly linguistically sound that yield results comparable to rules handcrafted by linguists. The ILP approach has two advantages over the approach of hand-crafting all rules: (i) the development time reduces by a factor of 240 when ILP is used instead of involving a linguist for the entire rule development and (ii) the ILP technique has the computational edge that it has a complete and consistent view of all significant patterns in the data at the level of abstraction specified through the mode declarations. The point (ii) enables the discovery of rules that could be missed by the linguist and also makes it possible to scale the rule development to a larger training dataset. The rules thus developed could be optionally edited by linguistic experts and consolidated either (a) through default ordering (as in TILDE[1]) or (b) with an ordering induced using [2] or (c) by using the rules as features in a statistical graphical model such a conditional random field (CRF) [3].

Among the three extraction methods, GMI, UMI, and ZMI methods, the latter two methods tend to provide better results by about 7\u20138% than the GMI method. Generally, when the features are combined, the results improve rather significant, about 7\u20138% improvement. Only the pair of GMI and UMI combination provide small or negligible improvement. Using the RBF kernel, GMI features alone result in 63% accuracy, UMI features alone 70% accuracy, and GMI-UMI combination result in 72% accuracy. Combination of UMI-ZMI features improve the accuracy significantly than each method along.

Different from the common understanding and tenet that hidden neurons of neural networks need to be iteratively adjusted during training stage, ELM theories show that hidden neurons are important but need not be iteratively tuned. In fact, all the parameters of hidden nodes can be independent of training samples and randomly generated according to any continuous probability distribution. And the obtained ELM networks satisfy universal approximation and classification capability. The fully connected ELM architecture has been extensively studied. However, ELM with local connections has not attracted much research attention yet. This paper studies the general architecture of locally connected ELM, showing that: 1) ELM theories are naturally valid for local connections, thus introducing local receptive fields to the input layer; 2) each hidden node in ELM can be a combination of several hidden nodes (a subnetwork), which is also consistent with ELM theories. ELM theories may shed a light on the research of different local receptive fields including true biological receptive fields of which the exact shapes and formula may be unknown to human beings. As a specific example of such general architectures, random convolutional nodes and a pooling structure are implemented in this paper.

Everyone understands what is meant by Incremental Learning (IL): learning the times tables, the kings and queens of England, foreign languages, or the structure of the solar system. Most of the national curriculum or university programmes exemplify IL - a process of learning about what you don't know by relating it to what you already do know. IL is gradual, logical and predictable. Transformational Learning (TL) is different. Obvious examples include learning to swim, falling in love, or the idea of evolution. TL is characteristically shocking, literally transforming our experience of the world - and of ourselves. TL occurs to us like a breakthrough into a new possibility for life. It opens our eyes to things we didn't know we didn't know. Of course, behind the gradual accumulation of detail which characterizes IL, there always lies a moment of TL - the excitement of discovering the possibility of multiplication, or the very concept of monarchy, or linguistic variety, or a heliocentric universe. TL is thrilling - and dangerous: Galileo's insistence that the earth goes round the sun nearly cost him his life. Learning to read is a paradigm example of TL. The moment when one grasps the \"triangle of meaning\" (symbol - sound - sense) is magical. The recognition of the equivalence between the sign \"2\", the sound /tu:/, and the idea of duality opens the door to a new world of literacy. (Incidentally, I think children find this easiest to do if they start with reading numbers, as in the example.) Once they have grasped this triangular relationship by means of TL, IL enables them to develop basic literacy into the advanced reading skills demanded by modern life and educational targets. I wonder why we don't make more of the distinction between these two kinds of learning - teach it to teachers and trainers, explain it to children and adult learners, research it in the universities? Successful learning requires both IL and TL. A knowledge-based curriculum of the sort designed to meet the needs of the 19th and 20th centuries can largely be acquired by IL. But the curriculum of the 21st century needs to give greater weight to skills and attitudes than its predecessors did, and TL is essential for the acquisition of good skills and attitudes.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2260031600", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["147389961"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:147678664"}

Automatic building detection from High Spatial Resolution (HSR) images is one of the most important issues in Remote Sensing (RS). Due to the limited number of spectral bands in HSR images, using other features will lead to improve accuracy. By adding these features, the presence probability of dependent features will be increased, which leads to accuracy reduction. In addition, some parameters should be determined in Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. Therefore, it is necessary to simultaneously determine classification parameters and select independent features according to image type. Optimization algorithm is an efficient method to solve this problem. On the other hand, pixel-based classification faces several challenges such as producing salt-paper results and high computational time in high dimensional data. Hence, in this paper, a novel method is proposed to optimize object-based SVM classification by applying continuous Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. The advantages of the proposed method are relatively high automation level, independency of image scene and type, post processing reduction for building edge reconstruction and accuracy improvement. The proposed method was evaluated by pixel-based SVM and Random Forest (RF) classification in terms of accuracy. In comparison with optimized pixel-based SVM classification, the results showed that the proposed method improved quality factor and overall accuracy by 17% and 10%, respectively. Also, in the proposed method, Kappa coefficient was improved by 6% rather than RF classification. Time processing of the proposed method was relatively low because of unit of image analysis (image object).

Here, our primary objective was to evaluate the potential of spontaneous sputum as a source of non-invasive metabolomic biomarkers for LC status. ::: ::: ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS ::: Spontaneous sputum was collected and processed from 34 patients with suspected LC, alongside 33 healthy controls. Of the 34 patients, 23 were subsequently diagnosed with LC (LC(+), 16 NSCLC, six SCLC, and one radiological diagnosis), at various stages of disease progression. The 67 samples were analysed using flow infusion electrospray ion mass spectrometry (FIE-MS) and gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Principal component analysis identified negative mode FIE-MS as having the main separating power between samples from healthy and LC. Discriminatory metabolites were identified using ANOVA and Random Forest. Indications of potential diagnostic accuracy involved the use of receiver operating characteristic/area under the curve (ROC/AUC) analyses. This approach identified metabolites changes that were only observed with LC. Metabolites with AUC values of greater than 0.8 which distinguished between LC(+)/LC(-) binary classifications where identified and included Ganglioside GM1 which has previously been linked to LC. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: This study indicates that metabolomics based on sputum can yield metabolites that can be used as a diagnostic and/or discriminator tool. These could aid clinical intervention and targeted diagnosis of LC within an 'at risk' LC(-) population group. The use of sputum as a non-invasive source of metabolite biomarkers may aid in the development of an at-risk population screening programme for lung cancer or enhanced clinical diagnostic pathways.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26973212", "doi": "10.1016/j.lungcan.2016.02.006", "venue": "Lung cancer", "journal": "Lung cancer", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2266898880", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["18050596", "2893552", "18917984", "19405153", "18737209", "18638425", "25617687", "13832219", "9238871", "126127576", "5241766", "10805346", "36561130", "32896579", "11351376", "8679420", "21571024", "23863490", "46180334", "1036171"], "inbound_citations": ["59555554", "18658914", "570532", "19953346", "3573793", "208946940", "46968940", "28004278", "52945327", "211064738", "214826623", "214970126", "215379292", "215490295", "73421429", "215119254", "7654959", "85545277", "52202322", "215258407", "201728717"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:689330"}

Many researchers reported that the machine learning models, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models provided good forecasts. The aim of this research was to compare the forecasting accuracy of ANN and SVR models in forecasting daily exchange rates of Sri Lankan Rupees to Euro and Yen and to identify a better model. Daily time series data, collected from 2nd July, 2012 to 31st August, 2016 (1008 trading days) from the official website of Central Bank of Sri Lanka, were analysed using Eviews, MATLAB and R packages. A Nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NAR) model using Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) learning algorithm, a SVR model with Gaussian radial basis kernel function designed to model the exchange rate returns and a hybrid ANN with Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) as input were designed to model the exchange rate series. Mean Squares Errors and directional accuracy measures revealed that the machine learning models explained the variation in the series well. However, Hybrid ANN models provided a more accurate directional accuracy as well as value forecast than NAR model and SVR model. These findings could be useful for domestic as well as foreign investors.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2888280373", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:158205953"}

Improving the accuracy and efficiency of electric load forecasting can help power utilities design reasonable operational planning which will lead to the improvement of economic and social benefits of the systems. A hybrid incremental learning approach composed of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Random Vector Functional Link network (RVFL) is presented in this work. RVFL network is a universal approximator with good efficiency because of the randomly generated weights between input and hidden layers and the close form solution for parameter computation. By introducing incremental learning, along with ensemble approach via DWT and EMD into RVFL network, the forecasting performance can be significantly improved with respect to both efficiency and accuracy. The electric load datasets from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed incremental DWT-EMD based RVFL network.

Study design and methodology: From 2000 to 2012, data on 636,111 newly diagnosed female T2DM patients were available in the Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance Research Database. By applying their data, a risk prediction model of breast cancer in patients with T2DM was created. We also collected data on potential predictors of breast cancer so that adjustments for their effect could be made in the analysis.

Local climatic factors could affect the selection of green building technologies and hence the target credits, but currently there is no research suggesting target LEED credits based on climatic factors. This paper presents a methodology for the selection of target LEED credits based on project information and climatic factors. This study focuses on projects certified with LEED for Existing Buildings (LEED-EB).

The results showed that Random Forests performed the best in most of the 55 classification models. With a combination of the three algorithms, the trained classification models were used to develop a web-based decision support system for LEED credit selection.

In the second phase. using the predicted output value of SVM, feasibility grade is calculated for the final NPD project decision making. In this study, the feasibility grades are also divided as three level grades. We assume that the frequency of NPD project cases is symmetrically determined according to the feasibility grades and misclassification errors are partially minimized by the multiple grades. However, the horizon of grade level can be changed by firms' NPD strategy. Our proposed feasibility grade method is more reasonable in NPD decision problems by considering particularly risk factor of NPD in viewpoints of future NPD success probability. In our empirical study using Korean NPD cases, the SVM significantly outperformed ANN and logistic regression as benchmark models in hit ratio. And the feasibility grades generated from the predicted output value of SVM showed that they can offer a useful guideline for NPD project selection.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2220813549", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110525198"}

The ensemble method of decision trees is widely introduced to improve the prediction accuracy.

The main aim is to address some fundamental open research issues on the significance of creating deep layered architectures in RNN and to characterize the inherent hierarchical representation of time in such models, especially for efficient implementations. In particular, the analysis aims at the study and proposal of approaches to develop and enhance hierarchical dynamics in deep architectures within the efficient Reservoir Computing (RC) framework for RNN modeling. The effect of a deep layered organization of RC models is investigated in terms of both occurrence of multiple time-scale and increasing of richness of the dynamics. It turns out that a deep layering of recurrent models allows an effective diversification of temporal representations in the layers of the hierarchy, by amplifying the effects of the factors influencing the time-scales and the richness of the dynamics, measured as the entropy of recurrent units activations. The advantages of the proposed approach are also highlighted by measuring the increment of the short-term memory capacity of the RC models.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2016.12.089", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2608997467", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204210220", "201090523", "204950292", "53240610", "208910145", "203605950", "53240029", "209492860", "203606254", "3313245", "108285488", "204089944", "43920008", "212725148", "212415629", "52986645", "204942686", "76667800", "202550348", "174798206", "199543889", "146803970", "49564619", "5934317", "153316189", "208131588", "41670309", "52985395", "209854113", "49182946", "3366620", "1077549", "204402407", "196621796", "44107610", "3610117", "155092639", "211532599", "159042136", "53240412", "214691680", "195767000", "51908202", "211532393", "57189452", "208013406", "133604224", "52987841", "3544459", "199541604"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32040653"}

Nowadays, people gain information on reviews of users regarding public transportation, movies, hotel reservation, etc., by utilizing the resources available, as they meet their needs. Hence, sentiment classification is an essential process employed to determine the positive and negative responses. This paper presents an approach for sentiment classification of train reviews using MapReduce model with the proposed Kernel Optimized-Support Vector Machine (KO-SVM) classifier. The MapReduce framework handles big data using a mapper, which performs feature extraction and reducer that classifies the review based on KO-SVM classification. The feature extraction process utilizes features that are classification-specific and SentiWordNet-based. KO-SVM adopts SVM for the classification, where the exponential kernel is replaced by an optimized kernel, finding the weights using a novel optimizer, self-adaptive lion algorithm. In a comparative analysis, the performance of KO-SVM classifier is compared with SentiWordNet, Naive Bayes, neural network, and LSVM, using the evaluation metrics, specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy, with train review and movie review database. The proposed KO-SVM classifier could attain maximum sensitivity of 93.46% and 91.249%, specificity of 74.485% and 70.018%; and accuracy of 84.341% and 79.611%, respectively, for train review and movie review databases.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12046-018-0980-1", "venue": null, "journal": "S\u0101dhan\u0101", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2904953199", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["17862322", "6608488", "18606744", "7586688", "207927251", "7105713", "14266822", "45420785", "205709105", "9787943", "114955219", "3181362", "207196397", "1428702", "9411379", "32692295", "1677808", "6247656", "60773091", "207165665", "28613859"], "inbound_citations": ["211209511"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125752989"}

In chemical and engineering domains, a common representational device for graph-like structures are so-called non-determinate relations. Manually engineered features in such domains typically test for or count occurrences of specific substructures having specific properties. However, representations containing non-determinate relations pose a serious efficiency problem for most standard ILP algorithms. Therefore, we have devised a stochastic algorithm to automatically derive features from non-determinate background knowledge. The algorithm conducts a top-down search for first-order clauses, where each clause represents a binary feature. These features are used instead of the non-determinate relations in a subsequent induction step.

Traditionally, reactive thermal/power management techniques have been used to take appropriate action when the temperature reaches a threshold. However, these approaches do not always balance temperature and, as a result, may degrade system reliability. Therefore, to distribute temperature evenly across all cores, a proactive mechanism is needed to forecast future workload characteristics and the corresponding temperature, in order to make decisions before hot spots occur. Such proactive methods rely on an engine to precisely predict future workload characteristics. In this work, we first discuss the state-of-the-art methods for predicting workload dynamics and we compare their performance. We, then, introduce a prediction method based on Support Vector Regression (SVR), which accurately predicts the workload behavior several steps ahead. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we use several programs from the PARSEC benchmark suite on an UltraSPARC T1 processor running the Sun Solaris operating system and we extract architectural traces.

Establishing a trust mechanism is vital in order to identify the trustful sources of information on the social web. Trust prediction can be a useful tool for identifying the potential trust relationships among users in an online community. Thereby, reliable participants can be recommended to users; this increases social interaction among users and makes the trust network denser. The main contribution of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of soft computing and neurofuzzy techniques within the context of trust prediction. Therefore, an adaptive neurofuzzy inference system ANFIS as a representative of neurofuzzy techniques is compared with the widely used classification techniques including C4.5 decision tree, artificial neural network ANN, logistic regression, and Bayesian network. All methods are applied on a portion of data obtained from the Epinions network. The results of empirical experiments indicate that ANFIS achieves the best performance in terms of area under ROC AUC among all other methods. Furthermore, ANFIS follows closely a C4.5 algorithm concerning F-measure.

Whole genome maps of circulating miRNAs in micro-vesicles, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and platelets have been constructed from a cohort of 20 UC patients and 20 normal individuals. Through Significance Analysis of Microarrays, a signature of 31 differentially expressed platelet-derived miRNAs has been identified and biomarker performance estimated through a non-probabilistic binary linear classification using Support Vector Machines. Through this approach, classifier measurements reveal a predictive score of 92.8% accuracy, 96.2% specificity and 89.5% sensitivity in distinguishing UC patients from normal individuals. Additionally, the platelet-derived biomarker signature can be validated at 88% accuracy through qPCR assays, and a majority of the miRNAs in this panel can be demonstrated to sub-stratify into 4 highly correlated intensity based clusters. Analysis of predicted targets of these biomarkers reveal an enrichment of pathways associated with cytoskeleton assembly, transport, membrane permeability and regulation of transcription factors engaged in a variety of regulatory cascades that are consistent with a cell-mediated immune response model of intestinal inflammation.

However, the performance of such systems degrades when a low-resolution face image captured in unconstrained settings, such as videos from cameras in a surveillance scenario, are matched with high-resolution gallery images. The primary challenge, here, is to extract discriminating features from limited biometric content in low-resolution images and match it to information rich high-resolution face images. The problem of cross-resolution face matching is further alleviated when there is limited labeled positive data for training face recognition algorithms. In this paper, the problem of cross-resolution face matching is addressed where low-resolution images are matched with high-resolution gallery.A co-transfer learning framework is proposed, which is a cross-pollination of transfer learning and co-training paradigms and is applied for cross-resolution face matching. The transfer learning component transfers the knowledge that is learnt while matching high-resolution face images during training to match low-resolution probe images with high-resolution gallery during testing. On the other hand, co-training component facilitates this transfer of knowledge by assigning pseudolabels to unlabeled probe instances in the target domain.

Although researches on automated face recognition have broadly increased along the last 35 years, it remains a challenging task in the fields of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. As the scenarios varies from static and constrained photographs to uncontrolled video images, the challenging issues on automatic face recognition are usually related with variations in illumination, pose and expressions. The goal of this master thesis is to propose techniques for the improvement of face recognition systems. The first technique addresses the problem of illumination by fusing the visible and the infrared spectra of the face. With this approach the recognition rates were improved in 2.07% while the Equal Error Rate (EER) were reduced in 45.47%. The second technique addresses the issue of face features extraction and classification.

In this article, I review the CBI model of foreign language (FL) instruction in the context of its close alignment with two emergent frameworks in cognitive science: connectionism and constructivism. I show that these frameworks offer powerful support for the features of CBI that make it an attractive alternative to textbook-based learning. In addition, I argue that the general principles associated with connectionism and constructivism suggest further avenues for development within CBI, especially in the areas of pattern recognition and speech processing.To describe connectionism and constructivism as emergent frameworks in cognitive science is perhaps misleading. They would be better described as landmark theories that have in recent years experienced a revival, in large part due to the influence of research associated with increased brain imaging capabilities and large-scale computational modeling. Connectionism and constructivism originally stem from separate disciplines (mathematics and psychology, respectively). Conceptually, however, they are sufficiently broad as to have implications for many different fields. Taken separately or together, connectionism and constructivism have been especially influential in fields that deal with behavioral phenomena.

Methods: We propose a novel approach for noise modeling using a \u201creference tag,\u201d a second RFID tag worn on the body in a location not subject to perturbations due to respiratory motions that are detected via the primary RFID tag. The reference tag enables modeling of noise artifacts yielding significant improvement in detection accuracy. The noise is modeled using autoregressive moving average (ARMA) processes and filtered using state-augmented Kalman filters. The filtered measurements are passed through multiple classification algorithms (naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision trees) and a new similarity classifier that generates binary decisions based on current measurements and past decisions. Results: Our findings demonstrate that state-augmented Kalman filters for noise modeling improves classification accuracy drastically by over 7.7% over the standard filter performance. Furthermore, the fusion framework used to combine local classifier decisions was able to predict the presence or absence of respiratory activity with over 86% accuracy. Conclusion: The work presented here strongly indicates the usefulness of processing passive RFID tag measurements for remote respiration activity monitoring.

The predominating pattern in MHG verse is the alternation between stressed and unstressed syllables, but syllable length also plays a crucial role. There are a total of eight possible metrical values. Single or half mora syllables can carry any one of three types of stress, resulting in six combinations. The seventh value is a double mora, i.e., a long stressed syllable. The eighth value is an elided syllable. We construct a supervised Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model to predict the metrical value of syllables, and subsequently investigate medieval German poets\u2019 use of semantic and sonorous emphasis through meter. The features used are: 1) the syllable\u2019s position within the line, 2) the syllable\u2019s length in characters, 3) the syllable\u2019s characters, 4) elision (last two characters of previous syllable and first two characters of focal syllable), 5) syllable weight, and 6) word boundaries. Additional metrical rules are enforced and marginal probabilities are calculated to yield the most likely legal scansion of a line. The model achieves a macro average F-score of .925 on internal cross-validation and .909 on held-out testing data. We determine that trochaic alternation with a one syllable anacrusis and words carrying clear stress assignment are the easiest for the model to scan. Lines with multiple double morae of syllables with few characters are the most difficult. We then rank all the epic poetry in the Mittelhochdeutsche Begriffsdatenbank (MHDBDB) by the difficulty of the meter. Finally, we investigate the double mora, which MHG poets used to draw attention to chosen concepts. We conclude that poets generally chose to use the double mora to emphasize highly sonorant words.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3389/fdigh.2018.00019", "venue": "Front.

Young people who are very active online are prone to suffer from IAD. It negatively affects their academic performance and social lives. The earlier the detection, the better the treatment. Therefore, this pilot study aimed to predict IAD among the youth to encourage early treatment. The sample included 30 undergraduate students at Universitas Indonesia (UI). Their Web browsing histories for five weeks were recorded from their laptops and analyzed using the support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function (RBF) kernel as a machine learning method for prediction. The results were subsequently compared using ensemble learning, such as random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB). It was then matched with respondents' responses to an Internet Addiction Test (IAT) questionnaire, which measures IAD levels. Respondents' general health data were collected with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Features from Web browsing histories were extracted to classify activities in five types. These are information retrieval (IR), instant messaging (IM), social networking services (SNS), leisure, and online shopping (OS). The extracted features became input to classify participants' IAD. The results were compared with their IAD results from the IAT questionnaire. Machine learning was also employed to classify the input into respondents' general health (GH) status, which was matched with their responses to the GHQ-12 questionnaire. The findings revealed that the prediction accuracies were 66.67% for the IAD status and 65.17% for the GH status employing SVM. The precisions for predicting IAD and GH were 63.33% and 44.33%, according to RF. Moreover, the accuracies were 63.33% and 67.17%, according to GB. Results indicated that RF decreased prediction accuracies, but GB was slightly different from SVM. For each classifier, IAD status was predicted more accurately than GH status. An alternative to improve the outcomes is gaining data from the Internet firewall instead of the Web browsing history from users' laptops. It can provide richer and more realistic records of Web access, which are collected from any devices connected to the university's computer networks. However, it requires consent from the participants and authority managing the infrastructure. If each class has a balanced example, we plan to add more features and employ other types of ensemble learning for higher accuracy. Furthermore, performing a multiclass prediction can demonstrate specific IAD severity levels and the class of mental health status, i.e., anxiety and depression.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3378936.3378947", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Software Engineering and Information Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3010326901", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7842411", "140735546", "6101385", "89141", "40816572", "206155944", "43421755", "22920306", "32819267", "20554106", "30844581", "18733217", "143896920", "17319293", "15701295", "18382435", "7352900", "341473", "12329388", "79055678"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212551904"}

Detection of pesticide residues on various commodities in an open environment is a challenging task. Hyperspectral sensing is one of the recent technologies used to detect the pesticide residues. This paper addresses the problem of detection of pesticide residues of Cyantraniliprole on grapes in open fields using multi temporal hyperspectral remote sensing data. The re ectance data of 686 samples of grapes with no, single and double dose application of Cyantraniliprole has been collected by handheld spectroradiometer (MS- 720) with a wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 1052 nm. The data collection was carried out over a large feature set of 213 spectral bands during the period of March to May 2015. This large feature set may cause model over-fitting problem as well as increase the computational time, so in order to get the most relevant features, various feature selection techniques viz Principle Component Analysis (PCA), LASSO and Elastic Net regularization have been used. Using this selected features, we evaluate the performance of various classifiers such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to classify the grape sample with no, single or double application of Cyantraniliprole. The key finding of this paper is; most of the features selected by the LASSO varies between 350-373nm and 940-990nm consistently for all days.

The load behavior is so complicated that it is hard to predict the load. The deregulated power market is faced with the new problem of an increase in the degree of uncertainty. Thus, power system operators are concerned with the significant level of load forecasting. Namely, probabilistic load forecasting is required to smooth power system operation and planning. In this paper, an IVM (Informative Vector Machine) based method is proposed for short-term load forecasting. IVM is one of the kernel machine techniques that are derived from an SVM (Support Vector Machine). The Gaussian process (GP) satisfies the requirements that the prediction results are expressed as a distribution rather than as points. However, it is inclined to be overtrained for noise due to the basis function with N2 elements for N data. To overcome this problem, this paper makes use of IVM that selects necessary data for the model approximation with a posteriori distribution of entropy. That has a useful function to suppress the excess training. The proposed method is tested using real data for short-term load forecasting. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We have reproduced the similarity dataset presented by Stober and Nurnberger at AMR 2011 to enable a comparison of approaches. On this dataset, we compare their two-level approach, defining similarity measures on individual facets and combining them in a linear model, to the Metric Learning to Rank (MLR) algorithm. MLR adapts a similarity measure that operates directly on low-level features to the user data. We compare the different algorithms, features and parameter spaces with regards to minimising constraint violations. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the MLR algorithm in generalising to unknown data is evaluated on this dataset. We also explore the effects of feature choice.

The proposed model, called score-guided GAN (ScoreGAN), is trained with an evaluation metric for GANs, i.e., the Inception score, as a rough guide for the training of the generator. By using another pre-trained network instead of the Inception network, ScoreGAN circumvents the overfitting of the Inception network in order that generated samples do not correspond to adversarial examples of the Inception network. Also, to prevent the overfitting, the evaluation metrics are employed only as an auxiliary role, while the conventional target of GANs is mainly used. Evaluated with the CIFAR-10 dataset, ScoreGAN demonstrated an Inception score of 10.36$\\pm$0.15, which corresponds to state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, to generalize the effectiveness of ScoreGAN, the model was further evaluated with another dataset, i.e., the CIFAR-100; as a result, ScoreGAN outperformed the other existing methods, where the Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of ScoreGAN trained over the CIFAR-100 dataset was 13.98.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2004.04396", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3015546600", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["52889459", "211022860", "206770979", "52305483", "46898260", "1033682", "1687220", "326772", "206593880", "21569987", "6706414", "38384342", "4555207", "20404279", "51605477", "1099052", "4918416", "2930547", "69622005", "3654518", "10894094", "3366315", "9010805", "5687613", "8236317", "208910107", "8094560", "21598586", "50784066", "202785189"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:215548917"}

We apply the method to a case study, specifically the Giessen-FACE experiment. This experiment involves a Central European meadow that has been exposed to moderate CO 2 -enrichment since May 1998. The method for an a posteriori PFT-analysis: The method consists of four working steps and uses a combination of standard gradient analysis and Random Forests (RF). (1) The trait composition of the species is studied using Principal Components Analysis. Species trait information is gathered from databases. Natural PFT, i.e. groups of species with similar trait-sets, are identified specifically for the community under study. (2) A ranking of the species according to standardized/absolute CO 2 abundance response is obtained from Redundancy Analysis. Initially, species with a response above or below the median are grouped into three response groups (RG) each having similar behaviour, i.e. positive/negative or no-response. (3) The outlyingness measure of RF is used to shift RG boundaries until satisfactory RG homogeneity is achieved. RF is utilized to find the best traits for the RG classification. The behaviour of species representative of the RG is derived from RF class centers. (4) From knowledge gained in steps 1-3, hypotheses about the causes underlying the community alteration are built. Strengths/weaknesses of the method are discussed. Application of the method to the case study: The community consists of three natural PFT. Five species are summer-green forbs of varying competitiveness. Four species are evergreen ruderal forbs characterized as (semi-) basal rosette plants. The third natural PFT contains evergreen, more or less competitive species, mostly grasses, but also a few forbs. Negative standardized CO 2 -response was practically restricted to two natural PFT, i.e. the summer-greens, irrespective of their competitiveness, and the evergreen ruderals. Standard positive response covered part of the evergreen competitive natural PFT. Among them was Glechoma hederacea, one of the forbs with the greatest similarity to grasses. Two hypotheses were formulated to explain the response pattern: (1) Summer-greens lost in competition with evergreens, because the annual time-integral they can use for enhanced growth was more limited with year-round CO 2 -enrichment. (2) As rosette plants, ruderal evergreens lagged behind evergreen competitors because periods with full sunlight, which enabled them to gain additional carbon, were shorter for them. Absolute responses were additionally dependent on dominance patterns. The most striking difference to standard responses was the restriction of positive response to (sub-)dominant grasses.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of applied botany and food quality", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1543527594", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["16605259", "60993494", "89141", "131946036", "205006508", "30584084", "7308660", "129530694", "2155597", "5039138", "129253814", "20165935", "41714971", "88286477", "133498586", "84542844", "85694107", "83954009", "37712779", "118142495", "88014732", "133184278", "21313466", "26030169", "18549484", "54725451", "129609991", "57625829", "208591532", "11743570", "60490675", "85239776", "83912741", "12142032", "10837608", "4326028"], "inbound_citations": ["25194354", "17023349", "11693731", "40323176", "202862715", "215451952"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55870033"}

Present work address the issue by assigning different labels to automatically separating mass tissue from normal breast tissue given a region of interest in a digitized mammogram is investigated. It is the critical stage in developing a robust automated classification system because the classification depends on the accurate assessment of the tumour-normal tissue border as well as information gathered from the tumour area.

In this paper, nonconvex approximation approaches for sparse optimization have been studied with a unifying point of view in DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming framework. Considering a common DC approximation of the zero-norm including all standard sparse inducing penalty functions, we studied the consistency between global minimums (resp. local minimums) of approximate and original problems. We showed that, in several cases, some global minimizers (resp. local minimizers) of the approximate problem are also those of the original problem. Using exact penalty techniques in DC programming, we proved stronger results for some particular approximations, namely, the approximate problem, with suitable parameters, is equivalent to the original problem. The efficiency of several sparse inducing penalty functions have been fully analyzed. Four DCA (DC Algorithm) schemes were developed that cover all standard algorithms in nonconvex sparse approximation approaches as special versions. They can be viewed as, an $\\ell _{1}$-perturbed algorithm / reweighted-$\\ell _{1}$ algorithm / reweighted-$\\ell _{1}$ algorithm. We offer a unifying nonconvex approximation approach, with solid theoretical tools as well as efficient algorithms based on DC programming and DCA, to tackle the zero-norm and sparse optimization.

Considering the importance of the breast-cancer image classification, this paper has classified a set of histopathological images into Benign and Malignant classes utilizing Neural Network techniques and Random Forest algorithms.

While the preceding decade has seen a tremendous improvement in the ability to monitor forest disturbances from space, advances in forest monitoring have almost universally relied on optical satellite data from the Landsat program, whose effectiveness is limited in tropical regions with frequent cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can penetrate clouds and have been utilized in forest mapping applications since the early 1990s, but no study has exclusively used SAR data to map tropical selective logging. A detailed selective logging dataset from three lowland tropical forest regions in the Brazilian Amazon was used to assess the effectiveness of SAR data from Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2 and PALSAR-2 for monitoring tropical selective logging. We built Random Forest models in an effort to classify pixel-based differences in logged and unlogged areas. In addition, we used the BFAST algorithm to assess if a dense time series of Sentinel-1 imagery displayed recognizable shifts in pixel values after selective logging. Random Forest classification with SAR data (Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2, and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) performed poorly, having high commission and omission errors for logged observations. This suggests little to no difference in pixel-based metrics between logged and unlogged areas for these sensors. In contrast, the Sentinel-1 time series analyses indicated that areas under higher intensity selective logging (> 20 m3 ha\u22121) show a distinct spike in the number of pixels that included a breakpoint during the logging season. BFAST detected breakpoints in 50% of logged pixels and exhibited a false alarm rate of approximately 10% in unlogged forest. Overall our results suggest that SAR data can be used in time series analyses to detect tropical selective logging at high intensity logging locations within the Amazon (> 20 m3 ha\u22121). These results have important implications for current and future abilities to detect selective logging with freely available SAR data from SAOCOM 1A, the planned continuation missions of Sentinel-1 (C and D), ALOS PALSAR-1 archives (expected to be opened for free access in 2020), and the upcoming launch of NISAR.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/2020.03.31.018606", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3014797965", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["37029407", "30463405", "85896854", "206656453", "4405827", "45174121", "89141", "5956609", "134159672", "63038412", "14283205", "120339545", "135343133", "4670952", "3093707", "131726829", "52060775", "19723189", "9555747", "40432379", "88326069", "51965516", "29236984", "140732095", "126031707", "120523776"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214793654"}

Initially, a user-independent model is used in the recognition process. When a new user starts to use the human activity recognition application, personal streaming data can be gathered. Of course, this data does not have labels. However, there are three different ways to obtain this data: non-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised. The non-supervised approach relies purely on predicted labels, the supervised approach uses only human intelligence to label the data, and the proposed method for semi-supervised learning is a combination of these two: It uses artificial intelligence (AI) in most cases to label the data but in uncertain cases it relies on human intelligence. After labels are obtained, the personalization process continues by using the streaming data and these labels to update the incremental learning based model, which in this case is Learn++. Learn++ is an ensemble method that can use any classifier as a base classifier, and this study compares three base classifiers: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and classification and regression tree (CART). Moreover, three datasets are used in the experiment to show how well the presented method generalizes on different datasets. The results show that personalized models are much more accurate than user-independent models. On average, the recognition rates are: 87.0% using the user-independent model, 89.1% using the non-supervised personalization approach, 94.0% using the semi-supervised personalization approach, and 96.5% using the supervised personalization approach. This means that by relying on predicted labels with high confidence, and asking the user to label only uncertain observations (6.6% of the observations when using LDA, 7.7% when using QDA, and 18.3% using CART), almost as low error rates can be achieved as by using the supervised approach, in which labeling is fully based on human intelligence.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6928956", "pubmed_id": "31775243", "doi": "10.3390/s19235151", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2990940624", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8312119", "8224155", "109107594", "10985974", "32558535", "15267007", "53231033", "12705858", "16574762", "19552174", "14531204", "10098456", "53239715", "15208147", "52283813", "167217731", "5423074", "800249", "6975432", "53219468", "15662659", "15821623", "7946364", "15921620", "202159451", "2162999", "27787383"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208336073"}

If the muscle function is influenced by spasticity, there are different types of therapy to regain muscle control.

A commonly-used transfer learning approach involves taking a part of a pre-trained model, adding a few layers at the end, and re-training the new layers with a small dataset. This approach, while efficient and widely used, imposes a security vulnerability because the pre-trained model used in transfer learning are usually available publicly to everyone, including potential attackers. In this paper, we show that without any additional knowledge other than the pre-trained model, an attacker can launch an effective and efficient brute force attack that can craft instances of input to trigger each target class with high confidence. We assume that the attacker does not have access to any target-specific information, including samples from target classes, re-trained model, and probabilities assigned by Softmax to each class, and thus called target-agnostic attack. These assumptions render all previous attacks impractical, to the best of our knowledge. To evaluate the proposed attack, we perform a set of experiments on face recognition and speech recognition tasks and show the effectiveness of the attack.

We initially induce the bilingual stem and suffix correspondences by considering the longest sequence common to orthogonally similar translations. Clusters of stem-pairs characterised by identical suffix-pairs are formed, which are then used to generate out-of-vocabulary translations that are identical to, but different from, the previously existing translations, thereby completing the existing lexicon.

Field experiments were conducted on 117 planted Luogang citrus trees in the Crab Village of Guangzhou. The citrus trees were divided into several groups and 1-year standardized management was performed on them. Nitrogenous fertilizer was applied to the citrus trees only during four phenological periods in the year, and each group was treated with various levels of N-fertilization in order to cultivate differentiation samples with varied nitrogenous content. 15 days after each fertilization, fresh and healthy citrus leaves were collected to gather training samples from different growth stages. Hyper-spectrometer ASD FieldSpec was used to detect spectral reflectance while the Kjeldahl method was used to measure the N-content of citrus leaves from the same batch. In this way, each sample is described as an instance-label pair, where a multi-variable vector was used as the descriptor and the ground truth of the nitrogen level was used as the label. The collected samples were used to construct a large-scale dataset, 80% of which were used as the train set and the remaining 20% were used as the test set. PCA (Principle Component Analysis) was applied to the original vectors for dimension reduction and noise removal and SVR (Support Vector Regression) was adopted to build the regression analysis model for predicting the nitrogen level of the citrus trees. The model relied on a training set and was created by mapping the multi-variable vectors to the related ground truths label through SVR. The test set was used to evaluate the performance of the model. The experiment on the test set resulted in reaching a square correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9730, a mean relative error of 0.9033%, and a mean square error (MSE) of 0.090343. Conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results: First, compared with various deformations of spectral data, e.g. first derivative spectrum, second derivative spectrum, reciprocal spectrum, logarithmic spectrum, logarithm of reciprocal spectrum, the original high spectral reflectance data, as the vector-descriptor of the samples, achieved the best experimental result when using the approach in this paper. Second, when the Radial Basis Function (RBF) is used as the kernel for SVR and PCA determines the principal components with the cumulative contribution rate set to 99.9%, the model will achieve the best performance and be the most robust. Third, comparative experiments between our method and other mainstream multivariate regression analysis algorithms demonstrate the validity of using SVR and PCA to do modeling. Experimental results show our method is obviously superior to Partial Least Squares (PLS), Back Propagation (BP) and Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (SMLR). Finally, using SVR to build the regression model based on PCA-processed data successfully achieved the ideal performance index, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method and provides a theoretical basis for the applications of high spectral reflectance in non-destructive nitrogen level detection.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "123605356", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107426147"}

To this end, we propose a novel framework that allows users to devise a plan of action to individuals in presence of Machine Learning classification, where both the ML model and the user properties are expected to change over time.

In this setting it uniquely combines state-of-the-art solutions for single model interpretation, domain adaptation techniques for predicting future models, and constraint databases to represent and query the space of possible actions.

Simulation results are provided demonstrating that similar spatiotemporal patterns map to similar traces. The model achieves this property by measuring the degree of match, G, between the current input pattern on each time slice and the expected input given the preceding time slices (i.e., temporal context) and then adding an amount of noise, inversely proportional to G, to the process of choosing the internal representation for the current time slice. Thus, if G is small, indicating novelty, we add much noise and the resulting internal representation of the current input pattern has low overlap with any preexisting representations of time slices.

The forest land conversion was evaluated in this district using supervised classification with the Random Forest algorithm based on Landsat images from 2002, 2007, and 2015. This data was used to conduct a land conversion analysis to study the relative changes in the defined classes. In the study, built-up areas, trees outside forest, and cropland areas increased by 654.38%, 87.44%, and 40.71%, respectively, while forest, waterbody, and fallow land areas decreased by 62.67%, 54.10%, and 46.95%, respectively. The land cover change analysis revealed that forest areas, particularly those dominated by the threatened sal tree (Shorea robusta), were converted into other land-use classes. Bangladesh-specific development indicators from the World Bank were also incorporated into the study to better understand the underlying situation. The results support the formation of policies and planning to reverse forest degradation as per the Paris Climate Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.

The methods of this paradigm, such as Boosting and Support Vector Machines, have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art for classification by improving the accuracy and by increasing the applicability of machine learning methods. One of the key benefits of these methods is their ability to learn efficiently in high dimensional feature spaces, either by the use of implicit data representations via kernels or by explicit feature induction. However, traditionally these methods do not exploit dependencies between class labels where more than one label is predicted. Many real-world classification problems involve sequential, temporal or structural dependencies between multiple labels. The goal of this research is to generalize discriminative learning methods for such scenarios. In particular, we focus on label sequence learning. ::: Label sequence learning is the problem of inferring a state sequence from an observation sequence, where the state sequence may encode a labeling, an annotation or a segmentation of the sequence. Prominent examples include part-of-speech tagging, named entity classification, information extraction, continuous speech recognition, and secondary protein structure prediction. ::: In this thesis, we present three novel discriminative methods that are generalizations of AdaBoost and multiclass Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a Gaussian Process formulation for label sequence learning. These techniques combine the efficiency of dynamic programming methods with the advantages of the state-of-the-art learning methods. We present theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations on pitch accent prediction, named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging which demonstrate the advantages over classical approaches like Hidden Markov Models as well as the state-of-the-art methods like Conditional Random Fields.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2137515156", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16729239", "13212070", "29494672", "28156381", "1435230"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61409487"}

Here, we propose a novel multi-resolution hierarchical framework (SuperCRF) inspired by the way pathologists perceive regional tissue architecture to improve cell classification and demonstrate its clinical applications. We develop SuperCRF by training a state-of-art deep learning spatially constrained- convolution neural network (SC-CNN) to detect and classify cells from 105 high-resolution (20\u00d7) H&E-stained slides of The Cancer Genome Atlas melanoma dataset and subsequently, a conditional random field (CRF) by combining cellular neighborhood with tumor regional classification from lower resolution images (5, 1.25\u00d7) given by a superpixel-based machine learning framework. SuperCRF led to an 11.85% overall improvement in the accuracy of the state-of-art deep learning SC-CNN cell classifier. Consistent with a stroma-mediated immune suppressive microenvironment, SuperCRF demonstrated that (i) a high ratio of lymphocytes to all lymphocytes within the stromal compartment (p = 0.026) and (ii) a high ratio of stromal cells to all cells (p < 0.0001 compared to p = 0.039 for SC-CNN only) are associated with poor survival in patients with melanoma.

There are several types of ransomware attacks, but the present paper focuses only upon the crypto-ransomware, because it makes data unrecoverable once the victim\u2019s files have been encrypted. Therefore, in this research, it was proposed that machine learning is used to detect crypto-ransomware before it starts its encryption function, or at the pre-encryption stage. Successful detection at this stage is crucial to enable the attack to be stopped from achieving its objective. Once the victim was aware of the presence of crypto-ransomware, valuable data and files can be backed up to another location, and then an attempt can be made to clean the ransomware with minimum risk. Therefore we proposed a pre-encryption detection algorithm (PEDA) that consisted of two phases. In, PEDA-Phase-I, a Windows application programming interface (API) generated by a suspicious program would be captured and analyzed using the learning algorithm (LA). The LA can determine whether the suspicious program was a crypto-ransomware or not, through API pattern recognition. This approach was used to ensure the most comprehensive detection of both known and unknown crypto-ransomware, but it may have a high false positive rate (FPR). If the prediction was a crypto-ransomware, PEDA would generate a signature of the suspicious program, and store it in the signature repository, which was in Phase-II. In PEDA-Phase-II, the signature repository allows the detection of crypto-ransomware at a much earlier stage, which was at the pre-execution stage through the signature matching method. This method can only detect known crypto-ransomware, and although very rigid, it was accurate and fast. The two phases in PEDA formed two layers of early detection for crypto-ransomware to ensure zero files lost to the user. However in this research, we focused upon Phase-I, which was the LA. Based on our results, the LA had the lowest FPR of 1.56% compared to Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Ensemble (NB and RF) and EldeRan (a machine learning approach to analyze and classify ransomware).

Our innovation makes it possible to extract and analyze the power system's eigenvalues, which are related to the intrinsic frequencies of the power system that determine correlations between extracted features and state of health (SoH). In-situ electronic prognostics for power systems are crucial for attaining a sound theoretical basis of health status.

Our goal is the development of a methodology to identify immunologic correlates of protection using the Shigella challenge as a model. Methods The proposed methodology utilizes the Random Forests (RF) machine learning algorithm as well as Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to detect immune markers that predict protection, identify interactions between variables, and define optimal cutoffs. Logistic regression modeling is applied to estimate the probability of protection and the confidence interval (CI) for such a probability is computed by bootstrapping the logistic regression models. Results The results demonstrate that the combination of Classification and Regression Trees and Random Forests complements the standard logistic regression and uncovers subtle immune interactions. Specific levels of immunoglobulin IgG antibody in blood on the day of challenge predicted protection in 75 % ( 95 % CI 67\u201386). Of those subjects that did not have blood IgG at or above a defined threshold, 100 % were protected if they had IgA antibody secreting cells above a defined threshold. Comparison with the results obtained by applying only logistic regression modeling with standard Akaike Information Criterion for model selection shows the usefulness of the proposed method.

Since physical models able to reliably recognize ::: and predict the occurrence of disruptions are currently not available, the re- ::: search carried out fits in the broad framework of machine learning techniques ::: that have been exploited as an alternative approach to disruption prediction ::: and automatic classification. ::: Promising approaches to prediction and classification are represented by ::: the so-called \"data-based\" methods: to this purpose, existing systems have ::: been applied and further developed and new approaches have been investi- ::: gated. ::: The mentioned activity has been carried out in collaboration with the ::: University of Cagliari and European Research Centers for nuclear fusion, ::: taking as case study some of the most important experimental machines ::: such as JET and ASDEX Upgrade (AUG), with several months of research ::: spent at the Culham Science Centre. ::: ::: Outline of the Thesis ::: --------------------- ::: In chapter 1 the perspectives of fusion in the world energy context as an ::: almost unlimited source of energy for the future are discussed, with particu- ::: lar reference to the role of magnetic confinement. Furthermore, the bases of ::: fusion reactions have been introduced. ::: In chapter 2 the main aspects of plasma stability in tokamaks configu- ::: rations are described with the aim to provide an adequate reference for all ::: the discussions of the following chapters. In particular, the main parameters ::: related to plasma stability, which have been used for the construction of the ::: databases, have been introduced. ::: The chapter 3 is focused on the description of the operational limits ::: with reference to the main quantities which should be maximized to im- ::: prove plasma performance. Everything, also in the previous chapters, has ::: been framed to introduce the key problems which this thesis has addressed: ::: analysis, prediction and classification of disruptions. After the main consid- ::: erations about the operational limits, the main phases, the causes and the ::: consequences of disruptions have been discussed, trying to integrate the sta- ::: bility concepts introduced in the previous chapter. ::: The chapter 4 is finalized to provide an insight of the Machine Learn- ::: ing methods which represent the starting point of all the analysis and algo- ::: rithms implemented for disruption prediction and classification. Today the ::: large amount of data available from fusion experiments and their character ::: of high-dimensionality make particularly difficult handling, processing, un- ::: derstanding and extracting properly what is really important among all the ::: available information. Machine Learning allows to deal with the problem in ::: efficient way. Therefore, a framework of all the techniques exploited for the ::: analysis has been provided, with particular reference to the Manifold Learn- ::: ing algorithms as Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) and Generative Topographic ::: Mappings (GTMs). Also reference methods such as k-Nearest Neighbor (k- ::: NN) or more recent methods such as Conformal Predictors, exploited for ::: validation and reliability assessment purposes, have been described. ::: In chapter 5 the state of the art of machine learning techniques ap- ::: plied to disruption prediction and classification is presented, describing in ::: particular the main applications with the widely employed Neural Networks, ::: such Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) ::: and Self Organizing Maps (SOMs), and statistical methods such as Discrim- ::: inant Analysis or Multiple Threshold technique. Strengths and weaknesses ::: have also been discussed with reference to a possible solution to overcome ::: the drawbacks of these methods: the multi-machine approach. ::: Chapter 6 is dedicated to the description of the databases used for all ::: the analysis presented in the following chapters. In particular, the statistical ::: analysis and the data-reduction algorithms that have been needed to build ::: a reliable and statistically representative database have been discussed in ::: detail. ::: The last three chapters contain all the analysis and all the algorithms im- ::: plemented for the mapping of the operational space, disruption classification ::: and prediction. In chapter 7 the mapping of the JET operational space ::: is presented. The first sections deal with projections and data-visualization ::: with linear projection methods such as Grand Tour (GT) and Principal Com- ::: ponent Analysis (PCA). In the central part, the same aspects have been taken ::: into account by exploiting nonlinear Manifold Learning techniques, SOM and ::: GTM, on the base of which a detailed analysis of the operational space has ::: been performed. Such analysis, showing the potentiality of the methods, has ::: been performed, regarding GTM model, through the implementation of a ::: dedicated tool. Finally, an outliers' analysis and performance indexes appo- ::: sitely proposed have been considered for evaluating the overall performance ::: of the mapping. ::: In the chapter 8 the developed automatic disruption classification for ::: JET has been described. The chapter is divided in two parts: the first one ::: describes the classification of disruptions belonging to the Carbon Wall (CW) ::: campaigns, whereas in the second part the classification of disruptions with ::: the ITER-like Wall (ILW) is framed in the assessment of the suitability of the ::: automatic classifier for real time applications, in conjunction with prediction ::: systems working online at JET. The reliability of the results has been vali- ::: dated by comparison with a k-NN based reference classifier and through the ::: recent conformal predictors, with which is possible to provide, in addition to ::: the prediction/classification, the related level of confidence. ::: Chapter 9 is dedicated to the disruption prediction at ASDEX Upgrade. ::: The first part is related to the description of the database and the data- ::: reduction technique used to select a representative and balanced dataset. ::: Self-Organizing Map and the Generative Topographic Mapping have been ::: exploited to map ASDEX Upgrade operational space and to build a disrup- ::: tion predictor, introducing at the same time their potentiality for disruptions ::: classification. Furthermore, the use of this two methods combined with a Lo- ::: gistic model has been proposed to realize a predictive system able to exploit ::: the complementary behaviors of the two approaches, improving the overall ::: performance in prediction.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "303857035", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["49658490", "201074178", "171088167"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107459857"}

Most nuclei detection algorithms are based on the assumption that the nuclei center should have larger responses than their surroundings in the probability map of the pathological image, which in turn transforms the detection or localization problem into finding the local maxima on the probability map. However, all the existing studies used regression algorithms to determine the probability map, which neglect to take the spatial contiguity within the probability map into consideration. In order to capture the higher-order consistency within the generated probability map, we propose an approach called Residual Attention Generative Adversarial Network (i.e., RAGAN) for nuclei detection. Specifically, the objective function of the RAGAN model combines a detection term with an adversarial term. The adversarial term adopts a generator called Residual Attention U-Net (i.e., RAU-Net) to produce the probability maps that cannot be distinguished by the ground-truth. Based on the adversarial model, we can simultaneously estimate the probabilities of many pixels with high-order consistency, by which we can derive a more accurate probability map. We evaluate our method on a public colorectal adenocarcinoma images dataset with 29756 nuclei.

First, diverse image processing algorithms for burnt area extraction from Sentinel-2 data were evaluated. In the next step, burn severity maps were derived from Sentinel-2 data alone, and the synergy between Sentinel-2 & Sentinel-1 for this purpose was evaluated. Finally, the impact of the wildfire to soil erodibility estimates derived from the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model implemented to the acquired Sentinel images was explored. In overall, the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifier obtained the most accurate burned area mapping, with a derived accuracy of 99.38%. An object-based SVMs classification using as input both optical and radar data was the most effective approach of delineating burn severity, achieving an overall accuracy of 92.97%. Soil erosion mapping predictions allowed quantifying the impact of wildfire to soil erosion at the studied site, suggesting the method could be potentially of a wider use.

The mean squared error (MSE) of the prediction model using PSO-SVR is about 8.6546\uf0b410-11. Practical results indicate that the application of the PSO-SVR method to temperature forecasting of PM10 is feasible and effective. The results show that the model is effective and highly accurate in the forecasting of PM10.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.403-408.3693", "venue": null, "journal": "Advanced Materials Research", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2143541509", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["98619743", "52874011", "31514870", "5543127", "96474051", "14834387", "7367791", "16190394", "61815900"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110031620"}

Random Forest (RF) technique was used to model soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations. Topographic and remote sensing indices, and land use and soil texture fractions maps were used as environmental variables. 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate models. Results showed that the mean SOC concentration is very low with a value of 0.33%. The most important variables for predicting SOC concentration variations were the clay map, Landsat 8 bands 7, 4, 6, 3 and distance from the river. Remote sensed data showed high potential to predict SOC in this low relief region. Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were 0.21 and 0.16%, respectively. We concluded that soil clay content, agricultural management, and the processes of wind erosion and deposition determine the SOC distribution in Zahak region, eastern Iran.

Most notably, email data is legally protected content, which means no one except the receiver can review the messages or derived information. In this paper we first introduce a system which can extract structured information automatically without requiring human review of any personal content. Then we focus on how to annotate product names from the extracted texts, which is one of the most difficult problems in the system. Neither general learning methods, such as binary classifiers, nor more specific structure learning methods, suchas Conditional Random Field (CRF), can solve this problem well. To accomplish this task, we propose a hybrid approach, which basically trains a CRF model using the labels predicted by binary classifiers (weak learners). However, the performance of weak learners can be low, therefore we use Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm on CRF to remove the noise and improve the accuracy, without the need to label and inspect specific emails. In our experiments, the EM-CRF model can significantly improve the product name annotations over the weak learners and plain CRFs.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2783258.2788580", "venue": "KDD '15", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1980176056", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15813440", "17589767", "2159733", "17157304", "15556693", "207646361", "62574043", "52874011", "2591187", "42464", "7457781", "6589999", "9091611", "7228110", "16483125", "115693616", "917949", "5368197", "669616", "13451873", "965046", "277918", "10975724", "11383614", "10910955", "60993494", "17216823", "2386383", "9985571", "1994530", "34824932", "7447380", "18989409", "12750207", "12517841", "5916894", "311547"], "inbound_citations": ["174802003", "50767110", "5815177", "2123004", "4155935", "29894232", "14995346", "17503968", "15826310"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6290268"}

This EMG has information corresponding to condition of power, tenderness of motions and motion level. Therefore, it is thought that it is useful biological information for analyzing person\u2019s motions. Recently, researches on this EMG have been actively done. For instance, it is used as a control signal of electrical arms, because EMG can be gathered from the remaining muscle about upper-extremity amputee. In addition, the pointing device that uses EMG has been developed. In general, EMG is measured from a part with comparatively big muscular fibers such as arms and shoulders. There is a problem that placing and removing the electrode is inconvenient when EMG is measured by placing the electrode in the arm and the shoulder. Therefore, if we can recognize wrist motions using EMG which is measured from the wrist, the range of application will extend furthermore. Currently, we have constructed a wrist motion recognition system which recognizes the wrist motion of 7 types as an object by using the technique named Simple-FLDA as a feature extraction technique. However, motions with low recognition accuracy were observed, and it was found that the difference of the recognition accuracy is significant at each motion and subject. Because EMG is highly individual and its repeatability is low. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with these problems. In this paper, we try the construction of a system that can learn by giving incremental data to achieve an online tuning. The improvement of the algorithm of Simple-FLDA that incremental learning becomes possible was tried as a technique for the construction of online tuning system.

Feature selection algorithms are generally categorized into two broad categories: algorithms that do not take the following classifier into account (the filter approaches), and algorithms that evaluate the following classifier for each considered feature subset (the wrapper approaches). Filter approaches are typically faster, but wrapper approaches deliver a higher performance. In this paper, we present the algorithm - Predictive Forward Selection - based on the widely used wrapper approach forward selection. Using ideas from meta-learning, the number of required evaluations of the target classifier is reduced by using experience knowledge gained during past feature selection runs on other datasets. We have evaluated our approach on 59 real-world datasets with a focus on SVM as the target classifier. We present comparisons with state-of-the-art wrapper and filter approaches as well as one embedded method for SVM according to accuracy and run-time.

To overcome these drawbacks, this article proposes to apply an emerging machine learning technique, relevance vector machine (RVM), to model and predict the diesel engine performance. The property of global optimal solution of RVM allows the model to be trained using only a few experimental data sets. In this study, the inputs of the model are engine speed, load, and cooling water temperature, while the output parameters are the brake-specific fuel consumption and the amount of exhaust emissions like nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide.

However, the modern sensor set of an autonomous vehicle is malfunctioning when it comes to visual impairing weather conditions such as sun glare, rain, snowfall, haze, and fog. In this thesis, the visual effects of adverse weather influences are removed from camera images using a Generative Adversarial Net (GAN). As a proof-of-concept, we focus on foggy weather conditions, where detectors struggle to identify objects because fog is decreasing the contrast of images recorded by a camera [1]. Therefore, we plan to use our system as a preprocessor, providing richer information to a subsequent detector. ::: Our GAN is based on Pix2PixHD [2] and further developed by using recent advancements in deep learning. A dataset of foggy images with clear weather reference images is created by simulating fog based on a physical model [3]. The GAN is optimized with an extensive hyperparameter search. Our evaluation shows that the GAN reconstructs a clear image using its foggy version as input.

Reliability of Li-ion batteries used in these devices has been recognized as of high importance from a broad range of stakeholders, including medical device manufacturers, regulatory agencies, patients and physicians. To ensure a Li-ion battery operates reliably, it is important to develop health monitoring techniques that accurately estimate the capacity of the battery throughout its life-time. This paper presents a sparse Bayesian learning method that utilizes the charge voltage and current measurements to estimate the capacity of a Li-ion battery used in an implantable medical device.

Cancer prevalence rate has noticeably quickened its pace in Malaysia and the world as we know it.

However, these conventional methods suffer from low diagnosis sensitivity compounded by work-intensive analysis. There have indeed been a number of miRNA studies to tackle the challenges associated with cancer biomarker discovery. However, the existing diagnosis techniques using miRNA suffer from low diagnosis accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The low diagnosis accuracy and sensitivity of the existing techniques stems from the fact that there is extremely low miRNA count in body fluids and the presence of a huge number of irrelevant miRNAs in the expression data. There is also an inevitable problem of cross contamination between cells and exosomes in sample preparation steps. This paper describes the state-of-the-art miRNA-based classifiers for cancer miRNA expression classification. To lower the computational complexity, we employ a heuristic-based miRNA selection approach to select relevant miRNAs that are directly responsible for cancer diagnosis.

The increase in temperature and changes in rainfall pattern may negatively affect their extent and condition, and thus the process of carbon accumulation in wetlands. The introduction of the Sentinel series (S1 and S2) and WorldView space-borne sensors (WV3) have enabled monitoring of herbaceous above ground biomass (AGB) in small and narrow wetlands in semi-arid areas. The objective of this study was to assess (i) the capabilities of the high to moderate resolution sensors such as WV3, S1A and S2A in estimating herbaceous AGB of vegetated wetlands using SAR backscatter, optical reflectance bands, vegetation spectral indices (including Leaf Area Index or LAI measurements) and band ratio datasets and (ii) whether significant differences exists between the AGB ranges of wetland and surrounding dryland vegetation. A bootstrapped Random Forest modelling approach, with variable importance selection, was utilised which incorporated ground collected grass AGB for model calibration and validation. WorldView-3 (WV3) yielded the highest AGB prediction accuracies (R2 = 0.63 and RMSE = 169.28 g/m2) regardless of the incorporation of bands only, indices only or the combination of bands and indices. In general, the optical sensors yielded higher modelling accuracies (improvement in R2 of 0.04-0.07 and RMSE of 11.48\u201317.28 g/m2) than the single Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor but this was marginal depending on the scenario.

Wetlands had significantly higher AGB compared to the surrounding terrestrial grassland (with a mean of about 80 g/m2 more).

On one hand there is the search for better fuel sources while on the other, the development for better driver assistance systems These systems should be capable of maximizing the driver's security and comfort while minimizing the fuel consumption. This can be achieved by the understanding of the environment surrounding the vehicle. Therefore the assistance should use this knowledge of its environment to alert the driver from any situation of risk so that they can be prevented. Moreover, reducing the number of accidents and unnecessary maneuvers will help reduce the fuel consumption by avoiding emergency breaking and other unnecesary situations. This thesis explains the development of a maneuver prediction system for highway scenarios. The system should identify lane changing vehicles with enough time to allow the driver to take the necessary precautions and maintain an efficient and more secure driving. To achieve this gial a set of features that describe the environment around the Ego vehicle is obtained. Afterwards, these Features are analyzed using state of the art data mining techniques and their performance is evaluated using a set of classification algorithms (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Neural networks and Random Forests). According to the present set of input data, it is possible to identify a left lane change from a right lane change with low misclassification error. But it is not possible to identify with the same efficiency a lane change from a no lane change. The best performance was obtained with a random forest where half of the lane changes are recognized while at the same time achieving a low number of false alarms; in another test, using a sub set of data by filtering noisy observations, it was possible to recognize left and right lane changes with more than 70\\% efficiency.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "659074845", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:106955217"}

The study further investigates possible environmental factors that contribute towards gully initiation and development. Analysis was done using a robust machine learning algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM). Additionally, possible environmental factors (i.e. slope steepness, percent vegetation cover, and Topographic Wetness Index, Stream Power Index, and hillslope profile and planform curvature) that could have an influence on the extent of the gullies were also derived. An overall land cover classification accuracy of 94% was achieved, while the overall classification accuracy for gullies was 77%. It was observed that bands located in the visible regions of the EM, red edge and SWIR could optimally discriminate gullies from other land cover types. Additionally, the findings of the study indicate no significant difference between the environmental variables across the different estimated gully volumes and indicate a weak correlation between the variables of R = 0.190526.

The aim is to substantially reduce the number of SNPs such that more specific modeling becomes feasible in a second step. We provide an evaluation of a statistical learning method called \u201cgradient boosting machine\u201d (GBM) that can be used as a filter. GBM does not require an a priori specification of a genetic model, and permits inclusion of large numbers of covariates. GBM can therefore be used to explore multiple GxE interactions, which would not be feasible within the parametric framework used in GWAS. We show in a simulation that GBM performs well even under conditions favorable to the standard additive regression model commonly used in GWAS, and is sensitive to the detection of interaction effects even if one of the interacting variables has a zero main effect. The latter would not be detected in GWAS. Our evaluation is accompanied by an analysis of empirical data concerning hair morphology.

However, early stages of the disease are difficult to ::: diagnose when symptoms are often misdiagnosed with other medical conditions. Though the disease is hard to diagnose in its early stages, early diagnosis of the disease is necessary since medications are most effective at an early stage of the disease. Speech impairment is one of the earliest indicators for PD; therefore early diagnosis of the disease can be performed by using the speech signals. The criteria for designing a system that can be used to detect PD are pre-processing through end-point detection, feature extraction techniques, speech classifiers, database, and performance evaluation. The speech data acquired from the recording of speech signals of 40 subjects (20 PD patients and 20 normal subjects).

As a result, online viscosity prediction in industrial polyester polymerization processes is not an easy task. An efficient data-driven prediction model is considered in this work. In order to solve the problem of low accuracy of the online viscosity measuring instrument and considerably time-consuming laboratory analysis, variables that are easily monitored during the polymerization process, i.e. temperature and pressure in the main reactor as well as the viscometer values, are selected to establish an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) viscosity prediction model.

There are several key factors which affect the perception of quality including color, tenderness, juiciness and flavor. To support consumers repurchase choices, there is a need for an objective measurement of quality that could be applied to meat prior to its sale. Objective approaches such as offered by spectral technologies may be useful, but the analytical algorithms used remain to be optimized. For visible and near infrared (VISNIR) spectroscopy, Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) is a widely used technique for meat related quality modeling and prediction. In this paper, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based machine learning approach is presented to predict beef eating quality traits. Although SVM has been successfully used in various disciplines, it has not been applied extensively in the analysis of meat quality parameters. To this end, the performance of PLSR and SVM as tools for the analysis of meat tenderness is evaluated, using a large dataset acquired under industrial conditions. The spectral dataset was collected using VISNIR spectroscopy with the wavelength ranging from 350nm to 1800nm on 234 beef M. longissimus thoracis steaks from heifers, steers and young bulls. As the dimensionality with the VISNIR data is very high (over 1600 spectral bands), the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique was applied for feature extraction and data reduction. The extracted principal components (less than 100) were then used for data modeling and prediction. The prediction results showed that SVM has a greater potential to predict beef eating quality than PLSR, especially for the prediction of tenderness. The influence of animal gender on beef quality prediction was also investigated, and it was found that beef quality traits were predicted most accurately in beef from young bulls.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10812-015-0076-1", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Applied Spectroscopy", "mag_id": "1981133190", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["18951389", "10961499", "5387296", "113922073", "14423488", "59483684", "189715", "134898699", "215208000", "211058120", "62900743", "56347887", "54680710"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:93879265"}

As most structural models, the GCRF model does not scale well with large networks. One of the approaches consists of performing calculations on factor graphs (if it is possible) rather than on the full graph, which is more computationally efficient. The Kronecker product of the graphs appears to be a natural choice for a graph decomposition. However, this idea is not straightforwardly applicable for GCRF, since characterizing a Laplacian spectrum of the Kronecker product of graphs, which GCRF is based on, from spectra of its factor graphs has remained an open problem. In this paper we apply new estimations for the Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and achieve high prediction accuracy of the proposed models, while the computational complexity of the models, compared to the original GCRF model, is improved from $O(n_{1}^{3}n_{2}^{3})$ to $O(n_{1}^{3} + n_{2}^{3})$. Furthermore, we study the GCRF model with a non-Kronecker graph, where the model consists of finding the nearest Kronecker product of graph for an initial graph.

These are time dependent neural networks with realistic models for the neurons (Hodgkin-Huxley). In addition the learning is biologically plausible as well, being a Hebbian approach based on spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). To make the approach very general and flexible, neurogenesis and synaptogenesis have been implemented, which allows the code to automatically add or remove neurons (or synapses) as required. Index Terms : Computational Neuroscience, Neural Plasticity, & Connectionist Approaches I. I NTRODUCTION raditional rate-based neural networks and the newer spiking neural networks have been shown to be very effective for some tasks, but they have problems with long term learning and \"catastrophic forgetting.\" Once a network is trained to perform some task, it is difficult to adapt it to new applications. To do this properly, one can mimic processes that occur in the human brain: neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, or the birth and death of both neurons and synapses. To be effective, however, this must be accomplished while maintaining the current memories. There have been many other examples of adaptive or evolving neural networks. Grossberg's adaptive resonance theory (ART) [1] is one of the most well-known. There are also self organizing maps (SOM) [2]. Evolving connectionist systems are discussed in [3] and evolving spiking neural networks are discussed in [4]. Many of these are summarized in Haykin's book [5] and a review paper by Widrow [6]. The adaptive part of the approach discussed here is the ability to add and remove neurons and synapses. In this paper we will describe a new computational approach that uses neurogenesis and synaptogenesis to continually learn and grow. Neurons and synapses can be added and removed from the simulation while it runs. The learning is accomplished using a variant of the spike time dependent plasticity method, which we have recently developed [7]. This Hebbian learning algorithm uses a combination of homeostasis of synapse weights, spike timing, and stochastic forgetting to achieve stable and efficient", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2183087202", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61531685"}

This article presents a novel method for real-time segmentation of catheters and guidewires in 2d X-ray images. We employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and propose a transfer learning approach, using synthetic fluoroscopic images, to develop a lightweight version of the U-Net architecture. Our strategy, requiring a small amount of manually annotated data, streamlines the training process and results in a U-Net model, which achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art segmentation, with a decreased number of trainable parameters. MethodsThe proposed transfer learning approach exploits high-fidelity synthetic images generated from real fluroscopic backgrounds. We implement a two-stage process, initial end-to-end training and fine-tuning, to develop two versions of our model, using synthetic and phantom fluoroscopic images independently. A small number of manually annotated in-vivo images is employed to fine-tune the deepest 7 layers of the U-Net architecture, producing a network specialized for pixel-wise catheter/guidewire segmentation. The network takes as input a single grayscale image and outputs the segmentation result as a binary mask against the background. ResultsEvaluation is carried out with images from in-vivo fluoroscopic video sequences from six endovascular procedures, with different surgical setups. We validate the effectiveness of developing the U-Net models using synthetic data, in tests where fine-tuning and testing in-vivo takes place both by dividing data from all procedures into independent fine-tuning/testing subsets as well as by using different in-vivo sequences. Accurate catheter/guidewire segmentation (average Dice coefficient of ~ 0.55, ~ 0.26 and ~ 0.17) is obtained with both U-Net models. Compared to the state-of-the-art CNN models, the proposed U-Net achieves comparable performance ( \u00b1 5% average Dice coefficients) in terms of segmentation accuracy, while yielding a 84% reduction of the testing time. This adds flexibility for real-time operation and makes our network adaptable to increased input resolution. ConclusionsThis work presents a new approach in the development of CNN models for pixel-wise segmentation of surgical catheters in X-ray fluoroscopy, exploiting synthetic images and transfer learning. Our methodology reduces the need for manually annotating large volumes of data for training. This represents an important advantage, given that manual pixel-wise annotations is a key bottleneck in developing CNN segmentation models. Combined with a simplified U-Net model, our work yields significant advantages compared to current state-of-the-art solutions.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32171151", "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105420", "venue": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "mag_id": "3006982732", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212718463"}

Most current methods always aim at learning a global distance metric to overcome the visual appearance changes between images from different cameras. However, the feature variations between images are not constant over the entire feature space, thus one global metric is not always applicable to all feature variation conditions. Moreover, few of the current methods take the modality discrepancy between different cameras into consideration during the metric learning process. To address these drawbacks, we propose Parametric Local MultiModal (PLMM) metric learning in this paper. We consider the feature difference value of one pair of images, which come from different cameras, characterizing one kind of feature variations. Accordingly, we learn a unique local metric for each image pair. Moreover, images from different cameras are regarded as lying on different modalities, and thus in each local metric, two different projection matrixes are learned for the cross-modality similarity measures. To balance the locality and computation efficiency, the local metrics are parameterized as weighted linear combinations of basis metrics, which correspond to a small set of anchor image pairs. The local metrics are capable of modeling the cross-modality feature variations among different cameras, making the distance of intra-class image pairs minimized and simultaneously those of inter-class image pairs maximized. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach obtains competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods on three publicly available benchmarks.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICPR.2014.445", "venue": "2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition", "journal": "2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1981799693", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7973738", "6485959", "3961724", "2059819", "12799509", "13619630", "5103649", "125621430", "1045818", "2675059", "47325215", "2261947", "202473", "15225312", "14627589", "4269137", "7342597", "10070153", "4149132", "17966229"], "inbound_citations": ["3423852", "199587917"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5457077"}

The learned metrics place similar pairs in local neighborhoods and dissimilar pairs in relatively orthogonal regions on a regularized manifold.

The proposed method is tested on five action video data sets and three facial expression data sets and is compared with various state-of-the-art methods.

While learning embedding models has yielded fruitful results in several NLP subfields, most notably Word2Vec, embedding correspondence has relatively not been well explored especially in the context of NLU, a task that typically extracts structured semantic knowledge from a text. A NLU embedding model can facilitate analyzing and understanding relationships between unstructured texts and their corresponding structured semantic knowledge, essential for both researchers and practitioners of NLU. Toward this end, we propose a framework that learns to embed semantic correspondence between text and its extracted semantic knowledge, called semantic frame . One key contributed technique is semantic frame reconstruction used to derive a one-to-one mapping between embedded vectors and their corresponding semantic frames. Embedding into semantically meaningful vectors and computing their distances in vector space provides a simple, but effective way to measure semantic similarities.

Using the Illumina Methylation 850K Beadchip, 44 relapse-related CpGs were identified from 49 T-LBL samples by two algorithms, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operation (LASSO) and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE). We built a four-CpG classifier using LASSO Cox regression based on association between the methylation level of CpGs and relapse-free survival (RFS) in the training cohort (n=160).The four-CpG classifier was validated in the internal testing cohort (n=68) and independent validation cohort (n=321) Results: The four-CpG-based classifier discriminated T-LBL patients at high risk of relapse in the training cohort from those at low risk (p<0.001).This classifier also showed good predictive value in the internal testing cohort (p<0.001) and the independent validation cohort(p<0.001). A nomogram incorporating 5 independent prognostic factors including the CpG-based classifier, lactate dehydrogenase levels, ECOG-PS, central nervous system involvement and NOTCH1/FBXW7 status showed a significantly higher predictive accuracy than each single variable. Stratification into different subgroups by the nomogram helped identify the subset of patients who most benefited from more intensive chemotherapy and/or sequential hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Our four-CpG-based classifier could predict disease relapse in patients with T-LBL, and could be used to guide treatment decision.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32234760", "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-4207", "venue": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "mag_id": "3014506572", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214772322"}

However, the Levelized Costs Of Energy (LCOE) is still higher than the LCOE of traditional energy production methods like nuclear power or energy from coals or gas. This research focuses on a further decrease of the LCOE, by minimizing the mass of a monopile support structure of a wind turbine. This is done in a so called integrated way: Optimizing the tower and the foundation together. The design variables used in this research are the wall thickness and the diameter of every +-3 meter section. These can even be cylindrical or conical. To simplify the problem, a parametrization of the designs is used, which reduces the design variables from around 180 to 28. This is checked with existing designs. Due to the interaction between mostly the first eigenfrequency and eigenmode, the diameter and the waves, it is expected that several local optima exist. Therefore, the proposed optimization strategy is a Particle Swarm Optimization which can be used for a global search for an initial position for a gradient based optimization to find a local optimum, which is possibly the global optimum. In this research the focus is on the Particle Swarm Optimization. The constraints of the optimization are Fatigue, Buckling, the maximum deflection of the monopile, the angle of the conical parts and the D/t-ratio of the monopile. These are used in the initial design of support structures, so that the optimized designs are realistic. To take the constraints into account, the objective is taken as the mass extended by the penalized constraints. To reduce the optimization time, the evaluations of the objective function are done by using load estimations instead of extensive load calculations. Several methods are compared on a theoretical basis: Response Surface Methodology, Radial Basis Functions, Kriging, Support Vector Regression, Multi-adaptive Regression Splines and Non-Uniform Regression B-Splines. The performance of a selection of methods is checked on the problem, to come up with reliable estimation methods. To improve the accuracy of the estimations, interaction of Particle Swarm Optimization and the estimators is proposed via estimator updating. During this research, an optimization tool for monopile support structures is developed. This tool is able to use calculations or estimations of the loads. In order to study the behaviour of the proposed optimization approach and to compare it with the traditional design approach, several case studies are formulated based on a realistic design problem. These are optimized with the optimization tool. Using a constant tower diameter, the optimization tool is able to reduce the mass of the support structure with 13\\%. Using the tower diameter also as design variable in the optimization gives a further reduction of the mass with 4\\%. Several test runs are done, to check whether a global optimum is found or not.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2611647628", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114497091"}

Random Forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning data driven method that is rarely used in water resources studies, and thus has not been evaluated thoroughly in this field, when compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques key advantages of RF include: its non-parametric nature; high predictive accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. This last characteristic can be used to better understand the individual role and the combined effect of explanatory variables in both protecting and exposing groundwater from and to a pollutant. In this paper, the performance of the RF regression for predictive modeling of nitrate pollution is explored, based on intrinsic and specific vulnerability assessment of the Vega de Granada aquifer. The applicability of this new machine learning technique is demonstrated in an agriculture-dominated area where nitrate concentrations in groundwater can exceed the trigger value of 50 mg/L, at many locations. A comprehensive GIS database of twenty-four parameters related to intrinsic hydrogeologic proprieties, driving forces, remotely sensed variables and physical\u2013chemical variables measured in \u201csitu\u201d, were used as inputs to build different predictive models of nitrate pollution. RF measures of importance were also used to define the most significant predictors of nitrate pollution in groundwater, allowing the establishment of the pollution sources (pressures). The potential of RF for generating a vulnerability map to nitrate pollution is assessed considering multiple criteria related to variations in the algorithm parameters and the accuracy of the maps. The performance of the RF is also evaluated in comparison to the logistic regression (LR) method using different efficiency measures to ensure their generalization ability. Prediction results show the ability of RF to build accurate models with strong predictive capabilities.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24463255", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.01.001", "venue": "The Science of the total environment", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "mag_id": "2038913727", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["134962877", "53304046", "104445697", "134521216", "34589712", "24200178", "14125575", "56438018", "164942937", "131740518", "199668095", "55470215", "20077003", "42940817", "214783721", "125146708", "14128173", "202777275", "88374667", "134440798", "49886427", "208869726"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1667908"}

Various spam filtering techniques have been so far proposed, mainly based on Naive Bayesian algorithms. Other Machine Learning algorithms like Boosting trees, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) have already been used with success. However, the number of False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN) resulting through applying various spam e-mail filters still remains too high and the problem of spam e-mail categorization cannot be solved completely from a practical viewpoint. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for spam e-mail filtering based on efficient information theoretic techniques for integrating classifiers, for extracting improved features and for properly evaluating categorization accuracy in terms of FP and FN. The goal of the presented methodology is to empirically but explicitly minimize these FP and FN numbers by combining high-performance FP filters with high-performance FN filters emerging from a previous work of the authors [Zorkadis, V., Panayotou, M., & Karras, D.

The experiments conducted are of the most extensive ones so far in the literature, exploiting widely accepted benchmarking e-mail data sets and comparing the proposed methodology with the Naive Bayes spam filter as well as with the Boosting tree methodology, the classification via regression and other machine learning models. It is illustrated by means of novel information theoretic measures of FP & FN filtering performance that the proposed approach is very favorably compared to the other rival methods.

Because even \"simple\" biological systems are difficult to control, we have used connectionist networks in order to inquire into the question of whether a chaotic signal originating in one part of the nervous system can be learned and transmitted by another. We have examined a number of different architectures, and report here the findings for a simple network consisting of one input unit, four hidden units, and one output unit. During training sessions, the input of the circuit was given analog values of either the 3.60 or 3.95 logistic equation, or of one variable of the three-variable R\u00f6ssler attractor. The backpropagated error in the learning algorithm was a function of the difference between the input value and the output at each iteration. Iterations involving small changes in analog value resulted in good similarity between the input and output signals, but little learning occurred because of the small error propagated back to the synapses. With larger differences in the analog values (and larger feedback error) at each iteration, we found that networks learned to transmit different chaotic attractors. Once the network learned one input, it could transmit another without changing the synapses.

In this paper, we propose a shrinkage expansion adaptive metric learning (SEAML) method by defining a novel shrinkage-expansion rule for adaptive pairwise constraints. SEAML is very effective in learning metrics from data with complex distributions. Meanwhile, it also suggests a new rule to assess the similarity between a pair of samples based on whether their distance is shrunk or expanded after metric learning. Our extensive experimental results demonstrated that SEAML achieves better performance than state-of-the-art metric learning methods.

Secondly, Pronunciation Space Models (PSMs) are proposed to enhance the discriminative capability of the acoustic models for pronunciation variations. In PSMs, each phone is modeled with several parallel acoustic models to represent pronunciation variations of that phone at different proficiency levels, and an unsupervised method is proposed for the construction of the PSMs. Experiments on a database consisting of more than 500,000 Mandarin syllables collected from 1335 Chinese speakers show that the proposed methods can significantly outperform the traditional posterior probability based method. The overall recall rates for the 13 most frequently mispronounced phones increase from 17.2%, 7.6% and 0% to 58.3%, 44.3% and 29.5% at three precision levels of 60%, 70% and 80%, respectively.

Urban built-up area extraction using moderate resolution remotely sensed data (e.g. Landsat TM/ETM+) presents numerous challenges, such as very heterogeneous spectral features of urban areas, spectral confusion between built-up class and others. Considering that image texture is one of the important spatial information for identifying urban land cover, a new methodology to address these issues is proposed. This approach involves processes as the following, as a first step, multivariate texture is computed through multivariate variogram.

We maintain that people often change their beliefs in ways driven by considerations of explanatory coherence. This report describes computational model of how experimental subjects revise their naive beliefs about physical motion. First, instances are presented in which subjects changed their beliefs while learning elementary physics. Each of these cases involved an individual's attempt to explain a surprising observation. Next, we show how their belief revisions can be modeled using ECHO, a connectionist computer program that uses constraint satisfaction techniques to implement a theory of explanatory coherence. The resulting simulations even captured temporal characteristics of the observed changes in beliefs. Finally, the model's representational sensitivity and procedural robustness are discussed and one can show how ECHO can be used to generate empirical predictions about subjects' current beliefs.

Molecular tumor classifications resulted from these data and learning algorithms have advanced our understanding of genetic changes associated with cancer etiology and development. However, classifications are not always perfect and in such cases the classification rankings (likelihoods of correct class predictions) can be useful for directing further research (e.g., by deriving inferences about predictive indicators or prioritizing future experiments). Classification ranking is a challenging problem, particularly for microarray data, where there is a huge number of possible regulated genes with no known rating function. This study investigates the possibility of making tumor classification more informative by using a method for classification ranking that requires no additional ranking analysis and maintains relatively good classification accuracy.ResultsMicroarray data of 11 different types and subtypes of cancer were analyzed using MDR (Multi-Dimensional Ranker), a recently developed boosting-based ranking algorithm. The number of predictor genes in all of the resulting classification models was at most nine, a huge reduction from the more than 12 thousands genes in the majority of the expression samples. Compared to several other learning algorithms, MDR gives the greatest AUC (area under the ROC curve) for the classifications of prostate cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and four ALL subtypes: BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, MALL and TALL. SVM (Support Vector Machine) gives the highest AUC for the classifications of lung, lymphoma, and breast cancers, and two ALL subtypes: Hyperdiploid > 50 and TEL-AML1. MDR gives highly competitive results, producing the highest average AUC, 91.01%, and an average overall accuracy of 90.01% for cancer expression analysis.ConclusionUsing the classification rankings from MDR is a simple technique for obtaining effective and informative tumor classifications from cancer gene expression data. Further interpretation of the results obtained from MDR is required. MDR can also be used directly as a simple feature selection mechanism to identify genes relevant to tumor classification. MDR may be applicable to many other classification problems for microarray data.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2559886", "pubmed_id": "18831787", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-9-S2-S21", "venue": "BMC Genomics", "journal": "BMC Genomics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2031909174", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["4382833", "9434141", "7159780", "10844362", "10570640", "8406472", "2914506", "15137899", "8019204", "2884606", "5262555"], "inbound_citations": ["15805933", "403501", "14557771", "1854893", "11014114", "15468532", "7535066", "215310391", "6115574", "46810705", "18337920", "7205827", "5812989", "12411133", "211222545", "8784842", "59062246", "198962973", "6817003", "59192696", "46788091", "17268878", "12036845", "14392109", "90026236", "1578191", "9735935"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7314966"}

We will present the method used to transform the 3D point cloud to a depth image and the region based segmentation method used to segment the depth images before shape features are computed on the segmented images.

Over open oceans, altimeter return waveforms generally correspond to the Brown model, and by inversion, estimated shape parameters provide mean surface height and wind speed. However, in coastal areas or over inland waters, the waveform shape is often distorted by land influence, resulting in peaks or fast decaying trailing edges. As a result, derived sea surface heights are then less accurate and waveforms need to be reprocessed by sophisticated algorithms. To this end, this work suggests a novel Spatio-Temporal Altimetry Retracking (STAR) technique. We show that STAR enables the derivation of sea surface heights over the open ocean as well as over coastal regions of at least the same quality as compared to existing retracking methods, but for a larger number of cycles and thus retaining more useful data. Novel elements of our method are (a) integrating information from spatially and temporally neighboring waveforms through a conditional random field approach, (b) sub-waveform detection, where relevant sub-waveforms are separated from corrupted or non-relevant parts through a sparse representation approach, and (c) identifying the final best set of sea surfaces heights from multiple likely heights using Dijkstra's algorithm. We apply STAR to data from the Jason-1, Jason-2 and Envisat missions for study sites in the Gulf of Trieste, Italy and in the coastal region of the Ganges\u2013Brahmaputra\u2013Meghna estuary, Bangladesh. We compare to several established and recent retracking methods, as well as to tide gauge data.

It provides essential molecules and energies for living organisms. To date, several metabolic pathways have been uncovered. However, their completeness is still on the way. A number of prediction methods have been built to assign chemicals into certain metabolic pathway, which can further be used to predict novel latent chemicals for a given metabolic pathway. However, they did not make use of chemical properties in a system level to construct prediction models. In this study, we applied a network integration method, which can extract topological features from different chemical networks, representing chemical associations from their different properties, and fused several high-dimension vector representations into a low-dimension vector representation for each chemical. The compact vector representations were fed into the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to construct the prediction model. To tackle the problem that one chemical can participate in more than one pathway type, we construct an SVM-based binary prediction model for each pathway type to determine whether a given chemical can participate in the pathway type. Furthermore, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was adopted to weaken the influence of imbalanced dataset. Each binary model gave a quite good performance and was superior to the classic prediction model, indicating that the proposed models can be useful tools for integrating heterogeneous information to assign chemicals into correct metabolic pathways.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30520371", "doi": "10.2174/1386207322666181206112641", "venue": "Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening", "journal": "Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening", "mag_id": "2904107098", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204109540", "145023786", "215474326", "209489745", "215360154", "201116451", "57013417"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54564978"}

The imaging process of range-gated imaging system in atmosphere associates with lots of factors, such as back scattering, background radiation, diffraction limit and the vibration of the platform. On one hand, due to the difficulty of constructing models for all factors, the kernels from physical-model based methods are not strictly accurate and practical. On the other hand, there are few strong edges in images, which brings significant errors to most of image-feature-based methods. Since different methods focus on different formation factors of the kernel, their results often complement each other. Therefore, we propose an approach which combines physical model with image features. With an fusion strategy using GCRF (Gaussian Conditional Random Fields) framework, we get a final kernel which is closer to the actual one. Aiming at the problem that ground-truth image is difficult to obtain, we then propose a semi data-driven fusion method in which different data sets are used to train fusion parameters. Finally, a semi blind restoration strategy based on EM (Expectation Maximization) and RL (Richardson-Lucy) algorithm is proposed. Our methods not only models how the lasers transfer in the atmosphere and imaging in the ICCD (Intensified CCD) plane, but also quantifies other unknown degraded factors using image-based methods, revealing how multiple kernel elements interact with each other.

Some finance companies have separate domain expert teams and data scientists who are working on identifying fraudulent activities. Data Scientists often use complex statistical models to identify frauds. However, there are many disadvantages to this approach. Fraud detection is not real-time and therefore, in many cases fraudulent activities are identified only after the actual fraud has happened. These methodologies are prone to human errors. In addition, it requires expensive, highly skilled domain expert teams and data scientists. Nevertheless, the accuracy of manual fraud detection methodologies are low and due to that, it is very difficult to handle large volumes of data. More often, it requires time-consuming investigations into the other transactions related to the fraudulent activity in order to identify fraudulent activity patterns. Finance companies are not getting adequate return of interest (ROI) despite the resources and money spent on these traditional methodologies. Most of the traditional fraud detection methodologies focused on discrete data points. (User accounts, IP addresses devices, etc...) However, these methodologies are no longer sufficient for today's needs. As fraudsters and hackers are using more advanced and cutting edge techniques to mask their fraudulent activities even from the sharpest eyes. These methodologies can only detect known types of attacks, therefore an analytical approach is required to address these drawbacks of the traditional methodologies. The aim of this paper is to review selected machine learning and outlier detection techniques that can be integrated into a fraud detection system for financial transactions.

The existing approaches mainly focus on enhancing the quality of a single frame, ignoring the similarity between consecutive frames. In this paper, we investigate that heavy quality fluctuation exists across compressed video frames, and thus low quality frames can be enhanced using the neighboring high quality frames, seen as Multi-Frame Quality Enhancement (MFQE). Accordingly, this paper proposes an MFQE approach for compressed video, as a first attempt in this direction. In our approach, we firstly develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based detector to locate Peak Quality Frames (PQFs) in compressed video. Then, a novel Multi-Frame Convolutional Neural Network (MF-CNN) is designed to enhance the quality of compressed video, in which the non-PQF and its nearest two PQFs are as the input. The MF-CNN compensates motion between the non-PQF and PQFs through the Motion Compensation subnet (MC-subnet). Subsequently, the Quality Enhancement subnet (QE-subnet) reduces compression artifacts of the non-PQF with the help of its nearest PQFs. Finally, the experiments validate the effectiveness and generality of our MFQE approach in advancing the state-of-the-art quality enhancement of compressed video.

However, the conditional data generated from WTGS operating in a tough environment is always dynamical and high-dimensional. To address these challenges, we propose a new fault diagnosis scheme which is composed of multiple extreme learning machines (ELM) in a hierarchical structure, where a forwarding list of ELM layers is concatenated and each of them is processed independently for its corresponding role. The framework enables both representational feature learning and fault classification. The multi-layered ELM based representational learning covers functions including data preprocessing, feature extraction and dimension reduction. An ELM based autoencoder is trained to generate a hidden layer output weight matrix, which is then used to transform the input dataset into a new feature representation. Compared with the traditional feature extraction methods which may empirically wipe off some \u201cinsignificant\u2019 feature information that in fact conveys certain undiscovered important knowledge, the introduced representational learning method could overcome the loss of information content. The computed output weight matrix projects the high dimensional input vector into a compressed and orthogonally weighted distribution. The last single layer of ELM is applied for fault classification. Unlike the greedy layer wise learning method adopted in back propagation based deep learning (DL), the proposed framework does not need iterative fine-tuning of parameters. To evaluate its experimental performance, comparison tests are carried out on a wind turbine generator simulator.

Accounts of monitoring of language posit an internal route by which production planning or competition between candidate representations provide predictive signals that monitoring is required to prevent error, and an external route in which output is monitored using the comprehension system. Abnormal reliance on the external route has been associated with damage to brain regions critical for sensory-motor transformation and a pattern of gradual error \u2018clean-up\u2019 called conduite d'approche (CD). Action pantomime data from 67 participants with left hemisphere stroke were consistent with versions of internal route theories positing that competition signals monitoring requirements. Support Vector Regression Lesion Symptom Mapping (SVR-LSM) showed that lesions in the inferior parietal, posterior temporal, and arcuate fasciculus/superior longitudinal fasciculus predicted action conduite d'approche, overlapping the regions previously observed in the language domain. A second experiment with 12 patients who produced substantial action CD assessed whether factors impacting the internal route (action production ability, competition) versus external route (vision of produced actions, action comprehension) influenced correction attempts. In these \u2018high CD\u2019 patients, vision of produced actions and integrity of gesture comprehension interacted to determine successful error correction, supporting external route theories. Viewed together, these and other data suggest that skilled actions are monitored both by an internal route in which conflict aids in detection and correction of errors during production planning, and an external route that detects mismatches between produced actions and stored knowledge of action appearance. The parallels between language and action monitoring mechanisms and neuroanatomical networks pave the way for further exploration of common and distinct processes across these domains.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6513694", "pubmed_id": "30831536", "doi": "10.1016/j.cortex.2019.01.032", "venue": "Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior", "journal": "Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior", "mag_id": "2913258180", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["213498386"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:72335427"}

In this study, a track geometry data set from Melbourne tram network has been used as the case study and gauge deviation parameter is selected as the main parameter to develop TDI. For prediction of the future TDI, Random Forests (RF) model as a Machine Learning (ML) model is used to predict the future TDI of the data set. Since TDI is a continuous variable, Random Forests Regression (RFR) model is applied. In this study, RF model has added two algorithms to the basic Decision Trees (DT) model including bagging and random subspace method.

In this study, we proposed a new computational predictor called IDP\u207bCRF, which is trained on an updated benchmark dataset based on the MobiDB database and the DisProt database, and incorporates more comprehensive sequence-based features, including PSSMs (position-specific scoring matrices), kmer, predicted secondary structures, and relative solvent accessibilities. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset and two independent datasets show that IDP\u207bCRF outperforms 25 existing state-of-the-art methods in this field, demonstrating that IDP\u207bCRF is a very useful tool for identifying IDPs/IDRs (intrinsically disordered proteins/regions).

Therapists involved in interventions must overcome the communication impairments generally exhibited by children with ASD by adeptly inferring the affective cues of the children to adjust the intervention accordingly. Similarly, an intelligent system, such as a computer or robot, must also be able to understand the affective needs of these children an ability that the current technologyassisted ASD intervention systems lack to achieve effective interaction that addresses the role of affective states in human-computer interaction (HCI), human-robot interaction (HRI), and intervention practice. In this chapter we present a physiology-based affect-inference mechanism for emotion modeling, emotion recognition, and emotion-sensitive adaptive response in technology-assisted intervention. This work is the first step towards developing \u201cunderstanding\u201d interactive technologies for use in future ASD intervention. We address the problem of how to make computer-based ASD intervention tools affect-sensitive by designing therapist-like affective models of the children with ASD based on their physiological responses. By employing these models, we explain how a robot can detect the affective states of a child with ASD and adapt its behaviors accordingly. Experimental results with 6 children with ASD from computer-based cognitive tasks and a proof-ofconcept experiment (i.e., a robot-based basketball game) are presented. A Support Vector Machines (SVM) based affective model yielded approximately 82.9% success for predicting affect inferred from a therapist. The robot learned the individual liking level of each child with regard to the game configuration and selected appropriate behaviors to present the task at his/her preferred liking level. Results show the robot automatically predicted individual liking level in real time with 81.1% accuracy. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that the affective states of children with ASD have been detected via a physiology-based affect recognition technique in real time. This is also the first time that the impact of affect-sensitive closed-loop interaction between a robot and a child with ASD has been demonstrated experimentally. While there is at present no single accepted intervention, treatment, or known cure for ASD, there is growing consensus that intensive behavioral and educational intervention programs can significantly improve long term outcomes for individuals and their families (Rogers,", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/6171", "venue": "RO-MAN 2008", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1560672969", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17089886", "145063520", "42498245", "25000167", "142040243", "194951", "62117949", "145767822", "11311200", "210837902", "19338381", "14119984", "145335013", "61960077", "38752392", "12710581", "1037743", "1005449", "183645", "145252025", "32945495", "14405398", "20362245", "33695419", "145592330", "16726452", "10360749", "65570", "13899397", "42455523", "818413", "28433797", "18280419", "19044254", "3194342", "17078137", "149499807", "32318315", "25508578", "43552020", "30426438", "144245980", "142921615", "209060765"], "inbound_citations": ["2346072", "16760622", "13869738", "183645", "35103805"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:183645"}

Herein, we investigate the performance of multitask deep neural networks (MT-DNNs) compared to random forest (RF) classification, a standard method in machine learning, in predicting compound profiling experiments. Predictions were carried out on a large profiling matrix extracted from biological screening data. For model building, submatrices with varying data density of 5-100% were generated to investigate the influence of data sparseness on prediction performance. MT-DNN models were directly compared to RF models, and control calculations were also carried out using single-task DNNs (ST-DNNs). On the basis of compound recall, the performance of ST-DNN was consistently lower than that of the other methods. Compared to RF, MT-DNN models only yielded better prediction performance for individual assays in the profiling matrix when training data were very sparse. However, when the matrix density increased to at least 25-45%, per-assay RF models met or partly exceeded the prediction performance of MT-DNN models. When the average performances of RF and MT-DNN over the grid of all targets were compared, MT-DNN was slightly superior to RF, which was a likely consequence of multitask learning. Overall, there was no consistent advantage of MT-DNN over standard RF classification in predicting the results of compound profiling assays under varying conditions. In the presence of very sparse training data, prediction performance was limited. Under these challenging conditions, MT-DNN was the preferred approach.

In this paper, a prediction model was developed to estimate the concentrate grade and recovery rate of a flotation circuit based on adaptive principal component analysis (APCA) and composite kernel support vector regression (CK-SVR). Firstly, the flotation prior knowledge and APCA are employed to reduce the dimension of input vector of CK-SVR. Then, considering that the characteristics of kernels have great impacts on learning and predictive results of SVR, a composite kernel SVR modeling method based on polynomial kernel and RBF kernel is adopted which hyperparameters are adaptively evolved by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

However, generating candidate chemical compounds for solar cells is a time-consuming process requiring thousands of hours of laboratory analysis. For a solar cell, the most important property is the power conversion efficiency which is dependent on the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) values of the donor molecules. Recently, machine learning techniques have proved to be very useful in building predictive models for HOMO values of donor structures of Organic Photovoltaic Cells (OPVs). Since experimental datasets are limited in size, current machine learning models are trained on data derived from calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Molecular line notations such as SMILES or InChI are popular input representations for describing the molecular structure of donor molecules. The two types of line representations encode different information, such as SMILES defines the bond types while InChi defines protonation. In this work, we present an ensemble deep neural network architecture, called SINet, which harnesses both the SMILES and InChI molecular representations to predict HOMO values and leverage the potential of transfer learning from a sizeable DFT-computed dataset- Harvard CEP to build more robust predictive models for relatively smaller HOPV datasets. Harvard CEP dataset contains molecular structures and properties for 2.3 million candidate donor structures for OPV while HOPV contains DFT-computed and experimental values of 350 and 243 molecules respectively.

However GANs are known to be very hard to train, suffering from problems such as mode collapse and disturbing visual artifacts. Batch normalization (BN) techniques have been introduced to address the training. Though BN accelerates the training in the beginning, our experiments show that the use of BN can be unstable and negatively impact the quality of the trained model. The evaluation of BN and numerous other recent schemes for improving GAN training is hindered by the lack of an effective objective quality measure for GAN models. To address these issues, we first introduce a weight normalization (WN) approach for GAN training that significantly improves the stability, efficiency and the quality of the generated samples. To allow a methodical evaluation, we introduce squared Euclidean reconstruction error on a test set as a new objective measure, to assess training performance in terms of speed, stability, and quality of generated samples. Our experiments with a standard DCGAN architecture on commonly used datasets (CelebA, LSUN bedroom, and CIFAR-10) indicate that training using WN is generally superior to BN for GANs, achieving 10% lower mean squared loss for reconstruction and significantly better qualitative results than BN. We further demonstrate the stability of WN on a 21-layer ResNet trained with the CelebA data set.

Traditional research usually achieves eye tracking by employing intrusive infrared-based techniques or expensive eye trackers. Nowadays, there are more and more needs to analyze user behaviors from tracking eye attention in general applications, in which users usually use a consumer-grade computer or even laptop with an inexpensive webcam. To satisfy the requirements of rapid developments of such applications and reduce the cost, it is no more practical to apply intrusive techniques or use expensive/specific equipment. In this paper, we propose a real-time eye-gaze estimation system by using a general low-resolution webcam, which can estimate eye-gaze accurately without expensive or specific equipment, and also without an intrusive detection process. An illuminance filtering approach is designed to remove the influence from light changes so that the eyes can be detected correctly from the low-resolution webcam video frames. A hybrid model combining the position criterion and an angle-based eye detection strategy are also derived to locate the eyes accurately and efficiently.

This makes a decentralized learning-based framework appealing for sharing and aggregating learned knowledge in-between the local models that map the obtained metrics to the user QoE, such as Mean Opinion Scores (MOS).

We show that the proposed approach is agnostic to specific ML algorithms, stacked upon each other, as it does not necessitate the collaborating localized nodes to run the same ML algorithm.

Meditation-related changes in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) have been previously reported, particularly in the default mode network, frontoparietal (FP) attentional circuits, saliency-related regions, and primary sensory cortices. We collected fMRI data from a sample of 12 experienced Zen meditators and 12 meditation-naive matched controls during a basic attention-to-breathing protocol, together with behavioral performance outside the scanner on a set of computerized neuropsychological tests. We adopted a network system of 209 nodes, classified into 9 functional modules, and a multi-stage approach to identify rsFC differences in meditators and controls. Between-group comparisons of modulewise FC, summarized by the first principal component of the relevant set of edges, revealed important connections of FP circuits with early visual and executive control areas. We also identified several group differences in positive and negative edgewise FC, often involving the visual or FP regions. Multivariate pattern analysis of modulewise FC, using Support Vector Machine (SVM), classified meditators and controls with 79% accuracy and selected 10 modulewise connections that were jointly prominent in distinguishing meditators and controls; a similar SVM procedure based on the subjects' scores on the neuropsychological battery yielded a slightly weaker accuracy (75%). Finally, we observed a good correlation between the across-subject variation in strength of modulewise connections among FP, executive, and visual circuits, on the one hand, and in the performance on a rapid visual information processing (RVIP) test of sustained attention, on the other.

This thesis undertakes this assessment through four main experiments based on combined RADARSAT-2 and SPOT-5 imagery of the southern part of Reunion Island. In Experiment 1, the use of feature selection for dimensionality reduction was considered. The rankings of important features for both single-sensor and dual-sensor data were assessed for four dates spanning a 6-month period, which coincided with both the wet and dry season. The mean textural features produced from the optical bands were consistently ranked highly across all dates. In the two later dates (29 May and 9 August 2014), the SAR features were more prevalent, showing that SAR and optical data have complementary natures. SAR data can be used to separate classes when optical imagery is insufficient. Experiment 2 compared the accuracy of six supervised and machine learning classification algorithms to determine which performed best with this complex data set. The Random Forest classification algorithm produced the highest accuracies and was therefore used in Experiments 3 and 4. Experiment 3 assessed the benefits of using combined SAR-optical imagery over single-sensor imagery for land cover classifications on four separate dates. The fused imagery produced consistently higher overall accuracies. The 29 May 2014 fused data produced the best accuracy of 69.8%. The fused classifications had more consistent results over the four dates than the single-sensor imagery, which suffered lower accuracies, especially for imagery acquired later in the season. In Experiment 4, the use of multi-temporal, dual-sensor data for classification was evaluated. Feature selection was used to reduce the data set from 638 potential training features to 50, which produced the best accuracy of 74.1% in comparison to 71.9% using all of the features. This result validated the use of multi-temporal data over single-date data for land cover classifications. It also validated the use of feature selection to successfully inform data reduction without compromising the accuracy of the final product. Multi-temporal and dual-sensor data shows potential for mapping land cover in a tropical, mountainous region that would otherwise be challenging to map using single-sensor data. However, accuracies generally remained lower than would allow for transferability and replication of the current methodology. Classification algorithm optimisation, supervised segmentation and improved training data should be considered to improve these results.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2283093051", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["134297058"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131514796"}

While using sEMG for position control, estimation of the intended torque of the user could also provide sufficient information for an effective force control of the hand prosthesis or assistive device. This paper presents the use of pattern recognition to estimate the torque applied by a human wrist and its real-time implementation to control a novel two degree of freedom wrist exoskeleton prototype (WEP), which was specifically developed for this work.MethodsBoth sEMG data from four muscles of the forearm and wrist torque were collected from eight volunteers by using a custom-made testing rig. The features that were extracted from the sEMG signals included root mean square (rms) EMG amplitude, autoregressive (AR) model coefficients and waveform length. Support Vector Machines (SVM) was employed to extract classes of different force intensity from the sEMG signals. After assessing the off-line performance of the used classification technique, the WEP was used to validate in real-time the proposed classification scheme.ResultsThe data gathered from the volunteers were divided into two sets, one with nineteen classes and the second with thirteen classes. Each set of data was further divided into training and testing data. It was observed that the average testing accuracy in the case of nineteen classes was about 88% whereas the average accuracy in the case of thirteen classes reached about 96%. Classification and control algorithm implemented in the WEP was executed in less than 125 ms.ConclusionsThe results of this study showed that classification of EMG signals by separating different levels of torque is possible for wrist motion and the use of only four EMG channels is suitable. The study also showed that SVM classification technique is suitable for real-time classification of sEMG signals and can be effectively implemented for controlling an exoskeleton device for assisting the wrist.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2936372", "pubmed_id": "20796304", "doi": "10.1186/1475-925X-9-41", "venue": "BioMedical Engineering OnLine", "journal": "BioMedical Engineering OnLine", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2134123560", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52817575", "15031382", "28323264", "9595344", "15181417", "20719385", "20556952", "24409562", "9963931", "237400", "25308802", "989105", "206608807", "14393157", "11053287", "5712077", "767699", "341755", "11837702", "494495", "10084310", "1955920", "15115353", "118902490", "61916674", "9082646", "17162934", "4666447", "23103332", "961425", "2443126", "1352566", "206741063", "236314"], "inbound_citations": ["59524871", "16063820", "3666770", "12285604", "18132607", "14377802", "3293281", "202711802", "214871091", "15912777", "17808178", "37534609", "19038480", "159043232", "4532368", "3990020", "10243973", "13671626", "29022679", "25799438", "33619221", "18583019", "6753081", "51834009", "148573345", "6175273", "693504", "61618634", "84846839", "86538954", "12327711", "20879866", "14146739", "14388543", "204779313", "18277956", "214700216", "205949934", "204739427", "12269929", "15263548", "14005642", "88495044", "53616806", "51872193", "15892734", "16422660", "280551", "11311334", "996303", "6366744", "11613625", "4440037", "17899296", "2710122", "18786506", "27679696", "51614518", "133603357", "53097909", "69950369", "199541303", "13278073", "14648431", "16455942", "12170388", "16457699", "204818531", "17747430", "7453793", "15736766", "2986521", "5609243", "11083750", "236314", "15856534", "11695674", "5787483", "6599497", "14019093", "11337161", "8087580", "14451301", "1607525", "17059005", "214911402", "4623961", "8614836", "35731274", "15909606", "215722801", "14017833", "14178970", "9238589", "57364940", "12008695", "29562091", "4031295", "9226935", "17559860"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:236314"}

One of these abnormalities is the epileptic seizure. A framework is proposed for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG signals recorded from normal and epileptic patients. The suggested approach is designed to classify the abnormal signal from the normal one automatically. This work aims to improve the accuracy of epileptic seizure detection and reduce computational costs. To address this, the proposed framework uses the 54-DWT mother wavelets analysis of EEG signals using the Genetic algorithm (GA) in combination with other four machine learning (ML) classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Naive Bayes (NB). The performance of 14 different combinations of two-class epilepsy detection is investigated using these four ML classifiers. The experimental results show that the four classifiers produce comparable results for the derived statistical features from the 54-DWT mother wavelets; however, the ANN classifier achieved the best accuracy in most datasets combinations, and it outperformed the other examined classifiers.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970012", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3004158844", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["27920852", "5802425", "206710383", "45811394", "155380", "6414893", "52922428", "11614017", "42376006", "62724583", "30410643", "10286080", "35677517", "98292068", "2983628", "23823246", "46880734", "3708639", "3494578", "61809830", "52299507", "57306561", "3814080", "46850980", "16896506", "56381252", "8944851", "124509842", "15507500", "13432950"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211058292"}

Objects with higher structural complexity often cannot be described by feature vectors without losing important structural information. These objects can adequately be represented in the language of logic or by labeled graphs. The similarity of such descriptions is difficult to define and to compute. In this paper, a connectionist approach for the determination of the similarity of arbitrary labeled graphs is introduced. Using an example from organic chemistry, the application of the approach within one distance based and one generalisation based classfication algorithm is demonstrated. The generalisation based algorithm forms clusters or subclasses of similar examples of the same class and extracts the parts of the objects which determine the class of the object. The algorithms perform very satisfactorily in comparison with recent logical and feature vector approaches. Moreover, being able to handle structural data directly, the algorithms need only a subset of the given features of the objects for classification.", "year": 1997, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/3-540-63223-9_124", "venue": "PKDD", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1582609757", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16107675", "119019", "16100016", "18851054", "15492787"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:41442043"}

To evade detection, the botmaster frequently changes the domain name of his Command and Control (C&C) server. Notice that most of these types of domain names are generated by domain generation algorithms (DGAs). In this paper, we propose Khaos, a novel DGA with high anti-detection ability based on neural language models and the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The key insight of our research is that real domain names are composed of readable syllables and acronyms, and thus we can arrange syllables and acronyms using neural language models to mimic real domain names. In Khaos, we first find the most common ${n}$ -grams in real domain names, then tokenize these domain names into ${n}$ -grams, and finally synthesize new domain names after learning arrangements of ${n}$ -grams from real domain names. We carry out experiments using a variety of state-of-the-art DGA detection approaches: the statistics-based, the distribution-based, the LSTM-based and the graph-based detection approach. Our experimental results show that the average distance for detecting Khaos under the distribution-based detection approach is 0.64, the AUCs of Khaos under the statistics-based and the LSTM-based detection approach are 0.76 and 0.57, respectively, and the precision of Khaos under the graph-based detection approach is 0.68. Our work proves that the existing detection approaches have big troubles in detecting Khaos, and Khaos has better anti-detection ability than state-of-the-art DGAs. In addition, we find that training the existing detection approach on a dataset including the domain names generated by Khaos can improve its detection ability.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIFS.2019.2960647", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2995774794", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1748215", "752301", "8036729", "16560076", "52174275", "206711647", "116239245", "1033682", "18828233", "6447277", "145048453", "13618539", "207927251", "52052916", "120349231", "125523249", "60827152", "17845928", "53960028", "52398612", "52167051", "139157757", "9744003", "45326030", "10540776", "10894094", "16119010", "368182", "65080459", "206594692", "15539264", "56367624", "17904306", "10511727", "198169179"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211121051"}

We train several GAN variants using our proposed framework and apply them to the speaker verification task. On the challenging NIST-SRE 2016 dataset, we are able to match the performance of a strong baseline x-vector system. In contrast to the the baseline systems which are dependent on dimensionality reduction (LDA) and an external classifier (PLDA), our proposed speaker embeddings can be scored using simple cosine distance. This is achieved by optimizing our models end-to-end, using an angular margin loss function.

The main challenge for an il algorithm is to update the classifier whilst preserving existing knowledge. We observe that, in addition to forgetting, a known issue while preserving knowledge, il also suffers from a problem we call intransigence, its inability to update knowledge. We introduce two metrics to quantify forgetting and intransigence that allow us to understand, analyse, and gain better insights into the behaviour of il algorithms. Furthermore, we present RWalk, a generalization of ewc++ (our efficient version of ewc [6]) and Path Integral [25] with a theoretically grounded KL-divergence based perspective.

We evaluated different machine learning techniques with an emphasis on boosting algorithms and implemented them in an ArcGIS toolbox. Performance was tested on an exploration dataset from the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) with respect to accuracy, performance, stability, and robustness. Boosting algorithms are ensemble methods used in supervised learning for regression and classification. They combine weak classifiers, i.e., classifiers that perform slightly better than random guessing to obtain robust classifiers. Each time a weak learner is added; the learning set is reweighted to give more importance to misclassified samples. Our test area, the IPB, is one of the oldest mining districts in the world and hosts giant volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VMS) deposits. The spatial density of ore deposits, as well as the size and tonnage, makes the area unique, and due to the high data availability and number of known deposits, well-suited for testing machine learning algorithms. We combined several geophysical datasets, as well as layers derived from geological maps as predictors of the presence or absence of VMS deposits. Boosting algorithms such as BrownBoost and Adaboost were tested and compared to Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector machines (SVM) in several experiments. We found performance results relatively similar, especially to BrownBoost, which slightly outperformed LR and SVM with respective accuracies of 0.96 compared to 0.89 and 0.93. Data augmentation by perturbing deposit location led to a 7% improvement in results. Variations in the split ratio of training and test data led to a reduction in the accuracy of the prediction result with relative stability occurring at a critical point at around 26 training samples out of 130 total samples. When lower numbers of training data were introduced accuracy dropped significantly. In comparison with other machine learning methods, Adaboost is user-friendly due to relatively short training and prediction times, the low likelihood of overfitting and the reduced number of hyperparameters for optimization. Boosting algorithms gave high predictive accuracies, making them a potential data-driven alternative for regional scale and/or brownfields mineral exploration.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11053-019-09483-8", "venue": "Natural Resources Research", "journal": "Natural Resources Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2940433316", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["28172082", "121877087", "118657649", "110492845", "130031321", "130031321", "64832941", "140724144", "128715331", "129071685", "129933245", "210619271", "121240696", "121476616", "62137670", "53233917", "6644398", "129928734", "140711848", "107429595", "130609167", "129349426", "129871158", "140618933", "128667126", "129095507", "127352833", "10659969", "59900704", "128818376", "129022625", "129774903", "129715044", "133102062", "128755502", "128493592", "131410987", "55689184", "129036477", "129118044", "129790880", "11803458", "12958071"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:146011015"}

This classifier is responsible for identifying the type of the road infrastructure and the safety-relevant traffic participants of the driving environment. With each class representing similar traffic scenarios, a set of Random Forests (RFs) is individually trained to predict the probabilistic space-time representation, which depicts the future behavior of traffic participants.

With a marked increase of jellyfish populations worldwide, understanding the dynamics of the polyp (scyphistoma) stage of their life-cycle is becoming increasingly important. In-situ studies of polyp population dynamics are scarce due to small size of the polyps and tedious manual work required to annotate and count large numbers of items in underwater photographs. We devised an experiment which shows a large variance between human annotators, as well as in annotations made by the same annotator. We have tackled this problem, which is present in many areas of marine biology, by developing a method for automated detection and counting. Our polyp counter (PoCo) uses a two-stage approach with a fast detector (Aggregated Channel Features) and a precise classifier consisting of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network and a Support Vector Machine. PoCo was tested on a year-long image dataset and performed with accuracy comparable to human annotators but with 70-fold reduction in time.

As an alternative, however, deep neural networks, in particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have become popular for learning image features or representations from data and have demonstrated remarkable performance in many real-world applications. But CNNs often require huge amount of labelled data, which may be prohibitive in many applications, as well as long training times. This paper considers an alternative, data-independent means of obtaining features for CNNs. The proposed framework makes use of the Markov random field (MRF) and self-organising map (SOM) to generate basic features and model both intra- and inter-image dependencies. Various MRF textures are synthesized first, and are then clustered by a convolutional translation-invariant SOM, to form generic image features. These features can be directly applied as early convolutional filters of the CNN, leading to a new way of deriving effective features for image classification. The MRF framework also offers a theoretical and transparent way to examine and determine the influence of image features on performance of CNNs. Comprehensive experiments on the MNIST, rotated MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets were conducted with results outperforming most state-of-the-art models of similar complexity.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2019.03.107", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2945252791", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:181516387"}

This paper focuses on recognizing the running of construction machines because they indicate the activity of the constructions. Acoustic information is applied for the recognition and a novel pipeline monitoring approach is proposed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. The obtained Eigenvalues are regarded as the special signature and thus used for building feature vectors. One-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for the classifier. The denoising ability of PCA can make it robust to noise interference, while the powerful classifying ability of SVM can provide good recognition results.

Experiments carried out in a real 3D scene dataset recorded promising results and proved the applicability of affordance-map for mapping human context.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1906.05498", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2949246522", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17730601", "15590376", "18997129", "3030972", "141852793", "1201984", "137038", "10015368", "6495041", "32450447", "61566044", "2546944", "69960436", "14005781", "3030972", "1963656", "17693053", "206787478", "9203634", "1124644", "1554582", "33354724", "180101", "35226726", "14591650", "206769680", "1115550", "564746", "9182766", "14264277", "130314828"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:189761992"}

Various sensors have been proposed in the literature, including in-ear microphones, strain sensors, and photoplethysmography.

In this paper, we present a chewing detection system that can adapt to each user independently using active learning (AL) with minimal intrusiveness. The system captures audio from a commercial bone-conduction microphone connected to an Android smart-phone. We employ a state-of-the-art feature extraction algorithm and extend the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification stage using AL. The effectiveness of the adaptable classification model can quickly converge to that achieved when using the entire available training set. We further use AL to create SVM models with a small number of support vectors, thus reducing the computational requirements, without significantly sacrificing effectiveness. To support our arguments, we have recorded a dataset from eight participants, each performing once or twice a standard protocol that includes consuming various types of food, as well as non-eating activities such as silent and noisy environments and conversation.

We propose a novel ensemble learning method which achieves a maximal detection rate at a user-defined range of false positive rates by directly optimizing the partial AUC using structured learning. In addition, in order to achieve high object detection performance, we propose a new approach to extracting low-level visual features based on spatial pooling. Incorporating spatial pooling improves the translational invariance and thus the robustness of the detection process. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors using the proposed structured ensemble learning method with spatially pooled features.

Firstly, we identify polarities (positive or negative) carried by the textual signals (e.g. comments) and non-textual ones (e.g. the reactions love and sad) for a given Facebook posts. Therefore, the polarity of each comment expressed in Arabic or in English on a given Facebook post, is estimated on the basis of a neural sentiment model. Secondly, we group signals according to their complementarity using attributes (features) selection algorithms. Thirdly, we apply learning to rank (LTR) algorithms to re-rank Facebook search results based on the selected groups of signals. Finally, experiments are carried out on 13,500 Facebook posts, collected from 45 topics, for each of the two languages.

A 1DOF torque sensor was used to model the point of interaction between a robot and a human. The following isolated upper extremity movements were considered: forearm pronation-supination, wrist flexion-extension and wrist radial-ulnar deviation.

In this paper, a new method for recognition of single and multi-source of PD based on extraction of high level image features has been introduced. A database, involving 365 samples of phase-resolved PD (PRPD) data, is developed by measurement carried out on transformer artificial defect models (having different sizes of defect) under a specific applied voltage, to be used for proposed algorithm validation. In the first step, each set of PRPD data is converted into grayscale images to represent different PD defects. Two \u201cimage feature extraction\u201d methods, the Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), are employed to extract features from the obtained gray scale images. Different variants of Support Vector Machine (SVM) are adjusted for optimal classification of PD sources in this process. Impact of the employed parameters in the image processing such as image resolution, random noise, and phase shift, on identification accuracy is investigated and addressed. It is shown that by using HOG-SVM method 99.3% accuracy can be achieved. This is hardly affected by various external factors. Two case studies have been conducted on multi-source PD for evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm. A void defect is implemented into the transformer model and the resultant recorded signal is used for the study. The DBSCAN algorithm is used as the mean of PD source clustering and sub-PRPD pattern development.

However, traditional methods on image-to-image translation merely consider the visual appearance properties, they fail to maintain the true semantics of an image during the transfer learning procedure from source to target domain. We propose a new approach that utilizes GAN to translate unpaired images between domains and remain high level semantic abstraction aligned.

We combined statistical (spectral analysis and Machine learning techniques) and physically based models to generate, for the first time in this system, a predictive tool of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a) and composition (morphology-based functional groups). The results, based on a 11-year time series, revealed two alternating phases in the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton biomass. One phase is characterized by high inorganic turbidity and low phytoplankton biomass, and the other by low inorganic turbidity and variable (low and high) phytoplankton biomass. A threshold of turbidity (29 TNU), above which phytoplankton remains with low biomass (<15\u201320 ug/l) was established. The periods of high turbidity, which in total cover 30% of the time series, start abruptly and are related to external forcing. Meteorological conditions associated with the beginning of these periods were modeled through a regression tree analysis. These conditions consist of moderate to high wind intensities from the SW direction, in some cases combined with high antecedent precipitation or low water level. The results from the physically-based modeling indicated that the long decaying time-scale of turbidity and intermediate resuspension events could explain the prolonged length of the high turbidity periods (\u223c1.5 years). Random Forests models for the prediction of phytoplankton biomass and composition in periods of low turbidity resulted in a proportion of explained variance and a classification error over a test sample of 0.46 and 0.34 respectively.

In this project, two experiments conducted on two types of banknote image: different region and orientation captured by using handphone camera in a controlled environment. Feature extraction of the RGB values called RB, RG, and GB from banknote image with different region were used to the machine learning classification algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Bayesian Classifier (BC) for recognizing each class of banknote. Banknote image with different orientation was directly feed to AlexNet, a pre-trained model of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the most popular image processing structure of Deep Learning Neural Network. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to select the optimized kNN, DTC, SVM, and BC which was based on the smallest cross-validation loss. After that, the performance of kNN, DTC, SVM, BC and AlexNet model was presented in a confusion matrix. Both kNN and DTC achieved 99.7% accuracy but both SVM and BC perform better by succeeded to achieve 100% accuracy. It also can be concluded that AlexNet can only perform great in testing new data if only the data had previously been trained with similar orientation.

The area near the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) along the Yangtze River in China is one of the most landslide-prone regions in the world, and the area has suffered widespread and significant landslide events in recent years. In our study, an object-oriented landslide mapping (OOLM) framework was proposed for reliable and accurate LM from \u2018ZY-3\u2019 high spatial resolution (HSR) satellite images. The framework was based on random forests (RF) and mathematical morphology (MM). RF was first applied as an object feature information reduction tool to identify the significant features for describing landslides, and it was then combined with MM to map the landslides. Three object-feature domains were extracted from the \u2018ZY-3\u2019 HSR data: layer information, texture, and geometric features. A total group of 124 features and 24 landslides were used as inputs to determine the landslide boundaries and evaluate the landslide classification accuracy. The results showed that: (1) the feature selection (FS) method had a positive influence on effective landslide mapping; (2) by dividing the data into two sets, training sets which consisted of 20% of the landslide objects (OLS) and non-landslide objects (ONLS), and test sets which consisted of the remaining 80% of the OLS and ONLS, the selected feature subsets were combined for training to obtain an overall classification accuracy of 93.3% \u00b1 0.12% of the test sets; (3) four MM operations based on closing and opening were used to improve the performance of the RF classification. Seven accuracy evaluation indices were used to compare the accuracies of these landslide mapping methods. Finally, the landslide inventory maps were obtained.

Recently, lots of deep learning approaches based on autoencoders have achieved a significance performance in domain adaptation. However, most existing methods focus on minimizing the distribution divergence by putting the source and target data together to learn global feature representations, while they do not consider the local relationship between instances in the same category from different domains. To address this problem, we propose a novel Semi-Supervised Representation Learning framework via Dual Autoencoders for domain adaptation, named SSRLDA.

C$^2$GAN contains two different types of generators, i.e., keypoint-oriented generator and image-oriented generator.

Each cycle not only aims at reconstructing the input domain, and also produces useful output involving in the generation of another cycle. By so doing, the cycles constrain each other implicitly, which provides complementary information from the two different modalities and brings extra supervision across cycles, thus facilitating more robust optimization of the whole network.

One of its main features is that iteratively it forces the base learner to work more on difficult samples. Usually it can achieve better overall classification performance, when compared to a single classification model trained by the classification algorithm used as the base learner. SVM, short for Support Vector Machine, is a learning algorithm that employs a kernel to project the original data space to a data space where a hyperplane that can linearly separate as many samples of classes as possible can be found. Because both are top algorithms, researchers have been exploring the use of AdaBoost with SVM. Unlike others simply using SVM with a single kernel as the base learner in AdaBoost, we propose an approach that uses SVM with multiple kernels as the base learners in a variant of AdaBoost. Its main feature is that it not only considers difficulties of samples but also classification performance of kernels, and accordingly it selects as well as switches between kernels in the boosting process.

This land use and land cover change in turn has influence on various hydrological processes such as soil erosion rate, sediment deposition in rivers and dams and also stream flow pattern in a catchment. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of Land use and Land cover (LU/LC) changes is necessary to assess the impacts of change in the pattern of natural vegetation on the earth's environment. Satellite images can provide useful information regarding spatial and temporal variation of LU/LC in an area. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the dynamics of LU/LC changes using LISS-III data for the years 2007, 2010 and 2013 of Harangi catchment, Coorg District, Karnataka State, India. Also, study compares three classification techniques such as Parallelepiped Algorithm, Minimum Distance to Mean Algorithm and Maximum Likelihood Algorithm based on the value of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient to check the reliability of the methods in classifying images. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient obtained by using Parellelepiped, Minimum distance to mean and Maximum likelihood algorithm for the year 2013 are 81.47% & 0.71, 78.67 & 0.68 and 89.36% & 0.81 respectively. Based on these results, it can be concluded that, among all the three techniques, the Maximum Likelihood Algorithm gave higher accuracy with high kappa coefficient and Minimum Distance to Mean Algorithm gave lower accuracy. The LU/LC change detection results between years 2007 and 2013 indicated a drastic change in forest area, plantation and waste land among all other classes. The forest area decreased dramatically from 183.12 sq. km to 131.02 sq. km. Also, fallow land and water body are decreased from 68.89 sq. km to 42.63 sq. km and 6.71 sq. km to 3.82 sq. km respectively.

The basic idea is to first create a graph with known and unknown pixels as vertices and with edge weights encoding the similarity between vertices, then the problem of interpolation converts to how to effectively propagate the label information from known points to unknown ones. This process can be posed as a Bayesian inference, in which we try to combine the principles of local adaptation and global consistency to obtain accurate and robust estimation. Specially, our algorithm first constructs a set of local interpolation models, which predict the intensity labels of all image samples, and a loss term will be minimized to keep the predicted labels of the available low-resolution (LR) samples sufficiently close to the original ones. Then, all of the losses evaluated in local neighborhoods are accumulated together to measure the global consistency on all samples. Moreover, a graph-Laplacian-based manifold regularization term is incorporated to penalize the global smoothness of intensity labels, such smoothing can alleviate the insufficient training of the local models and make them more robust. Finally, we construct a unified objective function to combine together the global loss of the locally linear regression, square error of prediction bias on the available LR samples, and the manifold regularization term. It can be solved with a closed-form solution as a convex optimization problem.

Identification and characterization of vegetation formations is generally conducted at a fine scale using ecological ground surveys, which are limited to small areas. While optical remotely sensed imagery is limited to cloud-free periods, SAR time-series are used more extensively for wetland mapping and characterization using the relationship between distribution of vegetation formations and flood duration. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal number and key dates of SAR images to be classified to map wetland vegetation formations at a 1:10,000 scale. A series of eight dual-polarization TerraSAR-X images (HH/VV) was acquired in 2013 during dry and wet seasons in temperate climate conditions. One polarimetric parameter was extracted first, the Shannon entropy, which varies with wetland flooding status and vegetation roughness. Classification runs of all the possible combinations of SAR images using different k (number of images) subsets were performed to determine the best combinations of the Shannon entropy images to identify wetland vegetation formations. The classification runs were performed using Support Vector Machine techniques and were then analyzed using the McNemar test to investigate significant differences in the accuracy of all classification runs based on the different image subsets. The results highlight the relevant periods (i.e. late winter, spring and beginning of summer) for mapping vegetation formations, in accordance with ecological studies.

This work presents a signature verification system as behavioral system to ensure that the currency authentication is preserved by validating the genuine signature. This study developed signatures by applying multiple classification techniques. These include Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and pearson correlation. These techniques are combined with fusion techniques, i.e., ordinal structure module of fuzzy and Or gate to determine the signature either it is real or forge. The average of the values we have it after applying multiple classification techniques is calculated, and the results are compared with the pre-defined threshold prior to decision making of either the signature is genuine or not. After collect many samples and calculate the final result we calculate the error rate for FRR and FAR to compare it with previous study.
