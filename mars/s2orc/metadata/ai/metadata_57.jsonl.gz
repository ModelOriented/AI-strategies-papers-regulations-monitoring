In this paper, we focus on identifying privacy leaks such as being pregnant and being drunk in the content of tweets. This problem is non trivial for two reasons. First, we need to differentiate tweets that indeed contain privacy leaks from tweets that do not. e.g., a tweet may talk about a celebrity getting pregnant or selling products for pregnant women and thus is not privacy sensitive. Second, most existing solutions build a supervised learning model for each type of private leaks, but there could be many types of leaks so such solutions require labeling a large number of tweets for each type of leaks, which could be quite tedious and not easily generalizable. Our main contribution is that we apply transfer learning techniques such that we can use training data for one type of privacy leaks for another type of leaks which shares some common ground but is not exactly the same. This greatly reduces the labeling effort and makes our solution more generalizable. Experimental results validated the benefit of our approach: only 7% of data for the new type of leaks need to be labeled to achieve similar results as using 100% labeled data.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CIC.2016.078", "venue": "2016 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)", "journal": "2016 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2570047076", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["31076785", "3126828", "2515885", "740063", "31071624", "17892883", "5984940", "15947790", "120932631"], "inbound_citations": ["209382863"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17788659"}

As an answer to this problem, research has shown that it might be possible to detect ideas from online communities, automatically. Research is however, yet to provide an answer to what is it that makes such automatic idea detection possible? Our study is based on two datasets from dialogue between members of two distinct online communities. The first community is related to beer. The second is related to Lego. We generate machine learning classifiers based on Support Vector Machines and Partial Least Squares that can detect ideas from each respective online community. We use partial least squares to investigate what are the words and expressions that allows for automatic classification of ideas. We conclude that ideas from the two online communities, contains suggestion/solution words and expressions and it is these that make automatic idea detection possible.

The efficiency of gene silencing, however is highly variable across genes, with some genes even escaping XCI in somatic cells. A genes susceptibility to Xist-mediated silencing appears to be determined by a complex interplay of epigenetic and genomic features; however, the underlying rules remain poorly understood. We have quantified chromosome-wide gene silencing kinetics at the level of the nascent transcriptome using allele-specific Precision nuclear Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq). We have developed a Random Forest machine learning model that can predict the measured silencing dynamics based on a large set of epigenetic and genomic features and tested its predictive power experimentally. While the genomic distance to the Xist locus is the prime determinant of the speed of gene silencing, we find that also pre-marking of gene promoters with polycomb complexes is associated with fast silencing. Moreover, a series of features associated with active transcription and the O-GlcNAc transferase Ogt are enriched at rapidly silenced genes.

To this end, the existing works typically train a depth regressor from visual appearance.

In this paper, we offer a different data-driven paradigm of estimating depth from a single image, which formulates depth estimation from a search-based perspective. In particular, we handle the depth estimation of local patches via a novel cross-modality retrieval scheme, which searches for the 3D patches with similar structure/appearance to the 2D query from a dataset with 2D-3D mappings. To that effect, a coupled dictionary learning formulation is proposed to link the 2D query with the 3D patches, on the reconstruction coefficients to capture the cross-modality similarity, to obtain a rough depth estimation locally. In addition, consistency on spatial context is further introduced to refine the local depth estimation using a Conditional Random Field.

The increasing rate of antibiotic resistance in Salmonella Typhimurium poses a significant global concern, and an improved understanding of the distribution of antibiotic resistance patterns in Salmonella Typhimurium is essential for choosing the suitable antibiotic for the treatment of infections. To evaluate the roles of animal and human in antibiotic resistance dissemination, this study aims to categorize 11447 S. Typhimurium strains obtained across the food-chain, including food animals, retail meats and humans for 21 years in the United States by analyzing minimum inhibitory concentration values for 27 antibiotics. Random Forest Algorithm and Hierarchical Clustering statistics were used to group the strains according to their minimum inhibitory concentration values. Classification and Regression Tree analysis was used to identify the best classifier for human- and animal-populations\u2019 isolates. We found the persistent population or multi-drug resistance clone across the four time periods (1996~2000, 2001~2005, 2006~2010, 2011~2016). Importantly, we also detected that there was considerable diversity among S. Typhimurium strains isolated between 2011 and 2016, which suggests significant emergence of diversified multi-drug resistance clones. The most frequently observed (43%) antibiotic resistance patterns found in S. Typhimurium were tetra-resistant pattern ASSuT (ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline) and the penta-resistant pattern ACSSuT (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline). Animals (mainly swine and bovine) are the major source for these two clones. The occurrence of antibiotic resistant strains from humans and chicken is alarming.

Two prominent and advanced methods for feature extraction via signal decomposition are wavelet packet transform (WPT) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). We apply these two methods to time series acquired from an acceleration sensor at the tool holder of a lathe. Different turning experiments with varying dynamic behavior of the machine tool structure were performed. We compare the performance of these two methods with support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, random forest classification and gradient boosting combined with recursive feature elimination (RFE). We also show that the common WPT-based approach of choosing wavelet packets with the highest energy ratios as representative features for chatter does not always result in packets that enclose the chatter frequency, thus reducing the classification accuracy. Further, we test the transfer learning capability of each of these methods by training the classifier on one of the cutting configurations and then testing it on the other cases. It is found that when training and testing on data from the same cutting configuration both methods yield high accuracies reaching in one of the cases as high as 94 % and 95 % , respectively, for WPT and EEMD. However, our experimental results show that EEMD can outperform WPT in transfer learning applications with accuracy of up to 95 % .", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1905.01982", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cirpj.2019.11.003", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2998222719,2942606382", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["109055221", "109211223", "109849277", "110263679", "109332853", "110956939", "120316118", "110555788", "121012145", "109796987", "109130548", "120940627", "106537685", "108438528", "59777442", "56263983", "110323795", "110169953", "110630836", "64491412", "126171279", "115356736", "117169670", "195307415", "116122982", "35460053", "110058594", "111387255", "125185574", "10798514", "1221529", "110947422", "110349430", "54705490", "215186402", "26787653", "96191442", "194951", "7359186", "2990061", "1262186", "207152935", "109404677", "15341548", "2158933"], "inbound_citations": ["199442215", "160009733", "204907119", "211085249"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:146120765"}

In this paper we review different strategies for steganography such as cover modification, cover selection and cover synthesis by GANs, and discuss the characteristics of these methods as well as evaluation metrics and provide some possible future research directions in image steganography.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1907.01886", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/access.2020.2983175", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3013821122,2954358664", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["60702784", "1768336", "11758569", "1687220", "9957731", "5002792", "15876696", "3439214", "20404279", "61806147", "3847983", "28464141", "1690568", "4368276", "29764034", "67902904", "846197", "6055711", "18277793", "15123665", "60459799", "18422247", "7050951", "18256248", "3724409", "3461342", "52284678", "2559642", "123748356", "6285625", "27585759", "6387937", "1505066", "15080593", "7844274", "413014", "63370263", "16122839", "115414747", "53096931", "1099052", "13002849", "10894094", "15140030", "70342378", "5916438", "5782450", "16991836", "397556", "98180", "107645", "1563370", "1515901", "1277217", "2023211", "4875951", "8432557", "323998", "70023", "5715258", "9364756", "49338665", "16502769", "3390543", "17206628", "3719281", "6706414", "4430716", "59413797", "50784854", "131773730", "32184974", "13980095", "206770979", "26516599", "147703950", "59312261", "459456", "16417736", "17493330", "14113767", "14542261", "12726540", "16084597", "207761262", "14859603", "174277", "195345871", "1993257", "51758422", "15788291", "9751504", "4876512", "5826746", "37818165", "198363501"], "inbound_citations": ["208547767", "214613567"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195791421"}

The challenge is in the manipulation of selected attributes of images while preserving the other details. The method to achieve this goal is to find an accurate latent vector representation of an image and a direction corresponding to the attribute. Almost all the works in the literature use labeled datasets in a supervised setting for this purpose. In this study, we introduce an architecture called Cyclic Reverse Generator (CRG), which allows learning the inverse function of the generator accurately via an encoder in an unsupervised setting by utilizing cyclic cost minimization. Attribute editing is then performed using the CRG models for finding desired attribute representations in the latent space. In this work, we use two arbitrary reference images, with and without desired attributes, to compute an attribute direction for editing. We show that the proposed approach performs better in terms of image reconstruction compared to the existing end-to-end generative models both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Cell death and dysfunction were introduced in a local patch of the first-stage ganglion cell mosaic, and perimetric defect depth was computed for the corresponding region of the visual field.

Climate change and human activities are arguably the most important factors driving wetland distribution changes which will have important implications for wetland ecological functions and services. We analyzed the importance of driving variables for wetland distribution and investigated the relative importance of climatic factors and human activity factors in driving historical wetland distribution changes. We predicted wetland distribution changes under climate change and human activities over the 21st century using the Random Forest model in a mid- and high-latitude region of Northeast China. Climate change scenarios included three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) based on five general circulation models (GCMs) downloaded from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5). The three scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5) predicted radiative forcing to peak at 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 W/m2 by the 2100s, respectively. Our results showed that the variables with high importance scores were agricultural population proportion, warmness index, distance to water body, coldness index, and annual mean precipitation; climatic variables were given higher importance scores than human activity variables on average. Average predicted wetland area among three emission scenarios were 340,000 ha, 123,000 ha, and 113,000 ha for the 2040s, 2070s, and 2100s, respectively. Average change percent in predicted wetland area among three periods was greatest under the RCP 8.5 emission scenario followed by RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6 emission scenarios, which were 78%, 64%, and 55%, respectively. Losses in predicted wetland distribution were generally around agricultural lands and expanded continually from the north to the whole region over time, while the gains were mostly associated with grasslands and water in the most southern region. In conclusion, climatic factors had larger effects than human activity factors on historical wetland distribution changes and wetland distributions were predicted to decline remarkably over time under climate change scenarios. Our findings have important implications for wetland resource management and restoration because predictions of future wetland changes are needed for wetlands management planning.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/su10030863", "venue": null, "journal": "Sustainability", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2794217170", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["134909539", "18008349", "84319794", "4404915", "84402345", "111379374", "13695966", "134300027", "11401158", "25565248", "41349", "129487575", "129898805", "53620128", "23917518", "31489947", "43278697", "132418927", "129145672", "128697278", "85174061", "8802149", "25437900", "129111160", "5707430", "29700239", "130711195", "130687394", "19809786", "129185005", "27360264", "85369616", "84787112", "52087261", "127253241", "84545018", "17166335", "89141", "85289939", "3640534", "9030856", "14276951", "86527405", "130978701", "133097797", "54737865", "27796499", "33775325", "130735784", "205142103", "83928159", "21689084", "32323101", "2525050", "207266000"], "inbound_citations": ["203456445", "52842624"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52086057"}

Dimensional theory is one of the effective methods to describe and model emotions. Despite recent advances in affective computing, modeling continuous affective space remains a challenge. Here, we present a computational framework to study the role of functional areas of brain and band frequencies in modeling 4-D continuous affective space (Valence, Arousal, Like and Dominance). In particular, we used Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and adopted a recursive feature elimination (RFE) approach to select band frequencies and electrode locations (functional areas) that are most relevant for predicting affective space. Empirical analyses on DEAP dataset [1] reveals that only a small number of locations (7-12) and certain band frequencies carry most discriminative information. Using the selected features, we modeled 4-D affective space using Support Vector Regression (SVR). Regression analysis show that Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for Valence, Arousal, Dominance, Like are 1.40, 1.23, 1.24 and, 1.24, respectively. Besides SVR, the performance of feature fusion and ensemble classifiers were also compared to determine the robust model against technical noise and individual variations.

In current practice, patients with tumor motion may be required to receive two sets of CT scans \u2013 the initial free-breathing 4-dimensional CT (4DCT) scan for tumor motion estimation and a second CT scan under appropriate motion management such as breath-hold or abdominal compression. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a predictive model for tumor motion estimation in three-dimensional space based on machine learning algorithms. The model was developed based on sixteen imaging features extracted from non-4D diagnostic CT images and eleven clinical features extracted from the Electronic Health Record (EHR) database of 150 patients to characterize the lung tumor motion. A super-learner model was trained to combine four base machine learning models including the Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, LightGBM and XGBoost, the hyper-parameters of which were also optimized to obtain the best performance. The outputs of the super-learner model consist of tumor motion predictions in the Superior-Inferior (SI), Anterior-Posterior (AP) and Left-Right (LR) directions, and were compared against tumor motions measured in the free-breathing 4DCT scans. The accuracy of predictions was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) through ten rounds of independent tests. The MAE and RMSE of predictions in the SI direction were 1.23 mm and 1.70 mm; the MAE and RMSE of predictions in the AP direction were 0.81 mm and 1.19 mm, and the MAE and RMSE of predictions in the LR direction were 0.70 mm and 0.95 mm.

To overcome this research lack, based on the effective depth model, the effects on various receiving depth, source frequency, and received signal-to-noise ratio on the algorithm performance have been studied in this paper. The influence of sound velocity profile parameters (negative gradient, thermocline intensity, thermocline thickness, and up-boundary depth) on the algorithm performance has also been researched. According to the simulation results, proper adjustment of the receiving depths can effectively improve the algorithm performance. The source frequency primarily affects the position of the ideal receiving depth which can be appropriately adjusted according to the depth classification requirements of the real sea environment. The algorithm performance improves gradually with the increase of signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the algorithm can also be applied under the conditions of negative gradient and thermocline. The comprehensive sound velocity profile parameters have a large impact on the depth classification performance of the algorithm. Even in the case of strong negative gradient or strong thermocline, the robustness of the algorithm is still high. The feasibility of our presented method has been verified by sea experiment. The practical application value of the ideal receiving depth has been researched and validated.

Some of the models that have been used to predict loan default include logistic regression models, linear discriminant analysis models and extreme value theory models. These models are parametric in nature thus they assume that the response being investigated takes a particular functional form. However, there is a possibility that the functional form used to estimate the response is very different from the actual functional form of the response. In such a case, the resulting model will be inaccurate. Support vector machine is non-parametric and does not take any prior assumption of the functional form of the data. The purpose of this study was to compare prediction of individual loan defaults in Kenya using support vector machine and logistic regression models. The data was obtained from equity bank for the period between 2006 and 2016. A sample of 1000 loan applicants whose loans had been approved was used. The variables considered were credit history, purpose of the loan, loan amount, saving account status, employment status, gender, age, security and area of residence. The data was split into training and test data. The train data was used to train the logistic regression and support vector machine models. The study fitted logistic regression and support vector machine models. Logistic regression model showed an accuracy of 0.7727 with the train data and 0.7333 with test data.

In this paper, two proposed learning methods; Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), are applied on landmine images. The complete identification technique consists of two stages to perform both the training of the input image models and the evaluation of the testing image sets. In the 1st stage, the 2-D images are transformed into 1-D signals by a spiral scan, and then the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and polynomial coefficients are extracted from these 1-D signals and/or their transforms. In the 2nd stage, the ANN and SVM are used to match the extracted features in the testing phase to those of the training phase. Experimental results have shown that the proposed techniques are effective with landmines. The best performance has been achieved with features extracted from the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) signals using ANN and from the DCT of images contaminated by AWGN and speckle noise and from the Discrete Sine Transform (DST) of images contaminated by impulsive noise using SVM.

Finally, with the characteristic parameters of fractures and vugs extracted from CT images, a new defined function of Carbonate Rock Index (CRI) was proposed, which can classify carbonate rock type. After analysis of more than 200 core samples from a fractured-vuggy carbonate reservoir of Middle East, the CRI values for matrix, vuggy and fractured carbonate rock were given in this paper. High CRI value means high fracture density, and small CRI value indicates that the carbonate rock is mainly matrix without fracture and vug. For vuggy carbonate, CRI value is in between.

General circulation models (GCMs) are among the most advanced tools to simulate climatic conditions on earth hundreds of years into the future. The GCMs are generally run at coarser scale to cover the whole globe and as a result they are inherently unable to represent local scale features.

Practicing this type of agriculture is, according to the SKY Rainforest Rescue organization, damaging to forest ecosystems. This organization aims to educate people in how to maintain sustainable agriculture. By monitoring this shift in agricultural practices with the use of remotely sensed data, the organization can follow the development. ::: In this thesis, an image with high spatial resolution from the SPOT-5 satellite is used to evaluate which classification method is most appropriate for monitoring land use change in this specific area. Three methods are tested; two pixels based and one object based. The pixel based methods are the Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), and the object based method is segmented with Multi Resolution Segmentation (MRS) and classified with the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). ::: The parameters gamma and penalty parameter C in the SVM with an RBF kernel were estimated by a k-fold cross validation and grid search method; and for the MLC, an assumption that each class had an equal probability distribution was made. For the object based approach the first step was segmentation; for the MRS there are three parameters: scale, shape and compactness. The scale parameter was set by using an algorithm that was based on comparing local variance; shape and compactness were defined based on previous studies and visual evaluation of the segments. ::: All three methods will produce two classified maps each; one where the feature space consists of the three original wavebands (green, red and NIR) and one where the feature space is of six dimensions that include the original three wavebands and three texture derivations, one from each original band. The texture is derived from the co-occurrence GLCM method, which can be used to calculate 14 different texture measures. The three most suitable texture derivations were the contrast texture measure from the green and NIR band, and an entropy texture derived from the red band. When combining these three texture derivations with the original bands, the classes were further separated. ::: The original image was also lowered in resolution, from 2.5m to 25m in pixel size. However, this did not generate either higher or similar overall accuracy compared to any of the high spatial resolution classified images. The moderate spatial resolution classifications were only computed with the MLC and SVM due to the inefficiency of an object based image analysis method when used with moderate spatial resolution. ::: Of these six classifications, only two exceeded the 85% threshold of an acceptable overall accuracy. These were the SVM (86.8%) and OB-kNN (86.2%), which included the texture analysis. None of those classifications with only the three original bands exceeded this threshold. In conclusion, the object based method is the most suitable approach for this dataset because: 1) the parameter optimization is less subjective, 2) computational time is relatively lower, 3) the classes in the image are more cohesive and 4) there is less need for post-classification filtering.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Student thesis series Ines", "mag_id": "2233781956", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:130145674"}

Our experiments are conducted ATIS benchmark. First, supervised learning using those models are compared when using different train data size. The experimental results show that it is not necessary to use whole data, even small part of train data can also get good performance. Then, we compare the results of our modified RNN with original RNN. 0.5% improvement is obtained. Last, we compare the co-training results.

It is therefore complex to isolate the effect of these actions in this multifocal context. To address this problem we chose to specifically identify the effect of hamstrings lengthening (HL) in CP children with crouch gait. The aims of this study were to describe the specific parameters influenced by HL and to classify the positive or not-positive effect of HL in SEMLS. Patients/materials andmethods: 42 CP children (12\u00b13 years) were divided into two groups: 31 (G1=60 lower limbs (LL)) and 11 (G2=20 LL), respectively having followed and not-followed HL among all the associated surgeries. All patients had clinical gait analysis before and 1.9\u00b10.8 years after surgery. The GDI is calculated [1]. All kinematic data (angles, velocities) were doublenormalized and conditioned in two vectors. A homogeneity test (G1 vs G2) selected the kinematic parameters influenced by HL (t-test, p<0.005). Principal component analysis identified theminimumdescriptors characterizing the effect of HL. Several classifiers (Regularized Discriminant Analysis (RDA) and linear or nonlinear Support Vector Machines (SVM)) were supervised by 6 experts\u2019 opinions. Experts\u2019 opinions were based on video and kinematic curves comparison between pre and post-surgery conditions. The classifiers performances in learning, validation (leave one out) and generalization were compared. Results: GDI results showed that 83% of the subjects of G1 were globally improved by SEMLS. Among all the kinematic data, 16 sub-vectors, significantly influenced by HL were selected. Their dimensionality was reduced by principal component analysis. The 6 experts have classified the effect of HL for 37 LL: 24 were positive and 13 not-positive. The classification method with the best performance was the linear SVMwith error rate 0% in learning, 5.4% in validation and 6.5% in generalization. In view of the classification system 1/3 of G1 LL were not improved by HL. Discussion and conclusions: This supervised classification and data conditioning techniques are able to categorize the specific effect of HL among all the associated performed procedures in two classes \u201cpositive effect\u201d and \u201cnot-positive effect\u201d.

However, typically the outcome is a set of Pareto optimal solutions which make up a trade-off surface between the objective functions. For decision makers to choose a satisfactory alternative from a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, this paper suggests a new method based on least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and k-means clustering for ranking the optimal solutions for the multi-objective allocation of water resources. First, the k-means clustering method was adopted to reduce the large set of solutions to a few representative solutions. Then, to capture and represent the decision maker's preferences as well as to select the most desirable alternative, the LSSVM method was applied to obtain the utility value for each representative solution. According to the magnitude of the utility values, the final priority orders of the representative solutions were determined. Finally, this methodology was applied to rank the Pareto optimal solution set obtained from the multi-objective optimization problems of water resources allocation for the water-receiving areas of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project in Hebei Province, China. Moreover, the comparisons of the proposed method with the information entropy method and the artificial neural network (ANN) model were given. The results of the comparison indicate that the proposed method has the ability to rank the non-dominated solutions of the multi-objective operation optimization model and that it can be employed for decision-making on water allocation and management in a river basin.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/w9040257", "venue": null, "journal": "Water", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2604235378", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["154876381", "7114788", "109090980", "109011324", "154996244", "153986306", "36482639", "16608195", "121608987", "140613009", "154717701", "16598448", "124940275", "33827786", "7626668", "7138354", "52874011", "154963069", "128749170", "111237030", "37311109", "207579947", "120756188", "121996112", "56467771", "129564929", "62190121", "125437908", "32162010", "16193605"], "inbound_citations": ["198490863"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10290656"}

The proposed algorithm works in different steps. Firstly, a database consisting of face images was manually labeled for training a discriminative model. Then, three kinds of features, namely, location, shape and color have been extracted from uniformly sampled square patches. By using a trained model, facial images have then been segmented into six semantic classes: hair, skin, nose, eyes, mouth, and back-ground, using a Random Decision Forest classifier (RDF). In the final step, a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was trained for each considered mid-level feature (i.e., gender and expression) by using the corresponding probability maps.

Staging of lung cancer is a major factor of prognosis. Measuring the maximum dimensions of the invasive component in a pathology images is an essential task. Therefore, image segmentation methods for visualizing the extent of invasive and noninvasive components on pathology images could support pathological examination. However, it is challenging for most of the recent segmentation methods that rely on supervised learning to cope with unlabeled pathology images. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to unsupervised representation learning and clustering for pathology image segmentation. Our method consists of two phases. In the first phase, we learn feature representations of training patches from a target image using the spherical k-means. The purpose of this phase is to obtain cluster centroids which could be used as filters for feature extraction. In the second phase, we apply conventional k-means to the representations extracted by the centroids and then project cluster labels to the target images. We evaluated our methods on pathology images of lung cancer specimen. Our experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms traditional k-means segmentation and the multithreshold Otsu method both quantitatively and qualitatively with an improved normalized mutual information (NMI) score of 0.626 compared to 0.168 and 0.167, respectively.

Robotic problems are dynamic and open world; a robot will likely observe objects that are from outside of the training set distribution.

Particularly in cardiac MRI, due to hardware and time limitations, current 3D acquisitions are limited by low-resolution, especially in the through-plane direction, leading to poor image quality in that dimension. To overcome this problem, super-resolution (SR) techniques have been proposed to reconstruct a single isotropic 3D volume from multiple anisotropic acquisitions. Previously, local regularization techniques such as total variation have been applied to limit noise amplification while preserving sharp edges and small features in the images. In this paper, inspired by the recent progress in patch-based reconstruction, we propose a novel isotropic 3D reconstruction scheme that integrates non-local and self-similarity information from 3D patch neighborhoods. By grouping 3D patches with similar structures, we enforce the natural sparsity of MR images, which can be expressed by a low-rank structure, leading to robust image reconstruction with high signal-to-noise ratio efficiency. An Augmented Lagrangian formulation of the problem is proposed to efficiently decompose the optimization into a low-rank volume denoising and a SR reconstruction. Experimental results in simulations, brain imaging and clinical cardiac MRI, demonstrate that the proposed joint SR and self-similarity learning framework outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

The incompleteness of data can hamper some important tasks, such as music and artist recommendation. In this scenario, transductive classification can be used to classify the whole dataset considering just few labeled instances. Usually transductive classification is performed through label propagation, in which data are represented as networks and the examples propagate their labels through their connections. Similarity-based networks are usually applied to model data as network. However, this kind of representation requires the definition of parameters, which significantly affect the classification accuracy, and presents a high cost due to the computation of similarities among all dataset instances. In contrast, bipartite heterogeneous networks have appeared as an alternative to similarity-based networks in text mining applications. In these networks, the words are connected to the documents which they occur. Thus, there is no parameter or additional costs to generate such networks.

It is a form of reasoning that generates a set of hypotheses that often explain some observed facts according to some known theory and constraints describing the domain of the observation. Abduction is most appropriate when we need to reason about problems for which we have incomplete information as for example in the case of common sense reasoning. Incomplete knowledge is handled by designating some relations as abducibles. These can then be assumed, whenever needed, thus extending the background theory, provided it is consistent to do BO. At a later stage they may be retracted if new information makes them inconsistent or inappropriate. Abductive reasoning is thus used in many problems of Artificial Intelligence such as Diagnosis, Planning, Natural Language Understanding and Knowledge Assimilation. The natural computational model of abduction that stems directly from its semantica1 definition is closely analogous to the basic computational model of Logic Programming (LP). Both models are goal oriented trying to succeed on a certain goal by making assumptions (in the case of LP these are equality assumptions), that are not given explicitly in the underlying theory (program) under some constraints (e.g. the equality theory in LP) governing the validity of the assumptions. It is thus very natural and relatively easy to integrate the two paradigms to obtain the enhanced framework of Abductive Logic Programming (ALP). We note here that, for basically the same reason, it is also easy to integrate abduction with another important extension of LP, namely Constraint Logic Programming. As a form of reasoning appropriate for handling incomplete information, abduction is also closely related to non-monotonic reasoning. It provides a framework where different forms of non-monotonic reasoning, e.g, default reasoning, counterfact ual reasoning and belief revision, can be accommodated. In particular, in the case of LP, Negation as Failure can be understood and generalised using abduction. Abduction thus appears as a principle or method that can unify many different aspects of Logic Programming. As a result the framework of ALP is a simple yet powerful and useful framework for many interesting and important problems. The tutorial provides an introduction to abduction with particular emphasis on Abductive Logic Programming. It covers semantic and computational issues and examines the connection of abduction to other forms of reasoning such as non-monotonic, default and temporal reasoning. The relation of ALP to other extensions of Logic Programming, such as Constraint Logic Programming and Inductive Logic Programming, is also examined. The tutorial includes a discussion of the use of abduction and ALP in Databases and in various application problems of Artificial Intelligence.

We report results on a series of experiments comparing spatial frequency ranges, feature selection techniques, and recognition engines. Best results were obtained by selecting a subset of Gabor filters using AdaBoost and then training Support Vector Machines on the outputs of the filters selected by AdaBoost.

In this paper we propose an \"Internal GAN\" (InGAN) - an image-specific GAN - which trains on a single input image and learns its internal distribution of patches. It is then able to synthesize a plethora of new natural images of significantly different sizes, shapes and aspect-ratios - all with the same internal patch-distribution (same \"DNA\") as the input image. In particular, despite large changes in global size/shape of the image, all elements inside the image maintain their local size/shape. InGAN is fully unsupervised, requiring no additional data other than the input image itself. Once trained on the input image, it can remap the input to any size or shape in a single feedforward pass, while preserving the same internal patch distribution. InGAN provides a unified framework for a variety of tasks, bridging the gap between textures and natural images.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2941016780", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207163791", "26169625", "11206708", "19581619", "9267164", "1475121", "6662846", "54970", "6888534", "24782789", "13914930", "8643626", "64270917", "1033682", "206594692", "5808102", "2581941", "206771128", "3366315", "64200748", "770477", "3030063", "212408756", "41805341", "755760", "21661885", "206770979", "14152023"], "inbound_citations": ["208921251", "202539843", "202577523", "213176428", "209500550", "215548219"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129945843"}

As a preferable modelling approach, the cellular automaton (CA) has been used to simulate the complex mechanisms of fire spreading.

Instead of defining transition rules, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was applied in this study. By integrating the ELM with the traditional forest fire CA framework, a new cellular automaton modelling approach was proposed. After that, its performance was validated using data collected from five fires in the west of United States. Results show that the ELM performed well in predicting each cell\u2019s igniting probability. The impact of wind velocity on fire spreading pattern can be effectively described by the proposed modelling approach.

Big data is a flaring field that deals with this deluge of data by using storage techniques, dedicated infrastructures and development frameworks for the parallelization of defined tasks and its consequent reduction. These solutions how- ever fall short in online and highly data demanding scenarios, since users expect swift feedback. Reduction techniques are efficiently used in big data online applications to improve classification problems. Reduction in big data usually falls in one of two main methods: (i) reduce the dimensionality by pruning or reformulating the feature set; (ii) reduce the sample size by choosing the most relevant examples. Both approaches have benefits, not only of time consumed to build a model, but eventually also performance-wise, usually by reducing overfitting and improving generalization capabilities.

Nitrogen nutrition status of rice could be identified based on the differences of color and shape of leaf and sheath under different levels of nitrogen nutrition. Machine vision technology can be used to non-destructively and rapidly identify rice nutrition status, but image acquisition via digital camera is susceptible to external conditions, and the images are of poor quality. In this research, static scanning technology was used to collect images of rice leaf and sheath. From those images, 14 color and shape characteristic parameters of leaf and sheath were extracted by R, G, B mean value function and region props function in MATLAB. Based on the relationship between nitrogen content and the characteristics extracted from the images, the leaf R, leaf length, leaf area, leaf tip R, sheath G, and sheath length were chosen to identify nitrogen status of rice by using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results showed that the overall identification accuracies of different nitrogen nutrition were 94%, 98%, 96% and 100% for the four growth stages, respectively. Different years of data were used for validation, identification accuracies were 88%, 98%, 90% and 100%, respectively. The results showed that additional sheath characteristics can effectively increase the identification accuracy of nitrogen nutrition status and the methodology developed in the study is capable of identifying nitrogen deficiency accurately in the rice. ::: Keywords: N deficiency, static scanning, leaf sheath, support vector machine (SVM), identification ::: DOI: 10.3965/j.ijabe.20171003.1860 ::: ::: Citation: Chen L S, Sun Y Y, Wang K.

The number of constraints is proportional to the cardinality of the output space which makes the QP task intractable by classical optimization methods. We propose a novel QP solver based on sequential minimal optimization (SMO). Unlike the original SMO, we propose a novel strategy for selecting variables to be optimized. The strategy aims at selecting such variables which yield the maximal improvement of optimization. We prove that the algorithm converges in a finite number of iterations to the solution which differs from the optimal one at most by a prescribed constant. Experiments performed show that the proposed algorithm is very competitive to a cutting plane algorithm of Tsochantaridis et. al.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a modern statistical tool has been successfully used to solve nonlinear regression and time series problem. Unlike most conventional neural network models which are based on the empirical risk minimization principle, SVM applies the structural risk minimization principle to minimize an upper bound of the generalization error rather than minimizing the training error. To build an effective SVM model, SVM parameters must be set carefully. This study proposes a novel approach, know as chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm (CPSO) support vector regression(SVR), to predict financial returns.

The top-performing system used features derived from the GPT-1 model, which was finetuned on over 150,000 unlabeled posts from this http URL. Our top system had a macro averaged F1 score of 0.572, providing a new state-of-the-art result on the CLPsych 2017 task.

This work systemically evaluates the effect of using different face image representations and different types of kernels in the KPA setup and presents a novel way of randomised learning of manifolds for setbased face recognition. First, our experiments show that sparse features such as Local Binary Patterns and Gabor wavelets significantly improve the accuracy of PA methods over 'pixel intensity'. Combining different features and types of kernels at their best hyper-parameters in a multiple classifier system has further yielded the improved accuracy. Based on the encouraging results, we propose a way of randomised learning of kernel types and hyper-parameters by the set-based Randomised Decision Forests. We observed that the proposed method with linear kernels efficiently competes with those of nonlinear kernels. Further incorporation of discriminative information by constrained subspaces in the proposed method has effectively improved the accuracy.

We believe that these models will be of great benefit when utilized by governments and intelligence agencies; since they help them to make pre-emptive strikes against terrorist groups quickly and over a short period of time. In our paper, we focus on two tasks: predicting the success of an attack and predicting the identity of the terrorist organization that is behind the attack. To implement this, we adopted three machine learning algorithms: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB) and Random Forest (RF), which we used to train our models. More specifically, each algorithm was used to construct two models, one for each task, where the data were sampled for the first model using the holdout method, while for the second model cross-validation was employed. In the end, we compared the performance of the models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure metrics.

To counter this issue, we discuss anomaly detection for the extensible Markup Language (XML) in a language-theoretic view.

XML offers so-called schemas for validation, but in real world, schemas are often unavailable, ignored or too general. In this work-in-progress paper we describe a grammatical inference approach to learn an automaton from example XML documents for detecting documents with anomalous syntax. We discuss properties and expressiveness of XML to understand limits of learn ability. Our contributions are an XML Schema compatible lexical data type system to abstract content in XML and an algorithm to learn visibly pushdown automata (VPA) directly from a set of examples.

In this manuscript, an attempt has been made to develop prediction method for the localization of mitochondrial proteins. In this study, we describe a method for predicting mitochondrial proteins of malaria parasite using machine-learning technique. All models were trained and tested on 175 proteins (40 mitochondrial and 135 non-mitochondrial proteins) and evaluated using five-fold cross validation. We developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predicting mitochondrial proteins of P. falciparum, using amino acids and dipeptides composition and achieved maximum MCC 0.38 and 0.51, respectively. In this study, split amino acid composition (SAAC) is used where composition of N-termini, C-termini, and rest of protein is computed separately. The performance of SVM model improved significantly from MCC 0.38 to 0.73 when SAAC instead of simple amino acid composition was used as input. In addition, SVM model has been developed using composition of PSSM profile with MCC 0.75 and accuracy 91.38%. We achieved maximum MCC 0.81 with accuracy 92% using a hybrid model, which combines PSSM profile and SAAC. When evaluated on an independent dataset our method performs better than existing methods.

The proposed approach considers the combined use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models in a memory based Bayesian priors system and a novel Bayesian restoration, in the problem of MR image reconstruction from sparsely sampled k-space, following several different sampling schemes, including spiral and radial. Effective solutions to this problem are indispensable especially when dealing with MRI of dynamic phenomena since then, rapid sampling in k-space is required. The goal in such a case is to make measurement time smaller by minimizing scanning trajectories. It is suggested here that significant improvements could be achieved, concerning quality of the extracted image, applying to the k-space data a novel Bayesian restoration method based on progressively approximating the unknown image, involving a neural model based priors system with memory specifically aimed at minimizing first order image derivatives reconstruction errors. More specifically, it is demonstrated that SVM neural network techniques could construct efficient memory based Bayesian priors and introduce them in the procedure of a novel stepwise Bayesian restoration. These Priors are independent of specific image properties and probability distributions. They are based on training SVM neural filters to estimate the missing samples of complex k-space and thus, to improve k-space information capacity. Such a neural filter based Bayesian priors system with memory is integrated to the maximum likelihood procedure involved in the Bayesian reconstruction and aims at minimizing image derivatives and image reconstruction errors. It is found that the proposed methodology leads to enhanced image extraction results favorably compared to the ones obtained by the Integrated Bayesian MRI reconstruction involving simple SVM models priors as well as memory based priors minimizing image reconstruction errors instead of its derivatives errors, by the traditional Bayesian MRI reconstruction as well as by the pure Neural filter based reconstruction approach.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-87656-4_30", "venue": "HAIS", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1597642293", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5639585"}

What do people learn when they do not know that they are learning? Until recently all of the work in the area of implicit learning focused on empirical questions and methods. In this book, Axel Cleeremans explores unintentional learning from an information-processing perspective. He introduces a theoretical framework that unifies existing data and models on implicit learning, along with a detailed computational model of human performance in sequence-learning situations. The model, based on a simple recurrent network (SRN), is able to predict perfectly the successive elements of sequences generated from finite-state, grammars. Human subjects are shown to exhibit a similar sensitivity to the temporal structure in a series of choice reaction time experiments of increasing complexity; yet their explicit knowledge of the sequence remains limited. Simulation experiments indicate that the SRN model is able to account for these data in great detail. Cleeremans' model is also useful in understanding the effects of a wide range of variables on sequence-learning performance such as attention, the availability of explicit information, or the complexity of the material. Other architectures that process sequential material are considered. These are contrasted with the SRN model, which they sometimes outperform.

In the case of global models the large number of descriptors makes mechanistic interpretation difficult. The local models use only one or two descriptors, so that a medicinal chemist working with sets of structurally-related chemicals can readily estimate their solubility. However, construction of stable local models requires the presence of closely related neighbours for each chemical considered. It is probable that a consensus of global and local QSPR models will be the optimal approach for construction of stable predictive QSPR models with mechanistic interpretation.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27490387", "doi": "10.1002/minf.201400144", "venue": "Molecular informatics", "journal": "Molecular informatics", "mag_id": "2120919910", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["182381178", "211028211"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4032326"}

It demonstrates that multiple features should be utilized to characterize urban areas. On the other hand, since levels of development in neighboring areas are not statistically independent, the features of each urban area site depend on those of neighboring sites. In this paper, we present a multiple conditional random fields (CRFs) ensemble model to incorporate multiple features and learn their contextual information. This model involves two aspects: one is to use a CRF as the base classifier to automatically generate a set of CRFs by changing input features, and the other is to integrate the set of CRFs by defining a conditional distribution. The model has some distinct merits: each CRF component models a kind of feature, so that the ensemble model can learn different aspects of training data. Moreover, it lets the ensemble model search in a wide solution space. The ensemble model can also avoid the well-known overfitting problem of a single CRF, i.e., the many features may cause the redundancy of irrelevant information and result in counter-effect. Experiments on a wide range of images show that our ensemble model produces higher detection accuracy than single CRF and is also competitive with recent results in urban area detection.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2007.907109", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2113199901", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["44803526", "12431193", "23801707", "21447051", "9790148", "8184980", "122533617", "56776745", "1073705", "42670095", "15590248", "120489597", "6934721", "122598442", "10689850", "1282113", "9389968", "13042972", "7443466", "2008977", "7411244", "12152883", "277918", "53303132", "7495827", "15097194", "3189198", "15171942", "7447370", "125582052", "2441808", "36847317"], "inbound_citations": ["18224047", "30204618", "210843286", "11784324", "60442848", "9234133", "8587614", "22364236", "211519425", "52166349", "4635286", "16721987", "22130133", "131569747", "21075725", "9133706", "17220465", "38814373", "25169078", "20396456", "49879694", "7538277", "14160628", "16403106", "10637950", "11089471", "25623004", "23391664", "52110678", "59231252", "17913671", "9179721", "38504818", "14390103", "29474964", "16457973", "212649257", "14217487", "28436772", "6629776", "6030404", "134191803", "67870247", "26277487", "9193779", "8333991", "53231385", "16828020", "52961269", "54051564", "23080812", "6707893", "1537057", "38398522", "132809597", "24511674", "10385599", "52111228", "31107091", "3110415", "205493223", "44014585", "35410259", "19714686", "8294583", "10304118", "9705204", "52077487", "120524400", "55243980", "28993658", "33119740", "209972660", "25352834", "8789703", "10934588", "129899558", "14292747", "11464708", "21548054", "148565530", "15393120", "1849376", "131629786", "7613520", "43653802", "13242248", "23338533", "25085630"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11098988"}

Diagnostic confusion is also posed due to imitation of similar signs by other disorders. Careful microscopic examination of stained blood smear or bone marrow aspirate is the only way to effective diagnosis of leukemia. Techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunophenotyping, cytogenetic analysis and cytochemistry are also employed for specific leukemia detection. The need for automation of leukemia detection arises since the above specific tests are time consuming and costly. Morphological analysis of blood slides are influenced by factors such as hematologists experience and tiredness, resulting in non standardized reports. A low cost and efficient solution is to use image analysis for quantitative examination of stained blood microscopic images for leukemia detection. A two stage color segmentation strategy is employed for segregating leukocytes or white blood cells (WBC) from other blood components. Discriminative features i.e. nucleus shape, texture are used for final detection of leukemia. In the present paper two novel shape features i.e., hausdorff dimension and contour signature is implemented for classifying a lymphocytic cell nucleus.

However, these types of investigations are needed to better understand the etiology, pathophysiology and progression of several inner ear disorders. Moreover, the fluid from the inner ear cannot be sampled for micro-chemical analyses from healthy individuals in vivo. Therefore, in the present paper, we studied patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) undergoing trans-labyrinthine surgery (TLS). Our primary aim was to identify perilymph proteins in patients with VS on an individual level. Our second aim was to investigate the proteins identified at a functional level and our final aim was to search for biological markers for tumor-associated hearing loss and tumor diameter. ::: ::: ::: Methods and findings ::: Sixteen patients underwent TLS for sporadic VS. Perilymph was aspirated through the round window before opening the labyrinth. One sample was contaminated and excluded resulting in 15 usable samples. Perilymph samples were analyzed with an online tandem LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Data were analyzed with MaxQuant software to identify the total number of proteins and to quantify proteins in individual samples. Protein function was analyzed using the PANTHER Overrepresentation tool. Associations between perilymph protein content, clinical parameters, tumor-associated hearing loss and tumor diameter were assessed using Random Forest and Boruta. In total, 314 proteins were identified; 60 in all 15 patients and 130 proteins only once in 15 patients. Ninety-one proteins were detected in at least 12 out of 15 patients. Random Forest followed by Boruta analysis confirmed that alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (P02765) was an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss. In addition, functional analysis showed that numerous processes were significantly increased in the perilymph. The top three enriched biological processes were: 1) secondary metabolic processes; 2) complement activation and 3) cell recognition. ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: The proteome of perilymph in patients with vestibular schwannoma has an inter-individual stable section. However, even in a cohort with homogenous disease, the variation between individuals represented the majority of the detected proteins. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, P02765, was shown to be an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss, a finding that needs to be verified in other studies.

Their reliable acquisition at home, however, is difficult. In comparison, ECG and thoracic respiratory (R) signals are easier to record and can be useful in home sleep monitoring systems. The simultaneous utilization of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and respiratory (R) signals seems a plausible scenario as both heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) vary during different sleep states. Therefore, we explored the combined discriminative capacity (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) of ECG/R signals in automatic sleep staging. As baseline, we classified the wakefulness, Stage 2, SWS (slow wave sleep) and REM sleep by using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) fed with a set of features extracted from: (a) HRV (34-features), (b) HRV/ECG-Derived Respiration (45-features), and (c) combined HRV/R (45-features) signals. Approach (a) produced reasonable discriminative capacity, while approach (b) significantly improved the classification; however, the best outcomes were achieved by using approach (c). Then, we enhanced the SVM classifier with the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method. The classification results were improved with 35 out of the 45 HRV/RS-EDR features. In comparison, best results were obtained by combining 27 out of the 45 features derived from HRV/R signals, in which the optimal feature set selected by the SVM-RFE method, included a combination of time domain, time-frequency, and fractal features, as well as entropies. Overall, these improvements revealed that it is possible to simplify home monitoring of sleep disorders and achieve high discriminative capacity (accuracy = 89.32%, specificity = 92.88%, and sensitivity = 78.64%) in automatic sleep staging by the exclusive recording of cardiorespiratory signals.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bspc.2014.12.003", "venue": "Biomed.

Semantic scene segmentation can help robots to identify the objects that are present in their surroundings, while semantic scene completion can enhance the ability of the robot to infer the object shape, which is pivotal for several high-level tasks. With dense Conditional Random Field (CRF), one key issue is how to construct the long-range interactions between nodes with Gaussian pairwise potentials. Another issue is what effective and efficient inference algorithms can be adapted to resolve the optimization. In this paper, we focus on semantic scene segmentation and completion optimization technology simultaneously using dense CRF based on a single depth image only. Firstly, we convert the single depth image into different down-sampled Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) or flipped TSDF voxel formats, and formulate the pairwise potentials terms with such a representation. Secondly, we use the output results of an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network named SSCNet to obtain the unary potentials. Finally, we pursue the efficiency of different CRF inference algorithms (the mean-field inference, the negative semi-definite specific difference of convex relaxation, the proximal minimization of linear programming and its variants, etc.). The proposed dense CRF and inference algorithms are evaluated on three different datasets (SUNCG, NYU, and NYUCAD). Experimental results demonstrate that the voxel-level intersection over union (IoU) of predicted voxel\u2019s semantic and completion can reach to state-of-the-art. Specifically, for voxel semantic segmentation, the highest IoU improvements are 2.6%, 1.3%, 3.1%, and for scene completion, the highest IoU improvements are 2.5%, 3.7%, 5.4%, respectively for SUNCG, NYU, and NYUCAD datasets.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2018.08.052", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2888815532", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["73728973", "214727619", "198919110", "199064182", "85504573", "210887720"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52927274"}

Borrowing from the idea of NNRWs that employs the random initialization technique, the relation among attributes, simple concepts, and complex concepts are randomly determined. Complex concepts are generated through the combination of randomly selected simple concepts by AFS logic operation. The output weights of NNRWs are utilized to evaluate the confidence of each complex concept for every target class, which means that the feasibility of complex concepts for every class is determined analytically rather than through the tuning parameters of constraint conditions such as in conventional AFS-based classifiers. For the proposed method, compared to other neural-network-based classification methods, the fuzzy descriptions generated from complex concepts in hidden layer make classification result human understandable. We have experimented with several benchmark datasets and compared the results with other neural network-based classifiers.

While many in-memory graph frameworks have made substantial progress in optimizing these applications, we show that it is still possible to achieve up to 4 $\\times$ speedups over the fastest frameworks by greatly improving cache utilization. Previous systems have applied out-of-core processing techniques from the memory/disk boundary to the cache/DRAM boundary. However, we find that blindly applying such techniques is ineffective because of the much smaller performance gap between DRAM and cache. We present two techniques that take advantage of the cache with minimal or no instruction overhead. The first, frequency based clustering, groups together frequently accessed vertices to improve the utilization of each cache line with no runtime overhead.

This paper deals with a novel ensemble classifier (RFAODE) for intrusion detection system. Proposed ensemble classifier is built using two well-known algorithms RF and AODE.

Currently, the machine learning methods achieve the-state-of-the-art performance with different features.

In this study, we proposed a feature vector composed of three kinds of sequence-based features, including overall amino acid composition, pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) proposed by Chou and physicochemical distance transformation. These features not only consider the sequence composition of proteins, but also incorporate the sequence-order information of amino acids in proteins. The feature vectors were fed into Support Vector Machine (SVM) for DNA-binding protein identification. The proposed method is called PseDNA-Pro. Experiments on stringent benchmark datasets and independent test datasets by using the Jackknife test showed that PseDNA-Pro can achieve an accuracy of higher than 80 %, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods, including DNAbinder, DNA-Prot, and iDNA-Prot. These results indicate that the combination of various features for DNA-binding protein prediction is a suitable approach, and the sequence-order information among residues in proteins is relative for discrimination.

Using spectroscopic estimates of metallicity as ground truth, we build, optimize and train several estimators to predict metallicity. We use the observed photometry, as well as derived quantities such as stellar mass and photometric redshift, as features, and we build two sample data sets at median redshifts of 0.103 and 0.218 and median r-band magnitude of 17.5 and 18.3 respectively. We find that ensemble methods, such as Random Forests of Trees and Extremely Randomized Trees, and Support Vector Machines all perform comparably well and can measure metallicity with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.081 and 0.090 for the two data sets when all objects are included. The fraction of outliers (objects for which |Z_true - Z_pred| > 0.2 dex) is 2.2 and 3.9%, respectively and the RMSE decreases to 0.068 and 0.069 if those objects are excluded.

Extensive computational results have shown the effectiveness of PSVM for two-class classification problems where the separating plane is constructed in time that can be as little as two orders of magnitude shorter than that of conventional support vector machines. When PSVM is applied to problems with more than two classes, the well known one-from-the-rest approach is a natural choice in order to take advantage of its fast performance. However, there is a drawback associated with this one-from-the-rest approach. The resulting two-class problems are often very unbalanced, leading in some cases to poor performance. We propose balancing the k classes and a novel Newton refinement modification to PSVM in order to deal with this problem. Computational results indicate that these two modifications preserve the speed of PSVM while often leading to significant test set improvement over a plain PSVM one-from-the-rest application.

The monitoring of these signals allows building a database that can be a reference for the detection of failures in equipment and thus support predictive maintenance routines. The simplicity of calculations, which are based on the Manhattan distance (City Block metric), makes it very suitable for use in embedded systems, field-programmable-logic based systems (e. g.

However, they can only detect bursty topics by using user-defined keywords a long with simple rules. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to detect emerging topics on Twitter streams. To detect emerging topics, a clustering technique has been applied to aggregate a set of keywords. Since an emerging topic occurs continuously, the emerging topics are merged with stateful technique to accumulate topics from different time intervals. To detect both high signal topics and small-medium signal topics, we use statistical features based on average, acceleration, and z-score. Moreover, we propose to include the stock indicator features: Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH). They are common features in trend (oversold and overbought) detection in stock analysis which is similar to our topic detection in twitter. To capture any event patterns, Random Forest (RF) has been proposed as a classifier to detect emerging keywords by utilizing the stated above five features. To evaluate the performance, we created and published a corpus by collecting Twitter data for 10 days with over 80 million tweets and then labeling possible topics in tota1161 events along with related keywords.

An FHVAE can learn a latent space that separates the more static attributes within an utterance from the more dynamic attributes by encoding them into two different sets of latent variables. Useful factors for dialect identification, such as phonetic or linguistic content, are encoded by a segmental latent variable, while irrelevant factors that are relatively constant within a sequence, such as a channel or a speaker information, are encoded by a sequential latent variable. The disentanglement property makes the segmental latent variable less susceptible to channel and speaker variation, and thus reduces degradation from channel domain mismatch. We demonstrate that on fully-supervised DID tasks, an end-to-end model trained on the features extracted from the FHVAE model achieves the best performance, compared to the same model trained on conventional acoustic features and an i-vector based system.

The authors suggest the use of computerized systems that automatically link assessment and recommendations as an effective method that can further increase the consistency of BI-RADS guidance. Although we agree with the authors, we believe that limitations of the BI-RADS system that arise from the methodology of system development must be emphasized. Despite the fact that scoring systems perform well in predicting outcomes in the original cohorts on which the models were developed, they may underestimate or overestimate outcomes in different populations [2]. Standardized scoring and reporting systems, such as BI-RADS, have been developed by use of conventional statistical methods, which are completely reductionist in nature. Contrary to the belief of Rene Descartes, biologic systems are complex systems, and their behavior cannot be explained by reductionist approaches [3]. In recent years, various methods based on artificial intelligence techniques, claiming to be universal approximators, have been proposed as alternatives to statistical methods, especially to model highly nonlinear functional relationships [2]. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are useful in detecting complex nonlinear relationships between a set of inputs and outputs, can be used as an example. ANNs have been shown to be as effective and sometimes superior to polynomial equations in predicting quantitative nonlinear relationships between variables and responses. Fuzzy logic is another problemsolving technique that defines and generates responses based on ambiguous, incomplete, and imprecise information. Fuzzy systems have drawn growing attention and interest in bioinformatics applications, decision-making studies, pattern recognition, and data analysis. By a combination of ANNs and fuzzy logic, the so called neurofuzzy approach, deficiencies of both can be compensated to some extent and their explanatory power can be increased further. Neurofuzzy systems have already been successfully applied to computer-aided diagnosis (e.g., detection of microcalcification, automatic detection of distorted plethysmogram pulses in neonates and pediatric patients, detection of erythematosquamous diseases, and lung-nodule detection) and have been useful for predicting the presence of prostate cancer [2]. In conclusion, we must change our reductionistic philosophy to understand disease states and their treatment. Selda Tez 19 Mayis Hospital Ankara, Turkey Yusuf A.

The goal of the learner in this domain is to classify the working state of the component in real time, given a stream of samples from the sensor array. Suppose that during the daytime hours, bear- ing temperatures rise from ambient heat, to levels that would, under other conditions, raise warning. In this case, the previous values used to classify nominal oper- ation do not reflect the new operating parameters. A supervised learner that is not modified after training re- quires retraining on the new instances. We are interested in applying biologically plausible computational models to this problem. Abstract Traditional supervised learning techniques do not ad- dress online learning problems such as concept drift, due to the fact that learning is offline when using these meth- ods. Associative neural networks using Hebbian learning rules show robust performance in classification tasks in- volving concept drift. Biologically plausible neural net- works represent a set of computational models designed to be more strongly related to biological neuron models. In this paper, we apply a biologically inspired plasticity model of synapse dynamics to a concept drift classifi- cation problem. The motivation for this method is to provide more biologically plausible networks in cognitive tasks. Introduction Concept Drift Concept drift is a real world problem associated with concept learning and classification: over time or as an agent gains more information about a concept and re- lated concepts, the parameters of the features defining the concept change. Traditional supervised learners do not address the issue. Learning in problem domains with static concepts also avoids the problem, but it is a prob- lem in dynamic learning problems and agents. Intuitively, neural networks seem to have properties that would be helpful in concept drift problems. Partic- ularly, associative neural networks seem appropriate to the problem. Traditional artificial neural networks how- ever were designed as computational models first based on observed neuron behavior second. Previous Work Computational modeling of neuron processes has re- ceived a wealth of research (O\u2019Reilly and Munakata, 2000). Some well researched models have been ap- plied to learning problems such as concept drift. Biehl and Schwarze (Biehl and Schwarze, 1993) demonstrate a Hebbian learning model for handling random as well as correlated concept drift. Widmer and Kubat (Widmer and Kubat, 1996) show how latent variables can influ- ence concept drift in the form of context. In this paper, we show results of timing dependent synapses, whose po- tentiation is governed by firing rate patterns of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. Schlimmer and Granger (Schlim- mer and Granger, 1986) show how learning incrementally from noisy data can still generate classification results. Consider the real world problem of classifying the working state of a power plant component (e.g. a tur- bine generator), given a set of sensor array readings for For the purpose of this discussion, we define concep- tual drift to be the change in distribution parameters that define a classification. For example, suppose that the probability density of the an instance belonging to a classification was defined as Gaussian. The parameters defining that distribution would change over time, indi- cating a conceptual drift. This drift can be correlated, so that concepts at time t are related to concepts at time t + n. Clearly, even in a binary decision task, if drift oc- curs, the decision boundary generated for the concepts at t would not be the decision boundary generated at t + n. Concept drift can increase without repetition (i.e. never returning to a previous distribution). Essentially, a concept\u2019s change is continual, and while the rate of change can slow, the change always leads to a new pa- rameterization of the concept probability distribution in feature space. A good example of this might be bear- ing temperature whose value distribution permanently changes after seating. Repeating and cyclic concept patterns There are some special cases worth mentioning. Concept drift can repeat. Suppose that a concept, after initial training, is explained by a parameterization b 1 . In online learn- ing, more instances arrive, inducing parameterization b 2 . Still more instances arrive, driving the concept param- eterization back to b 1 . The learner, having learned pa- rameterization b 1 would do best to take advantage of the previously learned concept. Concept drift can also be cyclic, where a concept repeats a set of parameteriza- tions in an order, and this ordering repeats. In general, these special cases point to the fact that a latent variable", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2622848377", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["121827424", "59870047", "53821877", "1215146", "33776987", "5952546", "7995837", "15558554"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13544007"}

In the calculation, the weight of each labeler is always unknown and people always assign the weight for each labeler by random or equally, and this may result in the ambiguous labels for the bags, which is called weak labels here. In addition, we always meet the problem of knowledge transfer from the source task to the target task, and this leads to the study of multiple instance transfer learning. In this article, we propose a new framework called transfer learning-based multiple instance learning (TMIL) framework to address the problem of multiple instance transfer learning in which both the source task and the target task contain the weak labels. We first construct a TMIL model with weak labels, which can transfer knowledge from the source task to the target task where both source and target tasks contain weak labels. We then put forward an iterative framework to solve the transfer learning model with weak labels so that we can update the label of the bag to improve the performance of multiple instance learning.

PSO-based SVM network intrusion detection is innovatively adopted in the paper where PSO is applied to support the parameters of SVM. Multi-classification is carried out with one versus one (OVO). The experiments on standard intrusion detection data set show that the PSO-based SVM method proposed in this paper is better than classical SVM method. Therefore, PSO -SVM test is very suitable for network intrusion detection. Introduction With the development of computer and internet, the network has been widely applied and its security has aroused people\u2019s attention. By detecting relevant audit data, system journals or system data for example, Intrusion Detection can decide whether there are any strategies or methods to threaten the security of network. Intrusion detection is to classify relevant data, finding out what data is normal, what is abnormal. Anomaly Detection is an Intrusion Detection technique, which is applied to test the deviation of the present situation to normal situation, according to observation result in the normal situation, and then make the intrusion detection through the analysis system or the deviation between the user behavior and normal behavior. Anomaly Detection can find out the new intrusion methods and users\u2019 misbehavior. The detecting methods include nerve system, fuzzy set theory, genetic arithmetic, and immunity theory. But methods like nerve system are low in accuracy when doing network security intrusion detection. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is proposed to avoid these disadvantages [1]. Based on statistic study theory and structure risk minimization, SVM theory is a brand-new study machine, solving the problems of partial extremum and over fitting phenomenon. Despite a lack of priori knowledge, SVM may make more accurate classification so that the whole intrusion detection system is better at detecting data. But there are some innate defects in traditional SVM, and some problems are difficult to solve, for example: the preference of kernel function, the speed of detection etc. These are main difficulties of SVM [2]. So, in this paper, various SVM parameters are optimized utilizing particle swarm algorithm.

{"paper_id": "14838462", "title": "Connectionist Modeling of Language: Examples and Implications", "authors": [{"first": "David", "middle": ["C."], "last": "Plaut", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Researchers interested in human cognitive processes have long used computer simulations to try to identify the principles of cognition. The strategy has been to build computational models that embody putative principles and then to examine how well such models capture human performance in cognitive tasks. Until the early 1980\u2019s, this effort was undertaken largely within the context of the \u201ccomputer metaphor\u201d of mind. Researchers built computational models based on the conceptualization that the human mind operated as though it were a conventional digital computer. However, with the advent of so-called connectionist, neural network, or parallel distributed processing models (Anderson, Silverstein, Ritz, & Jones, 1977; Hinton & Anderson, 1981; McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981; McClelland, Rumelhart, & PDP Research Group, 1986; Rumelhart, McClelland, & PDP Research Group, 1986), researchers began exploring the implications of principles that are more broadly consistent with the style of computation employed by the brain. In connectionist models, cognitive processes take the form of cooperative and competitive interactions among large numbers of simple, neuron-like processing units (see Figure 1). Unit interactions are governed by weighted connections that collectively encode the long-term knowledge of the system. The activity of some of the units encodes the input to the system; the resulting activity of other units encodes the system\u2019s response to that input. The patterns of activity of the remaining so-called hidden units constitute learned internal representations that mediate between inputs and outputs. Learning involves modifying the values of connection weights based on feedback from the environment on the accuracy of the system\u2019s responses. While each unit exhibits non-linear spatial and temporal summation, units and connections are not generally considered to be in one-to-one correspondence with actual neurons and synapses. Rather, connectionist systems attempt to capture the essential computational properties of the vast ensembles of real neuronal elements found in the brain, through simulations of smaller networks of units. In this way, the approach is distinct from computational neuroscience (Sejnowski, Koch, & Church", "year": 1998, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "44094419", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17526697", "26337319", "195973521", "144364447", "62151939", "60457972", "7741931", "146789070", "5892527", "140510420", "21975212", "23185326", "2763403", "211724331", "2105042", "24167820", "29043627", "61117014", "7124828", "6711307", "18181267", "60643864", "209396626", "11376473", "142822873", "144596341", "1874331", "35122435", "61064517", "145526011", "15560738", "143322175", "16291062", "20501973", "11708426", "4362134", "209396626", "15118845", "209396626", "198159", "145429190", "60496409", "30956329", "16774179", "2376781", "22761276", "144609697", "62704862", "62166684", "43544282", "12217058", "15713429", "58759858", "557347", "23789004", "17126604", "41058745", "961169", "209396626", "209396626", "18564256", "1093180", "30165868", "5788017", "210535755", "981612", "144930165", "14498946", "58798889", "11312358"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14838462"}

We present \\TOMOGAN{}, a denoising technique based on generative adversarial networks, for improving the quality of reconstructed images for low-dose imaging conditions. We evaluate our approach in two photon-budget-limited experimental conditions: (1) sufficient number of low-dose projections (based on Nyquist sampling), and (2) insufficient or limited number of high-dose projections. In both cases the angular sampling is assumed to be isotropic, and the photon budget throughout the experiment is fixed based on the maximum allowable radiation dose on the sample. Evaluation with both simulated and experimental datasets shows that our approach can significantly reduce noise in reconstructed images, improving the structural similarity score of simulation and experimental data from 0.18 to 0.9 and from 0.18 to 0.41, respectively.

With the emergence of big data, there is an increasing need to parallelize the training process of decision tree. However, most existing attempts along this line suffer from high communication costs. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called \\emph{Parallel Voting Decision Tree (PV-Tree)}, to tackle this challenge. After partitioning the training data onto a number of (e.g., $M$) machines, this algorithm performs both local voting and global voting in each iteration. For local voting, the top-$k$ attributes are selected from each machine according to its local data. Then, the indices of these top attributes are aggregated by a server, and the globally top-$2k$ attributes are determined by a majority voting among these local candidates. Finally, the full-grained histograms of the globally top-$2k$ attributes are collected from local machines in order to identify the best (most informative) attribute and its split point. PV-Tree can achieve a very low communication cost (independent of the total number of attributes) and thus can scale out very well. Furthermore, theoretical analysis shows that this algorithm can learn a near optimal decision tree, since it can find the best attribute with a large probability. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that PV-Tree significantly outperforms the existing parallel decision tree algorithms in the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1611.01276", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952714963,2553372643", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9848468", "1159048", "60993494", "89141", "397316", "7955044", "10308629", "1854939", "17001902", "18224224", "8268690", "9775238", "59871497", "13252401", "15051489"], "inbound_citations": ["47008309", "3815895", "52926013", "56089029", "204081256", "210023586", "57376417", "44132618", "196184846", "4624647", "202889935", "215723302", "42431206", "2951068", "198920364", "129945921", "215445177", "199440869", "37816994", "207957998", "26627808", "202687046"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3756321"}

As the networks evolve over times, the interactions among the nodes in networks make heterogeneous networks exhibit dynamic characteristics. However, almost all the existing heterogeneous network representation learning methods focus on static networks which ignore dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach DHNE to learn the representations of nodes in dynamic heterogeneous networks. The key idea of our approach is to construct comprehensive historical-current networks based on subgraphs of snapshots in time step to capture both the historical and current information in the dynamic heterogeneous network. And then under the guidance of meta paths, DHNE performs random walks on the constructed historical-current graphs to capture semantic information. After getting the node sequences through random walks, we propose the dynamic heterogeneous skip-gram model to learn the embeddings. Experiments on large-scale real-world networks demonstrate that the embeddings learned by the proposed DHNE model achieve better performances than state-of-the-art methods in various downstream tasks including node classifcation and visualization.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2942221", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2974594200", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["29608532", "10082102", "17145594", "3919301", "35493", "3051291", "207238980", "207238964", "19140125", "19188052", "28890170", "52930287", "51604561", "13741853", "3951790", "3953995", "3215337", "8399404", "16689401", "1364376", "322265", "16447573", "14879725", "3348552", "49651804", "10211629"], "inbound_citations": ["214774756"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203605105"}

The RF model, with a classification accuracy of 76.67%, identified fourteen DMN connections, two neuropsychological variables (memory span and total correct scores of the forward condition of the VST), and all impulsivity factors as significantly important for classifying participants into either the AUD or CTL group. Specifically, the AUD group manifested hyperconnectivity across the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and the prefrontal cortex as well as between the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex and the left inferior parietal lobule, while showing hypoconnectivity in long-range anterior\u2013posterior and interhemispheric long-range connections. Individuals with AUD also showed poorer memory performance and increased impulsivity compared to CTL individuals.

The time-varying amplitude and frequency sequences determining the subband sEMG signals have been estimated and their dominant values over short time intervals have been explored as fatigue-indicating features. These features are found carrying muscle fatigue cues of the human demonstrator in the course of robot manipulation. In robot learning tasks requiring multiple demonstrations, the fatiguing status of human demonstrator can be acquired by tracking the changes of the proposed features over time. In order to model data from multiple demonstrations, Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) have been employed. According to the identified muscle fatigue factor, a weight has been assigned to each of the demonstration trials in training stage, which is therefore termed as weighted GMMs (W-GMMs) algorithm. Six groups of data with various fatiguing status, as well as their corresponding weights, are taken as input data to get the adapted W-GMMs parameters. After that, Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) algorithm has been applied to regenerate the movement trajectory for the robot.

All the existing adversarial training methods consider only how the worst perturbed examples (i.e., adversarial examples) could affect the model output. Despite their success, we argue that such setting may be in lack of generalization, since the output space (or label space) is apparently less informative.In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Manifold Adversarial Training (MAT). MAT manages to build an adversarial framework based on how the worst perturbation could affect the distributional manifold rather than the output space. Particularly, a latent data space with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) will be first derived.On one hand, MAT tries to perturb the input samples in the way that would rough the distributional manifold the worst. On the other hand, the deep learning model is trained trying to promote in the latent space the manifold smoothness, measured by the variation of Gaussian mixtures (given the local perturbation around the data point). Importantly, since the latent space is more informative than the output space, the proposed MAT can learn better a robust and compact data representation, leading to further performance improvement. The proposed MAT is important in that it can be considered as a superset of one recently-proposed discriminative feature learning approach called center loss.

Consequently, a classifier has a little biased information related to the classes resulting in lower accuracy rates.

However, the further development of a recommender system has been restricted to some extent by the problems of cold start and data sparsity. To weaken the effect caused by data loss, some implicit feedback data are typically introduced into the recommendation such as social information and attribute data. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous information boosting model for recommendations (HIBoosting). The model takes advantage of different network meta-paths to mine the potential information of user social networks, object metadata and interactive data in heterogeneous information networks. For different semantic information, we use a random-walk based on a meta-path to calculate the similarities of users or items, which are used to extract the low-dimensional embedded features of users or items by factorization, construct user profiles and item profiles. Finally, the embedded features are used for integrated learning by a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) to provide users with better recommendation services. The model not only integrates heterogeneous information in information networks, but also makes full use of mining latent relations of heterogeneous information networks.

While identifying and analyzing named entities in a given natural language is a challenging research problem by itself, the phenomenal growth in the Internet user population, especially among the non-English speaking parts of the world, has extended this problem to the crosslingual arena. We specifically focus on research on all aspects of the Named Entities in our workshop series, Named Entities WorkShop (NEWS). The first of the NEWS workshops (NEWS 2009) was held as a part of ACL-IJCNLP 2009 conference in Singapore, and the current edition (NEWS 2010) is being held as a part of ACL 2010, in Uppsala, Sweden. ::: ::: The purpose of the NEWS workshop is to bring together researchers across the world interested in identification, analysis, extraction, mining and transformation of named entities in monolingual or multilingual natural language text. The workshop scope includes many interesting specific research areas pertaining to the named entities, such as, orthographic and phonetic characteristics, corpus analysis, unsupervised and supervised named entities extraction in monolingual or multilingual corpus, transliteration modelling, and evaluation methodologies, to name a few. For this years edition, 11 research papers were submitted, each of which was reviewed by at least 3 reviewers from the program committee. 7 papers were chosen for publication, covering main research areas, from named entities recognition, extraction and categorization, to distributional characteristics of named entities, and finally a novel evaluation metrics for co-reference resolution. All accepted research papers are published in the workshop proceedings. ::: ::: This year, as parts of the NEWS workshop, we organized two shared tasks: one on Machine Transliteration Generation, and another on Machine Transliteration Mining, participated by research teams from around the world, including industry, government laboratories and academia. ::: ::: The transliteration generation task was introduced in NEWS 2009. While the focus of the 2009 shared task was on establishing the quality metrics and on baselining the transliteration quality based on those metrics, the 2010 shared task expanded the scope of the transliteration generation task to about dozen languages, and explored the quality depending on the direction of transliteration, between the languages. We collected significantly large, hand-crafted parallel named entities corpora in dozen different languages from 8 language families, and made available as common dataset for the shared task. We published the details of the shared task and the training and development data six months ahead of the conference that attracted an overwhelming response from the research community. Totally 7 teams participated in the transliteration generation task. The approaches ranged from traditional unsupervised learning methods (such as, Phrasal SMT-based, Conditional Random Fields, etc.) to somewhat unique approaches (such as, DirectTL approach), combined with several model combinations for results re-ranking. A report of the shared task that summarizes all submissions and the original whitepaper are also included in the proceedings, and will be presented in the workshop. The participants in the shared task were asked to submit short system papers (4 pages each) describing their approach, and each of such papers was reviewed by at least two members of the program committee to help improve the quality of the content and presentation of the papers. 6 of them were finally accepted to be published in the workshop proceedings (one participating team did not submit their system paper in time). ::: ::: NEWS 2010 also featured a second shared task this year, on Transliteration Mining; in this shared task we focus specifically on mining transliterations from the commonly available resource Wikipedia titles. The objective of this shared task is to identify transliterations from linked Wikipedia titles between English and another language in a non-Latin script. 5 teams participated in the mining task, each participating in multiple languages. The shared task was conducted in 5 language pairs, and the paired Wikipedia titles between English and each of the languages was provided to the participants. The participating systems output was measured using three specific metrics. All the results are reported in the shared task report. ::: ::: We hope that NEWS 2010 would provide an exciting and productive forum for researchers working in this research area. The technical programme includes 7 research papers and 9 system papers (3 as oral papers, and 6 as poster papers) to be presented in the workshop. Further, we are pleased to have Dr Dan Roth, Professor at University of Illinois and The Beckman Institute, delivering the keynote speech at the workshop.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2622850790,2912273839", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64819293"}

For the machine learning approach, we implemented a dataset utilizing the Adaptive Boosting Trigger (AdaBoostTrigger) algorithm via video tagging to enable fall detection. For each approach, each subject on average has performed six true positive and six false positive fall incidents in two different conditions: one with objects partially blocking the sensor's view and one with partial obstructed field of view. The accuracy of each approach has been compared against one another in different conditions. The result showed an average of 95.42 % accuracy in the heuristic approach and 88.33 % in machine learning technique.

In particular, data fusion approaches that use depth and colour information (i.e., RGB-D data) seem to be particularly promising for recognizing large classes of human actions with a high level of accuracy. Anyway, existing data fusion approaches are mainly based on feature fusion strategies, which tend to suffer of some limitations, including the difficult of combining different feature types and the management of missing information. To address the two problems just reported, we propose an RGB-D data based human action recognition system supported by a decision fusion strategy. The system, starting from the well-known Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) data fusion model, analyses human actions separately for each channel (i.e., depth and colour). The actions are modelled as a sum of visual words by using the traditional Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model. Subsequently, on each channel, these actions are classified by using a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Finally, the classification results are fused by a Naive Bayes Combination (NBC) method. The effectiveness of the proposed system has been proven on the basis of three public datasets: UTKinect-Action3D, CAD-60, and LIRIS Human Activities.

Based on the CELF-P2 scores, the CI recipients were designated as either effective or ineffective CI users. For feature extraction from the fMRI data, we constructed contrast maps using the general linear model, and then utilized the Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach that we previously published to convert the contrast maps into feature vectors. We trained both supervised models and semi-supervised models to classify CI users as effective or ineffective. ::: ::: ::: ::: Results ::: ::: Compared with the conventional feature extraction approach, which used each single voxel as a feature, our BoW approach gave rise to much better performance for the classification of effective versus ineffective CI users. The semi-supervised model with the feature set extracted by the BoW approach from the contrast of speech versus silence achieved a leave-one-out cross-validation AUC as high as 0.97. Recursive feature elimination unexpectedly revealed that two features were sufficient to provide highly accurate classification of effective versus ineffective CI users based on our current dataset. ::: ::: ::: ::: Conclusion ::: ::: We have validated the hypothesis that pre-implant cortical activation patterns revealed by fMRI during infancy correlate with language performance 2 years after cochlear implantation.

It is becoming the best alternate of sensor based detectors for early detection of wildfire. The limitations of sensor based detector is that, they need close vicinity to fire for raising the alarm which make them vulnerable in case of detecting far-distant wild fire. Hence, vision based detection system which utilizes the surveillance cameras which shows more fastness and robustness as compared to sensor based detectors. These cameras when installed on hill top or mobile tower can raise the early alarm for any possibility of smoke present in the frames of videos whether near-by or far-away smoke. The proposed work presents a robust method for smoke detection which, utilizes a dual deep learning framework. The proposed architecture makes use of framework based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, which has proven their supremacy in object recognition tasks. The first deep learning framework is employed for extracting the image-based features from smoke patches, which are being extracted using superpixel algorithm. We have employed total of 20,000 frames with equally distribution of non smoke and smoke classes, out of which 6000 frames are utilized for testing purpose and 14,000 are used for fine tuning purpose. These features are comprised of smoke-color, smoke-texture, sharp edge detection and perimeter disorder analysis. The second deep learning framework is used for extracting motion-based features such as moving region of smoke, growing region and rising region detection. Optical flow method is employed, in order to capture the random motion of smoke. These extracted optical flow are then feed into Deep CNN for extracting motion based features. Features from both the framework are combined to train the Support Vector Machine and end to end classification which is CNN classifier. Accuracy on the nearby smoke and faraway smoke is \\(98.29\\%\\) and \\(91.96\\%\\) respectively. Testing on different varieties of non-smoke videos such as clouds, fog, sandstorm and images of cloud on water, method proves its precision and robustness. The average accuracy in all the scenarios is \\(97.49\\%\\) which outperforms the state of the art method for these scenarios.

It would be very resource consuming to test all the modules while the defect lies in fraction of modules. Information about fault-proneness of classes and methods can be used to develop new strategies which can help mitigate the overall development cost and increase the customer satisfaction. Several machine learning strategies have been used in recent past to identify defective modules. These models are built using publicly available historical software defect data sets. Most of the proposed techniques are not able to deal with the class imbalance problem efficiently. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a prediction model which consists of small simple and comprehensible rules. Considering these facts, in this paper, the authors propose a novel defect prediction approach named GUHA based Classification Association Rule Mining algorithm G-CARM where \"GUHA\" stands for General Unary Hypothesis Automaton. G-CARM approach is primarily based on Classification Association Rule Mining, and deploys a two stage process involving attribute discretization, and rule generation using GUHA. GUHA is oldest yet very powerful method of pattern mining. The basic idea of GUHA procedure is to mine the interesting attribute patterns that indicate defect proneness. The new method has been compared against five other models reported in recent literature viz. Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, RIPPER, J48 and Nearest Neighbour classifier by using several measures, including AUC and probability of detection. The experimental results indicate that the prediction performance of G-CARM approach is better than other prediction approaches. The authors' approach achieved 76% mean recall and 83% mean precision for defective modules and 93% mean recall and 83% mean precision for non-defective modules on CM1, KC1, KC2 and Eclipse data sets. Further defect rule generation process often generates a large number of rules which require considerable efforts while using these rules as a defect predictor, hence, a rule sub-set selection process is also proposed to select best set of rules according to the requirements. Evolution criteria for defect prediction like sensitivity, specificity, precision often compete against each other. It is therefore, important to use multi-objective optimization algorithms for selecting prediction rules. In this paper the authors report prediction rules that are Pareto efficient in the sense that no further improvements in the rule set is possible without sacrificing some performance criteria. Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm has been used to find Pareto front and defect prediction rules.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4018/ijssci.2014040101", "venue": "IJSSCI", "journal": "IJSSCI", "mag_id": "314710451", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16241985"}

While, most SBIR approaches focus on extracting low- and mid-level descriptors for direct feature matching, recent works have shown the benefit of learning coupled feature representations to describe data from two related sources. However, cross-domain representation learning methods are typically cast into non-convex minimization problems that are difficult to optimize, leading to unsatisfactory performance. Inspired by self-paced learning (SPL), a learning methodology designed to overcome convergence issues related to local optima by exploiting the samples in a meaningful order (i.e., easy to hard), we introduce the cross-paced partial curriculum learning (CPPCL) framework. Compared with existing SPL methods which only consider a single modality and cannot deal with prior knowledge, CPPCL is specifically designed to assess the learning pace by jointly handling data from dual sources and modality-specific prior information provided in the form of partial curricula. In addition, thanks to the learned dictionaries, we demonstrate that the proposed CPPCL embeds robust coupled representations for SBIR.

Given the assumption that, in terms of conveying the narrative of a field-sports-video, score-update events constitute the most significant moments, it is proposed that their detection should thus yield a favourable summarisation solution. To this end, a generic methodology is proposed for the automatic identification of score-update events in field-sports-video content. The scheme is based on the development of robust extractors for a set of critical features, which are shown to reliably indicate their locations. The evidence gathered by the feature extractors is combined and analysed using a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which performs the event detection process. An SVM is chosen on the basis that its underlying technology represents an implementation of the latest generation of machine learning algorithms, based on the recent advances in statistical learning. Effectively, an SVM offers a solution to optimising the classification performance of a decision hypothesis, inferred from a given set of training data. Via a learning phase that utilizes a 90-hour field-sports-video trainmg-corpus, the SVM infers a score-update event model by observing patterns in the extracted feature evidence. Using a similar but distinct 90-hour evaluation corpus, the effectiveness of this model is then tested genencally across multiple genres of fieldsports- video including soccer, rugby, field hockey, hurling, and Gaelic football.

In this paper, we hypothesize that there exists an inherent mapping between the low-quality embedding to a latent optimal one, with which the generator (decoder) can produce much better results. To improve the de-raining results significantly over existing models, we propose to learn this mapping by formulating a residual learning branch, that is capable of adaptively adding residuals to the original low-quality embedding in a representation entanglement manner. Using an embedding learned this way, the decoder is able to generate much more satisfactory de-raining results with better detail recovery and rain artefacts removal, providing new state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets with considerable improvement (i.e., on the challenging Rain100H data, an improvement of 4.19dB on PSNR and 5% on SSIM is obtained).

{"paper_id": "196212466", "title": "Automated Approaches to Community Question Answering", "authors": [{"first": "Antonio", "middle": [], "last": "Uva", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Social Media applications, e.g., forums, social networks, allow users to pose questions about a given topic to a community of expert users. Although successful, these applications suffer from a major drawback: it is rather complex to find similar questions with traditional keyword-based search. Thus, Community Question Answering (cQA), a branch of QA, has been developed with the aim of automatically answering new user questions. Generally, cQA systems answer new user questions by (i) first looking at the questions most similar to the input question and (ii) selecting the best answer for the related question. Such systems require powerful machine learning algorithms that go beyond traditional approaches based on features. In recent years, tree kernels and neural networks have established as the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for solving such kinds of problems. Tree kernels are used to compute the similarity between two sentences encoded in form of trees that incorporate syntactic and semantic information. Neural networks map words into informative vectors called embeddings used to learn non-linear transformations of user inputs. In this work, we used these models for solving classification and ranking tasks needed to build automatic cQA systems. As a first step, we conceived structured input models able to automatically extract discriminative syntactic patterns for classifying relatedness between two questions. Then, we extended the previous work by presenting a new model for question similarity that combines semantic information of neural networks with structured information of tree kernels. We assess the performance of the new model on two tasks, i.e. question duplicate detection and question reranking, showing the advantages of injecting syntactic information in neural models. After that, we focus on more challenging tasks such as building a neural network architecture for ranking comments on a forum according to their relevance with respect to a new question. We show that neural models can benefit from being trained in multi-task learning setting, together with auxiliary tasks. This make possible to train cQA systems in an end-to-end fashion, which is convenient for industrial applications that needs to be easily deployed. Furthermore, we developed a novel intent detection model that combines state-of-the-art methods in relational text matching with the latest techniques in supervised clustering to make inference over a set of questions and automatically discover intent clusters. The latter can be used to quickly bootstrap Natural Language Understanding pipelines for dialog systems. To conclude, we study advantages and disadvantages of neural networks and tree kernel models when applied to cQA tasks. We show that neural networks perform effectively when data is abundant. Conversely,tree kernels are more suitable in presence of data scarcity.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2949376815", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196212466"}

This paper evaluates two methods of sequence classification based on Hidden Markov Model, namely the maximum likelihood and similarity-based methods, for classification of malware using a large and comprehensive dataset. System calls generated by known malware during execution are used as observation sequences to train the Hidden Markov Models. Malware samples are evaluated against the trained models to produce similarity vectors, which are used in the maximum likelihood and similarity-based classification schemes to predict the family for an unknown malware sample. Comparison of the two schemes shows that combining the powerful statistical pattern analysis capability of Hidden Markov Models and discriminative classifiers in the similarity- based method results in a significantly better classification performance as compared to the maximum likelihood approach.

The motivating application is diagnostic fetal echocardiography analysis. Currently in clinical practice, recording full diagnostic fetal echocardiography is not common. Diagnostic videos are typically available in varying length and summarize a number of diagnostic sub-tasks of varying difficulty. Although large clinical datasets may be available at onset to build ultrasound image-based models for automatic image analysis, data may also become available over extended time to assist in algorithm refinement. To address this scenario, we propose to use an incremental learning approach to build a hierarchical network model that allows for a parallel inclusion of previously unseen anatomical classes without requiring prior data distributions. Super classes are obtained by coarse classification followed by fine classification to allow the model to self-organize anatomical structures in a sequence of categories through a modular architecture. We show that this approach can be adapted with new variable data distributions without significantly affecting previously learned representations. Two extreme situations of new data addition are considered; (1) when new class data is available over time with volume and distribution similar to prior available classes, and (2) when imbalanced datasets arrive over future time to be learned in a few-shot setting. In either case, availability of data from prior classes is not assumed. Evolution of the learning process is validated using incremental accuracies of fine classification over novel classes and compared to results from an end-to-end transfer learning-derived model fine-tuned on a clinical dataset annotated by experienced sonographers. The modularization of subsequent learning reduces the depreciation in future accuracies over old tasks from 6.75% to 1.10% using balanced increments. The depreciation is reduced from 6.95% to 1.89% with imbalanced data distributions in future increments, while retaining competitive classification accuracies in new additions of fine classes with parameter operations in the same order of magnitude in all stages in both cases.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32071014", "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2020.2973372", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3006419424", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["29631179", "16449991", "12730344", "44148227", "73497737", "362467", "6161478", "13874643", "914027", "15350923", "3693512", "206597351", "58057743", "10409742", "3355837", "206597351", "195882267", "206596260", "3883162", "204028221", "5575601", "53100504", "53102984", "210936517", "27934867", "8909022", "2164305", "53100504", "210936517"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211193221"}

Shevade and Keerthi propose a gene selection algorithm based on sparse logistic regression (SLogReg) incorporating a Laplace prior to promote sparsity in the model parameters, and provide a simple but efficient training procedure. The degree of sparsity obtained is determined by the value of a regularization parameter, which must be carefully tuned in order to optimize performance. This normally involves a model selection stage, based on a computationally intensive search for the minimizer of the cross-validation error. In this paper, we demonstrate that a simple Bayesian approach can be taken to eliminate this regularization parameter entirely, by integrating it out analytically using an uninformative Jeffrey's prior. The improved algorithm (BLogReg) is then typically two or three orders of magnitude faster than the original algorithm, as there is no longer a need for a model selection step. The BLogReg algorithm is also free from selection bias in performance estimation, a common pitfall in the application of machine learning algorithms in cancer classification. ::: ::: Results: The SLogReg, BLogReg and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) gene selection algorithms are evaluated over the well-studied colon cancer and leukaemia benchmark datasets. The leave-one-out estimates of the probability of test error and cross-entropy of the BLogReg and SLogReg algorithms are very similar, however the BlogReg algorithm is found to be considerably faster than the original SLogReg algorithm. Using nested cross-validation to avoid selection bias, performance estimation for SLogReg on the leukaemia dataset takes almost 48 h, whereas the corresponding result for BLogReg is obtained in only 1 min 24 s, making BLogReg by far the more practical algorithm. BLogReg also demonstrates better estimates of conditional probability than the RVM, which are of great importance in medical applications, with similar computational expense. ::: ::: Availability: A MATLAB implementation of the sparse logistic regression algorithm with Bayesian regularization (BLogReg) is available from http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~gcc/cbl/blogreg/ ::: ::: Contact: [email protected]", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "16844704", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btl386", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2144073719", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["9061359", "11625473", "198169059", "14814125", "523115", "6723676", "15179374", "13358226", "2914506", "118511012", "61649919", "2702042", "15439301", "58799660", "6530745", "15883988", "12018209", "14407056", "5943198", "62698647", "887404", "122072756", "7596571", "15739233"], "inbound_citations": ["4578315", "16401441", "59148770", "2715193", "14546719", "20854946", "17915816", "156054122", "46937960", "30428532", "24729223", "215443250", "14000960", "18955683", "15062013", "303256", "5712040", "8633969", "13958427", "1685931", "23898282", "18987264", "59233581", "6481310", "211076037", "2560851", "1420664", "54449525", "53042569", "10020941", "9792267", "196622203", "52063147", "21290002", "37999645", "28185737", "201283414", "3254023", "3425953", "199509439", "3182431", "17294611", "3406151", "55001086", "11768303", "6861041", "940966", "31541846", "4330146", "17464877", "16284289", "23901096", "208561806", "10911081", "196607608", "19240574", "71152963", "11834752", "91928009", "8565221", "16341080", "877788", "15945593", "15006243", "3178113", "201125405", "14840867", "24113190", "49540194", "201628377", "6718386", "6138340", "51846183", "208527576", "3824941", "131828314", "17201663", "12337340", "18093488", "16993462", "195906112", "215299511", "13325386", "18836575", "43935249", "19007979", "5740788", "201873451", "32678025", "11323554", "53305648", "4473804", "211252717", "14128382", "12965245", "4964532", "51611530", "57189808", "57189808", "12061187", "14729147", "209429381", "8333598", "51613916", "52283881", "44061188", "33522157", "3441420", "39179762", "34886506", "207749481", "27502170", "15670473", "13375266", "13375266", "17035307", "73556758"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1300054"}

Still, the robustness of the category-order effect is not unquestionable: the effect can be eliminated by inhibiting the consolidation of information by decreasing presentation rates, through articulatory suppression and through the reduction of available attentional resources (Greene & Lasek, 1994; for a more complete discussion of the influences on category-order effects, see Schoenherr & Thomson, 2008). Abstract Numerous factors interact to affect a participant's ability to encode and recall information. One example of this interaction is known as the category-order effect (COE; Brooks and Watkins, 1990). The present study models earlier work performed by the authors (Schoenherr & Thompson, 2008) with an oscillator-based model of memory (Brown et al., 2000). The OSCillator-based Associative Recall (OSCAR) network developed by Brown et al. (2000) was adapted to examine the role that attention plays in the COE. A series of simulations demonstrate that both the differential allocation of attention to items, as well as the strength of items stored in memory, independently contribute to the COE. Further lines of experimental inquiry are also discussed. Models of Human Memory To better understand the processes underlying category- order effects, it is important to identify several models of human memory and identify which provides a plausible explanation of the effects. Three models proposed different underlying mechanisms to describe serial position findings in the memory literature (see reviews in Brown et al., 2000; Henson, 1998). Chaining Theory (Ebbinghaus, 1964) postulates associations between neighbouring elements such that each element is the cue for the subsequent items in memory. Once retrieval is initiated, each item should activate its neighbour in a series of sequential pairwise associations until all items are retrieved. In this model, order information corresponds to the associations between items in memory. A limitation of chaining models is that high item-similarity (including item repetition in the extreme example) causes much higher than expected confusion during recall because highly-similar associations have similar retrieval cues. Positional Theory (Conrad, 1965) assumes that, after encoding, successive items are stored in ordered slots (i.e. bins). In contrast to chained associations, there is no individuated storage of item and order information: order (re: bins) is an implicit mechanism which cues retrieval of item information. Two difficulties of this theory are that there is no plausible explanation of how bins are organized, and theoretically this theory claims there should be no serial position errors. Ordinal Theory (e.g., Estes, 1972) assumes that the position of a list item is stored as a relative value along a continuous property of the items. In the case of memory, the relative strength of the memory trace is used to derive positional information. An advantage of ordinal models is that no explicit positional information need be encoded. The main limitation in ordinal models is that the middle Keywords: category-order effect; OSCAR; list recall; memory; lexicality; working memory Introduction Early studies of memory capacity observed a central distinction between the items being retained and their order of presentation and recall (Healy, 1974; Lashley, 1951). More recently, the interaction of item and position in a sequence have been examined in terms of the category-order effect (Brooks & Watkins, 1990). Brooks and Watkins (1990) defined the category-order effect in terms of an improvement in list recall performance when items from a relatively smaller, homogeneous category are presented prior to a comparatively larger, heterogeneous category (Brooks & Watkins, 1990; Greene & Lasek, 1994). Later work by Schoenherr & Thomson (2008) expanded this notion, finding category-order effects when stimuli from a more salient category preceded those from the less salient category, regardless of category size. Extending our previous work on the category-order effect (Schoenherr & Thomson, 2008), the present study uses an OSCillator-based Associative Recall (OSCAR) network developed by Brown et al. (2000) to examine the contributions of stimulus presentation order and readily distinguishable categories that underlie the category-order effect (Brooks & Watkins, 1990; Greene & Lasek, 1994). The Category-Order Effect Category-order effects have been revealed across a wide range of category properties (e.g. differential frequency, lexicality, and numerals) and are present during both forward and backward recall of list stimuli (Brooks &", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2617177571", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["38891668", "44448820", "46249274", "143294727", "143767383", "144592525", "32139681", "27794632", "21368151", "145167098", "36101244", "54270115", "2768108", "34075108", "41746398", "147449819", "145149827"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:974627"}

However, existing methods usually ignore the underlying coherence among views, which may lead to sub-optimal learning performance.

Specifically, we first divide the original data into several views based on possible combinations of modalities, followed by a sparse representation based hypergraph construction process in each view. A view-aligned hypergraph classification (VAHC) model is then proposed, by using a view-aligned regularizer to model the view coherence. We further assemble the class probability scores generated from VAHC via a multi-view label fusion method to make a final classification decision.

Many studies have been conducted in the estimation of forest above ground biomass (AGB) using features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Specifically, L-band ALOS/PALSAR (wavelength ~23 cm) data is often used. However, few studies have been made on the use of shorter wavelengths (e.g., C-band, 3.75 cm to 7.5 cm) for forest mapping especially in tropical forests since higher attenuation is observed for volumetric objects where energy propagated is absorbed. This study aims to model AGB estimates of mangrove forest using information derived from Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data. Combinations of polarisations (VV, VH), its derivatives, grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and its principal components were used as features for modelling AGB. Five models were tested with varying combinations of features; a) sigma nought polarisations and its derivatives; b) GLCM textures; c) the first five principal components; d) combination of models a\u2212c; and e) the identified important features by Random Forest variable importance algorithm. Random Forest was used as regressor to compute for the AGB estimates to avoid over fitting caused by the introduction of too many features in the model. Model e obtained the highest r2 of 0.79 and an RMSE of 0.44 Mg using only four features, namely, \u03c3\u00b0VH GLCM variance, \u03c3\u00b0VH GLCM contrast, PC1, and PC2.

Our algorithm takes a depth image as input and generates a set of skeletal joints as output. Previous decision forest-based methods often give labels to all points in a point cloud at a very early stage and vote for the joint locations. By contrast, our algorithm only tracks a set of more flexible virtual landmark points, named segmentation index points (SIPs), before reaching the final decision at a leaf node. Roughly speaking, a SIP represents the centroid of a subset of skeletal joints, which are to be located at the leaves of the branch expanded from the SIP. Inspired by recent latent regression forest-based hand pose estimation framework (Tang et al. 2014), we integrate SIP into the framework with several important improvements: First, we devise a new forest growing strategy, whose decision is made using a randomized feature guided by SIPs. Second, we speed-up the training procedure since only SIPs, not the skeletal joints, are estimated at non-leaf nodes.

It is widely believed that speaker verification systems perform better when there is sufficient background training data to deal with nuisance effects of transmission channels.

The main difficulty of large scale surveillance video summarization arises from the contradiction between the high-degree spatiotemporal redundancies and the limited storage budget. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of large scale surveillance video summarization on the basis of event detection. In the proposed approach, we firstly obtain the trajectories of vehicles and pedestrians in a tracking-by-detection manner, and then detect the abnormal events using the trajectories. Finally, we design a disjoint max-coverage algorithm to generate a summarized sequence with maximum coverage of interested events and minimum number of frames. Compared with traditional key frame-based approaches, our approach enjoys the following favorable features. First, important information can be efficiently extracted from the redundant contents since the approach is event-centric and those interested events contain almost all the important information. Second, abnormal events are successfully detected by combining the Random Forest classifier and the trajectory features. Third, the abnormal events are designed to display, and hence further reduces the compression ratio. Due to the above features, the proposed approach is suitable for different scenarios, ranges from highway to crowded crossings. Experiments on 12 surveillance sequences validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2015.07.131", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2287101536", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["49476903", "52286352", "204837453", "49562641", "53287478", "23131996", "3455594", "211519671", "210995352", "21730184", "208880654"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:39620005"}

Finally we turn to the question of whether credit risk is a source of sustainable competitive advantage and what measures would create greater welfare for the financial system as whole.

Using this weltanschauung we conclude with a simple example of restructuring mortgage products using affordability and borrower well being as central to sustainable credit risk management. The article is comprised of survey and quantitative analysis showing how affordability has been used in the credit industry or not used.

Firstly, two LCF life prediction models based on total strain energy density and Support Vector Regression (SVR) meta- model are presented for turbine disk alloy GH4133 under different loading conditions at 250 \u00b0C. Compared with the SWT model, modified Walker model and Response Surface (RS) model, the predicted lives by the proposed models are within a factor of \u00b12 and a factor of \u00b11.1 respectively. Sec- ondly, based on the fatigue design criteria, the probabili- ties of failure are calculated using SPA for the explicit and implicit performance functions using two proposed LCF models and viscosity-based model. These three models have provided the reliability design rules for GH4133. Finally, the failure probabilities curves between SPA and the designed fatigue lives are achieved. The reliability analysis results were found to be in good agreement with the calculated results of test data. These results show that SPA is very apt for the fatigue reliability analysis of turbine disk under different loading conditions using only a small number of samples without any distribution assumptions for random variables. Moreover, it can be used to estimate the system's probability of failure with a large number of random variables or high nonlinearity of performance functions.

The SR approach chosen for this study is Total Variation, an iterative method which models the relationship between the desired high resolution image and the low resolution images, with the following components: a subsampling factor, a point spread function, an estimated rotation and shift, and a regularization term. This regularization approach is fast in implementation and flexible in handling noise. Efficient gradient descent methods can be used to find the desired high resolution image. The spatial resolution of the original image is improved from 25 m to 12 m using Total Variation. Subjective assessment through visual interpretation shows substantial improvement in detail. A tree-based ensemble classifier Random Forest is used for the classification of 18 ecotopes.

Our overall goal was to advance our understanding of the factors that affect performance and interpretation of biological indices. Our specific objectives were to (1) develop biological indices that are insensitive to natural environmental gradients, (2) develop a general method to determine if the biological potential of an assessed site is adequately represented by the population of reference sites, (3) develop a robust method to select metrics for inclusion in MMIs that ensures maximum independence of metrics, and (4) determine if a fundamental sample property (the evenness of taxa counts within a sample) affects index performance. Random Forest modeling revealed that both individual metrics and taxa composition were strongly associated with natural environmental heterogeneity, which meant both the MMI and O/E index needed to be based on site-specific expectations. We produced a precise, responsive, and ecologically robust MMI by using principal components analysis to identify 7 statistically independent metrics from a list of 31 candidate assemblage-level metrics. However, the O/E index we developed was relatively imprecise compared with O/E indices developed for other regions. This imprecision may be the consequence of low predictability in local taxa composition associated with the relatively high spatial isolation of aquatic habitats within arid regions. We were also able to assess the likelihood that the biological potential of assessed sites were adequately characterized by the population of reference sites by developing and applying a multivariate, nearest-neighbor test that determined if an assessed site occurred within the environmental space of the reference site network. This approach is robust and applicable to all biological indices. We also demonstrate that the evenness of taxa counts within a sample is positively related to estimates of sample taxa richness and thus the scores of both indices. The relationship between richness and sample evenness can potentially compromise inferences regarding biological condition, and post hoc adjustments for the effects of evenness on index scores might be desirable. Further improvements in the performance and interpretation of biological indices will require simultaneous consideration of the effects of incomplete sampling on characterization of biological assemblages and the physical and biological factors that influence community assembly.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.09.006", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Indicators", "mag_id": "2096298362", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53801431", "5347287", "212615458", "91263740", "54484202", "54717345", "86294667", "167210327"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86688372"}

We observed that Arc-x4 behaves differently than AdaBoost if reweighting is used instead of resampling, indicating a fundamental difference. Voting variants, some of which are introduced in this paper, include: pruning versus no pruning, use of probabilistic estimates, weight perturbations (Wagging), and backfitting of data. We found that Bagging improves when probabilistic estimates in conjunction with no-pruning are used, as well as when the data was backfit. We measure tree sizes and show an interesting positive correlation between the increase in the average tree size in AdaBoost trials and its success in reducing the error. We compare the mean-squared error of voting methods to non-voting methods and show that the voting methods lead to large and significant reductions in the mean-squared errors. Practical problems that arise in implementing boosting algorithms are explored, including numerical instabilities and underflows. We use scatterplots that graphically show how AdaBoost reweights instances, emphasizing not only \u201chard\u201d areas but also outliers and noise.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null,

The MKELM, which consists of multiple kernels in the hidden nodes of an extreme learning machine, is used for the classification and location of faults in microgrids. A genetic algorithm is employed to determine the optimum parameters of the MKELM. The performance of the proposed method is tested on the standard IEC microgrid test system for various operating conditions and fault cases, including different fault locations, fault resistance, and fault inception angles using the MATLAB/Simulink software.

Two SVM strategies, 1-v-1 (one versus one) and 1-v-r (one versus rest), are respectively adopted at different classification levels. At the parallel classification level, using 1-v-1 strategy, the fault features extracted by various signal analysis methods are transferred into the multiple parallel SVM and the local classification results are obtained. At the serial classification level, these local results values are fused by one serial SVM based on 1-v-r strategy.

Marcus, MIT Press, 2001. $27.95/\u00a319.95 (xii + 224 pages)ISBN 0 262 13379 2This short book provides one of the best available expositions of the nature and shortcomings of the connectionist approach to cognitive modeling. It is a thorough, clearly written, and generally accurate review of the nature of this popular movement.Gary Marcus has been an effective critic of the connectionist approach to modeling the mind, especially as it applies to language acquisition. In this book he covers the range of published arguments concerning the shortcomings of connectionism. This is its purpose and its strength. It is not, however, a novel way of casting the debate between the symbolic and the connectionist approaches, as implied in the introductory chapter, nor a proposal for reconciling the two approaches (as suggested by the book's subtitle). The book will provide little solace for supporters of connectionism as a way of understanding mental processes.Marcus claims (p. 3) to shun the distinction between \u2018eliminative connectionism\u2019 (the claim that connectionist systems will eventually replace the systems of rules and of symbol-processing posited by classical cognitive science models) and \u2018implementational connectionism\u2019 (the view that connectionist systems can provide biologically plausible models of the mechanisms used in carrying out symbol processing). Nonetheless, he goes on to make a strong case for the implausibility of eliminativist connectionism. His analysis of the systematic failure of connectionist models to represent individuals (tokens), to provide a compositional system for building complex concepts out of simpler ones, to provide for rule schemas with variables, to deal with what he calls the \u2018ubiquitous Universally Quantified One-To-One Mappings\u2019, and so on, along with his detailed focus on language learning (where Marcus has personally contributed empirical evidence that is damaging to the connectionist proposals) show some of the reasons why eliminative connectionism fails.When it comes to implementational connectionism, the initial chapter claims to be much more concessive than the rest of the book actually warrants. For example, Marcus says, \u2018If it turns out that the brain does in fact implement symbol-manipulation, implementational connectionism would\u2026provide an enormous advance, tantamount to figuring out how an important part of the brain really works.\u2019 (p. 3). This might appear to give comfort to connectionists who believe their approach to be in harmony with biological bases of cognition, a belief based on a number of misunderstandings and on the illusion that, because they bear a superficial similarity to systems of neurons, connectionist networks are brain-like. But this book gives such connectionists little reason to rejoice, notwithstanding the above quote. If existing connectionist systems are to be viewed as proposals for how symbolic systems might be implemented, then they are not models of biological implementation, but of implementations in some more abstract cellular networks that owe little to the data of neuroscience. Few connectionist systems concern themselves directly with biological evidence, beyond such general claims as that such systems are built from simple elements, are distributed, and are robust in the face of physical damage, none of which are inherent properties of connectionist systems any more than of symbolic systems 1xConnectionism and cognitive architecture: a critical analysis. Fodor, J.A. and Pylyshyn, Z.W. Cognition. 1988; 28: 3\u201371Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (1117)See all References1.The sad truth is that very little is known about how the brain implements the functions we know must be computed, because little is known about biological information processing at the appropriate level of organization in the brain \u2013 that is, between large-scale localization of functions and cell biology. Consequently, connectionist systems are in exactly the same position as symbolic systems with respect to the question of \u2018how an important part of the brain really works\u2019. Indeed, Gallistel has argued persuasively 2xForaging for brain stimulation: toward a neurobiology of computation. Gallistel, C.R. Cognition. 1994; 50: 151\u2013170Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (21)See all References2 that biological computation requires a register architecture that can store and operate mathematically on representations of magnitudes, and consequently that an architecture based on adjusting connection weights and passing activations along these connections is bound to be inadequate.Nothing substantial in the book is in disagreement with these remarks, and yet some of the rhetoric does sound as though Marcus would like to be seen as providing more of a reconciliation between the connectionist and the classical symbolic approaches. Clearly, this is not the case. What this book provides is an accessible review of the current state of the debate about the nature of computational mental processes. From this it's hard to see how it represents a step towards \u2018integrating connectionism and cognitive science\u2019 as advertised in the subtitle. On the other hand, if Marcus's arguments are correct this might be about as much integration as is possible at the present time.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "11684483", "doi": "10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01771-X", "venue": "Trends in cognitive sciences", "journal": "Trends in cognitive sciences", "mag_id": "2107530829", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["9804019"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30248223"}

The methodology developed was applied to two salient applications: that of farrowing prediction through detection of nest building activity, and comparison of maternal lying behaviour in conventional movement-restricting and free-farrowing systems. Two sensors were attached at both the front and hind end to each of eight periparturient sows. Movement behaviour was recorded for a period of five days around parturition. Activity transitions were classified by a Support Vector Machine classifier, using data from both sensors individually, and combined; classifier output was validated against ground truth annotations collected from video data. We draw conclusions about the benefits of using multiple sensors over a single sensor, as well as the suitability of different sensor locations on the sow. Activity classification was found to improve through the use of multiple sensors, with a mean F 1 score (a measure of predictive performance between 0 and 1) of 0.84, compared to use of the front sensor alone (mean F 1 = 0.49) and the hind sensor alone (mean F 1 = 0.57). Activity transitions were classified using the dual sensor setup with a mean F 1 score of 0.77. Using a threshold-based approach, taking transition frequency as an indicator of nesting behaviour, we were able to detect the onset of nest building with an average latency to farrowing of 11.1 (\u00b14.65) hours, and an average of 1 premature detection per sow; however, the majority of these premature were in a particular sow. We draw comparisons between the lying behaviour of free-farrowing and restricted sows. Using a mixed-design ANOVA we found a main effect of farrowing environment on transition duration ( p = 0.003 ), peak acceleration ( p = 0.007 ) and rate of change in pitch ( p = 0.009 ) . Improving the classification accuracy of sow activity transitions through the addition of multiple sensors allows for improved performance in applications such as farrowing prediction, which has the capacity to reduce piglet mortality through enabling farrowing supervision. Understanding how movement restriction affects the lying behaviour of farrowing sows has the potential to inform decisions regarding restriction of sows and development of free-farrowing environments.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compag.2019.01.035", "venue": "Comput.

In particular, the generated geometrical shapes lack clear edges and fail to contain necessary details. In light of this, we propose a novel multi-task generative adversarial network to convert the individual's EEG signals evoked by geometrical shapes to the original geometry. First, we adopt a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn highly informative latent representation for the raw EEG signals, which is vital for the subsequent shape reconstruction. Next, we build the discriminator based on multi-task learning to distinguish and classify fake samples simultaneously, where the mutual promotion between different tasks improves the quality of the recovered shapes.

The outcome is a device installed in a long-haul bus for daily operation. The incumbent system features the combination of lane departure warning (LDW) function and forward collision warning (FCW) function employing the support vector machine (SVM) as the classifier. LDW recognizes the environment as in daytime or in nighttime by detecting a vanishing point and applies the appropriate thresholds for daytime and nighttime to enhance the detecting rate. The algorithmic components of LDW function include image overlapping, median filter, edge-enhancement filter and hough transform, while the FCW function identifies vehicles with a feature-based approach and verifies the vehicle candidates by the appearance-based approach. In addition, we propose a new detecting scheme by motion vector (MV) estimation, where the detection doesn't rely on the whole image inside the region of interest (ROI) but on the detection range of three different ranges to concurrently secure high detecting rate and low computing power. Besides, as distance estimation is the crucial part of FCW function, we create an innovative camera calibration algorithm working with an adjustment mechanism to enhance the accuracy of the distance estimation.

However, reducing the bias and variance of the learning model on the i.i.d dataset may not help the model to prevent from their failure on the adversarial samples, which are intentionally generated by either the malicious users or its rival programs. This paper gives a brief introduction of machine learning and adversarial learning, discussing the research frontier of the adversarial issues noticed by both the machine learning and network security field. We argue that one key reason of the adversarial issue is that the learning algorithms may not exploit the input feature set enough, so that the attackers can focus on a small set of features to trick the model. To address this issue, we consider two important classes of classifiers. For random forest, we propose a type of random forest called Weighted Random Forest (WRF) to encourage the model to give even credits to the input features. This approach can be further improved by careful selection of a subset of trees based on the clustering analysis during the run time. For neural networks, we propose to introduce extra soft constraints based on the weight variance to the objective function, such that the model would base the classification decision on more evenly distributed feature impact. Empirical experiments show that these approaches can effectively improve the robustness of the learnt model against their baseline systems.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12652-018-0714-6", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing", "mag_id": "2794323780", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52987004"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195251212"}

Connectionism is an approach to modeling perception and cognition that explicitly employs some of the mechanisms and styles of the processing that is believed to occur in the brain. In particular, connectionist models usually take the form of neural networks, which are composed of a large number of very simple components wired together. Neural network models were inspired by and resemble the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. Key aspects of many neural network models are that they are able to learn and their behavior improves with training or experience. This chapter outlines three levels at which information processing tasks\u2014including cognitive and perceptual ones\u2014must be understood: computational theory, representation and algorithm, and hardware implementation. The computational-theory level is concerned with identifying the goal of the process, its appropriateness, and the logic of its strategy. The representation and algorithm level is concerned with how the computational theory might be implemented, the representations of input and output, and the algorithm that transforms one into the other. The hardware-implementation level is concerned with how the representation and algorithm can be realized physically. The chapter also discusses the perceptron convergence theorem and describes the approach of batch learning and line learning.

I developed SB-CoRLA (SchemaBased, Constructivist Robot Learning Architecture) to address the issue of constructivist robot learning in a schema-based robot system. The SB-CoRLA architecture extends the previously developed ASyMTRe (Automated Synthesis of Multi-team member Task solutions through software Reconfiguration) architecture to enable constructivist learning for multi-robot team tasks. The schema-based ASyMTRe architecture has successfully solved the problem of automatically synthesizing task solutions based on robot capabilities. However, it does not include a learning ability. Nothing is learned from past experience; therefore, each time a new task needs to be assigned to a new team of robots, the search process for a solution starts anew. Furthermore, it is not possible for the robot to develop a new behavior. The complete SB-CoRLA architecture includes off-line learning and online learning processes. For my dissertation, I implemented a schema chunking process within the framework of SB-CoRLA that involves off-line evolutionary learning of partial solutions (also called \u201cchunks\u201d), and online solution search using learned chunks. The chunks are higher level building blocks than the original schemas. They have similar interfaces to the original schemas, and can be used in an extended version of the ASyMTRe online solution searching process. SB-CoRLA can include other learning processes such as an online learning process that uses a combination of exploration and a goal-directed feedback evaluation process to develop new behaviors by modifying and extending existing schemas. The online learning process is planned for future work. The significance of this work is the development of an architecture that enables continuous, constructivist learning by incorporating learning capabilities in a schema-based robot system, thus allowing robot teams to re-use previous task solutions for both existing and new tasks, to build up more abstract schema chunks, as well as to develop new schemas. The schema chunking process can generate solutions in certain situations when the centralized ASyMTRe cannot find solutions in a timely manner. The chunks can be re-used for different applications, hence improving the search efficiency.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "49002064", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59808432"}

The interest in such methods relies on the fact that standard gradient based learning algorithms may often converge to local minima and are usually time consuming. Despite the good performance achieved by Randomization Based Neural Networks (RNNs), the random feature mapping procedure may generate redundant information, leading to suboptimal solutions. To overcome this problem, some strategies have been used such as feature selection, hidden neuron pruning and ensemble methods. Feature selection methods discard redundant information from the original dataset. Pruning methods eliminate hidden nodes with redundant information. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to generate a single one. Selective ensemble methods select a subset of all available models to generate the final model. In this paper, we propose a selective ensemble of RNNs based on the Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA), for regression problems. The proposed method, named Selective Ensemble of RNNs using the Successive projections algorithm (SERS), employs the SPA for three distinct tasks: feature selection, pruning and ensemble selection. SPA was originally developed as a feature selection technique and has been recently employed for RNN pruning. Herein, we show that it can also be employed for ensemble selection. The proposed framework was used to develop three selective ensemble models based on the three RNNs: Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), Feedforward Neural Network with Random Weights (FNNRW) and Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL). The performances of SERS-ELM, SERS-FNNRW and SERS-RVFL were assessed in terms of model accuracy and model complexity in several real world benchmark problems.

For some real time applications, use of SVM could be a problem if the number of support vectors is high. Depending on the complexity of the class structure, sometimes the number of support vectors of a SVM model increases with the number of training data points. Here our objective is to reduce the number of support vectors, yet, maintaining more of less the same level of accuracy as that of a normal SVM that does not use any reduction of support vectors. An SVM finds a separating hyperplane maximizing the margin of separation and hence, the location of the hyperplane is primarily dependent on a set of \u201cboundary points\u201d. Here, we first identify some boundary points using a minimum spanning tree on the training data to obtain a reduced training set. The SVM algorithm is then applied on the reduced training data to generate the classification model. We call this algorithm, Minimally Spanned Support Vector Machine (MS-SVM). We also assess the performance by relaxing the definition of boundary points. Moreover we extend the algorithm to a feature space using a kernel transformation. In this case, an MST is generated in the feature space using the associated kernel matrix.

The Random Forest (RF) model, the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) model, and the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model are used to predict 50 ETF price. Firstly, the original quantitative investment strategy is taken as the research object, and the 15 min trading frequency, which is more in line with the actual trading situation, is used, and then the Delta hedging concept of the options is introduced to control the risk of the quantitative investment strategy, to achieve the 15 min hedging strategy. Secondly, the final transaction price, buy price, highest price, lowest price, volume, historical volatility, and the implied volatility of the time segment marked with 50 ETF are the seven key factors affecting the price of 50 ETF. Then, two different types of LSTM-SVR models, LSTM-SVR I and LSTM-SVR II, are used to predict the final transaction price of the 50 ETF in the next time segment. In LSTM-SVR I model, the output of LSTM and seven key factors are combined as the input of SVR model. In LSTM-SVR II model, the hidden state vectors of LSTM and seven key factors are combined as the inputs of the SVR model. The results of the two LSTM-SVR models are compared with each other, and the better one is applied to the trading strategy. Finally, the benefit of the deep learning-based quantitative investment strategy, the resilience, and the maximum drawdown are used as indicators to judge the pros and cons of the research results. The accuracy and deviations of the LSTM-SVR prediction models are compared with those of the LSTM model and those of the RF model.

This shifts the attention back to applicable resource allocation (RA), which need to be applicable for very short radio frames, large and dense sets of radio heads, and large user populations in the coordination area. So far, mainly CSI-based RA schemes have been proposed for this task. However, they have considerable complexity and also incur a significant CSI acquisition overhead on the system. In this paper, we study an alternative approach which promises lower complexity with also a lower overhead. We propose to base the RA in multi-antenna CRAN systems on the position information of user terminals only. We use Random Forests as supervised machine learning approach to determine the multi-user RAs. This likely leads to lower overhead costs, as the acquisition of position information requires less radio resources in comparison to the acquisition of instantaneous CSI. The results show the following findings: I) In general, learning-based RA schemes can achieve comparable spectral efficiency to CSI-based scheme; II) If taking the system overhead into account, learning-based RA scheme utilizing position information outperform legacy CSI-based scheme by up to 100%; III) Despite their dependency on the training data, Random Forests based RA scheme is robust against position inaccuracies and changes in the propagation scenario; IV) The most important factor influencing the performance of learning-based RA scheme is the antenna orientation, for which we present three approaches that restore most of the original performance results.

However, the accuracy and the computational efficiency of the existing methods need to be improved, especially for the analysis of large datasets (e.g., at regional or national levels). In this paper, we present a novel deep learning approach to ground classification for Digital Terrain Model (DTM) extraction as well as for multi-class land-cover classification, delivering highly accurate classification results in a computationally efficient manner. Considering the top\u2013down acquisition angle of ALS data, the point cloud is initially projected on the horizontal plane and converted into a multi-dimensional image. Then, classification techniques based on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) with dilated kernels are designed to perform pixel-wise image classification. Finally, labels are transferred from pixels to the original ALS points. We also designed a Multi-Scale FCN (MS-FCN) architecture to minimize the loss of information during the point-to-image conversion. In the ground classification experiment, we compared our method to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based method and LAStools software. We obtained a lower total error on both the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) filter test benchmark dataset and AHN-3 dataset in the Netherlands. In the multi-class classification experiment, our method resulted in higher precision and recall values compared to the traditional machine learning technique using Random Forest (RF); it accurately detected small buildings. The FCN achieved precision and recall values of 0.93 and 0.94 when RF obtained 0.91 and 0.92, respectively. Moreover, our strategy significantly improved the computational efficiency of state-of-the-art CNN-based methods, reducing the point-to-image conversion time from 47 h to 36 min in our experiments on the ISPRS filter test dataset.

Many algorithms are sensitive to similarity measures. To tackle this fundamental problem, automatically learning of similarity information from data via self-expression has been developed and successfully applied in various models, such as low-rank representation, sparse subspace learning, semi-supervised learning. However, it just tries to reconstruct the original data and some valuable information, e.g., the manifold structure, is largely ignored. In this paper, we argue that it is beneficial to preserve the overall relations when we extract similarity information. Specifically, we propose a novel similarity learning framework by minimizing the reconstruction error of kernel matrices, rather than the reconstruction error of original data adopted by existing work. Taking the clustering task as an example to evaluate our method, we observe considerable improvements compared to other state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, our proposed framework is very general and provides a novel and fundamental building block for many other similarity-based tasks.

In addition, we utilize the depth map together with the color image captured by the Kinect sensor to obtain a more effective and accurate feature to enhance the recognition accuracy. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments on both word-level sign language and sentence-level sign language. An American Sign Language dataset including approximately 2,000 word-level sign language phrases and 2,000 sentence-level sign language phrases was collected using the Kinect sensor, and each phrase contains color, depth, and skeleton information.

SVMs turned out to provide the best classification accuracy of 75.44% in the speaker dependent mode, that is, when speech samples from the same speaker were included in the training corpus. Various speaker dependent and speaker independent configurations were analyzed and compared. Emotion recognition in speaker dependent conditions usually yielded higher accuracy results than a similar but speaker independent configuration. The improvement was especially well observed if the base recognition ratio of a given speaker was low.

A two-layer Stacking framework is proposed in this study to predict the crash injury severity: The fist layer integrates advantages of three base classification methods: RF (Random Forests), AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting), and GBDT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree); the second layer completes classification of crash injury severity based on a Logistic Regression model. A total of 5538 crashes were recorded at 326 freeway diverge areas. In the model calibration, several parameters including the number of trees in three base classification methods, learning rate, and regularization coefficient are optimized via a systematic grid search approach. In the model validation, the performance of the Stacking model is compared with several traditional models including the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forests (RF) in the multi classification experiments. The prediction results show that Stacking model achieves superior performance evaluated by two indicators: accuracy and recall. Furthermore, all the factors used in severity prediction are classified into different categories according to their influence on the results, and sensitivity analysis of several significant factors is finally implemented to explore the impact of their value variation on the prediction accuracy.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30390518", "doi": "10.1016/j.aap.2018.10.016", "venue": "Accident; analysis and prevention", "journal": "Accident; analysis and prevention", "mag_id": "2899037650", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["96433630", "210962589", "169031954", "210967536", "199572632", "210960759", "182712914", "211246247", "211318027", "210870375", "203216838", "201093738", "195770738", "146076433"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53219523"}

Physical reservoir computing, which uses the body itself as a neural network-like system, is one approach to this computation. In this research, a tensegrity-like structure, designed by the compressive elements and the tensile elements that are made of springs, is used as a body structure. We demonstrated that the structure has a higher computational ability when the structure is easier to move with a smaller spring constant, or when the structure's input amplitude was set to be smaller. In addition, the environments around the body were shown to have large effects on the computational ability. The results of these previous experiments were summarized into four features. First, the softer body has a higher computational ability. Second, the input amplitude can control the memories of the system. Third, the best input position exists which maximizes the computational ability. Fourth, the environments around the structure have effects on the system and its computational ability.

State-of-the-art ED methods typically utilize local contextual information for obtaining mention embeddings which will be compared to candidate entity embeddings and then apply Conditional Random Field (CRF) for collective ED, considering global coherence. An inherent drawback of these methods is that, the global semantic relationships among the candidate entities in the same document are not encoded in the embedding process. As such, the resultant embeddings may not be sufficient to capture the global coherence effect. In this paper, to address the issue, we propose a novel end-to-end graph neural entity disambiguation model which fully exploits the global semantic information. In particular, a heterogeneous entity-word graph is first constructed for each document to model the global semantic relationships among candidate entities in a same document. Then graph convolutional network (GCN) is applied on the entity-word graph to generate enhanced entity embeddings encoding global semantics, which are fed to a CRF for collective ED.

We report on the classification value of several features extracted from the child's EDA responses, as well as several other features capturing the physiological synchrony between the child and the adult.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2632048.2636065", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the 2014 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2062914254", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["37683649", "7660794", "207165665", "753606", "961425", "14083769", "141196166", "62057483", "22422275", "13417958", "5658303", "6328541", "24061568", "7728535", "12429884", "12995929", "12472175", "9380050", "24507026", "145519136", "167776281", "6251485", "15967116", "7730856", "28378137"], "inbound_citations": ["189926549", "16305603", "174799905", "3631580", "52896054", "9527704", "58948754", "18263847", "209407131", "91186807", "145819643", "24346401", "6302146", "53217361", "215366832", "214939004", "31438356", "9212439", "32655521", "38219058", "53219343", "11071412", "51615383", "52295526", "52252669", "198146970", "6230019", "44181824", "8438090", "148836682", "53278513", "52296116", "21136495", "2328339", "18929917", "51948002", "44859968", "211194214", "12388894", "14638314", "212736992", "4299670", "53216756", "17214656", "8132417", "53030574", "7912697", "41081938"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14068293"}

A main drawback of manifold learning methods is, however, that there is no explicit mappings from the input data manifold to the output embedding. This prohibits the application of manifold learning methods in many practical problems such as classification and target detection. Previously, in order to provide explicit mappings for manifold learning methods, many methods have been proposed to get an approximate explicit representation mapping with the assumption that there exists a linear projection between the high-dimensional data samples and their low-dimensional embedding. However, this linearity assumption may be too restrictive. In this paper, an explicit nonlinear mapping is proposed for manifold learning, based on the assumption that there exists a polynomial mapping between the high-dimensional data samples and their low-dimensional representations. As far as we know, this is the first time that an explicit nonlinear mapping for manifold learning is given. In particular, we apply this to the method of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and derive an explicit nonlinear manifold learning algorithm, named Neighborhood Preserving Polynomial Embedding (NPPE).

Optical imagery is often affected by the presence of clouds. Aiming to reduce their effects, different reconstruction techniques have been proposed in the last years. A common alternative is to extract data from active sensors, like Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), because they are almost independent on the atmospheric conditions and solar illumination. On the other hand, SAR images are more complex to interpret than optical images requiring particular handling. Recently, Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) have been widely used in different image generation tasks presenting state-of-the-art results. One application of cGANs is learning a nonlinear mapping function from two images of different domains. In this work, we combine the fact that SAR images are hardly affected by clouds with the ability of cGANS for image translation in order to map optical images from SAR ones so as to recover regions that are covered by clouds. Experimental results indicate that the proposed solution achieves better classification accuracy than SAR based classification.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-annals-IV-1-5-2018", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2894340056", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["28659025", "126040099", "1033682", "12803511", "2202933", "3719281", "3591574", "85538255", "19063730", "810708"], "inbound_citations": ["202700277", "210843402", "127009833", "202921713"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:70029316"}

Existing models that build conditional generators either require massive labeled instances as supervision or are unable to accurately control the semantics of generated samples. We propose structured generative adversarial networks (SGANs) for semi-supervised conditional generative modeling. SGAN assumes the data x is generated conditioned on two independent latent variables: y that encodes the designated semantics, and z that contains other factors of variation. To ensure disentangled semantics in y and z, SGAN builds two collaborative games in the hidden space to minimize the reconstruction error of y and z, respectively. Training SGAN also involves solving two adversarial games that have their equilibrium concentrating at the true joint data distributions p(x, z) and p(x, y), avoiding distributing the probability mass diffusely over data space that MLE-based methods may suffer. We assess SGAN by evaluating its trained networks, and its performance on downstream tasks. We show that SGAN delivers a highly controllable generator, and disentangled representations; it also establishes start-of-the-art results across multiple datasets when applied for semi-supervised image classification (1.27%, 5.73%, 17.26% error rates on MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10 using 50, 1000 and 4000 labels, respectively).

In silico models for predicting the percentage of HIA based on calculated molecular descriptors are highly needed for the rapid estimation of this property. Here, we have studied the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) to classify compounds with high or low fractional absorption (%FA > 30% or %FA < or = 30%). The analyzed data set consists of 578 structural diverse druglike molecules, which have been divided into a 480-molecule training set and a 98-molecule test set. Ten SVM classification models have been generated to investigate the impact of different individual molecular properties on %FA. Among these studied important molecule descriptors, topological polar surface area (TPSA) and predicted apparent octanol-water distribution coefficient at pH 6.5 (logD6.5) show better classification performance than the others. To obtain the best SVM classifier, the influences of different kernel functions and different combinations of molecular descriptors were investigated using a rigorous training-validation procedure. The best SVM classifier can give satisfactory predictions for the training set (97.8% for the poor-absorption class and 94.5% for the good-absorption class). Moreover, 100% of the poor-absorption class and 97.8% of the good-absorption class in the external test set could be correctly classified. Finally, the influence of the size of the training set and the unbalanced nature of the data set have been studied. The analysis demonstrates that large data set is necessary for the stability of the classification models. Furthermore, the weights for the poor-absorption class and the good-absorption class should be properly balanced to generate unbiased classification models. Our work illustrates that SVMs used in combination with simple molecular descriptors can provide an extremely reliable assessment of intestinal absorption in an early in silico filtering process.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17929911", "doi": "10.1021/ci7002076", "venue": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "journal": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1971327393", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": ["85753952", "46441373", "24301532", "30131504", "12545264", "40190937", "6672051", "42803255", "15019298", "12796668", "3023230", "15829569", "7527613", "26736871", "119552869", "12032804", "1014138", "8657235", "18363040", "197033322", "197354670", "197109388", "2698102", "15181105", "9447436", "20924493", "1871891", "52874011", "1900499", "194951", "961425", "99131347", "7178582", "22176142", "2213367", "13912744", "21885397", "23997895", "30105588", "6954263"], "inbound_citations": ["2915", "20042277", "2598830", "207225122", "2076250", "3894201", "4305134", "12089945", "44094868", "1422077", "7920036", "35971899", "215025156", "6403208", "5985523", "7490147", "2423688", "14862027", "24717928"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5870442"}

However, machine learning methods to date have not been extended beyond classification and contemporaneously applied in a meaningful way to clinical measures. We hypothesized that brain measures would classify groups, and that increased likelihood of being classified as a patient using regional brain measures would be positively related to illness severity, developmental delays and genetic risk. Methods: Using 74 anatomic brain MRI sub regions and Random Forest, we classified 98 COS patients and 99 age, sex, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. We also used Random Forest to determine the likelihood of being classified as a schizophrenia patient based on MRI measures. We then explored relationships between brain-based probability of illness and symptoms, premorbid development, and presence of copy number variation associated with schizophrenia. Results: Brain regions jointly classified COS and control groups with 73.7% accuracy. Greater brain-based probability of illness was associated with worse functioning (p= 0.0004) and fewer developmental delays (p=0.02). Presence of copy number variation (CNV) was associated with lower probability of being classified as schizophrenia (p=0.001). The regions that were most important in classifying groups included left temporal lobes, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal regions, and left medial parietal lobes. Conclusions: Schizophrenia and control groups can be well classified using Random Forest and anatomic brain measures, and brain-based probability of illness has a positive relationship with illness severity and a negative relationship with developmental delays/problems and CNV-based risk.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3365783", "pubmed_id": "22675310", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2012.00053", "venue": "Front.

A hybrid model called Discrete Wavelet Transform Singular Value Decomposition based Perceptual Hash Convolutional Neural Network (DWT-SVD-PH-CNN) is proposed by using a perceptual hash function together with CNN to reduce the classification time. In the proposed method, the DWT-SVD- based perceptual hash function is used. The most important feature of perceptual hash functions is to obtain the salient features of images. First, DWT-SVD based perceptual hash function is applied to images for obtaining salient features. Then, images making up of salient features, are produced in 32 x 32 format and given as inputs to CNN, where Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify the images. In this paper, the DWT-SVD-PH-CNN method is applied to Caltech 101 image database. Experimental results show that the proposed DWT-SVD-PH-CNN method has a high accuracy, about 95.8 %. Moreover, this method reduces the execution time from 241.21 seconds to 83.08 seconds compared to the classical method.

However, detection and delineation of localised flooding with remote sensing techniques are often hampered on floodplains by the presence of herbaceous vegetation. To address this problem, this study presents the application of full-waveform airborne laser scanning (ALS) data for detection of floodwater extent. In general, water surfaces are characterised by low values of backscattered energy due to water absorption of the infrared laser shots, but the exact strength of the recorded laser pulse depends on the area covered by the targets located within a laser pulse footprint area. To account for this we analysed the physical quantity of radiometrically calibrated ALS data, the backscattering coefficient, in relation to water and vegetation coverage within a single laser footprint. The results showed that the backscatter was negatively correlated to water coverage, and that of the three distinguished classes of water coverage (low, medium, and high) only the class with the largest extent of water cover (>70%) had relatively distinct characteristics that can be used for classification of water surfaces. Following the laser footprint analysis, three classifiers, namely AdaBoost with Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest, were utilised to classify laser points into flooded and non-flooded classes and to derive the map of flooding extent. The performance of the classifiers is highly dependent on the set of laser points features used. Best performance was achieved by combining radiometric and geometric laser point features. The accuracy of flooding maps based solely on radiometric features resulted in overall accuracies of up to 70% and was limited due to the overlap of the backscattering coefficient values between water and other land cover classes. Our point-based classification methods assure a high mapping accuracy (\u223c89%) and demonstrate the potential of using full-waveform ALS data to detect water surfaces on floodplain areas with limited water surface exposition through the vegetation canopy.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2016.06.009", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2467321459", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["385625", "73541475", "55082424", "55053073", "59365779", "55140078"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124861747"}

Limited data availability, human resources and technical capacities, further exacerbate the challenge. The result is a region that is among the more understudied areas in the world, which in turn has resulted in a lack of appropriate information required for sustainable natural resources management. The objective of this paper is to explore open source software and easy-to-implement approaches to mapping and estimation of land change that are transferrable to local institutions to increase capacity in the region, and to provide updated information on the regional land surface dynamics. To achieve these objectives, stable land cover and land change between 2001 and 2013 in the Kara River Basin in Togo and Benin were mapped by direct multitemporal classification of Landsat data by parameterization and evaluation of two machine-learning algorithms. Areas of land cover and change were estimated by application of an unbiased estimator to sample data following international guidelines. A prerequisite for all tools and methods was implementation in an open source environment, and adherence to international guidelines for reporting land surface activities. Findings include a recommendation of the Random Forests algorithm as implemented in Orfeo Toolbox, and a stratified estimation protocol \u2212 all executed in the QGIS graphical use interface. It was found that despite an estimated reforestation of 10,0727 \u00b1 3480 ha (95% confidence interval), the combined rate of forest and savannah loss amounted to 56,271 \u00b1 9405 ha (representing a 16% loss of the forestlands present in 2001), resulting in a rather sharp net loss of forestlands in the study area.

We focus on multipartite ranking, where instances belong to one of a limited set of rank classes, study different approaches on synthetic and real data sets, and propose a ranking-specific evaluation framework and a new learning approach that combines multitask learning and binary decomposition. ::: ::: The thesis starts with an analysis of existing ranking approaches. These are used in a practical application of ranking within the domain of molecular biology. In particular, we study embryonic stem cell differentiation posed as a multipartite ranking problem. We critically evaluate several ranking approaches and demonstrate how they can be used to construct accurate predictive models that can rank samples based on their stage of differentiation. For testing, we introduce a framework for evaluation of ranking methods including a generalization of the popular performance measure AUC (area under the ROC curve) that can be used for multipartite problems. ::: ::: We proceed by analysing the family of methods based on binary decomposition, which reduces a ranking problem to a set of binary classification tasks. To improve the process of learning models for these tasks, we suggest to combine it with a multitask learning technique. Specifically, we propose a new ranking method, which we name BDMT, that combines one-against-one decomposition and multitask feature learning. The decomposition allows us to model nonlinear patterns and to simplify the learning domain to problems that are suitable for classical machine learning approaches. Multitask learning allows us to generalize across the decomposed tasks, making them interdependent through a joint regularized optimization. Our experiments show that the addition of multitask learning can greatly improve the performance of one-against-one decomposition and even succeed in outperforming state-of-the-art ranking approaches in certain settings. Learning the models of decomposed tasks simultaneously, increases the stability of model estimation and reduces the sensitivity to perturbations of the training data set. Compared with other ranking methods that are also able to model complex patterns, BDMT remains efficient and can achieve low training times with the use of fast linear base learners. We also show how the method and the patterns it learns can be interpreted.

In this paper, we propose LerGAN, a PIM-based GAN accelerator to address the challenges of training GAN. We first propose a zero-free data reshaping scheme for ReRAM-based PIM, which removes the zero-related computations. We then propose a 3D-connected PIM, which can reconfigure connections inside PIM dynamically according to dataflows of propagation and updating. Our proposed techniques reduce data movement to a great extent, avoiding I/O to become a bottleneck of training GANs. Finally, we propose LerGAN based on these two techniques, providing different levels of accelerating GAN for programmers. Experiments shows that LerGAN achieves 47.2X, 21.42X and 7.46X speedup over FPGA-based GAN accelerator, GPU platform, and ReRAM-based neural network accelerator respectively.

An unavoidable tension exists between accuracy gains obtained by using sensitive information as part of a statistical model, and any commitment to protect these characteristics.

In this paper we show how it is possible to get the best of both worlds: optimize model accuracy and fairness without explicitly using the sensitive feature in the functional form of the model, thereby treating different individuals equally. Our method is based on two key ideas. On the one hand, we propose to use Multitask Learning (MTL), enhanced with fairness constraints, to jointly learn group specific classifiers that leverage information between sensitive groups. On the other hand, since learning group specific models might not be permitted, we propose to first predict the sensitive features by any learning method and then to use the predicted sensitive feature to train MTL with fairness constraints. This enables us to tackle fairness with a three-pronged approach, that is, by increasing accuracy on each group, enforcing measures of fairness during training, and protecting sensitive information during testing.

Utilizing within-season multi-temporal optical and multi-polarization synthetic aperture radar SAR data, this study introduces a combined object-and pixel-based image classification methodology for accurate crop-type classification. Particularly, the study investigates the improvement of crop-type classification by using the least number of multi-temporal RapidEye RE images and multi-polarization Radarsat-2 RS-2 data utilized in an object-and pixel-based image analysis framework. The method was tested on a study area in Manitoba, Canada, using three different classifiers including the standard Maximum Likelihood ML, Decision Tree DT, and Random Forest RF classifiers. Using only two RE images of July and August, the proposed method results in overall accuracies OAs of about 95%, 78%, and 93% for the ML, DT, and RF classifiers, respectively. Moreover, the use of only two quad-pol images of RS-2 of June and September resulted in OAs of 92%, 75%, and 90% for the ML, DT, and RF classifiers, respectively. The best classification results were achieved by the synergistic use of two RE and two RS-2 images. In this case, the overall classification accuracies were 97% for both ML and RF classifiers. In addition, the average producer\u2019s accuracies of 95% and 96% were achieved by the ML and RF classifiers, respectively, whereas the average user accuracy was 94% for both classifiers. The results indicated promising potentials for rapid and cost-effective local-scale crop-type classification using a limited number of high-resolution optical and multi-polarization SAR images. Very accurate classification results can be considered as a replacement for sampling the agricultural fields at the local scale. The result of this very accurate classification at discrete locations approximately 25 \u00d7 25 km frames can be applied in a separate procedure to increase the accuracy of crop area estimation at the regional to provincial scale by linking these local very accurate spatially discrete results to national wall-to-wall continuous crop classification maps.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/01431161.2017.1317933", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of remote sensing", "mag_id": "2612601779", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["133736179", "91721886", "146187111", "203625009", "201263151"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196107749"}

In this paper, a multivariable analysis was used to classify signals as permanent and temporary faults. Thus, by using a simple convolution process among the mother functions called eigenvectors and the fault signals from a single end, a dimensionality reduction was determined. In this manner, the feature classifier based on the support vector machine was used for acceptably classifying fault types. The algorithm was tested in different fault scenarios that considered several distances along the transmission line and representation of first and second arcs simulated in the alternative transients program ATP software.

Classifier classifies MCCs into two classes. One class is benign and other is malignant. This classification is done based on some meaningful features that are extracted from enhanced mammogram. A number of classifiers have been proposed for CAD system to classify MCCs as benign or malignant. Recently, researchers have used Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as classifiers for many applications. Multilayer Feed-Forward Backpropagation (MLFFB) is the most important ANN that has been successfully used by researchers to solve various problems. Similarly, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) belong to another category of classifiers that researchers have recently given considerable attention. So, to explore MLFFB and SVM classifiers for MCCs classification problem, in this paper, Levenberg-Marquardt Multilayer Feed-Forward Backpropagation ANN (LM-MLFFB-ANN) and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) based SVM (SMO-SVM) are used for the classification of MCCs. Thus, a comparative evaluation of the relative performance of LM-MLFFBP-ANN and SMO-SVM is investigated to classify MCCs as benign or malignant. For this comparative evaluation, first suitable features are extracted from mammogram images of DDSM database. After this, suitable features are selected using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). At the end, MCCs are classified using LM-MLFFBP-ANN and SMO-SVM classifiers based on the selected features. Confusion matrix and ROC analysis are used to measure the performance of LM-MLFFBP-ANN and SMO-SVM classifiers.

As a representative method, Ranking Support Vector Machine (Rank-SVM) aims to minimize the Ranking Loss and can also mitigate the negative influence of the class-imbalance issue. However, due to its stacking-style way for thresholding, it may suffer error accumulation and thus reduces the final classification performance. Binary Relevance (BR) is another typical method, which aims to minimize the Hamming Loss and only needs one-step learning. Nevertheless, it might have the class-imbalance issue and does not take into account label correlations. To address the above issues, we propose a novel multi-label classification model, which joints Ranking support vector machine and Binary Relevance with robust Low-rank learning (RBRL). RBRL inherits the ranking loss minimization advantages of Rank-SVM, and thus overcomes the disadvantages of BR suffering the class-imbalance issue and ignoring the label correlations. Meanwhile, it utilizes the hamming loss minimization and one-step learning advantages of BR, and thus tackles the disadvantages of Rank-SVM including another thresholding learning step. Besides, a low-rank constraint is utilized to further exploit high-order label correlations under the assumption of low dimensional label space. Furthermore, to achieve nonlinear multi-label classifiers, we derive the kernelization RBRL. Two accelerated proximal gradient methods (APG) are used to solve the optimization problems efficiently.

Face recognition, as an un-solved problem under the conditions of pose and illu-mination variations, still attracts signi\ufb01cant research e f-forts. The main reasons for the ongoing research are:(i) the increased need for natural identi\ufb01cation for au-thentication in the networked society, for surveillance,for perceptual user interfaces, (ii) and the lack of robustfeatures and classi\ufb01cation schemes for the face recog-nition task.A common objective in face recognition is to \ufb01nda good way of representing face information. High in-formation redundancy present in face images results ininef\ufb01ciencies when these images are used directly forrecognition,identi\ufb01cationandclassi\ufb01cation. Akeypointin developing a good representation is to expose theconstraints and remove the redundancies contained inpixel images of faces. Typically one builds a compu-tational model to transform pixel images into face fea-tures, which generally should be robust to variations ofillumination, scale and orientation and then use thesefeaturesforrecognition[12].

As a consequence, the probability of someone choosing an alternative not recommended by a particular strategy increases with age. Some predictions made by this model include (see Figure 1) (1) young TTB and WADD users perform better and vary less than old decision-makers; (2) the difference in performance between young and old TTB decision-makers is smaller than the difference between equivalent WADD networks; (3) options with similar profiles are harder to distinguish for older compared to young decision makers. These predictions are currently being tested by training young and older adults to use TTB and EAS, and analyzing The adaptive toolbox approach (Gigerenzer, Todd, & the ABC Research Group, 1999) analyzes environments and proposes detailed cognitive mechanisms that exploit the structures identified. This poster argues that the posited mechanisms are suitable for implementation in a connectionist framework. Furthermore, it is proposed that implementing decision mechanisms as neural networks allows addressing developmental issues in decision making. These claims are supported by reporting implementations of decision strategies using simple recurrent networks (SRN; Elman, 1990) and modeling age differences. SRNs were used to implement two decision strategies: TTB (Gigerenzer et al. 1999), and an evidence accumulation strategy (EAS). SRNs are well suited to deal with the pair-comparison task, which is the focus of the reported modeling efforts, because internal states are fed back at every step, supplying such networks with a memory, and allowing them to process information sequentially over time. To obtain a probability that a network chooses a particular option a Luce choice rule was employed. Aging Decision Strategies Li (2002) has proposed that deficits in neuromodulatory efficiency due to aging can be modeled by adjusting the gain (G) parameter of the sigmoidal activation function of neural networks. According to this approach, the activation function of neural units takes the form: Activation it = 1 + e \u2212 ( G it \u00d7 Input it + bias ) their error patterns as a function of the strategy used and trial difficulty. Figure 1: Probability of choosing the option prescribed by TTB and EAS given different age (G) levels. where i refers to a unit, t indicates the processing step, Input refers to the input supplied to the unit, and bias refers to a negative bias unrelated to aging. Finally, G is a random number sampled from a uniform distribution (G i , \u2208 [G min , G max ], G min > 0). Age-related decline in neuromodulation and its effect on strategy efficiency was modeled by using Equation (1) as the activation function of the output layer of successfully trained SRNs on the pair comparison task. The mean of the distribution from which G was sampled was reduced for older networks, while keeping the range of G constant. Sampling G from a distribution with a lower mean produces less pronounced and more variable activations, thus making References Elman, J. F. (1990). Finding structure in time.

The latter can only be realised if a suitable kernel function is applied. This kernel function transforms the non-linear input space into a high dimensional feature space in which the solution of the problem can be represented as being a straight linear classification or regression problem. However, there are a lot of possible kernel functions that can be used to create such high dimensional feature space. The most commonly used kernel functions are the linear and polynomial inner-product functions and the Radial Basis Function (RBF). Since the nature of the data is usually unknown, it is very difficult to make, on beforehand, a proper choice out of the mentioned kernels. For this reason, during the model building process, usually more than one kernel is applied to select the one which gives the best prediction performance. Unfortunately, this will lead to a very time-consuming optimization procedure. To circumvent this disadvantage, a universal kernel function based on the Pearson VII function (PUK) is introduced in this paper. This function is well-known in the field of spectroscopy. The applicability, suitability, performance and robustness of this alternative kernel in comparison to the commonly applied kernels is investigated by applying this to simulated as well as real-world data sets. From the outcome of these examinations, it was concluded that the PUK kernel is robust and has an equal or even stronger mapping power as compared to the standard kernel functions leading to an equal or better generalization performance of SVMs. In general, PUK can be used as a universal kernel that is capable to serve as a generic alternative to the common linear, polynomial and RBF kernel functions.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.chemolab.2005.09.003", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2126819771", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "28637672", "14727192", "100455905", "53940663", "6674407", "94966401", "14121233", "8473401", "121070291", "55368388", "4208471", "118421633", "39651495", "121722338", "121578782"], "inbound_citations": ["18166283", "573849", "214614940", "21704809", "26929500", "41525371", "4657352", "63148548", "189949274", "18817090", "55846780", "8211712", "211542490", "215620248", "6733046", "59461754", "14378481", "4339711", "16867294", "15199638", "17155072", "14286046", "29111448", "132063787", "134197676", "1128851", "11895401", "59871751", "1837637", "1348587", "210954918", "16432028", "7588319", "209169720", "13885147", "47579703", "198997431", "9734197", "17879028", "17247298", "122972024", "52290469", "24520240", "8301454", "132934404", "73598960", "55357305", "5354879", "94997825", "17187222", "208879725", "123387980", "14371133", "15503072", "3390912", "15266601", "14016916", "4463634", "13119657", "53817138", "9176027", "32287845", "114374251", "27194956", "93190525", "10164380", "14541612", "44104304", "4073735", "59232689", "14887007", "57191328", "174814152", "11785643", "6521865", "10614132", "54866517", "215373654", "17395078", "5330901", "17619693", "15491620", "17168353", "38416557", "51871092", "5014201", "25561789", "50772350", "15529354", "19216474", "116880790", "15504128", "13536994", "211680050", "1161892", "5817600", "21830891", "29258734", "27785759", "34231", "905086", "55599926", "1770412"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17794081"}

These behaviours traditionally rely on manual observation. With the development of computer technology and digital image processing, machine vision gradually penetrated into various fields of agriculture production. In order to better monitor the behaviour of pigs, a new posture recognition method based on Zernike moments and support vector machines is proposed. First, the Otsu adaptive threshold segmentation is used to obtain the binary image. Then the contour of pigs is extracted by canny edge detection and morphological algorithms. Second, the Zernike moment feature parameters are extracted from the normalized binary contour images. Based on the above, the posture classifiers are designed according to support vector machine theory to recognize four kinds of behaviour postures of pigs, including walking normally, walking with head up, walking with head down, and lying. The experimental results show that the combination of Zernike moments and support vector machine makes the extracted features more sufficient and effective.

Next, a data cleaning method based on machine learning is applied to the big data of batteries. Meanwhile, to improve the model stability under dynamic conditions, an F-divergence-based data distribution quality assessment method and a sampling-based data preprocess method is designed. Then, a lithium-ion battery temperature-dependent model is built based on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders- Extreme Learning Machine (SDAE-ELM) algorithm, and a new training method combined with data preprocessing is also proposed to improve the model accuracy. Finally, to improve reliability, a conjunction working mode between the C-BMS and the BMS in vehicles (V-BMS) is also proposed, providing as an applied case of the model.

This condition leads to ovarian dysfunction with increased risk of miscarriage and infertility. The symptoms of PCOS include obesity, irregular menstrual cycle, and excessive production of male hormone, acne, and hirsutism. It is extremely difficult to diagnose PCOS due to the heterogeneity of symptoms associated and the presence of a varying number of associated gynecological disorders.

The location context is tied with the video shooting style of zooming in and out to create a scene description hierarchy. Actors are considered as detected people and faces, certain poses of people help define the action and activities, while objects relevant to certain types of events provide additional context. Summary features are created for the scene semantic units based on the actors, actions, object detections and the context. These features were successfully used to train an asymmetric Random Forest classifier for video event classification.

{"paper_id": "53242339", "title": "Scene understanding by robotic interactive perception", "authors": [{"first": "Aamir", "middle": [], "last": "Khan", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This thesis presents a novel and generic visual architecture for scene understanding by robotic interactive perception. This proposed visual architecture is fully integrated into autonomous systems performing object perception and manipulation tasks. The proposed visual architecture uses interaction with the scene, in order to improve scene understanding substantially over non-interactive models. Specifically, this thesis presents two experimental validations of an autonomous system interacting with the scene: Firstly, an autonomous gaze control model is investigated, where the vision sensor directs its gaze to satisfy a scene exploration task. Secondly, autonomous interactive perception is investigated, where objects in the scene are repositioned by robotic manipulation. The proposed visual architecture for scene understanding involving perception and manipulation tasks has four components: 1) A reliable vision system, 2) Camera-hand eye calibration to integrate the vision system into an autonomous robot\u2019s kinematic frame chain, 3) A visual model performing perception tasks and providing required knowledge for interaction with scene, and finally, 4) A manipulation model which, using knowledge received from the perception model, chooses an appropriate action (from a set of simple actions) to satisfy a manipulation task. This thesis presents contributions for each of the aforementioned components. Firstly, a portable active binocular robot vision architecture that integrates a number of visual behaviours are presented. This active vision architecture has the ability to verge, localise, recognise and simultaneously identify multiple target object instances. The portability and functional accuracy of the proposed vision architecture is demonstrated by carrying out both qualitative and comparative analyses using different robot hardware configurations, feature extraction techniques and scene perspectives. Secondly, a camera and hand-eye calibration methodology for integrating an active binocular robot head within a dual-arm robot are described. For this purpose, the forward kinematic model of the active robot head is derived and the methodology for calibrating and integrating the robot head is described in detail. A rigid calibration methodology has been implemented to provide a closed-form hand-to-eye calibration chain and this has been extended with a mechanism to allow the camera external parameters to be updated dynamically for optimal 3D reconstruction to meet the requirements for robotic tasks such as grasping and manipulating rigid and deformable objects. It is shown from experimental results that the robot head achieves an overall accuracy of fewer than 0.3 millimetres while recovering the 3D structure of a scene. In addition, a comparative study between current RGB-D cameras and our active stereo head within two dual-arm robotic test-beds is reported that demonstrates the accuracy and portability of our proposed methodology. Thirdly, this thesis proposes a visual perception model for the task of category-wise objects sorting, based on Gaussian Process (GP) classification that is capable of recognising objects categories from point cloud data. In this approach, Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) features are extracted from point clouds to describe the local 3D shape of objects and a Bag-of-Words coding method is used to obtain an object-level vocabulary representation. Multi-class Gaussian Process classification is employed to provide a probability estimate of the identity of the object and serves the key role of modelling perception confidence in the interactive perception cycle. The interaction stage is responsible for invoking the appropriate action skills as required to confirm the identity of an observed object with high confidence as a result of executing multiple perception-action cycles. The recognition accuracy of the proposed perception model has been validated based on simulation input data using both Support Vector Machine (SVM) and GP based multi-class classifiers. Results obtained during this investigation demonstrate that by using a GP-based classifier, it is possible to obtain true positive classification rates of up to 80\\%. Experimental validation of the above semi-autonomous object sorting system shows that the proposed GP based interactive sorting approach outperforms random sorting by up to 30\\% when applied to scenes comprising configurations of household objects. Finally, a fully autonomous visual architecture is presented that has been developed to accommodate manipulation skills for an autonomous system to interact with the scene by object manipulation. This proposed visual architecture is mainly made of two stages: 1) A perception stage, that is a modified version of the aforementioned visual interaction model, 2) An interaction stage, that performs a set of ad-hoc actions relying on the information received from the perception stage. More specifically, the interaction stage simply reasons over the information (class label and associated probabilistic confidence score) received from perception stage to choose one of the following two actions: 1) An object class has been identified with high confidence, so remove from the scene and place it in the designated basket/bin for that particular class. 2) An object class has been identified with less probabilistic confidence, since from observation and inspired from the human behaviour of inspecting doubtful objects, an action is chosen to further investigate that object in order to confirm the object\u2019s identity by capturing more images from different views in isolation. The perception stage then processes these views, hence multiple perception-action/interaction cycles take place. From an application perspective, the task of autonomous category based objects sorting is performed and the experimental design for the task is described in detail.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2902684407", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53242339"}

Lamb is defined as having no permanent incisors, hogget as having at least one incisor and mutton is defined as having two or more incisors. Classification of the carcase is done at the abattoir prior to the removal of an animal\u2019s head. Recently, an Australian Senate inquiry into meat marketing reported that there was concern that substitution of hogget and mutton for lamb may be occurring in the industry. At present, no objective method is available that can be used for classifying sheep category. The general aims of this thesis were to i) evaluate whether chemical analysis of branched chain fatty acid (BCFA) content could be used as an objective tool to determine sheep age, ii) understand the effect that some production factors had on BCFA concentrations in Australian sheep and iii) develop new approaches (whether chemical and/or statistical) for determining sheep category (age). ::: ::: BCFAs are implicated as the main contributors to \u201cmutton flavour\u201d, often associated with the cooked meat of older animals. BCFAs are reported to increase with age, which suggests that chemical analysis of these compounds could be used as an objective method. Concentrations of three BCFAs (4-methyloctanoic (MOA), 4-ethyloctanoic (EOA) and 4- methylnonanoic (MNA) acids) were measured in a survey of fat samples taken from 533 sheep carcases at abattoirs in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. This thesis shows that, on its own, chemical analysis of the BCFAs is not sufficient to discriminate lamb from hogget and mutton as pre-slaughter nutrition is a significant factor in classifying sheep using this approach. Uncertainty at the BCFA concentration ranges found in Australian sheep was determined to be high making it difficult to discriminate between sheep carcases of different ages based on the BCFA level. ::: ::: Fast gas chromatography was evaluated as the basis for a high throughput chemical technique but was not sufficiently sensitive for BCFA measurements. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was also found to be suitable for sampling 3-methylindole and p-cresol, compounds responsible for diet-related \u201cpastoral flavour\u201d in sheep fat, but further work is needed to validate this approach for measurement of these compounds in sheep fat. ::: ::: Statistical classification algorithms, when applied to the chromatograms measured for the 533 carcasses, showed great promise for predicting sheep category. Specifically, the random forests algorithm, when applied to mean-centred data, gave 100% predictive accuracy when differentiating between lamb, hogget and mutton. This approach could be used for the development of an objective method for determining sheep age and category, suitable for use by the Australian sheep meat industry.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "194632225", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["24303907", "15737344"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107353611"}

Then, pre-grasping manipulation like shifting or pushing an object becomes necessary. We developed an algorithm that can learn, in addition to grasping, to shift objects in such a way that their grasp probability increases. Our research contribution is threefold: First, we present an algorithm for learning the optimal pose of manipulation primitives like clamping or shifting. Second, we learn non-prehensible actions that explicitly increase the grasping probability. Making one skill (shifting) directly dependent on another (grasping) removes the need of sparse rewards, leading to more data-efficient learning.

The proposed SNPSVM based on LSH and the solving algorithm can guarantee that we can deal with large-scale classification problems with a huge number of instances as well as features.

The architecture integrates novel data mining and machine learning algorithms with modern sensor fusion techniques. Knowing wireless sensor networks are prone to failures resulting from their limitations i.e. limited energy resources and computational power, using this framework, the authors can distinguish between irregular variations in the physiological parameters of the monitored patient and faulty sensor data, to ensure reliable operations and real time global monitoring from smart devices. Sensor nodes are used to measure characteristics of the patient and the sensed data is stored on the local processing unit. Authorized users may access this patient data remotely as long as they maintain connectivity with their application enabled smart device. Anomalous or faulty measurement data resulting from damaged sensor nodes or caused by malicious external parties may lead to misdiagnosis or even death for patients. The authors' application uses a Support Vector Machine to classify abnormal instances in the incoming sensor data.

So, the multiple kernel fuzzy clustering (MKFC) is proposed to obtain the flexibility in designing an optimal kernel from a large set of candidates. In MKFC, many predefined general kernels like Gaussian and polynomial ones are linearly aggregated and the weights of kernels are adjusted automatically. However, the performance of MKFC is greatly hampered by two noticeable problems. First, MKFC only uses predefined general kernels and pays less attention to the inherent structure of specific data. This leads to the trouble of selecting proper base kernels for different data. The second problem is the ignorance of correlations between kernels in MKFC. It results in redundant kernels being used to define the feature space. This paper solves the two problems simultaneously by introducing a new MKFC model. Based on unsupervised random forests (RFs), some data-dependent kernels are generated and combined with others to build a more representative feature space. The correlations between kernels are also calculated and inserted into the objective function of fuzzy clustering as a matrix-induced regularization to encourage the diversity in kernels. We name the new model as MKFC with unsupervised RFs kernel and matrix-induced regularization. The optimization algorithm for the new model is derived, and the experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate its superiority over other MKFC approaches.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2889185", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2905849380", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4570042", "37272468", "30806637", "40378629", "31224123", "17376628", "53101603", "18361877", "907045", "36008077", "1226424", "37885712", "1333118", "2141469", "205459850", "36276603", "9295903", "1525786", "25566901", "38551083", "12546795", "30632904", "4983255", "13334278", "19615884", "5632732", "52047968", "35730151", "41206123", "89141", "14044731", "54563824", "245216", "6231871", "2179911", "56635617", "62190121", "11204096", "49186052", "53209479", "469034", "8124921"], "inbound_citations": ["202699338", "88467249", "208630819"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57763334"}

It aims at finding the entities which are present in text such as organizations, places or persons. Named entities extraction is of a paramount importance when it comes to automatic translation as different named entities are translated differently. Named entities are also very useful for advanced search engines which aim at searching for a detailed information regarding a specific entity. Named entity extraction is a difficult problem as it usually requires a disambiguation step as the same word might belong to different named entities depending on the context. This work has been conducted on the ANERCorp named entities database. This Arabic database contains four different named entities: person, organization, location and miscellaneous. The database contains 6099 sentences, out of which 60% are used for training 20% for validation and 20% for testing. Our method for named entity extraction contains two main steps: the first step predicts the list of named entities which are present at the sentence level. The second step predicts the named entity of each word of the sentence. The prediction of the list of named entities at the sentence level is done through separating the document into sentences using punctuation marks. Subsequently, a binary relation between the set of sentences (x) and the set of words (y) is created from the obtained list of sentences. A relation exists between the sentence (x) and the word (y) if, and only if, (x) contains (y). A binary relation is created for each category of named entities (person, organization, location and miscellaneous). If a sentence contains several named entities, it is duplicated in the relation corresponding to each one of them. Our method then extracts keywords from the obtained binary relations using the hyper concept method [1]. This method decomposes the original relation into non-overlapping rectangles and highlights for each rectangle the most representative keyword. The output is a list of keywords sorted in a hierarchical ordering of importance. The obtained keyword list associated with each category of named entities are fed into a random forest classifier of 10000 random trees in order to predict the list of named entities associated with each sentence. The random forest classifier produces for each sentence the list of probabilities corresponding to the existence of each category of named entities within the sentence. Random Forest [sentence(i)] = (P(Person),P(Organization),P(Location),P(miscellaneous)). Subsequently, the sentence is associated with the named entities for which the corresponding probability is larger than a threshold set empirically on the validation set. In the second step, we create a lookup table associating to each word in the database, the list of named entities to which it corresponds in the training set. For unseen sentences of the test set, the list of named entities predicted at the sentence level is produced, and for each word, the list of predicted named entities is also produced using the lookup table previously built. Ultimately, for each word, the intersection between the two predicted lists of named entities (at the sentence and the word level) will give the final predicted named entity. In the case where more than one named entity is produced at this stage, the one with the maximum probability is kept. We obtained an accuracy of 76.58% when only considering lookup tables of named entities produced at the word level. When performing the intersection with the list produced at the sentence level the accuracy reaches 77.96%. In conclusion, the hierarchical named entity extraction leads to improved results over direct extraction. Future work includes the use of other linguist features and larger lookup table in order to improve the results. Validation on other state of the art databases is also considered.

However, to build such a state space is one of the main issues of the robot learning because of the inter-dependence between state and action spaces, which resembles to the well known \\chicken and egg\" problem. This paper proposes two methods of actionbased state space construction for vision-based mobile robots. Basic ideas common to the two methods to cope with the inter-dependence are that we de ne a state as a cluster of of input vectors from which the robot can reach the goal state or the state already obtained by a sequence of one kind action primitive regardless of its length, and that this sequence is de ned as one action. The rst method clusters the input vectors as hyper ellipsoids so that the whole state space is segmented into a state transition map in terms of action from which the optimal action sequence is obtained. In order to obtain the such a map, we need a su cient number of data, which means longer learning time. To cope with this, we proposed the second method by which a robot learns purposive behavior within less learning time by incrementally segmenting the sensor space based on the experiences of the robot. The incremental segmentation is performed by constructing local models in the state space, which is based on the function approximation of the sensor outputs to reduce the learning time and on the reinforcement signal to emerge a purposive behavior. To show the validity of the methods, we apply them to a soccer robot which tries to shoot a ball into a goal.

Therefore, we propose a new face recognition method on a mobile device robust to illumination variations. This research makes the following four original contributions. First, we compared the performance of face recognition with illumination variations on mobile devices for several illumination normalization procedures suitable for mobile devices with low processing power. These include the Retinex filter, histogram equalization and histogram stretching. Second, we compared the performance for global and local methods of face recognition such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis), LNMF (Local Non-negative Matrix Factorization) and LBP (Local Binary Pattern) using an integer-based kernel suitable for mobile devices having low processing power. Third, the characteristics of each method according to the illumination variations are analyzed. Fourth, we use two matching scores for several methods of illumination normalization, Retinex and histogram stretching, which show the best and 2 nd best performances, respectively.

In this study, maize/soybean intercropping plant populations in the field were selected as the research objects. We combined ground and aerial photography to obtain the image sequences. at the stage of seedling, jointing, tasseling and grain filling. The targeted plants were photographed with fixed point from multi-view hemispherical directions on ground photography before tasseling stage. Then, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle was used to take photos in the way of concentric circles with different radius. We preprocessed the image sequences by Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, and pixel information only containing targeted plants were achieved. We evaluated the accuracy of calculated individual height, blade length and maximum width with the measured data. Image sensitivity analysis was also done at 25 and 79 days after emergence by reducing the image numbers. Canopy coverage and plant height were compared between different scenarios. The results showed that there was a good agreement between measured and calculated plant height, blade length and blade maximum width with R2>0.90. Then the dynamic changes of plant height, crown surface and organ growth were extracted based on reconstructed 3D architecture. Sensitivity analysis showed that at the early growth stage, 50 images are enough for 3D reconstruction of the plant. However, all 300 images need to be included at the late growth stage of plants.

In semiconductor manufacturing, independent models for each process chamber are limited because the number of sampled wafers measured at each chamber are too few to build a reliable model. One potential solution to this problem is to pool the data from all chambers to create a model capable of learning and serving as a global predictive model. However, even with chambers that perform the same operation, the condition of their semiconductor tools may vary because of various factors. This study uses, for the first time, various multitask methods to develop VM models. By learning multiple related tasks simultaneously, multitask methods effectively increase the number of observations included in the prediction model. In addition, by identifying the related task, the method can make a prediction using only similar tasks. This property of multitask learning can be useful to account for lack of information in a single chamber and for diversity among the chambers. The experimental results indicate that multitask models consistently outperformed independent and pooled models regardless of the size of the training set used. Among the multitask methods, a multitask tree-based ensemble model outperformed the others in every case.

K-means clustering and a dendogram based clustering methods are tested and classification results are presented for synthetic and real world data by using the MCOS. Experiments show that in many cases, MCOS outperforms the OCSVM algorithm.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "2010 18th European Signal Processing Conference", "journal": "2010 18th European Signal Processing Conference", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1488384386", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1782131", "59849738", "7035291", "16714140", "29535089", "125866813", "57368876", "31251383", "2611600", "118368002", "35730151", "547095", "207566367", "9086165"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9494004"}

Five curve features and two principal components of the normalized time-intensity curve (TIC) in 80 samples were calculated as the dataset in training three SVM classifiers. The other 40 samples were used as the testing dataset. The area overlap measure (AOM) and the corresponding ratio (CR) and percent match (PM) were calculated to evaluate the segmentation performance. The training and testing procedure was repeated for 10 times, and the average performance was calculated and compared with similar studies. Results. Our method has achieved higher accuracy compared to the previous results in literature in HNC segmentation.

MESMA was adopted to tackle the mixing pixel problem induced by medium resolution data. Specifically, 35 optimal endmembers were selected to construct a total of 3111 models in the MESMA procedure to derive accurate fraction information. A multi-dimensional feature space was constructed including the normalized difference water index (NDWI), topographical parameters of height, slope, and aspect together with the fraction maps. A Random Forest classifier consisting of 200 decision trees was adopted to classify the post-flood image based on the above multi-features. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method can extract the inundated areas precisely with a classification accuracy of 94% and a Kappa index of 0.88. The inclusion of fraction information can help improve the mapping accuracy with an increase of 2.5%.

Previous studies in finding similar users and items have several drawbacks. First, they are based on user-defined similarity measurements, such as Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) or Vector Space Similarity (VSS), which are, for the most part, not adaptive and optimized for specific applications and data. Second, these similarity measures are restricted to symmetric ones such that the similarity between A and B is the same as that for B and A, although symmetry may not always hold in many real world applications. Third, they typically treat the similarity functions between users and functions between items separately. However, in reality, the similarities between users and between items are inter-related. In this paper, we propose a novel unified model for users and items, known as Similarity Learning based Collaborative Filtering (SLCF) , based on a novel adaptive bidirectional asymmetric similarity measurement. Our proposed model automatically learns asymmetric similarities between users and items at the same time through matrix factorization. Theoretical analysis shows that our model is a novel generalization of singular value decomposition (SVD). We show that, once the similarity relation is learned, it can be used flexibly in many ways for rating prediction. To take full advantage of the model, we propose several strategies to make the best use of the proposed similarity function for rating prediction. The similarity can be used either to improve the memory-based approaches or directly in a model based CF approaches. In addition, we also propose an online version of the rating prediction method to incorporate new users and new items.

This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of these drivers in rangeland and cropland, both at the Sahel and local levels (an agropastoral site in South-West Niger). At the Sahel level, the MODIS Land Cover product was used to extract cropland and rangeland pixels. By analyzing MODIS NDVI trends together with TRMM3B43 annual rainfall (2000-2015), we developed a classification scheme allowing to identify areas of persistent decline/improvement in biomass productivity and to separate rainfall-driven dynamics from other factors. The results showed an overall increase of productivity in the rangeland, and both an improvement and a degradation in the cropland. We found strong evidence that rain is not the only import driver of biomass increase, while the decrease could be attributed chiefly to other factors exclusively or to a combination of both climate-and human-induced factors. At the Niger site level, biomass trends have been put in relation with a set of potential drivers via a Random Forest model, to define which were the explanatory factors of the observed trends. The factor set covered 5 categories: climate, natural constraints, demography, physical accessibility and land cover changes. We highlighted that tiger bushes areas were particularly prone to pressure due to overgrazing and overexploitation of wood, while positive trends were mainly observed near rivers and in fossil valleys where new agricultural practices might have been promoted. The approach developped here could help to delineate areas with decrease in crop and grassland production and thus to assess the vulnerability of the population, but also to target zones with good potential for planning long-term food security policies.

One of the central issues with FR is that its recognition performance tends to suffer when the size of the database to search through is large, due to the cost of needing to generate and compare descriptors for each individual face. Hence in this paper, we address this issue by employing VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) to aggregate local face descriptors (which are pooled using Bag-of-Words (BOW) algorithm) and classified using RBF-SVM (Radial Basis Function-Support Vector Machine) to output a predicted label file, which can be used to directly access the descriptors, instead of computing them from individual face images for each comparison. Although variants of VLAD exist, they have been proposed primarily for object recognition and hence we proffer three novel VLAD variants for FR by utilizing the popular feature descriptors: SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform), SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) and ORB (Oriented Fast Rotated Brief). We will demonstrate using comprehensive experimentations on the ORL database that the proposed variants can considerably improve the performance of FR over the contemporary state-of-the-art algorithms.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2818567.2818649", "venue": "ICCCT '15", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1983281383", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["699782", "14777911", "16196650", "5258236", "206769866", "13344451", "122725444", "14555654", "7317448", "22483386", "10381017", "6638556", "8635999", "871003", "130535382", "461853", "126155729", "14294002"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17160897"}

Previous studies often utilize classical machine learning classification algorithms to predict protein-ATP binding sites based on protein primary sequence. However, deep learning as a newly developed technique has shown outstanding performance in various fields. In this work, we introduce the deep convolutional neural network for protein-ATP binding sites prediction based on sequence information. Two classification networks are developed including a residual-inception-based predictor and a multi-inception-based predictor, then the ensemble learning is applied by giving optimized weights to each network architecture to combine them for more superior performance. We examine the performance of our proposed method on two groups of independent testing sets including a classic ATP-binding benchmark dataset and a newly proposed ATP-binding dataset. As a result, our proposed method outperforms other state-of-art sequence-based predictors with the AUC of 0.922 and 0.896 respectively which illustrates the efficacy of deep learning technique in protein-ATP binding sites prediction.

We propose to employ learnable text distance functions for each database field, and show that such measures are capable of adapting to the specific notion of similarity that is appropriate for the field's domain. We present two learnable text similarity measures suitable for this task: an extended variant of learnable string edit distance, and a novel vector-space based measure that employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for training.

The thermal response of such systems to heating and cooling is strongly dependent upon the thermal resistance found at the interfaces. Due to difficulties in modeling thermal resistances between different solid objects of a constituent system or assembly, an alternative approach is proposed in this work. In this paper, the dynamic flow of heat through multiple solid objects within a system is predicted by a machine learning model that uses a graph theoretic diffusion kernel. To demonstrate this approach, a randomly packed assembly of cylindrical rods was selected to represent a network of solids where heat transfer rates are largely governed by contacts and/or gaps between the solids. This assembly of cylindrical rods represents a network of solids with unknown interconnecting thermal resistances. Each rod represents a node in the network. The cylindrical rods were assembled in a quartz tube with axis aligned parallel to each other and the tube. The assembly was heated to temperatures up to 1200 K, and then cool-down experiments were conducted. An infra-red (IR) camera and IR transparent ports in the high temperature experimental facility were used to obtain time dependent, high-fidelity thermographic data for training and validation purposes. In particular, the temperature information from an \u2018outer\u2019 set of rods, i.e., directly cooled by contact with an external surface, was used for generating training data. This data was then used to train the models for predicting the thermal response of \u2018inner\u2019 rods of graphite, quartz and alumina materials. The network of \u2018inner\u2019 and \u2018outer\u2019 rods touching each other was used to construct a graph. A Support Vector Regression (SVR) model was trained using a diffusion kernel obtained from this graph\u2019s Laplacian matrix.

With this prediction comes an indication of the predominant failure types, the causes of structural failure and the risk profile of a road network. The usefulness of the approach was demonstrated on a dataset taken from the New Zealand Long Term Pavement Performance study of State Highways, which predominantly consist of low-volume, flexible, unbound granular pavements. The analysis of the dataset showed that the network was in a good condition. It also identified a small number of pavement sections with a high likelihood of failure. Furthermore, the application of the failure paths examined the three predominant failure types occurring on the network and identified their possible causes. Rutting appears to be significantly influenced by the road pavement strength, cracking seems to be affected notably by the environment (i.e. water ingress) and shear failure is caused primarily by the combination of traffic, pavement composition and strength.

The experimental test data are collected from reliable literature sources. The main variables used to construct the predictive model are related to the dimensional and material properties of the beams. SVR-PSO, the objective predictive model, is validated against a classical neural network model tuned with the same metaheuristic optimizer algorithm. The findings of the modeling study provide a clear evidence of the superior capability of the SVR-PSO used to predict the SFRC shear strength relative to the benchmark model. In addition, the construction of the predictive models with a lesser number of input data attributes are attained, leading an acceptable prediction accuracy of the SVR-PSO compared to the ANN-PSO model.

We compare the efficacy of supervised (Linear Discriminant Analysis LDA; Boosted Regression Trees, BRT; and Random Forest, RF) and unsupervised (Modified Self-Organizing Map, MSOM) learning-based methods to predict groundwater redox status in the agriculturally dominated Tasman, Waikato, and Wellington regions of New Zealand. Thresholds applied to regional groundwater-quality samples provide redox status variables and learn heuristics constrained by these variables and applied to spatial factors (climate, elevation, geologic, hydrology soils, and well depth) identify optimal sets of regional predictor variables. A split-sample approach is used to train and test the learning methods ability to predict redox status using the optimal predictor variables. Overall, the supervised methods demonstrate a prediction bias toward oxic conditions and inability to perform statistically well when using independent regional data; for example, consider kappa statistics for BRT (Tasman: 0.42, Waikato: 0.38, Wellington: 0.17), RF (Tasman: 0.42, Waikato: 0.47, Wellington: 0.17 and LDA (Tasman: 0.46, Waikato: 0.32, Wellington: 0.17).

Deep generative models (e.g., Variational Autoencoder (VAE)) and semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently shown promising performance in semi-supervised classification for the excellent discriminative representing ability. However, the latent code learned by the traditional VAE is not exclusive (repeatable) for a specific input sample, which prevents it from excellent classification performance. In particular, the learned latent representation depends on a non-exclusive component which is stochastically sampled from the prior distribution. Moreover, the semi-supervised GAN models generate data from pre-defined distribution (e.g., Gaussian noises) which is independent of the input data distribution and may obstruct the convergence and is difficult to control the distribution of the generated data. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel Adversarial Variational Embedding (AVAE) framework for robust and effective semi-supervised learning to leverage both the advantage of GAN as a high quality generative model and VAE as a posterior distribution learner. The proposed approach first produces an exclusive latent code by the model which we call VAE++, and meanwhile, provides a meaningful prior distribution for the generator of GAN.

Its well founded mathematical formulation, based on convex optimization framework, together with its nice generalization capabilities thanks to the implementation of the ideas from Structural Risk Minimization, perhaps lead to one of the most widely used classifiers in Machine Learning. Its non-linear extension is based in abstract vector spaces of functions called Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. By means of the so called kernel trick, that enables the possibility of projecting the data from the native space into a another space of high, possibly infinite, dimensionality, where the boundary is linear and thus, solvable by a linear Support Vector Machine. This allows to solve non-linear problems while enjoying all the mathematical guaranties and convergence bounds provided by the linear version. Since it is built on top of convex optimization, there are available the primal and the dual formulations. Traditionally, only the dual version was kernel capable, but recent work has enabled the possibility of using the kernel trick also in the primal, improving the convergence properties. However, both primal and dual versions suffer from the fact that their complexity is proportional to the number of support vectors, which is proved that it is linearly proportional to the size of the dataset. Recently, with the apparition of Internet and Big Data, new requirements have arisen for the old models. However, because Kernel SVM complexity in terms both of time and memory are proportional to the size of the problem, it is simply unfeasible to use with this kind of large-scale problems. This has lead to the fact that other models like Deep Neural Networks or Random Forest are used instead of SVM. There has been an increasing interest in the machine learning community to address those problems. In the early 2000\u2019s the first attempts were made by the use of Reduced Set methods that try to build a model only with a subset of the support vectors. However, this only address the problem in testing, since a regular SVM need to be trained beforehand. Therefore, other approaches appeared, most of them based in clustering techniques and k-Nearest Neighbours, that could be applied before the training process. The results were quite promising, but the resulting models lose some of the desirable mathematical properties of the original SVM. Nevertheless, none of those models have become widely known and they have remained as a topic of research for academics. Another type of problems that have appeared with internet is the need for online models, models that can be trained continuously with a stream of intermittently arriving data. Even more, the distribution of the data can vary over the time, requiring the capability of forgetting what has been learnt until the point. Most of the most important SVM implementations use offline optimization algorithms, notably Platt\u2019s Sequential Minimal Optimization and Interior Point Methods.

In this work, we propose a system for classifying three diseases affecting grapes \u2014 Anthracnose, Powdery Mildew and Downy Mildew \u2014 and identifying the severity of these diseases using image processing and machine learning algorithms. The key contribution of the proposed system is to consider images of grapes leaves with complex background which are captured under an uncontrolled environment. We compare the performance of four machine learning algorithms, PNN, BPNN, SVM and Random Forest, for separating the background from disease patches and classifying between the different diseases.

Therefore, when performing survival analysis, we deal with a data set with missing values, and changes over time.

In survival analysis methods, usually partial log likelihood is maximized following the idea by Cox used in his regression. This approach is also most commonly adopted in non-linear survival analysis methods. On the other hand, the predictive performance of survival analysis is measured by concordance index (C-index). In our work we investigated whether optimizing directly C-index via gradient boosting yields better results and compared it with the other survival analysis methods on several medical datasets.

Although EEG-based neurofeedback has been long employed both in experimental and clinical investigation, functional MRI (fMRI)-based neurofeedback emerged as a promising method, given its superior spatial resolution and ability to gauge deep cortical and subcortical brain regions. In combination with improved computational approaches, such as pattern recognition analysis (e.g., Support Vector Machines, SVM), fMRI neurofeedback and brain decoding represent key innovations in the field of neuromodulation and functional plasticity. Expansion in this field and its applications critically depend on the existence of freely available, integrated and user-friendly tools for the neuroimaging research community. Here, we introduce FRIEND, a graphic-oriented user-friendly interface package for fMRI neurofeedback and real-time multivoxel pattern decoding. The package integrates routines for image preprocessing in real-time, ROI-based feedback (single-ROI BOLD level and functional connectivity) and brain decoding-based feedback using SVM. FRIEND delivers an intuitive graphic interface with flexible processing pipelines involving optimized procedures embedding widely validated packages, such as FSL and libSVM. In addition, a user-defined visual neurofeedback module allows users to easily design and run fMRI neurofeedback experiments using ROI-based or multivariate classification approaches.

However, directly applying common-structure CNNs to pixel-based remote sensing image classification will lead to boundary or outline distortions of the land cover and consumes enormous computation time in the image classification stage. To solve this problem, we propose a high-resolution remote sensing image classification method based on CNN and the restricted conditional random field algorithm (CNN-RCRF). CNN-RCRF adopts CNN superpixel classification instead of pixel-based classification and uses the restricted conditional random field algorithm (RCRF) to refine the superpixel result image into a pixel-based result. The proposed method not only takes advantage of the classification ability of CNNs but can also avoid boundary or outline distortions of the land cover and greatly reduce computation time in classifying images.

Therefore, intelligently categorizing the large and growing collections of data for access convenience has been a central goal for modern computer vision research. In this thesis, we describe several newly-developed approaches for visual categorization upon the single and multiple instance learning cases. In single-instance learning (SIL), each of the training instances has been labeled. Here, we focus on a challenging task of facial expressions recognition where manually labeling each training instance, i.e., face video, is handy. To get the distinct features of expressions, we propose a novel feature representation, Histogram Variances Face (HVF), which integrates dynamic expression information into a static image being invariant to illumination and in-plane rotation. Through HVFs, the facial expression recognition can be cast as a facial recognition problem. We have applied our approach on the well-known Cohn-Kanade AU-Coded Facial Expression database, and then those extracted HVFs are classified by using facial recognition technology, i.e., Eigenfaces and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The recognition accuracy is very encouraging. We further propose an extension of HVFs, Hexagonal Histogram Variance Faces (HHVFs), which applies HVFs on a hexagonal structure. Comparing to HVFs, HHVFs not only greatly reduce the computation costs but also improve the recognition accuracy. In multiple-instance learning (MIL), the training instances are divided into groups and the instances in the same group share only one label. MIL arises from many applications where individually labeling training instances is expensive. In this case, we propose a novel algorithm, multiple-instance learning with a supervised kernel density estimation (MIL-SKDE), to tackle the labeling ambiguity. Our algorithm extends the twin technologies, kernel density estimation (SKDE) and mean shift, to their supervised versions in which the labels of data points will affect the mode seeking. We apply MIL-SKDE in several applications of visual categorization, e.g., image and object categorization, and our algorithm performs superiorly comparing to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, to address the complexity issue of MIL-SKDE, we propose MIL-SS (MIL with speed-up SKDE) to speed up the training process. Experiments shows that it has comparable performances to MIL-SKDE but is much more efficient in training stage. Finally, we apply MIL-SS in a \u201cbag-of-words\u201d (BoW) system to learn the visual codebook for object categorization on a more comprehensive dataset. Our system consists of four steps: codebook generation, feature coding, feature pooling and classification. Unlike conventional BoW methods that learn codebook from the whole image areas, our method can learn codebook just from the areas of target objects, which significantly improves classification accuracy.

By reducing the number of query samples to be cultured and enabling diagnostic services to concentrate on those in which there are true microbial infections, a significant improvement in efficiency of the service is possible. Screening process for urine samples prior to culture was modelled in a single clinical microbiology laboratory covering three hospitals and community services across Bristol and Bath, UK. Retrospective analysis of all urine microscopy, culture, and sensitivity reports over one year was used to compare two methods of classification: a heuristic model using a combination of white blood cell count and bacterial count, and a machine learning approach testing three algorithms (Random Forest, Neural Network, Extreme Gradient Boosting) whilst factoring in independent variables including demographics, historical urine culture results, and clinical details provided with the specimen. A total of 212,554 urine reports were analysed. Initial findings demonstrated the potential for using machine learning algorithms, which outperformed the heuristic model in terms of relative workload reduction achieved at a classification sensitivity > 95%. Upon further analysis of classification sensitivity of subpopulations, we concluded that samples from pregnant patients and children (age 11 or younger) require independent evaluation. First the removal of pregnant patients and children from the classification process was investigated but this diminished the workload reduction achieved. The optimal solution was found to be three Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithms, trained independently for the classification of pregnant patients, children, and then all other patients. When combined, this system granted a relative workload reduction of 41% and a sensitivity of 95% for each of the stratified patient groups. Based on the considerable time and cost savings achieved, without compromising the diagnostic performance, the heuristic model was successfully implemented in routine clinical practice in the diagnostic laboratory at Severn Pathology, Bristol.

The Fast Local Kernel Support Vector Machine (FaLK-SVM) trains a set of local SVMs on redundant neighbourhoods in the training set and an appropriate model for each query point is selected at testing time according to a proximity strategy. Supported by a recent result by Zakai and Ritov (2009) relating consistency and localizability, our approach achieves high classification accuracies by dividing the separation function in local optimisation problems that can be handled very efficiently from the computational viewpoint. The introduction of a fast local model selection further speeds-up the learning process. Learning and complexity bounds are derived for FaLK-SVM, and the empirical evaluation of the approach (with data sets up to 3 million points) showed that it is much faster and more accurate and scalable than state-of-the-art accurate and approximated SVM solvers at least for non high-dimensional data sets.

In this paper we proposea novel method that uses the dual objective of the SVM in order to update scaling weight vectors to scale different input features.

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing is a promising technology for achieving accurate estimates of aboveground biomass and thereby carbon pools; however, not much is known about the accuracy of estimating biomass change and carbon flux from repeat LiDAR acquisitions containing different data sampling characteristics. In this study, discrete return airborne LiDAR data was collected in 2003 and 2009 across {approx}20,000 hectares (ha) of an actively managed, mixed conifer forest landscape in northern Idaho, USA. Forest inventory plots, established via a random stratified sampling design, were established and sampled in 2003 and 2009. The Random Forest machine learning algorithm was used to establish statistical relationships between inventory data and forest structural metrics derived from the LiDAR acquisitions. Aboveground biomass maps were created for the study area based on statistical relationships developed at the plot level. Over this 6-year period, we found that the mean increase in biomass due to forest growth across the non-harvested portions of the study area was 4.8 metric ton/hectare (Mg/ha). In these non-harvested areas, we found a significant difference in biomass increase among forest successional stages, with a higher biomass increase in mature and old forest compared to stand initiation and young forest. Approximately 20% of the landscape had been disturbed by harvest activities during the six-year time period, representing a biomass loss of >70 Mg/ha in these areas. During the study period, these harvest activities outweighed growth at the landscape scale, resulting in an overall loss in aboveground carbon at this site. The 30-fold increase in sampling density between the 2003 and 2009 did not affect the biomass estimates. Overall, LiDAR data coupled with field reference data offer a powerful method for calculating pools and changes in aboveground carbon in forested systems.

Conventional scheduling algorithms will fail due to the static rules used and much user intervention required. We suggest that learning with neural networks is promising to solve this problem.

Due to the huge number of scene classes in the real world, the variances within each class and the shared features between classes, the classification becomes a challenging issue for scene recognition.

The lists of known tissue-specific genes for different tissues were collected from UniProt database, and the expression data retrieved from the previously compiled dataset according to the lists were used for input vector encoding. Random Forests (RFs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used to construct accurate classifiers. The RF classifiers were found to outperform SVM models for tissue-specific gene prediction. The results suggest that the candidate genes for brain or liver specific expression can provide valuable information for further experimental studies. Our approach was also applied for identifying tissue-selective gene targets for different types of tissues.ConclusionsA machine learning approach has been developed for accurately identifying the candidate genes for tissue specific/selective expression. The approach provides an efficient way to select some interesting genes for developing new biomedical markers and improve our knowledge of tissue-specific expression.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3552705", "pubmed_id": "23369200", "doi": "10.1186/1755-8794-6-S1-S10", "venue": "BMC Medical Genomics", "journal": "BMC Medical Genomics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2156677646", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3079653", "1119157", "4394630", "5663485", "5871794", "14091537", "24932154", "250879", "3093707", "10006606", "16849357", "3034777", "44639922", "15462794", "9130825", "28174177", "26636168", "45572403", "27882602", "18408855", "6361578", "11893944", "12493082", "22479211", "31998719", "207246084", "42511298", "9148917", "24614265", "19771711", "6165967", "9585460", "12845390", "24700080", "45644110", "7809588", "16523927"], "inbound_citations": ["10514240", "199469261", "11407382", "13862912", "16523927", "15800331", "8469646", "4922309"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16523927"}

In the case of supervised classification, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) play a dominant role. Recently, the Extreme Learning Machine algorithm (ELM) has been extensively used. The classification scheme previously published by the authors, and called WT-EMP, introduces spatial information in the classification process by means of an Extended Morphological Profile (EMP) that is created from features extracted by wavelets. In addition, the hyperspectral image is denoised in the 2-D spatial domain, also using wavelets and it is joined to the EMP via a stacked vector. In this paper, the scheme is improved achieving two goals. The first one is to reduce the classification time while preserving the accuracy of the classification by using ELM instead of SVM. The second one is to improve the accuracy results by performing not only a 2-D denoising for every spectral band, but also a previous additional 1-D spectral signature denoising applied to each pixel vector of the image. For each denoising the image is transformed by applying a 1-D or 2-D wavelet transform, and then a NeighShrink thresholding is applied. Improvements in terms of classification accuracy are obtained, especially for images with close regions in the classification reference map, because in these cases the accuracy of the classification in the edges between classes is more relevant.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2240854", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2533345990", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["59076046", "15480403", "16008390", "116858", "62210240", "15969351", "62195445", "12208116", "26615105", "10229553", "10574569", "6546550", "202503", "14004541", "16150618", "15049946", "119358120", "7443466", "17078915", "37570878", "16327957", "6793216", "15617677", "26985497", "60633363", "13801828", "16542065", "32219353", "8376138", "1295558", "123509357", "9727835", "2619920", "42359732", "24059259", "833630", "25903493", "149055", "12479973", "11995267", "15508105", "118471922", "1019699", "60452913", "38150955"], "inbound_citations": ["71149763", "173186848"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132130467"}

In this context, the models for predicting financial crisis of contractor have been extensively studied. However, the previous studies have been focused on predicting a financial crisis for one-quarter or one-year ahead of prediction point, even though the duration of projects are relatively long in the construction industry, usually exceeding one year. Moreover, despite the possibility of knowing the signs of financial crisis of a contractor through predicting financial distress, no attempt has been made to predict financial distress that contractor can suffer before reaching a financial crisis including highly visible legal events, such as bankruptcy, default, and delisting. This means that there is significant gap between those models and practical application in terms of the prediction period and definition of the financial crisis. This study proposes voting-based ensemble models that predict financial distress of contractor for two- and three-year ahead of prediction point using a finance-based definition of financial distress. The prediction performance of proposed model was evaluated using financial statements of contractors in South Korea from 2007 to 2012. The proposed models showed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.940 and 0.910 for predicting financial distress for each of the prediction years. By predicting financial distress of the contractor from the early stages of a construction project to the end stage with high accuracy, this model can help project owners and broad stakeholders to avoid damage due to financial crisis during a project.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2018.05.026", "venue": "Expert Syst.

Intelligent interpretation of digital ink in a sketch-based application can augment a static sketch with meaningful interpretation, thus enabling the use of electronic editing and processing. The goal of this research was to determine whether a practical, trainable, and adaptive multi-stroke symbol recognition system for sketch-based applications could be developed. This dissertation provides a thorough background study and a detailed analysis of existing approaches to symbol recognition. Two new recognition methods are presented in this work. The first method uses a combined structural and statistical approach that extracts both global and local features from structural primitives of a shape to train a set of statistical classifiers. The challenge posed by a particular class of shapes led to the development of another recognition technique. This second technique uses Zernike moment descriptors for characterizing symbols and a Support Vector Machine classifier for learning and classification. A recognition accuracy rate of 97% has been achieved on a dataset consisting of 7,410 sketched symbols and using Zernike moment features up to the 8th order. Furthermore, in this dissertation, two optimal fragmentation algorithms that fragment common geometries into a basis set of line segments and elliptical arcs are presented. The first algorithm uses an explicit template in which the order and types of bases are specified. The other only requires the number of fragments of each basis type. For the set of symbols under test, both algorithms achieved 100% fragmentation accuracy rate for the symbols with line bases, >99% accuracy for the symbols with elliptical bases, and >90% accuracy for the symbols with mixed line and elliptical bases.

Images from ten different domestic object categories (apple, bottle, bowl, cup, handbag, laptop, light switch, potted plant, shoe and toaster) are downloaded and annotated from the Web. This results in complex training sets for each category, which are divided unsupervised into sub-sets according to the extracted principal views. The principal views are also employed to learn class- and view-specific, data-tuned hierarchical tessellations of the 2D image plane. The 2D tessellations are used along with a class-independent data-tuned hierarchical tessellation of a high-dimensional descriptor space to realize a view-tuned approximate partial matching kernel. A view-tuned kernel implements a fine-to-coarse matching of Bag of Words-based object parts, while paying attention to the structure of the object and the relative positions of its parts. Both the tessellation of the image plane and the high-dimensional descriptor space are learned with a hierarchical Growing Neural Gas, the lbTreeGNG. View-tuned kernels are used efficiently with Support Vector Machines in a sliding window approach to train view-tuned experts for the different sub-sets.

Since most individual loci contribute little to complex trait variations, it remains a challenge for traditional statistical methods to identify minor QTLs with subtle phenotypic effects. Here we applied a new framework which combined the GWAS analysis and machine learning feature selection to explore new ways for the study of minor QTLs mining. Results We studied the soybean branching trait with the 2,137 accessions from soybean (Glycine max) diversity panel, which was sequenced by 50k SNP chips with 42,080 valid SNPs. First as a baseline study, we conducted the GWAS GAPIT analysis, and we found that only one SNP marker significantly associated with soybean branching was identified. We then combined the GWAS analysis and feature importance analysis with Random Forest score analysis and permutation analysis. Our analysis results showed that there are 36,077 features (SNPs) identified by Random Forest score analysis, and 2,098 features (SNPs) identified by permutation analysis. In total, there are 1,770 features (SNPs) confirmed by both of the Random Forest score analysis and the permutation analysis. Based on our analysis, 328 branching development related genes were identified. A further analysis on GO (gene ontology) term enrichment were applied on these 328 genes. And the gene location and gene expression of these identified genes were provided. Conclusions We find that the combined analysis with GWAS and machine learning feature selection shows significant identification power for minor QTLs mining. The presented research results on minor QTLs mining will help understand the biological activities that lie between genotype and phenotype in terms of causal networks of interacting genes.

Class membership probabilities are important in many applications in document classification, in which multiclass classification is often applied. In the proposed method, we first make an accuracy table by counting the number of correctly classified training samples in each range or cell of classification scores. We then apply smoothing methods such as a moving average method with coverage to the accuracy table. In order to determine the class membership probability of an unknown sample, we first calculate the classification scores of the sample, then find the range or cell that corresponds to the scores and output the values associated in the range or cell in the accuracy table. Through experiments on two different datasets with both Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes classifiers, we empirically show that the use of multiple classification scores is effective in the estimation of class membership probabilities, and that the proposed smoothing methods for the accuracy table work quite well. We also show that the estimated class membership probabilities by the proposed method are useful in the detection of the misclassified samples.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-71701-0_29", "venue": "PAKDD", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1760702393", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["17004306"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:34855893"}

RGB-D images provide synchronized information from multiple views (e.g., color and depth) of real-world objects and scenes. This work proposes learning compact and discriminative features from the multiple views of RGB-D content toward effective feature representation for RGB-D image understanding. In particular, a robust multiview feature learning approach is developed, which exploits the intrinsic relations among multiple views. The feature learning in multiple views is jointly optimized in an integrated formulation. The joint optimization essentially exploits the intrinsic relations among the views, leading to effective features and making the learning process robust to noises. The feature learning function is formulated as a robust nonnegative graph embedding function over multiple graphs in various views. The graphs characterize the local geometric and discriminating structure of the multiview data. The joint sparsity in e1-norm graph embedding and e21-norm data factorization further enhances the robustness of feature learning. We derive an efficient computational solution for the proposed approach and provide rigorous theoretical proof with regard to its convergence. We apply the proposed approach to two RGB-D image understanding tasks: RGB-D object classification and RGB-D scene categorization.

In this context the effective change detection (CD) among multitemporal datasets is a key process that must produce accurate results obtained by computationally efficient algorithms. Most of the CD methods are focused on binary detection (presence or absence of changes) or in the clustering of the different detected types of changes. In this paper, a CUDA scheme to perform pixel-based multiclass CD for hyperspectral datasets is introduced. The scheme combines multiclass CD with binary CD to obtain an accurate multiclass change map. The combination with the binary map contributes to reducing the execution time of the CUDA code. The binary CD is based on performing the difference among images based on Euclidean and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) distances and a later thresholding by Otsu's algorithm to detect the changed pixels. The multiclass CD begins with the fusion of the multitemporal data following with feature extraction by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and incorporating spatial features by means of an Extended Morphological Profile (EMP). The resulting dataset is filtered using the binary CD map and classified pixel by pixel by the supervised algorithms Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Using the car-following model the subject vehicle (i.e., the following vehicle) utilizes the leading vehicle's information to detect sensor anomalies by employing previously-trained One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) models. This approach allows the AEKF to estimate the state of a vehicle not only based on the vehicle's location and speed, but also by taking into account the state of the surrounding traffic. A communication time delay factor is considered in the car-following model to make it more suitable for real-world applications.

Given the low incidence of CMML and its broad range complexity, a large disease-specific data set is necessary to discern independent co-variates predictive of disease behavior. Several prognostic models derived from smaller data sets have been developed to stratify CMML patients into distinct groups that are predictive for OS. However, the validity of these models in a large international data set has never been investigated. Here, we present the largest International CMML data base established to date and report key baseline characteristics predictive for disease outcome. We externally validate and perform a detailed statistical comparison between the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), Revised (R)-IPSS, Global MD Anderson Scoring System (MDASC), MD Anderson Prognostic Score (MDAPS), Dusseldorf Score (DS), Mayo, and Spanish Scoring Systems (CPSS). ::: ::: Methods: Data were abstracted by each contributing institution and deposited for central data review at the Moffitt Cancer Center. Manual review of cases was performed to ensure data quality prior to analysis. Only WHO defined CMML was included. The primary objective of this study was to establish an international CMML data set and validate the above models calculated at the time of presentation to each center. All prognostic models were calculated as previously described. The Kaplan\u2013Meier (KM) method was used to estimate median OS and the log rank test was used to compare KM survival estimates with SPSS version 21.0. Random Forest Survival (RSF) and ROC analysis was done with R. ::: ::: Results: Between July 1981 and June 2014, 1832 CMML patients were captured in the International CMML database. Median age at diagnosis was 70 (16-93) years with a male (67%) predominance. By the WHO classification, the majority of patients had CMML-1 (79.9% vs. 20.1%) and most patients were evenly subcategorized as MPN-CMML (49.8%) versus MDS-CMML (50.2%) by FAB criteria. Splenomegaly was demonstrable in 25%. Most patients had favorable cytogenetics by both IPSS (70%) and CPSS (67.6%) classification schemas. Mean BM blast % was 5.6 and mean monocyte count was 4.85x103/dL. Median OS of the entire data set was 31.6 months. All tested prognostic models were valid and able to predict OS (p<0.0001). To compare relative model performance, 1013 complete cases with sufficient data to calculate all risk models were compared using time dependent receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and their area under the curves (AUC). ROC curves were calculated for OS at 36 months. The R-IPSS model had the highest AUC (0.694) while the DS model had the lowest (0.635). The difference in AUC between the R-IPSS and DS models was statistically significant (p = 0.003) whereas there was no significant difference from other models tested. To determine which models were most vulnerable to reclassification from low-risk to higher risk, we calculated a vulnerability score defined by the number of models able to up-stage low-risk disease in more than 15% of cases. Using this metric, the Mayo and MDASC scores were least vulnerable to up-staging by other models. Lastly, we used an orthogonal method for determination of variable importance (RSF for OS at 36 months). RSF is an ensemble method of classification and regression tree methodology. Ranking of variables by their weighted importance determined by this procedure identified the top five variables were hemoglobin, circulating blasts, platelet count, number of cytopenias, and karyotype. A new risk model was developed using the results of the RSF with an AUC of 0.720, which was comparable but not significantly different than other modern scoring systems. ::: ::: Conclusions: This represents the largest international CMML-specific data set derived from eight unique centers of excellence. All modern prognostic models were valid and performed comparably. Despite novel strategies for variable importance discovery, an improved model could not be constructed. This data suggest that the power of clinical variables has reached an asymptote and highlights the need for incorporation of molecular and other novel biological features.

This study will identify new biomarkers through metabolomics, a powerful method to identify numerous metabolites and profiles. Study Design: We utilized a previously conducted epidemiology study of well-characterized smokers. These subjects completed an extensive interview and smoked two cigarettes, one hour apart, in a smoking laboratory. Blood and CO measurements were collected before and after each cigarette. Plasma is available for metabolomic profiling. A pilot study was conducted on 5 light smokers and 5 heavy smokers\u2019 plasma from the study and evaluated whether number of cigarettes per day mediates the influence of global metabolome. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the number of cigarettes per day exerts their influence on phenotype through global metabolome. Methods: Using UPLC-TOFMS in our pilot study, we first analyzed global metabolomic profiles of 5 light smokers and 5 heavy smokers\u2019 plasma and evaluated whether number of cigarettes per day mediate the influence of global metabolomic profiles. The data obtained for multivariate data analyses using Scripps\u2019 XCMS. t-test, SVM (Support Vector Machine analysis), and Random Forest from the Metaboanalyst (www.metaboanalyst) were used for feature selection. The OOB (out-of-bag) error was used to measure the performance of Random Forest classification and the performance for SVMs was estimated using leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV). Results: In our results, 1199 peaks in the positive mode and 497 peaks in the negative mode were detected and after feature selection, 816 and 361 peaks were selected in the positive mode and negative mode, separately. Those significant features from all three methods (t-test, SVM and Random Forest) were pooled together for identification using Metlin, MMCD and HMDB databases to obtain the KEGG IDs, and the pooled KEGG IDs were used for Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity@ Systems, www.ingenuity.com). Our preliminary results suggest that smoking behavior is associated with several biological pathways such as cell death, gene expression, cell-cell interaction, and lipid metabolism. The Pathways Analysis also reveals several liver, heart and renal toxicity and altered bile acid biosynthesis, phospholipid degradation due to heavy smoking. Future Studies: We will further evaluate whether smoking topography and inhalation, as measured by a nicotine boost and CO boost, and whether nicotine metabolism is associated with smokers\u2019 global metabolome by level of smoking.

Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) for hyperspectral images has been explored in recent years. However, it is still a concern and challenging task to extract a highly descriptive feature to contribute to improve the performance of hyperspectral image retrieval. At present, deep learning is a new research area of machine learning, which can extract more effective deep features by using a cascade of many layers of nonlinear processing units. In this paper, a deep spectral-spatial feature extraction method is proposed based on Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) for hyperspectral image retrieval. Firstly, spectral vector is extracted by selecting manually pure pixels from hyperspectral image. Then spatial vector is extracted by selecting manually the neighbor pixels of pure pixels from principal bands after reducing the dimensionality of hyperspectral images with one-bit (1BT) transform. Spectral-spatial vector as training samples is obtained by combining spectral vector with spatial vector by using Vector Stacking (VS) approach. After training DCGAN model, deep spectral-spatial feature is extracted to further apply into hyperspectral retrieval. Experiments are conducted among our method and the three other state-of-the-art methods including endmember extraction using improved Automatic Pixel Purity Index (APPI), spectral and spatial features extraction, and endmember signatures extraction using Endmember Induction Algorithm (EIA).

A more natural, intuitive, user-friendly, and less intrusive Human-Computer interface for controlling an application by executing hand gestures is presented. For this purpose, a robust vision-based hand-gesture recognition system has been developed, and a new database has been created to test it. The system is divided into three stages: detection, tracking, and recognition. The detection stage searches in every frame of a video sequence potential hand poses using a binary Support Vector Machine classifier and Local Binary Patterns as feature vectors. These detections are employed as input of a tracker to generate a spatio-temporal trajectory of hand poses. Finally, the recognition stage segments a spatio-temporal volume of data using the obtained trajectories, and compute a video descriptor called Volumetric Spatiograms of Local Binary Patterns (VS-LBP), which is delivered to a bank of SVM classifiers to perform the gesture recognition. The VS-LBP is a novel video descriptor that constitutes one of the most important contributions of the paper, which is able to provide much richer spatio-temporal information than other existing approaches in the state of the art with a manageable computational cost.

Affect prediction in movies is one such domain, potentially aiding the design as well as the impact analysis of movies.

In this paper, we address the problem of continuous affect ratings with the availability of limited in-domain data resources. We initially setup several baseline models trained on in-domain data, followed by a proposal of a Knowledge Transfer (KT) + Gradient Boosting (GB) approach. KT learns models on a larger (mismatched) data which are then adapted to make predictions on the data of interest. GB further updates these predictions based on models learnt from the in-domain data. We observe that the KT + GB models provide Concordance Correlation Coefficient values of 0.13 and 0.27 for valence and affect prediction on the continuous LIRIS ACCEDE dataset against best baseline prediction values of 0.12 and 0.11.

Friedman's Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB), is applied to predicting a compound's quantitative or categorical biological activity based on a quantitative description of the compound's molecular structure. Stochastic Gradient Boosting is a procedure for building a sequence of models, for instance regression trees (as in this paper), whose outputs are combined to form a predicted quantity, either an estimate of the biological activity, or a class label to which a molecule belongs. In particular, the SGB procedure builds a model in a stage-wise manner by fitting each tree to the gradient of a loss function: e.g., squared error for regression and binomial log-likelihood for classification. The values of the gradient are computed for each sample in the training set, but only a random sample of these gradients is used at each stage. (Friedman showed that the well-known boosting algorithm, AdaBoost of Freund and Schapire, could be considered as a particular case of SGB.) The SGB method is used to analyze 10 cheminformatics data sets, most of which are publicly available. The results show that SGB's performance is comparable to that of Random Forest, another ensemble learning method, and are generally competitive with or superior to those of other QSAR methods.

The formulation intrinsically causes two problems: (1) the generator and the discriminator (i.e., the classifier) may not converge to the data distribution at the same time; and (2) the generator cannot control the semantics of the generated samples. In this paper, we present the triple generative adversarial network (Triple-GAN), which consists of three players---a generator, a classifier, and a discriminator. The generator and the classifier characterize the conditional distributions between images and labels, and the discriminator solely focuses on identifying fake image-label pairs. We design compatible objective functions to ensure that the distributions characterized by the generator and the classifier converge to the data distribution.

In order to solve this challenging nonlinear regression problem, two novel strategies were proposed to design the DNN architecture and the learning workflow: 1) Dual Data Feed; 2) Progressive Transfer Learning. With the Dual Data Feed structure, both the high-frequency data and the corresponding Beat Tone data are fed into the DNN to relieve the burden of feature extraction, thus reducing the network complexity and the training cost. The second strategy, Progressive Transfer Learning, enables us to unbiasedly train the DNN using a single training dataset. Unlike most established deep learning approaches where the training datasets are fixed, within the framework of the Progressive Transfer Learning, the training dataset evolves in an iterative manner while gradually absorbing the subsurface information retrieved by the physics-based inversion module, progressively enhancing the prediction accuracy of the DNN and propelling the FWI process out of the local minima. The Progressive Transfer Learning, alternatingly updating the training velocity model and the DNN parameters in a complementary fashion toward convergence, saves us from being overwhelmed by the otherwise tremendous amount of training data, and avoids the underfitting and biased sampling issues.

This indicates, as a promising research avenue, the possibility to combine their strengths into an online multi-task approach to the problem.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2335874026", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["7626806", "15700257", "1009868", "10002479", "6558253", "5694525", "5412263", "6470935", "6117965", "7553535", "13914425", "120581754", "17257979", "122415379", "10659969", "41555371", "6097881", "8938789", "6284099", "17912911", "11453394", "15832680"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28522152"}

A retrospective analysis was performed on 216 HNC patients who were treated using radiotherapy at a single institution between 2009 and 2016. CT and T1 post-contrast MR images along with NCI-CTCAE xerostomia grade (3-month follow-up) were prospectively collected at our institution. Image features were extracted for ipsilateral/contralateral parotid and submandibular glands relative to the location of the primary tumor. Dose-volume-histogram (DVH) parameters were also acquired. Features that were correlated with xerostomia (p<0.05) were further reduced using a LASSO logistic regression. Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were used to predict xerostomia under five conditions (DVH-only, CT-only, MR-only, CT+MR, and DVH+CT+MR) using a ten-fold cross validation. The prediction performance was determined using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). DeLong\u2019s test was used to determine the difference between the ROC curves. Among extracted features, 13 CT, 6 MR, and 4 DVH features were selected. The ROC-AUC values for GLM/SVM classifiers with DVH, CT, MR, CT+MR and all features were 0.72\u00b10.01/0.72\u00b10.01, 0.73\u00b10.01/0.68\u00b10.01, 0.68\u00b10.01/0.63\u00b10.01, 0.74\u00b10.01/0.75\u00b10.01, and 0.78\u00b10.01/0.79\u00b10.01, respectively. DeLong\u2019s test demonstrated an improved in AUC for both classifiers with the addition of all features compared to DVH, CT, and MR-alone (p<0.05) and the SVM CT+MR model (p=0.03).

Since the intensive care unit (ICU) data set (publicly available in Physionet) has subjects from four different ICU types, we hypothesize that there is an underlying relatedness amongst various ICU types. Therefore, this study aims to explore MTTL model for in-hospital mortality prediction of ICU patients. We used single-task learning (STL) approach on the augmented data as well as individual ICU data and compared the performance with the proposed MTTL model. As a performance measurement metrics, we used sensitivity (Sens), positive predictivity (+Pred), and Score. MTTL with class balancing showed the best performance with score of 0.78, 0.73, o.52 and 0.63 for ICU type 1 (Coronary care unit), 2 (Cardiac surgery unit), 3 (Medical ICU) and 4 (Surgical ICU) respectively. In contrast the maximum score obtained using STL approach was 0.40 for ICU type 1 & 2. These results indicates that the performance of in-hospital mortality can be improved using ICU type information and by balancing the `non-survivor' class. The findings of the study may be useful for quantifying the quality of ICU care, managing ICU resources and selecting appropriate interventions.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28324982", "doi": "10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591438", "venue": "Conference proceedings : ...
