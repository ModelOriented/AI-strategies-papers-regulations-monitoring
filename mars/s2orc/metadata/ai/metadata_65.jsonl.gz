Computerized systems for fetal monitoring provide a quantitative analysis of FHR signals, however the effective methods of qualitative assessment that could support the process of medical diagnosis are still needed. The measurements of hydronium ions concentration (pH) in neonatal cord blood are an objective indicator of the fetal outcome. Improper pH level is a symptom of acidemia being the result of fetal hypoxia. The paper proposes a two-step analysis of fetal heart rate recordings that allows for effective prediction of the acidemia risk. The first step consists in fuzzy classification of FHR signals. Fuzzy inference corresponds to the clinical interpretation of signals based on the FIGO guidelines. The goal of inference is to eliminate recordings indicating the fetal wellbeing from the further classification process. In the second step, the remained recordings are nonlinearly classified using multilayer perceptron and Lagrangian Support Vector Machines (LSVM). The proposed procedures are evaluated using data collected with computerized fetal surveillance system. The assessment performance is evaluated with the number of correct classifications (CC) and quality index (QI) defined as the geometric mean of sensitivity and specificity. The highest CC=92.0% and QI=88.2% were achieved for the Weighted Fuzzy Scoring System combined with the LSVM algorithm.

In the real world, most images and videos are stored and transferred in a compressed format to save storage capacity and data transfer bandwidth. However, since typical generative adversarial networks generate raw RGB images, those generated images need to be compressed by a post-processing stage to reduce the data size. Among image compression methods, JPEG has been one of the most commonly used lossy compression methods for still images. Hence, we propose a novel framework that generates JPEG compressed images using generative adversarial networks. The novel generator consists of the proposed locally connected layers, chroma subsampling layers, quantization layers, residual blocks, and convolution layers. The locally connected layer is proposed to enable block-based operations. We also discuss training strategies for the proposed architecture including the loss function and the transformation between its generator and its discriminator. The proposed method is evaluated using the publicly available CIFAR-10 dataset and LSUN bedroom dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate compressed data with competitive qualities.

Moreover, transit information is only delivered by traditional media which is not always accurate or in real-time.

However, these methods do not explore the relationship between the bars, and the connected song as a whole has no musical form structure and sense of musical direction. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-model Multi-task Hierarchical Conditional VAE-GAN (Variational Autoencoder-Generative adversarial networks) networks, named MIDI-Sandwich, which combines musical knowledge, such as musical form, tonic, and melodic motion. The MIDI-Sandwich has two submodels: Hierarchical Conditional Variational Autoencoder (HCVAE) and Hierarchical Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (HCGAN). The HCVAE uses hierarchical structure. The underlying layer of HCVAE uses Local Conditional Variational Autoencoder (L-CVAE) to generate a music bar which is pre-specified by the First and Last Notes (FLN). The upper layer of HCVAE uses Global Variational Autoencoder(G-VAE) to analyze the latent vector sequence generated by the L-CVAE encoder, to explore the musical relationship between the bars, and to produce the song pieced together by multiple music bars generated by the L-CVAE decoder, which makes the song both have musical structure and sense of direction. At the same time, the HCVAE shares a part of itself with the HCGAN to further improve the performance of the generated music. The MIDI-Sandwich is validated on the Nottingham dataset and is able to generate a single-track melody sequence (17x8 beats), which is superior to the length of most of the generated models (8 to 32 beats).

The experimental results demonstrate that the predicted effect with support vector machine is better than the neural network and the proposed approach with multiscale wavelet kernel can provide more optimal performance than that with radial basis function kernel,and the feasibility of applying MW- SVR in traffic flow prediction.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Computer Simulation", "mag_id": "2394360073", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["56178307", "32100670", "199582536"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63815835"}

In such cases, the most widely accepted approach is to model the normal behavior of the system in order to subsequently detect unknown events. This is the basic concept of One-Class Classification (OCC). In some preliminary works we have proposed the Feature Boundaries Detector for One-Class Classification FBDOCC method, which operates by examining each problem feature at a time. In this paper we propose an extensive study of the behavior of the FBDOCC and introduce another version of the method, namely FBDOCC2.

Furthermore, this work also introduces a procedure to improve the training time performance without degrading the quality of the classification as well as some other contributions hereafter described. A number of experiments were carried out with synthetic and real datasets aiming at comparing both versions of the FBDOCC method with the most recent and effective OCC methods, namely: SVDD, One-class SVM, Least Squares One-class SVM, Kernel PCA, Gaussian Process Prior OCC, Condensed Nearest Neighbor Data Description and One-class Random Forests. The evaluation metrics considered in the experiments are: (i) the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC); (ii) the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC); (iii) the training time; and (iv) the prototype reduction rate. Regarding the metrics AUC and MCC, the first FBDOCC version has presented the best overall results among all the methods whereas the FBDOCC2 obtained results comparable to the best methods in some experiments where the standard FBDOCC yielded a poorer performance.

Like 2.5-year-olds, inexperienced networks behave as if following one rule; slightly more experienced networks (akin to 3-year-old children) behave as if following a pair of rules; and the most experienced networks (akin to 5-year-olds) behave as if following two pairs of rules. Analysis of the networks\u2019 activation levels revealed that mastery of simple rules is a necessary precondition for using higher order rules. The model also generated four novel predictions that can be tested in future research with children. Introduction Since its inception, artificial intelligence has made a large impact on the field of psychology. The infusion of computer generated models into psychological research has become increasingly common. In the past decade, connectionist models have become particularly influential as a research tool in psychology. Connectionist models benefit psychology in three ways: (a) successful simulation requires formalization of the assumptions of the model, (b) analyzing the solution of a connectionist network may provide insight into the psychological mechanisms used, and (c) the model may generate novel (and often counter-intuitive) predictions. In particular, connectionist modeling used in conjunction with empirical research has the potential to shed light on patterns of development across a wide range of cognitive domains. Researchers in developmental psychology have already employed connectionist models to simulate developmental phenomenon in a variety of cognitive tasks (e.g., McClelland & Jenkins, 1991; Schultz, Schmidt, Buckingham, & Mareschal, 1995; see Elman et al., 1996, for a comprehensive review). Often, the results of these simulations call into question contemporary explanations of cognitive development. According to Cognitive Complexity and Control theory (CCC; Frye, Zelazo, & Palfai, 1995; Zelazo & Frye, 1997), developmental improvements on tasks assessing deliberate reasoning and intentional action can be attributed to the acquisition of increasingly complex rule systems. Specifically, CCC postulates that young children (2.5 years) can use one rule, slightly older children (3 years) can use a pair of rules, while the oldest preschoolers (5 years) can use two incompatible pairs of rules. Rule-based card sorting paradigms have been employed to illustrate the number of Target Cards Test Cards Figure 1: Stimuli for DCCS rules that children can use. In these tasks, children are given cards that can be placed in one of two boxes based on a rule. For example, Zelazo, Reznick, & Pinon (1995) instructed 2.5-year-olds to sort pictures into categories such as things found inside the house versus things found outside. Typically, these children were able to sort the first card correctly, but then perseverated and sorted all subsequent cards in the same box. Thus, these results demonstrated that 2.5-year-old children could sort by one rule (e.g., if picture of things found inside the house then put card there), but not by a pair of rules (e.g., if picture of things found inside the house then put card here, but if picture of things found outside, then put card there). The Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS; Frye et al., 1995; Zelazo, Frye, & Rapus, 1996) has also been used to reveal age-related changes in the number of rules children can use simultaneously. In the standard task, children are shown two target cards that differ on two dimensions, say color and shape (e.g., red car and blue flower). Children are presented with test cards that share one dimension with one target and the other dimension with the other target (e.g., red flower and blue car, see Figure 1). In the pre-switch phase, children are instructed to sort the test cards (i.e., match the test card to the appropriate target card) according to one rule (color or shape). After a predetermined number of pre- switch trials (e.g., 5, see Zelazo et al., 1996), children are asked to sort the same test cards by the other rule. So, the same test card will be sorted differently in the pre-switch and post-switch phases. On this task, 3-year-old children tend to pass the pre-switch phase, but fail the post-switch phase. This indicates that these children can sort by one pair of rules (e.g., in the color game, if it\u2019s red it goes here, but if it\u2019s blue it goes here), but not by two incompatible pairs of rules (e.g., if it\u2019s the color game, then if it\u2019s red it goes here, and if it\u2019s blue it goes here but if it\u2019s the shape game, then if it\u2019s a flower it goes here and if it\u2019s a car it goes here.) Five- year-old children tend to pass both the pre-switch and post-", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1483488209", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["143637046", "62180866", "144101880", "143784295", "149370888", "11876354", "56589641", "145399502", "140817445", "144906791", "144304214"], "inbound_citations": ["205560275", "54016818", "10001332"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:40022602"}

In the present study, extensive observation data collected from a river of SES, Sundarban Estuarine System (River Jagaddal, situated in the southernmost part of western Sundarbans and in the closed proximity to Northern boundary of Bay of Bengal) has been used to perform rigorous data analysis using Random Forests. The basic objective of the study is to identify variability, importance and associated interactions for phytoplankton as well as chlorophyll concentrations along the river stretch. This study enables us to identify status of productivity pertinent to availability as well as growth of fish production of this region. It may be noted that most of the people residing in these areas have sole dependency of earning from fishing. RF model has a high predictive power. The interpretations of RF model can be visualized by feature importance graphs which evaluate a feature as a whole which means, contribution of all the properties to a certain phenomena can be observed. In this approach, Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm has been used to classify different properties of estuarine water according to their individual roles on the phytoplankton density and chlorophyll-a concentrations. The properties are classified as significant, moderately significant and insignificant on the basis of their roles (as obtained from RF model) in modulating phytoplankton density and chlorophyll-a concentration. The present study reveals that the phytoplankton density is strongly influenced by the distance from the sea. Surface salinity is the other important factor to be considered as per our findings. Surface phosphate and surface nitrate are marked to be the other important dominating factors on phytoplankton density. In fact, nitrogen and phosphorus are the primary factors that control phytoplankton abundance in estuaries. The bottom temperature has little significance on phytoplankton density as per model investigation. But, the roles of the other factors like surface temperature (st), bottom phosphate (bp) and bottom salinity (bs) have found to be literally insignificant. The chlorophyll-a concentrations found in the study area during study period are found to be strongly correlated to phytoplankton density. This is quite expected since chlorophyll-a concentration can be used as a direct measure of phytoplankton density. The surface phosphate and bottom salinity also observed to have significant influences on chlorophyll-a concentration. It can also be concluded from the model output that, surface phosphate is the most important limiting nutrient on the chlorophyll-a concentration in this specific study area. Usually, there is a general consensus that there are seasonal and spatial variations of the limiting nutrients which in turn are the most important factors responsible for variation in phytoplankton density. Phosphorus is known to be the principal limiting nutrient of phytoplankton growth. Phosphorus limitation is often associated with periods of high river runoff whereas, N or N+P limitation was associated with low river runoff, with comparatively greater influence of sea water. The contribution of other parameters like distance from the sea (d), surface temperature, bottom temperature, bottom phosphate, surface nitrate, bottom nitrate and surface salinity are observed to have more or less insignificant effect on chlorophyll-a concentrations.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3369740.3372761", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3008901788", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5956609", "128814743", "16036351", "3412141", "62973643", "126570947", "118915646", "52029269", "54820492", "129126786"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211519882"}

For this purpose, numerical predictor variables such as topographically derived factors (Digital Elevation Model, Aspect, Slope, Curvature, Topographic Wetness Index), climatic variables (Rain), and hydrological variables (stream density, stream power index, distance to river) and multiple remote sensing indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Buildup Index) were used. These predictor variables were selected because they are globally collectible and reproducible. The performances of these models were evaluated by using common statistical indicators, namely Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, Overall Accuracy and Area under Receiving Operating Characteristics, and the statistical test of differences. The results showed that the proposed swarm intelligence models outperformed benchmarked methods, namely Particle Swarm Optimization, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest in almost all comparing indicators.

The widely used back propagation method of connectionist learning [19, 21, 18] is set in the context of nonlinear optimization. In this framework, the issues of stability, convergence and parallelism are considered. As a form of gradient descent with fixed step size, back propagation is known to be unstable, which is illustrated using Rosenbrock's function. This is contrasted with stable methods which involve a line search in the gradient direction. The convergence criterion for connectionist problems involving binary functions is discussed relative to the behavior of gradient descent in the vicinity of local minima. A minimax criterion is compared with the least squares criterion. The contribution of the momentum term [19, 18] to more rapid convergence is interpreted relative to the geometry of the weight space. It is shown that in plateau regions of relatively constant gradient, the momentum term acts to increase the step size by a factor of 1/1-\u03bc, where \u03bc is the momentum term. In valley regions with steep sides, the momentum constant acts to focus the search direction toward the local minimum by averaging oscillations in the gradient.

We present a new approach using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on galaxy images. We test the method using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) r-band images with artificial AGN point sources added which are then removed using the GAN and with parametric methods using GALFIT. When the AGN point source PS is more than twice as bright as the host galaxy, we find that our method, PSFGAN, can recover PS and host galaxy magnitudes with smaller systematic error and a lower average scatter ($49\\%$). PSFGAN is more tolerant to poor knowledge of the PSF than parametric methods. Our tests show that PSFGAN is robust against a broadening in the PSF width of $\\pm 50\\%$ if it is trained on multiple PSF's. We demonstrate that while a matched training set does improve performance, we can still subtract point sources using a PSFGAN trained on non-astronomical images.

We introduce a novel approach based on supervised machine learning that detects effects of translational selection on genes, while controlling for local variation in nucleotide substitution patterns represented as sequence composition of intergenic DNA. A cornerstone of our method is a Random Forest classifier that outperformed previous distance measure-based approaches, such as the codon adaptation index, in the task of discerning the (highly expressed) ribosomal protein genes by their codon frequencies. Unlike previous reports, we show evidence that translational selection in prokaryotes is practically universal: in 460 of 461 examined microbial genomes, we find that a subset of genes shows a higher codon usage similarity to the ribosomal proteins than would be expected from the local sequence composition. These genes constitute a substantial part of the genome--between 5% and 33%, depending on genome size--while also exhibiting higher experimentally measured mRNA abundances and tending toward codons that match tRNA anticodons by canonical base pairing. Certain gene functional categories are generally enriched with, or depleted of codon-optimized genes, the trends of enrichment/depletion being conserved between Archaea and Bacteria. Prominent exceptions from these trends might indicate genes with alternative physiological roles; we speculate on specific examples related to detoxication of oxygen radicals and ammonia and to possible misannotations of asparaginyl-tRNA synthetases.

Traditionally, new PPIs are identified through biochemical experiments but such methods are labor-intensive, expensive, time-consuming and technically ineffective due to high false positive rates. Sequence-based prediction is currently the most readily applicable and cost-effective method. It exploits known PPI Databases to construct classifiers for predicting unknown PPIs based only on sequence data without requiring any other prior knowledge. Among existing sequence-based methods, most feature-based methods use exact sequence patterns with fixed length as features \u2014 a constraint which is biologically unrealistic. SVM with Pairwise String Kernel renders better predicting performance. However it is difficult to be biologically interpretable since it is kernel-based where no concrete feature values are computed. Here we have developed a novel method WeMine-P2P to overcome these drawbacks. By assuming that the regions/sites that mediate PPI are more conserved, WeMine-P2P first discovers/locates the conserved sequence patterns in protein sequences in the form of Aligned Pattern Clusters (APCs), allowing pattern variations with variable length. It then pairs up all APCs into a set of Co-Occurring APC (cAPC) pairs, and computes a cAPC-PPI score for each cAPC pair on all PPI pairs. It further constructs a feature vector composed of all cAPC pairs with their cAPC-PPI scores for each PPI pair and uses them for constructing a PPI predictor. Through 40 independent experiments, we showed that (1) WeMine-P2P outperforms the well-known algorithm, PIPE2, which also utilizes co-occurring amino acid sequence segments but does not allow variable lengths and pattern variations; (2) WeMine-P2P achieves satisfactory PPI prediction performance, comparable to the SVM-based methods particularly among unseen protein sequences with a potential reduction of feature dimension of 1280\u00d7; (3) Unlike SVM-based methods, WeMine-P2P renders interpretable biological features from which we observed that co-occurring sequence patterns from the compositional bias regions are more discriminative.

Unlike the conventional facial age estimation methods that employ hand-crafted descriptors or holistically learned descriptors for feature representation, our CS-LBFL method learns discriminative local features directly from raw pixels for face representation. Motivated by the fact that facial age estimation is a cost-sensitive computer vision problem and local binary features are more robust to illumination and expression variations than holistic features, we learn a series of hashing functions to project raw pixel values extracted from face patches into low-dimensional binary codes, where binary codes with similar chronological ages are projected as close as possible, and those with dissimilar chronological ages are projected as far as possible. Then, we pool and encode these local binary codes within each face image as a real-valued histogram feature for face representation. Moreover, we propose a cost-sensitive local binary multi-feature learning method to jointly learn multiple sets of hashing functions using face patches extracted from different scales to exploit complementary information.

The classification of retinal images requires an experienced ophthalmologist. This has been a bottleneck to implement routine screenings performed by general physicians. It has been proposed to create automated systems that can perform such task with little intervention from humans, with partial success. In this work, we report advances in such endeavor, by using a Lattice Neural Network with Dendritic Processing (LNNDP). We report results using several metrics, and compare against well known methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP). Our proposal shows better performance than other approaches reported in the literature. An additional advantage is that unlike those other tools, LNNDP requires no parameters, and it automatically constructs its structure to solve a particular problem. The proposed methodology requires four steps: (1) Pre-processing, (2) Feature computation, (3) Classification and (4) Post-processing. The Hotelling T2 control chart was used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector, from 7 that were used before to 5 in this work. The experiments were run on images of DRIVE and STARE databases. The results show that on average, F1-Score is better in LNNDP, compared with SVM and MLP implementations. Same improvement is observed for MCC and the accuracy.

The proposed paradigm builds a binary tree for multiclass SVM, using the technical of portioning by criteria of natural classification: Separation and Homogeneity, with the aim of obtaining optimal tree.

After data preparation, data of 22,763 female patients, mean age 59.4 years, stored in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) breast cancer dataset were analyzed anonymously. IBM SPSS Statistics 16, Access 2003 and Excel 2003 were used in the data preparation and IBM SPSS Modeler 14.2 was used in the model design. Support Vector Machine (SVM) model outperformed other models in the prediction of breast cancer survival. Analysis showed SVM model detected ten important predictor variables contributing mostly to prediction of breast cancer survival. Among important variables, behavior of tumor as the most important variable and stage of malignancy as the least important variable were identified. In current study, applying of the knowledge discovery method in the breast cancer dataset predicted the survival condition of breast cancer patients with high confidence and identified the most important variables participating in breast cancer survival.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4802184", "pubmed_id": "25946945", "doi": "10.5539/gjhs.v7n4p392", "venue": "Global journal of health science", "journal": "Global journal of health science", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1966130221", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["17397981", "67688377", "2019972", "8000223", "6950845", "14110875", "13545404", "63322927", "26050432", "57146809", "13816791", "28700566", "15408337", "6052745", "207198535", "28438586", "11221196", "39973732", "140109802"], "inbound_citations": ["56086825", "42489638", "25217641", "29588398", "210953541", "720866", "54743054", "54201592", "215424911"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2896057"}

The architecture, also known as 1.5-Class (1.5C) classifier, consists of one 2C classifier and two 1C classifiers run in parallel followed by a final 1C classifier. In our system, the first three classifiers are implemented by means of Support Vector Machines (SVM) fed with SPAM features. The outputs of such classifiers are then processed by a final 1C SVM in charge of making the final decision. Particular care is taken to design a proper strategy to train the SVMs the 1.5C classifier relies on. This is a crucial task, due to the difficulty of training the two 1C classifiers at the front end of the system. We assessed the performance of the proposed solution with regard to three manipulation detection tasks, namely image resizing, median filtering and contrast enhancement.

To measure the similarity between two grasslands, a new kernel is proposed as a second contribution: the a-Gaussian mean kernel. It allows to weight the influence of the covariance matrix when comparing two Gaussian distributions. This kernel is introduced in Support Vector Machine for the supervised classification of grasslands from south-west France. A dense intra-annual multispectral time series of Formosat-2 satellite is used for the classification of grasslands management practices, while an inter-annual NDVI time series of Formosat-2 is used for ::: permanent and temporary grasslands discrimination.

We use ::: gestures not only to reinforce meaning, but also to describe the shape of objects, ::: to play games, and to communicate in noisy environments. Vision systems that ::: exploit gestures are often limited by inaccuracies inherent in handcrafted models. ::: These models are generated from a collection of training examples which requires ::: segmentation and alignment. Segmentation in gesture recognition typically involves manual intervention, a time consuming process that is feasible only for a ::: limited set of gestures. Ideally gesture models should be automatically acquired ::: via a learning scheme that enables the acquisition of detailed behavioural knowledge only from topological and temporal observation. ::: The research described in this thesis is motivated by a desire to provide a framework for the unsupervised acquisition and tracking of gesture models. In any ::: learning framework, the initialisation of the shapes is very crucial. Hence, it would ::: be beneficial to have a robust model not prone to noise that can automatically correspond the set of shapes. In the first part of this thesis, we develop a framework ::: for building statistical 2D shape models by extracting, labelling and corresponding ::: landmark points using only topological relations derived from competitive hebbian learning. The method is based on the assumption that correspondences can ::: be addressed as an unsupervised classification problem where landmark points ::: are the cluster centres (nodes) in a high-dimensional vector space. The approach ::: is novel in that the network can be used in cases where the topological structure of ::: the input pattern is not known a priori thus no topology of fixed dimensionality is imposed onto the network. ::: In the second part, we propose an approach to minimise the user intervention ::: in the adaptation process, which requires to specify a priori the number of nodes ::: needed to represent an object, by utilising an automatic criterion for maximum ::: node growth. Furthermore, this model is used to represent motion in image sequences by initialising a suitable segmentation that separates the object of interest ::: from the background. The segmentation system takes into consideration some illumination tolerance, images as inputs from ordinary cameras and webcams, some ::: low to medium cluttered background avoiding extremely cluttered backgrounds, ::: and that the objects are at close range from the camera. ::: In the final part, we extend the framework for the automatic modelling and ::: unsupervised tracking of 2D hand gestures in a sequence of k frames. The aim ::: is to use the tracked frames as training examples in order to build the model and ::: maintain correspondences. To do that we add an active step to the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) network, which we call Active Growing Neural Gas (A-GNG) that ::: takes into consideration not only the geometrical position of the nodes, but also the ::: underlined local feature structure of the image, and the distance vector between ::: successive images. The quality of our model is measured through the calculation ::: of the topographic product. The topographic product is our topology preserving ::: measure which quantifies the neighbourhood preservation. ::: In our system we have applied specific restrictions in the velocity and the appearance of the gestures to simplify the difficulty of the motion analysis in the gesture representation.

Automatic identification of speaker traits and states has a wide range of forensic, commercial and medical applications in real-world scenarios. This thesis proposes a novel approach for automatic estimation of four forensically important components of speaker profiling systems, namely speaker age, height, weight and smoking habit estimations, from spontaneous telephone speech signals. In this method, each utterance is modeled using the i-vector framework which is based on the factor analysis on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) mean supervectors, and the Non-negative Factor Analysis (NFA) framework which is based on a constrained factor analysis on GMM weight supervectors. Then, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) are employed to estimate age, height and weight of speakers from given utterances. Various classification techniques such as ANNs, Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayesian Classifier (NBC), Gaussian Scoring (GS) and Von-Mises-Fisher Scoring (VMF) are also utilized to perform smoking habit detection. Since GMM weights provide complementary information to GMM means, a score-level fusion of the i-vector-based and the NFA-based recognizers is considered for speaker age estimation and smoking habit detection tasks to improve the performance. In addition, inspired from the human learning system in which the related tasks are learned in interaction with each other, a multitask speaker profiling approach is proposed to evaluate the correlated tasks simultaneously, and consequently, to boost the accuracy in speaker age, height, weight and smoking habit estimations. To this end, a hybrid architecture involving the score-level fusion of the i-vector-based and the NFA-based recognizers is proposed. ANNs are then employed to provide an appropriate architecture to share the learned information with all tasks while they are learned in parallel. The proposed method has two major distinctions with the previous speaker profiling approaches. First, information in both GMM means and weights is employed through a score-level fusion of the i-vector-based and the NFA-based recognizers. Second, by applying multitask learning, correlated tasks, which are usually investigated in isolation, are evaluated simultaneously and in interaction with each other. The suggested approach is evaluated on telephone speech signals of National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) 2008 and 2010 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE) corpora.

Moreover, some important patterns are ignored because they are statistically insignificant. In this article, we present a framework that combines Genetic Programming and Inductive Logic Programming to induce knowledge represented in various knowledge representation formalisms from noisy databases. The framework is based on a formalism of logic grammars, and it can specify the search space declaratively.

We compare LOGENPRO with FOIL and other learning systems in detail, and find its performance is significantly better than that of the others. This result indicates that the Darwinian principle of natural selection is a plausible noise handling method that can avoid overfitting and identify important patterns at the same time.

This paper compares two hypo-optimum feature selection and evaluation methods to obtain the best combination of features for continuous identity authentication and monitoring. Experiments show that most of the selected feature parameters (12 out of 14) are real time computable which means these features are suitable for online monitoring.

They are small molecules, approximately 17-25 nucleotides in length, and their high stability in human serum supports their use as novel diagnostic biomarkers of cancer and other pathological conditions. In this study, we analyzed the expression patterns of miR-21 and miR-221 in the serum from a total of 100 Egyptian female subjects with breast cancer, fibroadenoma, and healthy control subjects. Using microarray-based expression profiling followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction validation, we compared the levels of the two circulating miRNAs in the serum of patients with breast cancer (n=50), fibroadenoma (n=25), and healthy controls (n=25). The miRNA SNORD68 was chosen as the housekeeping endogenous control. We found that the serum levels of miR-21 and miR-221 were significantly overexpressed in breast cancer patients compared to normal controls and fibroadenoma patients. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that miR-21 has greater potential in discriminating between breast cancer patients and the control group, while miR-221 has greater potential in discriminating between breast cancer and fibroadenoma patients. Classification models using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), and Random Forests (RF) were developed using expression levels of both miR-21 and miR-221. Best classification performance was achieved by NB Classification models, reaching 91% of correct classification. Furthermore, relative miR-221 expression was associated with histological tumor grades. Therefore, it may be concluded that both miR-21 and miR-221 can be used to differentiate between breast cancer patients and healthy controls, but that the diagnostic accuracy of serum miR-21 is superior to miR-221 for breast cancer prediction. miR-221 has more diagnostic power in discriminating between breast cancer and fibroadenoma patients. The overexpression of miR-221 has been associated with the breast cancer grade.

This paper presents our research work on automatic question classification through machine learning approaches. We have experimented with five machine learning algorithms: Nearest Neighbors (NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Sparse Network of Winnows (SNoW), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) using two kinds of features: bag-of-words and bag-of-ngrams. The experiment results show that with only surface text features the SVM outperforms the other four methods for this task.

However, the field windings and the armature windings are strongly coupled, which makes the inductance characteristics non-linear and too complex to model. The complex model with low precision also leads to difficulties in modeling and analysis of the entire aircraft Electrical Power System (EPS). A behavior level modeling method based on modified inductance Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) inductance data are modified based on the experiment results to improve the precision. A functional level modeling method based on input\u2013output characteristics SVM is also proposed. The two modeling methods are applied to a 9 kW DSEG prototype. The steady state and transient process precision of the proposed methods are proved by comparing with the experiment results. Meanwhile, the modeling time consumption, the application time consumption and the calculation resource demand are compared. The DSEG behavior and functional modeling methods provide precious results with high efficiency, which accelerates theoretical analysis and expands the application foreground of the DSEG in the aircraft EPS.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cja.2018.12.028", "venue": null, "journal": "Chinese Journal of Aeronautics", "mag_id": "2907121645", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126998091"}

Inspired by the previous approach which assigns multi-pseudo labels on the generated data to reduce the risk of over-fitting, we propose to take sparse regularization into consideration.

It is hypothesised that host innate immune response factors are involved in modulating the disease outcome and the expression levels of genes involved in this response could be used as early prognostic markers for disease severity. ::: ::: ::: METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS ::: mRNA expression levels of genes involved in DENV innate immune responses were measured using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Here, we present a novel application of the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm to analyze the expression pattern of 12 genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 28 dengue patients (13 DHF and 15 DF) during acute viral infection. The SVM model was trained using gene expression data of these genes and achieved the highest accuracy of approximately 85% with leave-one-out cross-validation. Through selective removal of gene expression data from the SVM model, we have identified seven genes (MYD88, TLR7, TLR3, MDA5, IRF3, IFN-alpha and CLEC5A) that may be central in differentiating DF patients from DHF, with MYD88 and TLR7 observed to be the most important. Though the individual removal of expression data of five other genes had no impact on the overall accuracy, a significant combined role was observed when the SVM model of the two main genes (MYD88 and TLR7) was re-trained to include the five genes, increasing the overall accuracy to approximately 96%. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE ::: Here, we present a novel use of the SVM algorithm to classify DF and DHF patients, as well as to elucidate the significance of the various genes involved.

Unlike the Bayesian calibration, which is commonly used to estimate the simulation bias, the transfer learning approach discussed in this article involves calculating an artificial neural network surrogate model of the simulations. Assuming that the simulation code correctly predicts the trends in the experimental data but it is subject to unknown biases, we then partially retrain, or transfer learn, the initial surrogate model to match the experimental data. This process eliminates the bias while still taking advantage of the physics relations learned from the simulation. Transfer learning can be easily adapted to a wide range of problems in science and engineering. In this article, we carry out numerical tests to investigate the applicability of this technique to predict the observable outcomes of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments under new conditions. Using our synthetic validation data set, we demonstrate that an accurate predictive model can be built by retraining an initial surrogate model with experimental data volumes so small that they are relevant to the ICF problem.

Satellite images have been widely utilized for various purposes, such as natural environment monitoring (pollution, forest or rivers), transportation improvement and prompt emergency response to disasters. However, the obscurity caused by clouds makes it unstable to monitor the situation on the ground with the visible light camera. Images captured by a longer wavelength are introduced to reduce the effects of clouds. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is such an example that improves visibility even the clouds exist. On the other hand, the spatial resolution decreases as the wavelength increases. Furthermore, the images captured by long wavelengths differs considerably from those captured by visible light in terms of their appearance. Therefore, we propose a network that can remove clouds and generate visible light images from the multispectral images taken as inputs. This is achieved by extending the input channels of cGANs to be compatible with multispectral images. The networks are trained to output images that are close to the ground truth using the images synthesized with clouds over the ground truth as inputs. In the available dataset, the proportion of images of the forest or the sea is very high, which will introduce bias in the training dataset if uniformly sampled from the original dataset. Thus, we utilize the t- Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to improve the problem of bias in the training dataset.

In our previous work [Zhang, Kochhar and Grigorov (2005) Protein Science, 14: 431-444], a machine learning-based method called DescFold was established by using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to combine the following four descriptors: a profile-sequence-alignment-based descriptor using Psi-blast e-values and bit scores, a sequence-profile-alignment-based descriptor using Rps-blast e-values and bit scores, a descriptor based on secondary structure element alignment (SSEA), and a descriptor based on the occurrence of PROSITE functional motifs. In this work, we focus on the improvement of DescFold by incorporating more powerful descriptors and setting up a user-friendly web server.ResultsIn seeking more powerful descriptors, the profile-profile alignment score generated from the COMPASS algorithm was first considered as a new descriptor (i.e., PPA). When considering a profile-profile alignment between two proteins in the context of fold recognition, one protein is regarded as a template (i.e., its 3D structure is known). Instead of a sequence profile derived from a Psi-blast search, a structure-seeded profile for the template protein was generated by searching its structural neighbors with the assistance of the TM-align structural alignment algorithm. Moreover, the COMPASS algorithm was used again to derive a profile-structural-profile-alignment-based descriptor (i.e., PSPA). We trained and tested the new DescFold in a total of 1,835 highly diverse proteins extracted from the SCOP 1.73 version. When the PPA and PSPA descriptors were introduced, the new DescFold boosts the performance of fold recognition substantially. Using the SCOP_1.73_40% dataset as the fold library, the DescFold web server based on the trained SVM models was further constructed. To provide a large-scale test for the new DescFold, a stringent test set of 1,866 proteins were selected from the SCOP 1.75 version. At a less than 5% false positive rate control, the new DescFold is able to correctly recognize structural homologs at the fold level for nearly 46% test proteins. Additionally, we also benchmarked the DescFold method against several well-established fold recognition algorithms through the LiveBench targets and Lindahl dataset.ConclusionsThe new DescFold method was intensively benchmarked to have very competitive performance compared with some well-established fold recognition methods, suggesting that it can serve as a useful tool to assist in template-based protein structure prediction.

And then, we extract geometric features of RGB images using Active Appearance Model (AAM). Combining the HOG texture features with the AAM geometric feature, we build a robust multichannel feature vector for facial expression recognition. On this basis, an improved Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, namely GS-SVM, is used to classify facial expression recognition. The proposed GS-SVM algorithm applies Grid Search method to optimize the best parameters for SVM classifier and estimate the accuracy of each parameter combination in specified range.

The idea is to learn and update a reduced feature space in a supervised way at each iteration of the AL process, thus taking advantage of the increasing labeled information provided by the user. In particular, the computation of the reduced feature space is based on the large-margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) metric learning principle. This strategy is applied in conjunction with $k$ -nearest neighbor ( $k$ -NN) classification, for which a new sample selection strategy is proposed. The methodology is validated experimentally on four benchmark hyperspectral data sets.

Our paper presents two case studies, each utilizing a unique, combined approach of Random Undersampling and Feature Selection to investigate the effect of class imbalance on big data analytics. Random Undersampling is used to generate six class distributions ranging from balanced to moderately imbalanced, and Feature Importance is used as our Feature Selection method. Classification performance was reported for the Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Trees, and Logistic Regression learners, as implemented within the Apache Spark framework. The first case study utilized a training dataset and a test dataset from the ECBDL\u201914 bioinformatics competition. The training and test datasets contain about 32 million instances and 2.9 million instances, respectively. For the first case study, Gradient-Boosted Trees obtained the best results, with either a features-set of 60 or the full set, and a negative-to-positive ratio of either 45:55 or 40:60. The second case study, unlike the first, included training data from one source (POST dataset) and test data from a separate source (Slowloris dataset), where POST and Slowloris are two types of Denial of Service attacks. The POST dataset contains about 1.7 million instances, while the Slowloris dataset contains about 0.2 million instances.

But the most widely used model, Conditional Random Fields (CRF), needs a large amount of manual design features.

However, RNN is rather slow because of the timing dependence between computations and not good at capturing local information of the sentence.

It can be applied in numerous application areas such as medical, remote sensing, computer vision etc. Brain tumor is caused due to formation of abnormal tissues within human brain. Therefore, it is necessary to remove affected tumor part from the brain securely. Among various medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) employs a vital role to generate images of internal parts of human body. Image segmentation is one of the challenging tasks in today\u2019s medical field. An effective segmentation using MRI slices can help to identifying the tumor with its actual size and shape. To meet this requirement, a novel method called Adaptive Convex Region Contour (ACRC) algorithm is presented. Here, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized for slice classification whether it is normal or abnormal. After obtaining SVM results, abnormal slices are involved in segmentation process. Since, human body is having complicated 3D anatomical structure naturally. Unfortunately, MRI slices are yields only 2Dimensional images. The actual shape of tumor cannot be clearly visualized in 2D form. Hence, transformation from 2D to 3D is essential which helps the doctors during surgery. The Rapid Mode Image Matching (RMIM) algorithm has to be followed for 3D reconstruction modeling. After building 3D model, the original volume of the tumor is estimated. The precise experimentation was implemented in MATLAB simulation environment.

These responses then trigger the other party's cycle of internal activation and congruence-seeking response. Effectively, emotional exchange is a spiral of mutual influence.

To detect potential misstatements and fraud, international audit standards demand auditors to directly assess journal entries using 'Computer Assisted AuditTechniques' (CAATs). At the same time, discoveries in deep learning research revealed that machine learning models are vulnerable to 'adversarial attacks'. It also became evident that such attack techniques can be misused to generate 'Deepfakes' designed to directly attack the perception of humans by creating convincingly altered media content. The research of such developments and their potential impact on the finance and accounting domain is still in its early stage. We believe that it is of vital relevance to investigate how such techniques could be maliciously misused in this sphere. In this work, we show an adversarial attack against CAATs using deep neural networks. We first introduce a real-world 'thread model' designed to camouflage accounting anomalies such as fraudulent journal entries. Second, we show that adversarial autoencoder neural networks are capable of learning a human interpretable model of journal entries that disentangles the entries latent generative factors.

Our method explicitly separates the model into the language-shared part and language-specific part to transfer cross-lingual knowledge and improve the monolingual slot tagging, especially for low-resource languages. To refine the shared knowledge, we add a language discriminator and employ adversarial training to reinforce information separation. Besides, we adopt novel multi-level knowledge transfer in an incremental and progressive way to acquire multi-granularity shared knowledge rather than a single layer. To mitigate the discrepancies between the feature distributions of language specific and shared knowledge, we propose the neural adapters to fuse knowledge automatically.

We found that neurons encoding current choice outcomes, outcome prediction errors, and outcome history in their firing rates also carried significant information in their phase-of-firing at a 10-25 Hz beta frequency at which they synchronized across lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and striatum. The phase-of-firing code exceeded information that could be obtained from firing rates alone, was strong for inter-areal connections, and multiplexed information at three different phases of the beta cycle that were offset from the preferred spiking phase of neurons.

Most explanations of this well-known phenomenon rely on prior knowledge in the child of the nounadjective distinction or on the logical priority of nouns as the arguments of predicates. In this paper we examine an alternative account, one which seeks to explain the relative ease of nouns over adjectives in terms of the response of the learner to various properties of the semantic categories to be learned and of the word learning task itself. We isolate four such properties: the relative size and the relative compactness of the regions in representational space associated with the categories, the presence or absence of lexical dimensions in the linguistic context of a word (what color is it? vs. what is it?), and the number of words of a particular type to be learned. In a set of five experiments, we trained a simple connectionist categorization device to label input objects, in particular linguistic contexts, as nouns or adjectives. We show that, for the network, the first three of the above properties favor the more rapid learning of nouns, while the fourth favors the more rapid learning of adjectives. Our experiments demonstrate that the advantage for nouns over adjectives does not require prior knowledge of the distinction between nouns and adjectives and suggest that this distinction may instead emerge as the child learns to associate the different properties of noun and adjective categories with the different morphosyntactic contexts which elicit them.", "year": 1993, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Language and Cognitive Processes", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "15191865", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["181433975", "144597545", "58865362", "147284144", "145178157", "145440147", "7539638", "192952437", "143647996", "26166298", "205117480", "60731136", "14525617", "23789004", "141414708", "62245742", "145608064", "18151933", "146289883", "22517977"], "inbound_citations": ["210171302", "1824408"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9973318"}

The task is making possible significant advances in applications that require deep understanding capabilities such as question-answering engines, dialogue systems, or the semantic web. Due to the huge effort and time consumation of developping extraction systems by domain experts, our approach focuses on machine learning methods that can accurately infer an extraction model by training on a dataset. The goal of this research is to design and implement models with improved performance by learning the combination of different algorithms or by inventing novel structures that are able to exploit kinds of evidence that have not been explored in the literature. ::: A basic component of an IE system is named entity recognition (NER) whose purpose is to locate objects that can be referred by names, belonging to a predefined set of categories. We approach this task by proposing a novel reranking framework that employs two learning phases to pick the ::: best candidate. The task is considered as sequence labelling with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) is selected as the baseline algorithm. Our research employs novel kernels based on structured and unstructured features for reranking the N-best hypotheses from the CRFs baseline. The former features are generated by a polynomial kernel encoding entity features whereas tree kernels are used to model dependencies amongst tagged candidate examples. ::: Relation Extraction (RE) is concerned with finding relationships between pairs of entities in texts. State-of-the-art relation extraction model is based on convolution kernel over the constituent parse tree. In our research, we employ dependency parses from dependency parsing in addition to phrase-structure parses from constituent parsing. We define several variations of dependency parses to inject additional information into the trees. ::: Additionally, we provide an extensive ablation over various types of kernels by combining the tree, sequence, and polynomial kernels. These novel kernels are able to exploit learned correlations between phrase-structure parses and grammatical relations. ::: A large amounts of wide-coverage semantic knowledge today exists in large repositories of unstructured or semi-structured text documents. The increased availability of online collaborative resources has attracted the attention of much work in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. Nevertheless, the ability to extract it using statistical machine learning techniques is hindered by well-known problems such as heavy supervision and scalability. These drawbacks can be alleviated by applying a form of weakly supervision, specifically named distant supervision (DS), to automatically derive explicit facts from the semi-structured part of Wikipedia. ::: To learn relational facts from Wikipedia without any labeled example or hand-crafted pattern, we employ DS where the relation providers are external repositories, e.g., YAGO (a huge semantic knowledge base), and the training instances are gathered from Freebase (a huge semantic database). ::: These allow for potentially obtaining larger training data and many more relations, defined in different sources. We apply state-of-the-art models for ACE RE, that are sentence level RE (SRLE), to Wikipedia. Based on a mapping table of relations from YAGO to ACE (according to their semantic ::: definitions), we design a joint RE model of DS/ACE and tested it on ACE annotations (thus according to expert linguistic annotators). Moreover, we experiment with end-to-end systems for real-world RE applications.

This research paper focuses on the ten required KAs for a project manager or a project to be successful. It aims at applying the Softcomputing modeling techniques to describe the relations between the 47 processes and the KAs. Such a model will enable users to predict the overall competencies of the project management. Thus, it provides an assessment tool to envisage, visualize and indicate the overall performance and competency of a project. The proposed Softcomputing Knowledge Areas Model (SKAM) is a two-stage model. The first stage involves ten models. Each model describes relations between a specific KA and its related processes. The outputs of these ten models will feed into the second stage that will represent the relationship between all the ten KAs and the overall predicted competencies of a project. A combination of Subtractive Clustering and Neurofuzzy modeling techniques are used. Three measures are used to validate the adequacy of the models: the mean average percentage errors, the correlation coefficient and the maximum percentage errors. The highest achieved values for these measures are0.5751, 0.9999 and 4.7283, respectively.

Compared with previous efforts to analyze the CVR outcome, this MSVR-based technique does not depend on selections of control groups or assumptions of any linear relationship between the load and its impact factors.

Specifically, we identified differentially expressed mRNA genes and miRNAs in 103 tumors using the transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas.

Subsequently, we determined 288 and 664 dysregulated TF-miRNA-gene FFLs in SE and NSE, respectively. By constructing dysregulated FFL networks, we found that many hub nodes (12 out of 30 for SE and 8 out of 32 for NSE) in the top ranked FFLs could predict subtype-classification (Random Forest classifier, average accuracy \u226590%).

In this paper, we investigate two popular large-margin classication methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD), under two contexts: the high-dimensional, low-sample size data and the imbalanced data. A unied family of classication machines, the FLexible Assortment MachinE (FLAME) is proposed, within which DWD and SVM are special cases. The FLAME family helps to identify the similarities and dierences between SVM and DWD. It is well known that many classiers overt the data in the high-dimensional setting; and others are sensitive to the imbalanced data, that is, the class with a larger sample size overly inuences the classier and pushes the decision boundary towards the minority class. SVM is resistant to the imbalanced data issue, but it overts high-dimensional data sets by showing the undesired data-piling phenomenon. The DWD method was proposed to improve SVM in the highdimensional setting, but its decision boundary is sensitive to the imbalanced ratio of sample sizes. Our FLAME family helps to understand an intrinsic connection between SVM and DWD, and provides a trade-o between sensitivity to the imbalanced data and overtting the high-dimensional data. Several asymptotic properties of the FLAME classiers are studied.

The human eye strongly reflects the mental state of an individual, such as attention, drowsiness, stress and confusion. In recent times, the automatic identification of such mental states using non-contact eyelid state recognition technology is proving to be a promising avenue for the development of such systems. In the field of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), high accuracy and real-time processing are necessary for detecting driver drowsiness in order to prevent accidents. To develop such a recognition method, we use Higher-order Local Auto-Correlation (HLAC). HLAC can represent the shape feature in images clearly without incurring a high computational cost, and it implements position invariability. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to differentiate between open and closed eyelids on the basis of the HLAC feature. The proposed method can achieve open and closed eyelid recognition rates of 98.77% and 98.98%, respectively.

A simulation framework is introduced, utilizing a two-track dynamics model and a mass-spring model, to simulate the pre-, in- and post-crash phases and automatically generate a large amount of crash data. The data are used to train a Random Forest regression model, capable of estimating the reliability of one crash severity prediction in real-time and thereby, around 105 times faster than with simulations, and with a correlation coefficient of true and predicted reliability values of 0:92.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795911", "venue": "2016 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)", "journal": "2016 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2563361301", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15673667", "52520663", "53556719", "122794686", "108456393", "55031451", "53498920", "8078582", "109838916", "56330330", "89141", "122697410"], "inbound_citations": ["54461566", "160015343", "208210512", "54462702"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18074856"}

To overcome this weakness, we are proposing a novel end-to-end approach for image dehazing, fit for being used as input to an image segmentation procedure, while maintaining the visual quality of the generated images. Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), we propose to optimize the generator by introducing a discriminator network and a loss function that evaluates segmentation quality of dehazed images. In addition, we make use of a supplementary loss function that verifies that the visual and the perceptual quality of the generated image are preserved in hazy conditions.

Previous work assumes the latent space learned by GANs follows a distributed representation but observes the vector arithmetic phenomenon. In this work, we propose a novel framework, called InterFaceGAN, for semantic face editing by interpreting the latent semantics learned by GANs. In this framework, we conduct a detailed study on how different semantics are encoded in the latent space of GANs for face synthesis. We find that the latent code of well-trained generative models actually learns a disentangled representation after linear transformations. We explore the disentanglement between various semantics and manage to decouple some entangled semantics with subspace projection, leading to more precise control of facial attributes. Besides manipulating gender, age, expression, and the presence of eyeglasses, we can even vary the face pose as well as fix the artifacts accidentally generated by GAN models. The proposed method is further applied to achieve real image manipulation when combined with GAN inversion methods or some encoder-involved models.

These approaches have the potential to bring biological insights into microarray studies. A variety of methods have been proposed to construct networks using gene expression data. Because individual pathways do not act in isolation, it is important to understand how different pathways coordinate to perform cellular functions. However, there are no published methods describing how to build pathway clusters that are closely related to traits of interest.ResultsWe propose to build pathway clusters from pathway-based classification methods. The proposed methods allow researchers to identify clusters of pathways sharing similar functions. These pathways may or may not share genes. As an illustration, our approach is applied to three human breast cancer microarray data sets. We found that our methods yielded consistent and interpretable results for these three data sets. We further investigated one of the pathway clusters found using PubMatrix. We found that informative genes in the pathway clusters do have more publications with keywords, like estrogen receptor, compared with informative genes in other top pathways. In addition, using the shortest path analysis in GeneGo's MetaCore and Human Protein Reference Database, we were able to identify the links which connect the pathways without shared genes within the pathway cluster.ConclusionOur proposed pathway clustering methods allow bioinformaticians and biologists to investigate how informative genes within pathways are related to each other and understand possible crosstalk between pathways in a cluster. Therefore, building pathway clusters may lead to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms affecting a trait of interest, and help generate further biological hypotheses from gene expression data.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2335306", "pubmed_id": "18254968", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-9-87", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2062995227", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2133503", "33823772", "2374637", "15255397", "15569265", "13940856", "17023091", "39116639", "33197934", "23027224", "22342439", "21903781", "22279488", "22427101", "3093707", "15588516", "2193579", "12059999", "8529157", "34557183", "29310725", "8612863", "22260147", "37898647", "35213881", "13078644", "23876107", "6049374", "32635739", "1613632", "35233474"], "inbound_citations": ["17163551", "18323222", "8819335", "14484133", "24581245", "13168112", "31925120", "9390749", "8970783", "14340163", "3042597", "21189463", "109937094", "15524291", "14098389", "22003595", "14613940", "11790495", "8552703", "60810426", "2161745", "16568374", "102490826"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13513481"}

In contrast, we propose a generative model that can naturally learn from unsupervised examples, and synthesize training examples for unseen classes purely based on their class embeddings, and therefore, reduce the zero-shot learning problem into a supervised classification task. The proposed approach consists of two important components: (i) a conditional Generative Adversarial Network that learns to produce samples that mimic the characteristics of unsupervised data examples, and (ii) the Gradient Matching (GM) loss that measures the quality of the gradient signal obtained from the synthesized examples.

Accordingly, it has gained great popularity within the pattern recognition field over the past three decades. In this paper, we suggest a new approach for personal identification based on palmprint features extracted using the various methods of fractal theory. These methods have been broadly applied in image processing fields to estimate the fractal dimensions of an image as an important parameter for the analysis of objects of irregular shapes of the texture image. The novelty of this approach is two-fold. On the one hand, we apply the Box counting (BC), the Mass Radius (MS) and the Cumulative Intersection (CumInt) methods to extract the palmprint texture information. On the other hand, the combination of efficient information from the three descriptors has been presented in order to make identification system more efficient and achieve better performances. Then, we explore such texture information features by using classical machine learning techniques: the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Multiclass Random Forest classification algorithms. The results of the experiments conducted on two large datasets show that our proposed method gives better recognition rates of about 96.35% for CASIA-Palmprint dataset and 95.98% for IITD-Touchless-Palmprint dataset.

American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet recognition (i.e. fingerspelling) using marker-less vision sensor is a challenging task due to the difficulties in hand segmentation and appearance variations among signers. Existing color-based sign language recognition systems suffer from many challenges such as complex background, hand segmentation, large inter-class and intra-class variations. In this paper, we propose a new user independent recognition system for American sign language alphabet using depth images captured from the low-cost Microsoft Kinect depth sensor. Exploiting depth information instead of color images overcomes many problems due to their robustness against illumination and background variations. Hand region can be segmented by applying a simple preprocessing algorithm over depth image. Feature learning using convolutional neural network architectures is applied instead of the classical hand-crafted feature extraction methods. Local features extracted from the segmented hand are effectively learned using a simple unsupervised Principal Component Analysis Network (PCANet) deep learning architecture. Two strategies of learning the PCANet model are proposed, namely to train a single PCANet model from samples of all users and to train a separate PCANet model for each user, respectively. The extracted features are then recognized using linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using public dataset of real depth images captured from various users.

They can support individuals with disabilities to independently perform daily living activities, such as drinking, eating, manipulation tasks, and opening doors. An attractive solution is to enable motor impaired users to teach a robot by providing demonstrations of daily living tasks. The user controls the robot \u2018manually\u2019 with an intuitive human-robot interface to provide demonstration, which is followed by the robot learning of the performed task. However, the control of robotic manipulators by motor impaired individuals is a challenging topic. In this paper, a novel head gesture-based interface for hands-free robot control and a framework for robot learning from demonstration are presented. The head gesture-based interface consists of a camera mounted on the user\u2019s hat, which records the changes in the viewed scene due to the head motion. The head gesture recognition is performed using the optical flow for feature extraction and support vector machine for gesture classification. The recognized head gestures are further mapped into robot control commands to perform object manipulation task. The robot learns the demonstrated task by generating the sequence of actions and Gaussian Mixture Model method is used to segment the demonstrated path of the robot\u2019s end-effector. During the robotic reproduction of the task, the modified Gaussian Mixture Model and Gaussian Mixture Regression are used to adapt to environmental changes. The proposed framework was evaluated in a real-world assistive robotic scenario in a small study involving 13 participants; 12 able-bodied and one tetraplegic.

To this end, behind theoretical consideration of the open channel sediment transport through incorporating of four fundamental characteristics of fluid, flow, sediment and channel, recently, machine learning techniques are used for modeling of sediment transport in open channels. However, most of the studies in the literature used limited number of data for model development neglecting some effective parameters involved which may affect their performances. Moreover, most of this studies had not provided a comprehensive explicit equation for future use. Accordingly, this study applied four machine learning techniques of Gene Expression Programming (GEP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Generalized Structure Group Method of Data Handling (GS-GMDH) and Fuzzy c-means based Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (FCM-ANFIS) to model sediment transport in open channels. Four existing data sets in the literature with wide ranges of pipe size, sediment size, sediment volumetric concentration, channel bed slope and flow depth are used for the model development. The recommended models are compared with their corresponding conventional regression models taken from the literature in terms of different statistical performance indices. Results indicate superiority of the machine leaning techniques to the conventional multiple non-linear regression models. Although, developed GEP, ELM, GS-GMDH and FCM-ANFIS models have almost same performances, GS-GMDH gives slightly better performance which can be linked to the generalized structure of this approach.

Ultrasound elastography involves a set of techniques intended to facilitate the noninvasive diagnosis of cancer. Among these, Vibro-elastography is an ultrasound-based technique that employs external mechanical excitation to infer the elastic properties of soft tissue. In this paper, we evaluate the Vibro-elastography performance in the differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions. For this study, a group of 18 women with clinically confirmed tumors or suspected malignant breast lesions were invited to participate. For each volunteer, an elastogram was obtained, and the mean elasticity of the lesion and the adjacent healthy tissue were calculated. After the acquisition, the volunteers underwent core-needle biopsy. The histopathological results allowed to validate the Vibro-elastography diagnosis, which ranged from benign to malignant lesions. Results indicate that the mean elasticity value of the benign lesions, malignant lesions and healthy breast tissue were 39.4 \u00b1 12 KPa, 55.4 \u00b1 7.02 KPa and 23.91 \u00b1 4.57 kPa, respectively. The classification between benign and malignant breast cancer was performed using Support Vector Machine based on the measured lesion stiffness. A ROC curve permitted to quantify the accuracy of the differentiation and to define a suitable cutoff value of stiffness, obtaining an AUC of 0.90 and a cutoff value of 44.75 KPa. The results obtained suggest that Vibro-elastography allows differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. Furthermore, the elasticity values obtained for benign, malignant and healthy tissue are consistent with previous reports.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2293664", "venue": "Medical Imaging", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2794231190", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["10498486", "21440596", "23530565", "32783004", "16405517", "25463708", "13412559", "40009712", "42078568", "42923391", "11922014", "28966129", "10340825", "206747318", "7389", "24810216", "5448990", "207708484", "7759818", "33850420", "25602636", "6377629", "22082302", "46102646", "1309037", "6741030", "33884100", "1244545", "39106499", "17157892"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44096792"}

When there are no labels provided for documents in target domains, it is challenging to effectively transfer knowledge from source domains to target domains. In this paper, we develop a new Genetic Programming (GP) based transfer learning method for document classification, which utilises the evolved GP programs from the source domain to learn a set of weak GP classification models on the target domain with unlabelled documents, which is called self-taught learning.

A key example of such a FI-FM ensemble classification method is the Decision-level Fuzzy Integral Multiple Kernel Learning (DeFIMKL) algorithm, which aggregates the outputs of kernel based classifiers through the use of the Choquet FI with respect to a FM learned through a regularised quadratic programming approach.

In this paper, we take one step ahead and propose a novel transfer learning framework, known as source-selection-free transfer learning (SSFTL), to free users from the need to select source domains. Instead of asking the users for source and target data pairs, as traditional transfer learning does, SSFTL turns to some online information sources such as World Wide Web or the Wikipedia for help. The source data for transfer learning can be hidden somewhere within this large online information source, but the users do not know where they are. Based on the online information sources, we train a large number of classifiers. Then, given a target task, a bridge is built for labels of the potential source candidates and the target domain data in SSFTL via some large online social media with tag cloud as a label translator. An added advantage of SSFTL is that, unlike many previous transfer learning approaches, which are difficult to scale up to the Web scale, SSFTL is highly scalable and can offset much of the training work to offline stage.

Popular traditional methods for individual cattle identification are using plastic ear tags or microchips.

However, in public events and places, users can deploy a network over their connectivity enabled mobile devices to share sentiments at no monetary cost and analyze them to select a service.

This has caused an increase in the average global temperatures by nearly 0.7 \u00b0C due to the greenhouse effect. However, the most prosperous states are the highest emitters of greenhouse gases (especially CO2). This indicates a strong relationship between gaseous emissions and the gross domestic product (GDP) of the states. Such a relationship is highly volatile and nonlinear due to its dependence on the technological advancements and constantly changing domestic and international regulatory policies and relations. To analyse such vastly nonlinear relationships, soft computing techniques has been quite effective as they can predict a compact solution for multi-variable parameters without any explicit insight into the internal system functionalities.

In this paper, we develop a model of Reservoir Computing called Reservoir Parser (ResPars) for learning to parse Natural Language from grounded data coming from humanoid robots. Previous work showed that ResPars is able to do syntactic generalization over different sentences (surface structure) with the same meaning (deep structure). We argue that such ability is key to guide linguistic generalization in a grounded architecture. We show that ResPars is able to generalize on grounded compositional semantics by combining it with Incremental Recruitment Language (IRL). Additionally, we show that ResPars is able to learn to generalize on the same sentences, but not processed word by word, but as an unsegmented sequence of phonemes. This ability enables the architecture to not rely only on the words recognized by a speech recognizer, but to process the sub-word level directly.

The traditional approach uses supervised learning, in which an expert designates which patterns to look for (by specifying the learning task and the class labels), and where to look for them (by specifying the input variables). While appropriate for individual tasks, this approach scales poorly and misses the patterns that we don\u2019t think to look for. Unsupervised feature learning overcomes these limitations by identifying patterns (or features) that collectively form a compact and expressive representation of the source data, with no need for expert input or labeled examples. Its rising popularity is driven by new deep learning methods, which have produced high-profile successes on difficult standardized problems of object recognition in images. Here we introduce its use for phenotype discovery in clinical data. This use is challenging because the largest source of clinical data \u2013 Electronic Medical Records \u2013 typically contains noisy, sparse, and irregularly timed observations, rendering them poor substrates for deep learning methods. Our approach couples dirty clinical data to deep learning architecture via longitudinal probability densities inferred using Gaussian process regression. From episodic, longitudinal sequences of serum uric acid measurements in 4368 individuals we produced continuous phenotypic features that suggest multiple population subtypes, and that accurately distinguished (0.97 AUC) the uric-acid signatures of gout vs. acute leukemia despite not being optimized for the task.

They represent an approach that is quite different from that of classical models based on the structure of Von Neumann machines. Although the term \u201cconnectionist models\u201d often refers to artificial neural network models, which are inspired directly by the biological neurons, there are also other connectionist architectures that differ significantly from this biological exemplar. This thesis describes such a \u201cnovel\u201d connectionist learning architecture based on the technology of optical thin-film multilayer. The proposed connectionist model consists of multiple thin-film layers (similar to simple processing units in a neural network model), each with different refractive index and thickness. A light beam incident perpendicular to the surface of the multilayer stack is used to carry out the required computation. The reflectance of the light incident can be used as the general measurement of the outputs. Inputs can be fed into the system by encoding them into some system parameters such as refractive indices, and individual layer thicknesses can be used as adjustable parameters that are equivalent to the connection weights of a neural network model. Since this approach involves optical signal processing, the proposed connectionist learning architecture has unique properties and could offer significant advantages. Much of the work has focused on developing this new connectionist learning architecture and investigating its capability to accomplish complex computational tasks which have been extensively studied for conventional connectionist models such as the widely used feed-forward neural network using the back-propagation learning by gradient descent. A prototype simulation model has also been built from first principles. A wide range of experiments have been conducted on this simulation model with commonly used data sets from the field of connectionist models.", "year": 1997, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2167658763", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16298121", "7973419"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62357545"}

Methods A corpus of ED admission notes was manually annotated for bleeding ADEs. The notes were taken for patients \u2265 65 years of age who had an ICD-9 code for bleeding, the presence of hemoglobin value \u2264 8 g/dL, or were transfused > 2 units of packed red blood cells. This training corpus was used to develop bleeding ADE algorithms using Random Forest and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). A completely separate set of notes was annotated and used to test the classification performance of the final models using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC). Results The best performing CART resulted in an AUROC on the training set of 0.882. The model's AUROC on the test set was 0.827. At a sensitivity of 0.679, the model had a specificity of 0.908 and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.814. It had a relatively simple and intuitive structure consisting of 13 decision nodes and 14 leaf nodes. Decision path probabilities ranged from 0.041 to 1.0. The AUROC for the best performing Random Forest method on the training set was 0.917. On the test set, the model's AUROC was 0.859. At a sensitivity of 0.274, the model had a specificity of 0.986 and a PPV of 0.92. Conclusion Both models accurately identify bleeding ADEs using the presence or absence of certain clinical concepts in ED admission notes for older adult patients. The CART model is particularly noteworthy because it does not require significant technical overhead to implement.

The IE systems also provide a set of pattern templates that determines the kind of syntactic and semantic constraints to be considered. In this paper, we argue that such pattern templates restricts the kind of extraction patterns that can be learned by IE systems.

In response to the above two issues, a new dynamic rule induction (DRI) method is proposed. Whenever a rule is produced and its related training data instances are discarded, DRI updates the frequency of attribute values that are used to make the next in-line rule to reflect the data deletion. Therefore, the attribute value frequencies are dynamically adjusted each time a rule is generated rather statically as in PRISM. This enables DRI to generate near perfect rules and realistic classifiers.

This paper proposes a feature-based transfer learning method based on distribution similarity that aims at the partial overlap of features between two domains. The non-overlapping features are completed by leveraging the distribution similarity of other features within the source domain. Features of the two domains are then reweighted in accordance with the distribution similarity between the source and target domains. This, in turn, decreases the distribution discrepancy between the two domains, therefore achieving the desired feature transfer.

The weld surfaces produced at different welding condition are captured using digital camera and processed to extract features. The features from weld surface image has been extracted using maximally stable extremal region algorithm and which is used as input for classification of weld joint. The Support Vector Machines is used for classification of weld using features from surface image. Support Vector Machines is trained with different kernel functions and found that linear and quadratic kernel function classify defect weld and good weld with accuracy of 95.8%.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2019.05.018", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "mag_id": "2946134719", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:181854539"}

The accuracy of locating tropical cyclone centers has a large impact on the accuracy of tropical cyclone track prediction. This study focuses on the center location of tropical cyclones in the SAR images. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of the tropical cyclone SAR images, combined with the theory and methods of SAR image segmentation and computer vision, center location methods for both the tropical cyclones with eyes in the SAR images and the tropical cyclones without eyes in the SAR images are presented in this chapter. The main work is as follows: 1, For a tropical cyclone with its eye in the SAR image, The eye area in image appears as black or dark grey area for there being no rain and little wind in the eye area. But the gray level contrast is not always obvious. There may be no complete and clear eye when a tropical cyclone is in the development period or the recession period. The eye area in the tropical cyclone SAR image may appears as light grey area at these periods. So it is necessary to enhance the gray level contrast before image segmentation. Besides, denoising the speckle noise is also necessary for the SAR image processing. A tropical cyclone eye extraction method based on non-local means method and labeled watershed algorithm is given. PPB filter is used to denoise the speckle noise. Then the top-hat transform is used to enhance the contrast. At last the tropical cyclone eye is extracted labeled watershed algorithm. The eye area extracted with this method is computed to compare with the eye area extracted manually. The comparison indicates the accuracy of the extraction accuracy. 2, Generally speaking, the center of the tropical cyclone without its eye is located with template matching method for a single image. The spiral cloud band of the tropical cyclone without its eye is the information can be fully used in the tropical cyclone SAR image. Take the advantage of simple background with little texture information, a center location method of the tropical cyclone without its eye in the SAR image based on feature learning and visual saliency detection is proposed. Spiral cloud bands appear as light and dark spiral structure in the tropical cyclone SAR image, containing rich directional information. Therefore salient region map taking advantage of the gray contrast feature and orientation feature is built. The salient region map makes the spiral cloud bands outstanding and the irrelevant clouds excluded. Then the morphology method is used to extract the spiral bands in the salient region map, the skeleton lines of spiral cloud bands is extracted. At last the tropical cyclone center is estimated with the inflow angle model and the particle swarm optimization algorithm. And the estimation results are compared with the Best Track Data, confirming the validity of the algorithm.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-10-2893-9_8", "venue": "Hurricane Monitoring With Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar", "journal": "Hurricane Monitoring With Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar", "mag_id": "2614997597", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133984377"}

Each of the trees learns a different part of the underlying function relating the dependent variable to the input variables, but the sum of the trees offers a flexible and robust model. Through several benchmark examples, we show that the BACT shows excellent performance. We apply the BACT technique to classify whether firms would be insolvent. This practical example is very important for banks to construct their risk profile and operate successfully.

Companies with a strong consumer focus use data mining. The information getting from datamining is useful to increase revenue and reduce overall costs of the company. It is applied in retail field, financial sector, communication media, and in marketing organizations. Datamining facilitate these companies to determine relationships among company internal factors such as price, product positioning, or staff skills, and external factors such as competition in products, economic indicators, and customer demographics. Ensemble learning is a machine-learning paradigm where multiple models or learners are trained to solve the problem. This research explores the usage of SVM ensemble for Insurance Data Analysis. The number of Insurance firms is increasing day by day. The main objective of this research is to find out the best policy from a given list of Insurance policies. In this research a detailed study of SVM ensemble is done. An insurance dataset obtained from UCI knowledge discovery in Databases Archive is taken in the research analysis. From the dataset five different Non-life insurance policies were selected and used in this research work. The categories of policies include Fire policy, Home policy, Car policy, Kissan policy and Boat policy. AdaBoost, multiclassifier SVM ensemble was created and tested with the insurance dataset. SVM ensemble produces better accuracy than other ensembles. The knowledge flow of SVM ensemble is loaded in Weka. From each category, the policy that gives a highest accuracy value for SVM ensemble is considered to be the best policy. A graphical user interface is also developed using .NET framework, to view the policy output. This system helps the user to find out a best policy from the analysed data.

In order to overcome this issue, application of the popularly used SVM classifier is performed to focus on the need of detecting dangerous weapons. However, PCA is used to explore the usefulness of each feature and reduce the multi dimensional features to simplified features with no underlying hidden structure. In this paper, we take advantage of the simplified features and classifier to categorize images object with the hope to detect dangerous weapons effectively. In order to validate the effectiveness of the SVM classifier, several classifiers are used to compare the overall accuracy and computational speed of the system with the compliment from the features reduction of PCA. These classifiers include Neural Network, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbor methods.

This study investigates if the blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) signal could be used to assess the cardiovascular status of the patient. This on its turn can improve the phenotyping of OSAS patients. SpO 2 signals from 100 OSAS patients, of which half have a known cardiovascular comorbidity, are investigated.

Using these, a Least-squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier reached an accuracy of 76.7 % on separating test set patients according to their cardiac comorbidity status.

Accordingly, we also design a novel attention-guided discriminator which only considers attended regions.

The main contribution of this paper is a procedure for the early detection and differentiation of sugar beet diseases based on Support Vector Machines and spectral vegetation indices. The aim was (I) to discriminate diseased from non-diseased sugar beet leaves, (II) to differentiate between the diseases Cercospora leaf spot, leaf rust and powdery mildew, and (III) to identify diseases even before specific symptoms became visible. Hyperspectral data were recorded from healthy leaves and leaves inoculated with the pathogens Cercospora beticola, Uromyces betae or Erysiphe betae causing Cercospora leaf spot, sugar beet rust and powdery mildew, respectively for a period of 21 days after inoculation. Nine spectral vegetation indices, related to physiological parameters were used as features for an automatic classification. Early differentiation between healthy and inoculated plants as well as among specific diseases can be achieved by a Support Vector Machine with a radial basis function as kernel. The discrimination between healthy sugar beet leaves and diseased leaves resulted in classification accuracies up to 97%.

Consequentely, it is important to adopt economical solutions to replace traditional systems. These considerations led us to use cloud computing to meet large-scale data processing requirements. Meanwhile, this approach provides rapid access to on-demand services with high availability and scalability. Therefore, using cloud services instead of in-house applications would undoubtedly help healthcare organizations outsource computations to an external party, thereby minimizing operating expenses. Nevertheless, strong data protection against both untrusted clouds and unauthorized users is required to prevent malicious data disclosure. Today, various frameworks are developed to enable users to store and process their data using cloud computing. In genaral, they are built up using cryptosystems, distributed systems and sometimes a combination of both. In particular, homomorphic cryptosystems, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) and Secret Share Schemes (SSS) are the major security mechanisms for almost all existing implementations. The main problem in the process of massive data analysis over cloud using these techniques is the computational costs associated with image processing tasks. The first and foremost challenge is to prevent unauthorized access to medical records and personal health information. In this regard, we propose a novel approach based on machnine learing techniques to secure data processing in cloud environement. Typically, we use Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Fuzzy C-means Clustering (FCM) to classify image pixels more efficiently. Additionally, we incorporate a further level, the CloudSec module, into the conventional two layered architecture to reduce the risk of the potential disclosure of medical information. We perform two sets of experiments to evaluate the proposed technique. The simulation results demonstrate that the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) is an efficient concept for simultaneous image segmentation and data protection.

A powerful search method is to look for large jets with accidental substructure due to multiple hard partons falling within a single jet. One way for estimating the background in this search is to exploit an approximate factorization in quantum chromodynamics whereby the jet mass distribution is determined only by its kinematic properties. Traditionally, this approach has been executed using histograms constructed in a background-rich region. We propose a new approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These neural network approaches are naturally unbinned and can be readily conditioned on multiple jet properties. In addition to using vanilla GANs for this purpose, a modification to the traditional WGAN approach has been investigated where weight clipping is replaced with a naturally compact set (in this case, the circle). Both the vanilla and modified WGAN approaches significantly outperform the histogram method, especially when modeling the dependence on features not used in the histogram construction.

The robot\u2019s vision is commonly used to obtain the semantic concepts and relations of objects and rooms in indoor environments, which are labeled semantic information on the map. In an actual indoor environment, because of the great variety of objects and complex arrangements, a key problem is building a semantic map successfully in which the scale of the semantic database is large and the query speed is highly efficient. However, this is often a difficult problem to solve. Combined with cloud technology, the semantic acquisition structure of an environment based on the cloud is constructed by designing a cloud semantic database; the cloud robot can not only obtain the geometric description of the environment but also obtain the semantic map that contains the objects\u2019 relationships based on a rich semantic database of the complex environment. It solves the problems of low-reliability when adding semantic information, errors in updating the map and the lack of scalability in the process of constructing the semantic map. An SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm is used to classify the semantic subdatabase on the foundation of which the feature model database is formed by extracting key feature points based on network text classification.

The deep architecture of CNN then exploits the original and boosted channels down the stream for learning discriminative patterns. Churn prediction in telecom is a challenging task due to high dimensionality and imbalanced nature of the data and it is therefore used to evaluate the performance of the proposed Channel Boosted CNN (CB CNN).

In these studies, fish images are typically collected with the help of scuba divers or autonomous underwater vehicles. These images are then annotated manually by marine biologists. Such a process is certainly a tremendous waste of manpower and material resources. In recent years, the introduction of deep learning has helped making remarkable progress in this area. However, fish image classification can be considered as fine-grained problem, which is more challenging than common image classification, especially with low-quality and small-scale data. Meanwhile, well-known effective convolutional neural networks (CNNs) consistently require a large quantity of high-quality data. This paper presents a new method by improving transfer learning and squeeze-and-excitation networks for fine-grained fish image classification on low-quality and small-scale datasets. Our method enhances data augmentation through super-resolution reconstruction to enlarge the dataset with high-quality images, pre-pretrains, and pretrains to learn common and domain knowledge simultaneously while fine-tuning with professional skill. In addition, refined squeeze-and-excitation blocks are designed to improve bilinear CNNs for a fine-grained classification.

Prediction of the chronological age based on age-dependent changes in the DNAm of specific CpG sites within the genome is one such potential application. Here we present an age-prediction tool for whole blood based on massive parallel sequencing (MPS) and a random forest machine learning algorithm. MPS allows accurate DNAm determination of pre-selected markers and neighboring CpG-sites to identify the best age-predictive markers for the age-prediction tool. 15 age-dependent markers of different loci were initially chosen based on publicly available 450K microarray data, and 13 finally selected for the age tool based on MPS (DDO, ELOVL2, F5, GRM2, HOXC4, KLF14, LDB2, MEIS1-AS3, NKIRAS2, RPA2, SAMD10, TRIM59, ZYG11A). Whole blood samples of 208 individuals were used for training of the algorithm and a further 104 individuals were used for model evaluation (age 18\u201369). In the case of KLF14, LDB2, SAMD10, and GRM2, neighboring CpG sites and not the initial 450K sites were chosen for the final model. Cross-validation of the training set leads to a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 3.21 years and a root-mean square error (RMSE) of 3.97 years. Evaluation of model performance using the test set showed a comparable result (MAD 3.16 years, RMSE 3.93 years). A reduced model based on only the top 4 markers (ELOVL2, F5, KLF14, and TRIM59) resulted in a RMSE of 4.19 years and MAD of 3.24 years for the test set (cross validation training set: RMSE 4.63 years, MAD 3.64 years). The amplified region was additionally investigated for occurrence of SNPs in case of an aberrant DNAm result, which in some cases can be an indication for a deviation in DNAm.

In our pursuit of meeting this challenge, we present a pattern classification model which uses a sparse connection matrix and exploits the mechanism of nonlinear dendritic processing to achieve high classification accuracy. A rate-based structural learning rule for multiclass classification is proposed which modifies a connectivity matrix of binary synaptic connections by choosing the best \u201ck\u201d out of \u201cd\u201d inputs to make connections on every dendritic branch (k<<d), rendering the model well suited for implementation in neuromorphic systems using address-event representation (AER). Further, an ensemble method combining several dendritic classifiers to achieve enhanced generalization leads to two major findings: (1) An ensemble created with classifiers comprising moderate number of dendrites performs better than both ensembles of perceptrons and of complex dendritic trees. (2) In order to determine the moderate number of dendrites required for a specific classification problem, an adaptive approach is proposed which scales the relative size of the dendritic trees of neurons for each class followed by the theoretical capacity calculations used to convert each neuronal dendritic tree to its optimal topology. We show that for the classification of handwritten digits from the benchmark MNIST dataset, our system can achieve accuracy within 1-2% of other reported spike-based classifiers while using much less synaptic resources (only 7%) compared to that used by other methods. Further, an ensemble classifier created with adaptively learned sizes can attain accuracy of 96.4% which is at par with the best reported performance of spike-based classifiers. We also present results of applying our algorithm to classify the MNIST-DVS dataset collected from a real spike-based image sensor and show results comparable to the best reported ones (88.1% accuracy). For VLSI implementations, we show that the reduced synaptic memory can save upto 4X area compared to conventional crossbar topologies. Finally, we also present a biologically realistic spike-based version for calculating the correlations required by the structural learning rule and demonstrate the correspondence between the rate-based and spike-based learning methods.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4814530", "pubmed_id": "27065782", "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2016.00113", "venue": "Front.

In addition, the cost-to-charge ratio is often not reported, and in such cases group average values from similar hospitals are used. In this study we address the problem of estimating the cost-to-charge ratio at the hospital level by utilizing structured regression on a temporal graph of more than 4,000 hospitals, observed over 8 years, constructed from the National Inpatient Sample database. In the proposed approach, the cost-to-charge estimates at individual hospitals for a certain month obtained by an artificial neural network were used as unstructured components in the Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (GCRF) model.

The estimates of cost-to-charge ratio obtained using convex optimization of the GCRF parameters on the constructed graph were much better than those relying on group average based cost-to-charge estimates.

The accuracy of a landslide susceptibility map is affected by false negative and false positive errors which can decrease the reliability of this useful product. In particular, false negative errors, are generally worse in terms of social and economic losses with respect to the losses associated with false positives. In this paper, we present a new technique to improve the accuracy of landslide susceptibility maps using Permanent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) data. The proposed approach uses two different data sets acquired in ascending and descending geometry. The PS velocity measured along the line of sight is re-projected into a new velocity along the steepest slope direction (VSlope). Integration between the LSM and the ground deformation velocity map along the slope was performed using an empirical contingency matrix, which takes into account the average VSlope and the susceptibility degree obtained using the Random Forests algorithm. The Results show that the susceptibility degree increased in 56.41 km2 of the study area.

These systems are in an area of great importance to the healthcare providers. However, classification of large medical database is not an easy task due to unbalance number of training data, intra class variability and inter-class similarities among them. In this thesis, three lassification frameworks are presented to increase the accuracy rate of every individual categories of such database. Bag of Words (BoW) has been explored for image representation techniques in the proposed frameworks. ::: In the first framework, we proposed an iterative filtering scheme on the database where classes with optimal accuracy rate are filtered out. They are then used to construct a new classification model. These processes are carried out in four iterations. As a result, four classification models are generated from different number of classes. These models are then employed to classify unseen test images. ::: In continuation of the first framework, another classification framework is proposed for classes which are left with low accuracy rate after the first iteration. These classes are those with high ratio of intra class variability and inter-class similarities. The classification process is carried out by employing three different annotation techniques, i.e. Annotation by binary classification, Annotation by Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Annotation using top similar images. The annotated keywords produced are integrated by applying ranking similarity. The final annotation keywords were then divided into three levels according to the body region, specific bone structure in body region as well as imaging direction. Different weights were given to each level of the keywords; they are then used to calculate the weightage for each category of medical images based on their ground truth annotation. The weightage computed from the generated annotation of test ::: iii ::: image was compared with the weightage of each category of medical images, and then the test image would be assigned to the category with closest weightage to the test image. ::: In the third framework, the unsupervised latent space model is used in feature extraction to discover patterns of visual co-occurrence. In this direction, we employed PLSA to learn the co-occurrence information between elements in the vector space. PLSA model can generate a robust, high level representation and low-dimensional image representation. This would help to disambiguate visual words. Thus, a classification framework based on integration of PLSA and discriminative Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is developed. In this framework, both visual features and textual features of the images are incorporated by using multi-modal PLSA model. ::: The experimental results on all the above frameworks have shown an increment in accuracy rate at the entire database level as well as at class specific level compared with other methods.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "971314748", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61018487"}

Climate extremes, ecological disturbances, and anthropogenic activities are currently altering the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. As a result, there is a need to improve the monitoring of the terrestrial ecosystem\u2019s and the role of extreme events (i.e. natural and human-induced disturbances) in the biogeochemical cycles for better quantifying regional and global C dynamics. In recent years, there has been an intensive global effort to measure and model carbon dioxide (CO2) exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere. The integration of multiple modeling methods, remote sensing data, climate data, and a global network of eddy-covariance (EC) flux towers has provided unprecedented insights in understanding the mechanisms controlling CO2 fluxes from ecosystem to regional scales. However, current bottom-up approaches do not explicitly account for the effects of site history (e.g. forest age) and the ecological memory effects of both vegetation and climate dynamics on CO2 fluxes. Although most scientists agree on the importance of forest age and ecological memory effects in controlling the CO2 flux variability, there is still a debate about the quantitative role of forest age and ecological memory effects in estimating CO2 fluxes. In my thesis, I explored ways both to integrate forest age as well as ecological memory effects and to quantify their relevance when estimating the spatiotemporal variability of the CO2 fluxes. This was approached from two directions. First, a statistical method based on a combination of climate, ancillary, and EC data was developed to quantify the role of forest age towards the terrestrial net CO2 fluxes. Second, the application of a deep learning (DL) method was explored for understanding the contribution of vegetation and climate\u2019s ecological memory effects on CO2 fluxes. In Chapter 2, I carried-out an observational synthesis to determine to what extent environmental conditions and site history (i.e. forest age) influence the spatiotemporal variability of forest annual net ecosystem production (NEP) across a set of forest EC flux sites globally. The proposed empirical model yielded a substantial capacity for reproducing the spatiotemporal (Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) of 0.62) and across-site variability (NSE of 0.71) of annual forest NEP. By investigating the model structure, I found that forest age was the main driver of NEP spatiotemporal variability in both space and time (decrease in NSE of 0.42 and 0.50 for spatiotemporal and across-site variability, respectively). These results confirmed the importance of forest age in quantifying spatiotemporal variation in NEP using data-driven approaches and paved the way towards further developments in upscaling EC data. Based on the findings of Chapter 2, I provided new global estimates of forest C balance by accounting for both forest age and climate spatial variations (chapter 3). Gridded estimates of forest NEP inferred from a new forest age map and environmental gridded global products (i.e. air temperature, gross primary production, and nitrogen deposition) at 0.5 spatial resolution for the period 2000-2013 were produced. This approach estimated the global forest NEP as a sink of around +50.2 PgC yr-1 and the net biome production (NBP) of forests of around +30.3 PgC yr-1. Forest NBP estimates matched results of independent forest inventories globally, while discrepancies were found at biome level (i.e. temperate, boreal, and tropical regions). Overall, this first attempt to include forest age for estimating the forest C balance globally provided new insights on both the location and the magnitude of the global land C sink. Furthermore, I investigated the relevance of capturing the vegetation and climate temporal properties, the so-called ecological memory effects, for predicting net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at 185 forest and woodland FLUXNET sites (Chapter 4). To answer this question, I used a data-driven DL model that translates the response of net CO2 fluxes to past climate and vegetation fluctuations: Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The findings of the experiments were two folds: (1) an LSTM approach with embedded climate and vegetation ecological memory effects outperforms a non-dynamic statistical model (i.e. Random Forest) and (2) the vegetation mean seasonal cycle embeds most of the information content to realistically explain the spatial and seasonal variations in NEE. To further explore the contribution of vegetation and climate\u2019s temporal dynamic properties to CO2 fluxes globally (Chapter 5), I expanded the approach developed in Chapter 4. A bottom-up approach and a series of experiments provided evidence with respect to the geographical distribution and magnitude of vegetation and climate\u2019s ecological memory effects on NEE for the 2001-2018 period. The spatial patterns of ecological memory effects as well as the controls of the ecosystem properties and climatic conditions on the observed ecological memory effects\u2019 spatial patterns were explored. The results depicted widespread and substantial ecological memory effects across the globe, confirming the importance of explicitly capturing the vegetation and climate temporal properties to accurately reproduce CO2 flux spatiotemporal patterns. Finally, I explored to what degree vegetation and climate\u2019s ecological effects control the biosphere-atmosphere CO2 responses to a specific climate extreme event (i.e. 2018 European heatwave). Chapter 6 summarized the main findings of the thesis and provided additional reflections as well as outlooks for future research. Overall, this thesis strengthened the role of ecosystem history in understanding the biosphere-atmosphere CO2 exchange. Methodologically, my works have demonstrated the potential of new modeling approaches in the Earth system science, such as DL. Yet, the accommodation of new data streams in the presented modeling schemes and the development of new model frameworks are of relevance. Thereby, the potential of integrating new datasets (e.g. biomass time-series, soil moisture) for investigating the control of C stocks and soil moisture stress on CO2 fluxes for providing more reliable global CO2 fluxes products were briefly presented in Chapter 6. In addition, the potential application of a data-driven method (i.e. transfer learning) for overcoming the problem of extrapolation when modeling CO2 fluxes from site to globe was introduced. This chapter also pointed at the design of modeling schemes that are not only data-adaptive but also embed physical ecosystem properties, the so-called hybrid models. Finally, a brief reflection on the feasibility of implementing operational systems for CO2 flux monitoring was provided.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.18174/497385", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2980161739", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210307413"}

Hydrologic data of flash flood events in the Lan-Yang River basin in Taiwan were used for the case study. Various percentages (from 50% to 10%) of hydrologic data, including those for flood stage and rainfall data, were mined and used as informative data to characterize a flood hydrograph. Information on these mined hydrologic data sets was quantified using entropy indices, namely marginal entropy, joint entropy, transinformation, and conditional entropy. Analytical results obtained using the entropy indices proved that the mined informative data could be hydrologically interpreted and have a meaningful explanation based on information entropy. Estimates of marginal and joint entropies showed that, in view of flood forecasting, the flood stage was a more informative variable than rainfall. In addition, hydrologic models with variables containing more total information were preferable to variables containing less total information. Analysis results of transinformation explained that approximately 30% of information on the flood stage could be derived from the upstream flood stage and 10% to 20% from the rainfall.

Recovering a complete image is complicated by the fact that neural representations are noisy, high-dimensional, and contain incomplete information about image details. Thus, reconstructions of complex images from brain activity require a strong prior. Here we propose to train generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn a generative model of images that is conditioned on measurements of brain activity. We consider two challenges of this approach: First, given that GANs require far more data to train than is typically collected in an fMRI experiment, how do we obtain enough samples to train a GAN that is conditioned on brain activity? Secondly, how do we ensure that our generated samples are robust against noise present in fMRI data? Our strategy to surmount both of these problems centers around the creation of surrogate brain activity samples that are generated by an encoding model.

We demonstrate how partial and disorganized\"bifurcation observations\"can be integrated in coherent bifurcation surfaces whose dimensionality and topology/parametrization can be systematically recovered in a data-driven fashion. The approach can be justified through the Whitney and Takens embedding theorems, allowing reconstruction of manifolds/attractors through observations. We discuss extensions to different types of bifurcation observations (not just one-parameter continuation), and show how certain choices of observables create analogies between the observation of bifurcation surfaces and the observation of vector fields.

In this paper, we propose the Sequential Text-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning to build knowledge representations from multiple sentences.

All patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, achromatic standard automated perimetry (SAP) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) imaging with SD-OCT (Cirrus HD-OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, California). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained for all SD-OCT parameters and global indices of SAP. Subsequently, the following MLCs were tested using parameters from the SD-OCT and SAP: Bagging (BAG), Naive-Bayes (NB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Random Forest (RAN), Ensemble Selection (ENS), Classification Tree (CTREE), Ada Boost M1(ADA),Support Vector Machine Linear (SVML) and Support Vector Machine Gaussian (SVMG).

Due to the high variability inherent in satellite data, most of the current object classification approaches are not suitable for handling satellite datasets. The progress of satellite image analytics has also been inhibited by the lack of a single labeled high-resolution dataset with multiple class labels. The contributions of this paper are twofold -- (1) first, we present two new satellite datasets called SAT-4 and SAT-6, and (2) then, we propose a classification framework that extracts features from an input image, normalizes them and feeds the normalized feature vectors to a Deep Belief Network for classification. On the SAT-4 dataset, our best network produces a classification accuracy of 97.95% and outperforms three state-of-the-art object recognition algorithms, namely - Deep Belief Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks and Stacked Denoising Autoencoders by ~11%. On SAT-6, it produces a classification accuracy of 93.9% and outperforms the other algorithms by ~15%.

Four contrasting methods for estimating mean flow, proportion of flow in February, 7-day mean annual low flow, mean annual high flow, the all-time flow duration curve and the February flow duration curve at ungauged sites across New Zealand were compared. The four methods comprised: (1) an uncalibrated national-coverage physically-based rainfall-runoff model (TopNet); (2) data-driven empirical approaches informed by hydrological theory (Hydrology of Ungauged Catchments); (3) a purely empirically-based machine learning regression model (Random Forests); and (4) correction of the TopNet estimates using flow duration curves estimated using Random Forests. Model performance was assessed through comparison with observed data from 485 gauging stations located across New Zealand. Three model performance metrics were calculated: Nash\u2013Sutcliffe Efficiency, a normalised error index statistic (the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data) and the percentage bias. Results showed that considerable gains in TopNet model performance could be made when TopNet time-series were corrected using flow duration curves estimated from Random Forests. This improvement in TopNet performance occurred regardless of two different parameterisations of the TopNet model.

For the first time, we try to solve this question in a fully automated way using a computer-based method. The main goal is to show how the combination of graph-derived metrics with machine learning techniques constitutes a powerful tool for a better characterization and classification of MS clinical profiles. Materials and methods: Sixty-four MS patients (12 Clinical Isolated Syndrome (CIS), 24 Relapsing Remitting (RR), 24 Secondary Progressive (SP), and 17 Primary Progressive (PP)) along with 26 healthy controls (HC) underwent MR examination. T1 and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to obtain structural connectivity matrices for each subject. Global graph metrics, such as density and modularity, were estimated and compared between subjects\u2019 groups. These metrics were further used to classify patients using tuned Support Vector Machine (SVM) combined with Radial Basic Function (RBF) kernel. Results: When comparing MS patients to HC subjects, a greater assortativity, transitivity and characteristic path length as well as a lower global efficiency were found. Using all graph metrics, the best F-Measures (91.8%, 91.8%, 75.6% and 70.6%) were obtained for binary (HC-CIS, CIS-RR, RR-PP) and multi-class (CIS-RR-SP) classification tasks, respectively. When using only one graph metric, the best F-Measures (83.6%, 88.9% and 70.7%) were achieved for modularity with previous binary classification tasks. Conclusion: Based on a simple DTI acquisition associated with structural brain connectivity analysis, this automatic method allowed an accurate classification of different MS patients\u2019 clinical profiles.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5078266", "pubmed_id": "27826224", "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2016.00478", "venue": "Front.

Without detracting from the value of these early investigations, this paper argues that current neural network architectures are too weak to solve anything but toy language problems. Their downfall is the need for 'dynamic inference', in which several pieces of information not previously seen together are dynamically combined to derive the meaning of a novel input. The first half of the paper defines a hierarchy of classes of connectionist models, from categorizers and associative memories to pattern transformers are dynamic inferencers. Some well-known connectionist models that deal with natural language are shown to be either categorizers or pattern transformers. The second half examines in detail a particular natural language problem: prepositional phase attachment. Attaching a PP to an NP changes its meaning, thereby influencing other attachments. So PP attachment requires compositional semantics; and compositionality in non-toy domains requires dynamic inference. Mere pattern transformers cannot learn the PP attachment task without an exponential training set. Connectionist-style computation still has many valuable ideas to offer, so this is not an indictment of connectionisms's potential.

The study is part of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA\u2019s) Driver Monitoring of Inattention and Impairment using Vehicle Equipment (DrIIVE) program. The detection algorithm incorporates time series probabilistic estimation using a Hidden Markov Model, so a drowsiness prediction at any time is dependent on a previous history of observations. Two mitigation methods are designed for testing in the simulation study. One is a three stage audio/visual alert that requires a driver response through a button press. The second is a binary haptic alert that uses a vibrating seat. Additionally, each mitigation will include three varying levels of sensitivity: a nominal model, an over-sensitive model, and an under-sensitive model. These variations will expose drivers to different numbers of false alarms while also potentially missing episodes of drowsiness. Various parameters in the detection algorithm were tested and the vote thresholds of two Random Forest models were selected for variation. It was observed how these parameters affected the output of the detection and mitigation system using previously collected drowsy driving data. Three specific levels were chosen as candidates for the experiment. It is hoped that the study will answer questions about how effective a mitigation system is at changing driving performance, whether drivers willfully ignore the mitigation, and how many alerts are too many.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "936162310", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:106945467"}

To overcome this limitation, we propose MLAT, which covers both alignment and temporal dependencies at the same time. MLAT achieves the alignment effect as well as preserves temporal dependencies by augmenting a given time series using a sliding window. Furthermore, MLAT employs time-invariant metric learning to derive the most appropriate distance measure from the augmented samples which can also capture the temporal dependencies among them well.

Among errors caused by various behaviors, Silent Data Corruption (SDC) error, owing to stealthy destruction without error prompt, is one of the most difficult data consistency problems in the storage system, whether it is a traditional multi-control, distributed storage, or public cloud storage. Nowadays, for SDC error detection, extracting instruction features to analyze vulnerabilities of programs or instructions has still not been fully explored. Literature generally just count the number of possible features, without mining the inter-characteristic of the instruction and correlation between them. Thus, we propose a method of SDC-causing Error Detection based on Support Vector Regression (SED-SVR) for fully exploiting the correlation between data features. Specifically, firstly, we extract instruction features based on the SDC vulnerability of program instructions by analyzing results of fault injections.

Understanding the mechanisms of TMS action and developing biomarkers predicting response remain important goals. We applied a combination of machine learning and electroencephalography (EEG), testing whether machine learning analysis of EEG coherence would (1) predict clinical outcomes in individuals with comorbid MDD and PTSD, and (2) determine whether an individual had received a TMS course. Methods We collected resting-state 8-channel EEG before and after TMS (5 Hz to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). We used Lasso regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to test the hypothesis that baseline EEG coherence predicted the outcome and to assess if EEG coherence changed after TMS. Results In our sample, clinical response to TMS were predictable based on pretreatment EEG coherence ( n = 29). After treatment, 13/29 had more than 50% reduction in MDD self-report score 12/29 had more than 50% reduction in PTSD self-report score. For MDD, area under roc curve was for MDD was 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.69\u20130.94) and for PTSD was 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.54\u20130.87).

We also explore the performance of random forest by way of comparing and contrasting the differences single model methods and ensemble methods in this context. Our work reveals that Random Forest, although not inherently designed to be robust to outliers, substantially outperforms the existing techniques specifically designed to achieve robustness. Indeed, random forest emerges as the best predictively on both real life and simulated data.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1501.00592", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2231649245", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["9061359", "16235752", "17963213", "58447813", "9346690", "10518339", "15303115", "120727315", "14183758", "2914506", "687313", "120672575", "122953110", "16028349", "123086172", "9667765", "18285906", "13990288", "121114451", "13153928", "40937484", "24074746", "14937014", "4419580", "122809100", "33519033", "120565598", "42207433", "129472819", "18463639", "5222721", "18702"], "inbound_citations": ["52478815", "58013600", "60842582", "198997221", "96450192", "54845706", "2930278", "210880306", "215340562", "4363729"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88514531"}

In this paper, we illustrate the utility of applying MKL for the classification of heterogeneous features obtained from UAV data through a case study of an informal settlement in Kigali, Rwanda.

A comparison of seven MKL methods indicates that linearly-weighted kernel combinations based on simple heuristics are competitive with respect to computationally-complex, non-linear kernel combination methods.

The text mining technique has been used to extract the summary terms and trained the classifiers using these terms. About 63 training candidates have been designed by combining seven datasets of Eclipse projects to develop the severity prediction models.

In the framework of associative perceptual learning with indirect supervision, three learning techniques are examined in detail: \u2022 short-term on-line memory-based model learning; \u2022 long-term on-line distribution-based statistical estimation; \u2022 mixed onand off-line continuous learning of gesture models. The three methods proceed within essentially the same framework, consisting of a perceptual sub-system and a sub-system that implements the associative mapping from perceptual categories to actions. The thesis contributes in several areas \u2013 it formulates the framework for solving incremental associative learning tasks; introduces the idea of incremental classification with utility, margin and boundary compression rules; develops a technique of sequence classification with Support Vector Machines; introduces an idea of weak transduction and offers an EM-based algorithm for solving it; proposes a mixed onand off-line algorithm for learning continuous gesture with reward-based decomposition of the state space. The proposed framework facilitates the development of agents and human-computer interfaces that can be trained by a naive user. The work presented in this dissertation focuses on making these incremental learning algorithms practical. Thesis Supervisor: Bruce M.

A not-well-distributed data set is prone to lead to a partial overfitting model. The two approaches proposed in this paper for the binary classification enhance the useful data information by mining negative data. First, error driven compensating hypothesis approach is based on the Support Vector Machines with 1+k times learning, where the base learning hypothesis is iteratively compensated k times. This approach produces a new hypothesis on the new data set in which, each label is a transformation of the label from the negative data set, further produces the child positive and negative data subsets in subsequent iterations. This procedure refines the model created by the base learning algorithm, creating k number of hypotheses over k iterations. A predicting method is also proposed to trace the relationships between the negative subsets and testing data set by vector similarity technique. Second, a statistical negative examples learning approach based on theoretical analysis improves the performance of base learning algorithm learner by creating one or two additional hypothesis audit and booster to mine the negative examples output from the learner. The learner employs a regular support vector machine to classify main examples and recognize which examples are negative. The audit works on the negative training data created by learner to predict whether an instance could be negative. The negative examples are strongly imbalanced. However, boosting learning booster is applied when audit does not have enough accuracy to judge learner correctly. Booster works on the training data subset with which learner and audit do not agree. The classifier for testing is the combination of learner, audit and booster. The classifier for testing a specific instance returns the learner's result if audit acknowledges learner's result and learner agrees with audit's judgment, otherwise returns the booster's result.

However, the object transfiguration task only translates regions containing target objects instead of whole images; most of the existing methods never consider this issue, which results in mistranslation on the backgrounds of images. To address this problem, we present a novel pipeline called Deep Attention Unit Generative Adversarial Networks (DAU-GAN). During the translating process, the DAU computes attention masks that point out where the target objects are. DAU makes GAN concentrate on translating target objects while ignoring meaningless backgrounds. Additionally, we construct an attention-consistent loss and a background-consistent loss to compel our model to translate intently target objects and preserve backgrounds further effectively. We have comparison experiments on three popular related datasets, demonstrating that the DAU-GAN achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art. We also export attention masks in different stages to confirm its effect during the object transfiguration task. The proposed DAU-GAN can translate object effectively as well as preserve backgrounds information at the same time. In our model, DAU learns to focus on the most important information by producing attention masks.

Risk factors associated with fatalities and fractures were identified and predictive models for both fatalities and fractures were developed and their performance was evaluated. Our analysis was based on 188,269 Thoroughbreds that raced on 89 racecourses reporting injuries to the Equine Injury Database (EID) in the US and Canada from 1st January 2009 to 31st December 2015. This included 2,493,957 race starts and 4,592,162 exercise starts. The race starts reported to the EID represented the starts for 90.0% of all official Thoroughbred racing events in the United States and Canada during the 7-year observation period. ::: The annual average risk of fatal and fracture equine injuries for the period 2009 - 2015 was estimated and a description of the different injury types that resulted in fatalities and fractures was given, based on the cases recorded in the EID. ::: Possible risk factors were pre-screened using univariable logistic regression models; risk factors with an association indicated by p < 0.20 were then included in a stepwise logistic regression selection process. A forward bidirectional elimination approach using Akaike's Information Criterion was utilised for the stepwise selection. We identified more than 20 risk factors that were found to be significantly associated with fatal injury (p < 0.05) and more than 20 risk factors associated with fracture injury, across the final multi-variable models. The risk factors identified are related to the horse\u2019s previous racing history, the trainer, the race, the horse's expected performance and the horse's racing history. ::: Five different algorithms were used to develop predictive models based on the data available from the period 2009 - 2014 for both fatal and fracture injuries. Firstly, we used Multivariable Logistic Regression, commonly used in risk factor analysis. Secondly, Improved Balanced Random Forests were developed, a machine learning algorithm based on a modification of the random forests algorithm. Because fatal injuries are extremely rare events, less than 2 instances per 1000 starts on average, balanced samples were used to develop the Random Forest model to deal with the class-imbalance problem. Furthermore, we trained an Artificial Neural Network with a single layer and two networks with deep architecture, a Deep Belief Network and a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder. As artificial neural networks and deep learning models have been successfully used to solve complex problems in a diverse field of domains we wanted to explore the possibility of using them to successfully predict equine injuries. The performance of each classifier was evaluated by calculating the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), using the data available from 2015 for validation. AUC results ranged from 0.62 to 0.64 for the best performing algorithm and similar predictive results were obtained from the wide array of different models created. ::: This is the first study to make use of the extensive information contained in the EID to identify risk factors associated with equine fatal and fracture injuries in the US and Canada for this period. To our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective observational study investigating the risk of equine fatal and fracture injuries during flat racing in the literature. This is also the first study to train logistic regression and machine learning models to predict equine injuries using such an extensive amount of data and a full year of horse racing events for prediction and evaluation. ::: We believe the results could help identify horses at high risk of (fatal) injury on entering a race and inform the design and implementation of preventive measures aimed at minimising the number of Thoroughbreds sustaining fatal injuries during racing in North America.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2745463226", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117302244"}

These peers share their wireless transmission power with other peers so that indirect communication can be possible between nodes that are not in the radio range of each other. The nature of MANETs, such as node mobility, unreliable transmission medium and restricted battery power, makes them extremely vulnerable to a variety of node misbehaviors. Wireless links, for instance, are generally prone to both passive eavesdropping and active intrusion. Another security concern in ad hoc networks is caused by the cooperative nature of the nodes. Attacks from external adversaries may disturb communications, but the external intruder generally cannot directly participate in the cooperative activities among the nodes because they do not possess the proper secure credentials, such as shared keys. However, compromised nodes, which are taken over by an adversary, are capable of presenting the proper secure credentials, and consequently can interfere with almost all of the network operations, including route discovery, key management and distribution, and packet forwarding. Hence, it is essential to cope with node misbehaviors so as to secure mobile ad hoc networks. ::: In this dissertation, we address the question of how to ensure that a MANET will properly operate despite the presence of various node misbehaviors by building a holistic framework that can cope with various node misbehaviors in an intelligent and adaptive manner. The main purpose of this framework is to provide a platform so that the components that identify and respond to misbehaviors can better cooperate with each other and quickly adapt to the changes of network context. Therefore, policies are utilized in our framework in order to make those components correctly function in different network contexts. Besides the policy component, there are three other components, which fulfill the tasks of misbehavior detection, trust management, and context awareness, respectively. To validate and evaluate our proposed framework, we implement our framework based on a simulator. ::: The specific contributions of this dissertation are: (i) Develop a framework to combine the functionalities of surveillance and detection of misbehavior, trust management, context awareness, and policy management to provide a high-level solution to cope with various misbehaviors in MANETs in an intelligent and adaptive manner; (ii) Utilize the outlier detection technique as well as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to detect node misbehaviors, and both techniques do not require a pre-defined fix threshold for misbehavior detection; (iii) Trust is modeled in a vector instead of a single scalar so that it can reflect the trustworthiness of a node in a more accurate manner; (iv) Sense and record various contextual information, such as network status (channel busy/idle, etc.), node status (transmission buffer full/empty, battery full/low, etc.) and environmental factors (altitude, velocity, temperature, weather condition, etc.), so that we can distinguish truly malicious behaviors from faulty behaviors and also more accurately evaluate nodes' trust; (v) Specify and enforce policies in the proposed framework, which makes the framework promptly adapt to the rapidly changing network context.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2299736151", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111715207"}

The ultimate intelligent systems should be able to detect/track suspicious subjects, predict actions and events, and raise alarms for emergencies before happening. From this STIR project, we have created a new algorithmic tool set of modeling spatiotemporal contextual dynamics. For low-level and middle-level visual representation, we proposed a class of Schatten norm based discriminative metrics, locality-constrained low-rank coding, discriminative analysis by multiple principal angles, and clustering based fast low-rank approximation for large scale analysis. We also proposed decomposed contour prior and a stub feature based level set method for shape recognition in images and videos. For high-level understanding and inference, we proposed the ARMA-HMM model for early recognition of human activity and the complex temporal composition model of actionlets for activity prediction.

However, training deep networks such as those based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) requires large labeled data, significant hyper-parameter tuning effort and expertise, and high computational resources. In this work, we investigate as to what extent can transfer learning address these issues when using deep RNNs to model multivariate clinical time series. We consider two scenarios for transfer learning using RNNs: i) domain-adaptation, i.e., leveraging a deep RNN - namely, TimeNet - pre-trained for feature extraction on time series from diverse domains, and adapting it for feature extraction and subsequent target tasks in healthcare domain, ii) task-adaptation, i.e., pre-training a deep RNN - namely, HealthNet - on diverse tasks in healthcare domain, and adapting it to new target tasks in the same domain. We evaluate the above approaches on publicly available MIMIC-III benchmark dataset, and demonstrate that (a) computationally-efficient linear models trained using features extracted via pre-trained RNNs outperform or, in the worst case, perform as well as deep RNNs and statistical hand-crafted features based models trained specifically for target task; (b) models obtained by adapting pre-trained models for target tasks are significantly more robust to the size of labeled data compared to task-specific RNNs, while also being computationally efficient. We, therefore, conclude that pre-trained deep models like TimeNet and HealthNet allow leveraging the advantages of deep learning for clinical time series analysis tasks, while also minimize dependence on hand-crafted features, deal robustly with scarce labeled training data scenarios without overfitting, as well as reduce dependence on expertise and resources required to train deep networks from scratch.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1904.00655", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s41666-019-00062-3", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2994829590", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["11212020", "4900015", "5590763", "5842463", "49567853", "51953582", "14502739", "20071973", "33285731", "6628106", "6502142", "13880", "43680425", "37174872", "5142742", "4404566", "2740197", "740063", "14650762", "9919769", "10641834", "7979241", "18121764", "13675490", "14124313", "5985448", "7961699", "16162039"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:90262239"}

We consider two sets of objects, the \u201crow\u201d and the \u201ccolumn\u201d objects, and we represent these objects by a matrix of numerical values which describe their mutual relationships. We then introduce a new technique, the \u201cPotential Support Vector Machine\u201d (P-SVM), as a large-margin based method for the construction of classifiers and regression functions for the \u201ccolumn\u201d objects. Contrary to standard support vector machine (SVM) approaches, the P-SVM minimizes a scale-invariant capacity measure under a new set of constraints. As a result, the P-SVM can handle data matrices which are neither positive definite nor square, and leads to a usually sparse expansion of the classification boundary or the regression function in terms of the \u201crow\u201d rather than the \u201ccolumn\u201d objects. We introduce two complementary regularization schemes in order to avoid overfitting for noisy data sets. The first scheme improves generalization performance for classification and regression problems, the second scheme leads to the selection of a small and informative set of \u201crow\u201d objects and can be applied to feature selection. A fast optimization algorithm based on the \u201cSequential Minimal Optimization\u201d (SMO) technique is provided. We first apply the new method to two kinds of data representation. The first representation uses a vectorial representation for the \u201crow\u201d and the \u201ccolumn\u201d objects, and constructs a Gram matrix from feature vectors using a kernel function. Benchmark results show, that the P-SVM method is competitive with or provides superior classification and regression results compared to standard methods and has the additional advantage that the kernel functions are no longer restricted to be positive definite.

For hyperspectral data, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a common dimensionality reduction method which removes the correlation between bands by finding the lower dimensional projections of the original data which have maximum variance. However, since PCA does not take class label information into account, it does not always provide the best set of reduced features for class discrimination. Our proposed approach for dimensionality reduction is based on a measure of Mutual Information (MI). Our new algorithm, called MI-PCA, uses a mutual information measure to find those principal components which are spatially most similar to all the target classes. Our MI-PCA approach selects features which contain the most information about the output class structures and are also uncorrelated. We provide both theoretical and experimental analysis of this method in the paper. Experiments were conducted using hyperspectral data with 191 bands, covering the Washington DC area. The results show that 2 features selected out of 191 using MI-PCA provides 98% and 93% classification accuracy for training and test data respectively, with a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. Whereas, to obtain a similar accuracy, the first 5 principle components are needed for a PCA-only approach. We also compared our approach with measuring the mutual information between the original bands and the class labels. However this approach performed poorly compared to our algorithm as the best features selected were all highly correlated with each other and could only provide discrimination between a small subset of the classes.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2214364679", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["15045885", "37196499"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123718303"}

Herein, we report on the successful use of advanced NLP approaches for detecting not only named entities, but entire legal phrases, a skill previously requiring domain knowledge and human expertise. We have utilized the Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) approach that employs hand-engineered features combined with word2vec embeddings trained on legal corpus. Furthermore, to reduce our dependency on hand-engineered features, we have also implemented deep learning architecture comprising of bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and linear chain CRF. Both approaches were benchmarked against a rule-based approach for different types of legal questions.

Bayesian optimization has recently emerged as a de-facto method for this task. The hyperparameter tuning is usually performed by looking at model performance on a validation set. Bayesian optimization is used to find the hyperparameter set corresponding to the best model performance. However, in many cases, where training or validation set has limited set of datapoints, the function representing the model performance on the validation set contains several spurious sharp peaks. The Bayesian optimization, in such cases, has a tendency to converge to sharp peaks instead of other more stable peaks. When a model trained using these hyperparameters is deployed in real world, its performance suffers dramatically. We address this problem through a novel stable Bayesian optimization framework. We construct a new acquisition function that helps Bayesian optimization to avoid the convergence to the sharp peaks. We conduct a theoretical analysis and guarantee that Bayesian optimization using the proposed acquisition function prefers stable peaks over unstable ones.

For copyright protection, the blind digital watermarking schemes with the new machine learning technique ELM-Kernel(KELM) and Reduced Kernel Extreme Learning Machine(RKELM) plus Integer Wavelet Transformation(IWT) and Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) have been proposed. The scheme is composed of three steps, namely, watermark embedding, machine learning phase and finally an extraction of watermark. In the embedding phase, the cover image is transformed into IWT domain, then the HL sub-band has been divided into 4 \u00d7 4 non-overlapping blocks. SVD is applied to each block to get their singular values then these values have been modified by using the Cox\u2019s formula to embed one bit of watermark in one block and a watermarked image is then obtained. During the machine training phase, an ELM-Kernel(KELM) and Reduced Kernel Extreme Learning Machine(RKELM) is trained separately to memorize the relationship between the coefficients of watermarked image and the original cover image. During extraction phase, an oblivious phase, where the original image is not required and the trained machine is used to extract the watermark from the watermarked image. This algorithm aims to minimize the value of BER in order to assess the robustness of the algorithm. Results show that value of BER is very small even watermarked images are subject to attacks like noise, cropping, sharpening, rotation and blurring. The extracted watermarks are shown in the results which has great similarity with the original watermark. Performance of the proposed method is analyzed by the comparative study with some of the existing methods and it demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms these methods in terms of robustness.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jisa.2019.03.005", "venue": "J.

Thus, this study proposes a novel hybrid intelligent method to improve existing forecasting models such as random forest (RF) and artificial neural networks, for higher accuracy. First, the proposed method develops the predictive deep belief network (DBN) to perform short-term wind speed prediction (WSP). Then, the WSP data are transformed into supplementary input features in the prediction process of WPF. Second, owing to its ensemble learning and parallelization, the random forest is used as supervised forecasting model. In addition, a data driven dimension reduction procedure and a weighted voting method are utilized to optimize the random forest algorithm in the training process and the prediction process, respectively. The increasing number of training samples would cause the overfitting problem. Therefore, the k-fold cross validation (CV) technique is adopted to address this issue.

In this work, we propose Randomized Gradient Boosting Machine (RGBM) which leads to significant computational gains compared to GBM, by using a randomization scheme to reduce the search in the space of weak-learners. We derive novel computational guarantees for RGBM. We also provide a principled guideline towards better step-size selection in RGBM that does not require a line search. Our proposed framework is inspired by a special variant of coordinate descent that combines the benefits of randomized coordinate descent and greedy coordinate descent; and may be of independent interest as an optimization algorithm. As a special case, our results for RGBM lead to superior computational guarantees for GBM. Our computational guarantees depend upon a curious geometric quantity that we call Minimal Cosine Angle, which relates to the density of weak-learners in the prediction space.

Therefore, a better understanding of CO 2 solubility mechanisms and its influence on physical properties of crude oil are essential to any effective CO 2 flooding process. In this study, Least-Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) as a newly established soft computing algorithm is applied for developing a new correlative model for CO 2 solubility in both dead and live oil systems. CO 2 solubility in dead oil is basically affected by the oil saturation pressure (P s ), oil specific gravity ( \u03b3 ), oil molecular weight (MW), and reservoir temperature (T). Moreover, the impact of bubble point pressure is considered in constructing the LSSVM model for the live oil. A number of statistical quality measures are utilized to assess and demonstrate the superior capability of the newly developed LSSVM model in comparison with the previous empirically derived correlations. The average absolute relative deviation (AARD) and coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 2.2783% and 0.9933 for the dead oil system, and 1.7432% and 0.9958 for the live oil system, respectively, verify the acceptable accuracy and efficient performance of the proposed LSSVM model over a wide range of dataset used in this study within the range of the used databank. However, the impact of CO 2 liquefaction pressure is ignored, the LSSVM model gives the best result.

Dams, for example, alter the hydrologic and sediment regimes of rivers and can negatively affect riparian areas and deltas. In order to sustainably manage these ecosystems, it is, therefore, essential to assess and monitor the impacts of dams. To this end, site-assessments and in-situ measurements have commonly been used in the past, but these can be laborious, resource demanding and time consuming. Here, we investigated the impact of three dams on the riparian forest of the Nestos River Delta in Greece by employing multi-temporal satellite data. We assessed the evolution in the values of eight vegetation indices over 27 years, derived from 14 dates of Landsat data. We also employed a modelling approach, using a machine learning Random Forests model, to investigate potential linkages between the observed changes in the indices and a host of climatic and terrestrial predictor variables. Our results show that low density vegetation (0\u201325%) is more affected by the construction of the dams due to its proximity to anthropogenic influences and the effects of hydrologic regime alteration. In contrast, higher density vegetation cover (50\u201375%) appears to be largely unaffected, or even improving, due to its proximity to the river, while vegetation with intermediate coverage (25\u201349%) exhibits no clear trend in the Landsat-derived indices. The Random Forests model found that the most important parameters for the riparian vegetation (based on the Mean Decrease Gini and the Mean Decrease Accuracy) were the distance to the dams, the sea and the river.

In the pre-training of neural network, the loss function of distance metric learning is used as a regularization term. With the loss function of distance metric learning, the samples from within-class become closer and that from between-class become farther, which can improve the quasi-linear kernel.

One of the famous preferred system is neural network. This approach has been invented for decades but becomes popular recently due to its satisfied results in many applications. The success of applying neural network involves model training which conventionally uses backpropagation method. However, it has many drawbacks. In recent decades, Extreme learning machine (ELM) was first proposed for training single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN). It optimizes training error by utilizing the whole training dataset with a one-shot calculation. However, for the training in datasets with large number of input features or high-dimensional datasets, original ELM encounters many difficulties. One of them is that the original ELM has no learning process from an input layer. This lead to an incomplete representation of data when it is transferred from one layer to another. Another difficulty involves training instability which causes fluctuation in testing accuracy. This is because networks' input weights are randomly generated. To circumvent these difficulties, the imposing architecture, namely Extended Extreme Learning Machine (X-ELM), is proposed. X-ELM uses ELM as an extension part in order to predict the outputs based on ensemble approach. The proposed framework extends the usage of ELM to apply to more complex network structures, such as networks with multiple hidden layers or networks with multiple computing systems. The proposed framework is applied to vehicles characteristic classifications' datasets.

Based on data from major irrigation systems in the southern Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, a case is made for cost-effective methodology to locate seepage hotspots and quantify seepage losses in channels. In particular, a predictive model was developed based on EM31 survey and direct measured channel seepage data. The main input data for the model were EM values, soil types, water depth in channels, wetted perimeter of channels and whether water is flowing in channels. The output from the model was a seepage loss value in channels. The three different modelling techniques considered were the Generalised Linear Mixed (GLM) model, Random Forest (RF) model and Generalized Boosted Regression Model (GBM), and a best performing model for seepage prediction was identified. The RF model was found to the most reliable, explaining 60% of the variability in the data and with the least mean absolute error.

Context relations are learned during training which capture displacements from all the supervoxels in a video to those belonging to foreground actions. Then, given a testing video, we select a supervoxel randomly and use the context information acquired during training to estimate the probability of each supervoxel belonging to the foreground action. The walk proceeds to a new supervoxel and the process is repeated for a few steps. This \"context walk\" generates a conditional distribution of an action over all the supervoxels.

Over the last 30 years, researchers have tried to overcome the tedious and time consuming manual interpretation of images. With the advent of digital technologies, classification approaches facilitating image interpretation have emerged. They were quickly embraced, and nowadays classification of remote sensing imagery is a mature field with many well-established methods. However, a major yet largely unsolved problem is the design and selection of features, that would be appropriate for a specific classification task. Usually, it is not known in advance which image features would help separating object classes in an optimal way and manual feature by trial and error is still a common practice. In the last decade rapid development of remote sensing sensors gave the end-user access to very high resolution imagery. At a ground sampling distance below a meter, small objects and fine-grained texture of larger objects emerge. Thus, to properly exploit the information that these images contain, additional contextual and textural properties of objects should be extracted. Unfortunately, classification of such images is often performed using features tailored to lowand medium resolution sensors: raw pixel values, usually augmented with either simple band ratios (e.g. in form of vegetation indices), or specific texture filter banks (e.g. Gabor filters). In this thesis we consider the problem of feature design and selection for classification of urban land-cover from very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. To appropriately capture characteristic object patterns, we propose a set of simple and efficient features, called random quasi-exhaustive (RQE) feature bank. It consists of a multitude of multiscale texture features computed efficiently via integral images inside a sliding window. At the same time, we propose to sidestep manual feature selection, and let a boosting classifier choose only those features from a RQE feature bank that are able to efficiently discriminate between different object classes in a specific classification task. We believe that the proposed feature set is fairly generic to many urban remote sensing datasets, such that the features selected by the classifier can be adapted to the characteristics of a certain image: different lighting or different scene structures. We start with presenting the developed framework for supervised classification of land-cover in urban environments. We demonstrate the efficiency of a boosting classifier used in conjunction with the RQE feature databank on five different very high resolution remote sensing datasets. Next, we move from supervised feature learning to unsupervised methods. Using random forest classifier, we investigate the performance of features extracted using data-driven methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or Deep Belief Networks (DBN). We show that, at least in our study, complex unsupervised and non-linear feature learning did not improve classification accuracy over standard linear baseline methods. Finally, we use the developed supervised classification framework for an application in the field of urban hydrology. We produce imperviousness maps, which are then used to model rainfall-runoff processes in urban catchments. We show that the proposed method yields results superior over state-of-the-art methods in the field of urban hydrology. Furthermore, we perform an end-to-end comparison, in which different image data sources produced using different classification methods are used as an input for a hydraulic sewer model.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3929/ethz-a-010414770", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1410022150", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127768991"}

Sentiment analysis, also called opinion mining, is currently one of the most studied research fields which aims to analyse people's opinions. E-commerce websites allow users to share opinions about a product/service by providing textual reviews along with numerical ratings. These opinions greatly influence future consumer purchasing decisions. This paper introduces an innovative computational intelligence framework for efficiently predicting customer review ratings. The framework has been designed to deal with the dimensionality and noise which is typically apparent in large datasets containing customer reviews. The proposed framework integrates the techniques of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and dimensionality reduction, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The performance of the proposed approach returned high accuracy and the results revealed that when large datasets are concerned, only a fraction of the data is needed for creating a system to predict the review ratings of textual reviews. Results from the experiments suggest that the proposed approach yields better prediction performance than other state-of-the-art rating predictors which are based on the conventional Artificial Neural Network, Fuzzy C-Means, and Support Vector Machine approaches. In addition, the proposed framework can be utilised for other classification and prediction tasks, and its neuro-fuzzy predictor module can be replaced by other classifiers.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2016.02.024", "venue": "Appl.

However, the wind power time series always exhibits nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics, which is still with great challenge to be predicted accurately. To overcome the challenge, a Stacked Denoising Auto Encoders (SDAE) based deep learning approach for WPP is proposed in this paper. Firstly, SDAE with three hidden layers is designed to capture the nonlinear and complex characteristics from the reference data sequence, and the optimal initial connection weights of the deep neural network is obtained by the layer-wise pre-training process. Secondly, the back propagation algorithm is applied to fine-tune the weights of the whole network. To achieve the optimal network architecture, the Bat Algorithm (BA) is adopted to identify the number of neurons of the hidden layers for each denoising auto encoder (DAE). Finally, the proposed method is evaluated by the data from a real wind farm and compared with the Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results show that SDAE is with the ability to learn the nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics of wind power data and the WPP Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are reduced by 3.49% and 1.59% in comparison with BPNN and SVM, respectively, which is applicable for practical applications in electric power system.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ciced.2018.8592384", "venue": "2018 China International Conference on Electricity Distribution (CICED)", "journal": "2018 China International Conference on Electricity Distribution (CICED)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2906914645", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["24637170", "17804904", "153803450"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57365083"}

This is also true for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) systems, particularly for data-driven ones. While a perfect system for automatic acquisition of all sorts of knowledge is still far from being realized, partial solutions are possible. This holds especially for lexical data. Nevertheless, the task is not trivial, in particular when dealing with languages rich in inflectional forms like German. Our system is to be used by persons with no specific linguistic knowledge, thus linguistic expertise has been put into the system to ascertain correct classification of words. Classification is done by means of a small rule based system with lexical knowledge and language-specific heuristics.

Distinct domains are typically heterogeneous in language, so that transfer learning techniques are advisable to support knowledge transfer from source to target. Deep neural networks have recently reached the state-of-the-art in many NLP tasks, including in-domain sentiment classification, but few of them involve transfer learning and cross-domain sentiment solutions. This paper moves forward the investigation started in a previous work [1], where an unsupervised deep approach for text mining, called Paragraph Vector (PV), achieved cross-domain accuracy equivalent to a method based on Markov Chain (MC), developed ad hoc for cross-domain sentiment classification. In this work, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is included into the previous investigation, showing that memory units are beneficial for cross-domain when enough training data are available. Moreover, the knowledge models learnt from the source domain are tuned on small samples of target instances to foster transfer learning. PV is almost unaffected by fine-tuning, because it is already able to capture word semantics without supervision. On the other hand, fine-tuning boosts the cross-domain performance of GRU. The smaller is the training set used, the greater is the improvement of accuracy.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-15640-4_1", "venue": "IC3K", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2921248524", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["38234658", "6639821", "215194139", "7363908", "13898083", "8633881", "26573917", "33320463", "990233", "2407601", "14257320", "784094", "5579734", "38302455", "5590763", "14154185", "740063", "12542466", "14688775", "5984940", "1728741", "14508922", "6370030", "3074096", "15874232", "2319779", "1892094", "17526511", "17804904", "18235792", "1915014", "18593743", "16447573", "51873494", "5575601", "6628106", "1957433", "205251479", "56482680", "39870142", "28667777"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88469377"}

However, new photonic technologies appear promising to facilitate and improve the early diagnosis, prognostic and monitoring of personalized therapy. The development of automated diagnostic approaches could assist clinicians in improving the efficiency and quality of health services, but also reduce medical costs. Aims The M3S project aims at improving the diagnosis and prognosis of the CLL pathology by developing a multimodal microscopy platform, including Raman spectrometry, dedicated to the automatic analysis of lymphocytes. Methods Blood smears were prepared on glass slides commonly used in pathology laboratories for microscopy. Two types of sample per patient were prepared: a conventional blood smear and a deposit of \u201cpure\u201d lymphocyte subtypes (i.e. normal B, CLL B, T and NK), sorted out in flow cytometry by using the negative double labeling technique. The second sample is used for the construction of a database of spectral markers specific of these different cell types. The preparations were analyzed with the multimodal machine which combines i) a Raman micro-spectrometer, equipped with a 532nm diode laser excitation source; ii) a microscope equipped with 40x and 150x lenses and a high precision xyz motorized stage for scanning the blood smear, and localizing x-y coordinates of representative series (~100 for each patient) of lymphocyte cells before registering three Raman spectra; these cells of interest being previously localized by an original method based on the morphology analysis. After the Raman acquisitions, the conventional blood smears were submitted to immunolabelling using specific antibodies. For the establishment of the Raman classifiers, this post-acquisition treatment was used as reference to distinguish the different lymphocyte sub-populations. Raman data were then analyzed using chemometric processing and supervised statistical classifiers in order to construct a spectral library of markers highly specific of the lymphocyte type and status (normal or pathological). Results Currently, a total of 60 patients (CLL and healthy) were included in the study. Various classification methods such as LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), PLS-DA (Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis), RF (Random Forest) and SVM (Support Vector Machine), were tested in the purpose to distinguish tumoral B lymphocytes from other cell types. These classification algorithms were combined with feature selection approaches. The best performances were around 70% of correct identification when a three-class model (B-CLL vs B-normal vs T and NK lymphocytes) was considered, and 80% in case of a two-class model (B-CLL vs B-normal lymphocytes). These encouraging results demonstrate the potential of Raman micro-spectroscopy coupled to supervised classification algorithms for leukemic cell classification. The approach can find interest more generally in the field of cyto-hematology. Further developments will concern the integration of additional modality such as Quantitative Phase Imaging on one hand to speed the exploration process of cells of interest to be probed, and on the other hand to extract additional characteristics likely to be informative for CLL diagnosis. In addition, the identification of prognostic markers will be investigated by confronting the photonic data to clinical patient information.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.17629/www.diagnosticpathology.eu-2016-8:189", "venue": null, "journal": "Diagnostic Pathology", "mag_id": "2512736237", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:78235858"}

A traditional way to classify the origin of genes sampled from a pool of mixed cDNA is through sequence similarity to known genes from either the pathogen or host organism or other closely related species. This approach does not work when the identified sequence has no close homologues in the sequence databases. In our previous studies, we classified genes using their codon frequencies. This method, however, explicitly required the prediction of CDS regions and thus could not be applied to sequences composed from the non-coding regions of genes. In this study, we show that the use of sliding-window triplet frequencies extends the application of the algorithm to both coding and non-coding sequences and also increases the prediction accuracy of a Support Vector Machine classifier from 95.6 \u00b1 0.3 to 96.5 \u00b1 0.2. Thus the use of the triplet frequencies increased the prediction accuracy of the new method by more than 20% compared to our previous approach.

Robot learning is often in interaction with or in the vicinity of humans. As a result the learning process needs to be transparent to humans. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been used successfully for robot task learning. However, this learning process is often not transparent to the users. This results in a lack of understanding of what the robot is trying to do and why. The lack of transparency will directly impact robot learning. The expression of emotion is used by humans and other animals to signal information about the internal state of the individual in a language-independent, and even species-independent way, also during learning and exploration. In this article we argue that simulation and subsequent expression of emotion should be used to make the learning process of robots more transparent. We propose that the TDRL Theory of Emotion gives sufficient structure on how to develop such an emotionally expressive learning robot. Finally, we argue that next to such a generic model of RL-based emotion simulation we need personalized emotion interpretation for robots to better cope with individual expressive differences of users.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/taffc.2019.2893348", "venue": null, "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2910369714", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["9166388", "6023746", "1932843", "15238391", "8139497", "18205161", "41183270", "35539012", "144112099", "10543103", "37870878", "14678361", "1045325", "1104128", "7035643", "2705346", "6281465", "4236207", "1045325", "8024583", "171437", "207424217", "16654939", "15303928", "977482", "13028724", "96460146", "15091825", "142543849", "93844814", "147276271", "16547922", "9595783", "14973143", "13355264", "57218155", "16281963", "18437088", "143162686", "144421085", "1261659", "5917069", "145462389", "10073982", "15634692", "5066263", "43935832", "23147079", "6798862", "59809750", "59872172", "207771194", "3347463", "3039686", "9429760", "12524300", "14418847", "16247433", "8311222", "195709516", "30962958", "16503204", "15288363", "900867", "7449640", "145424245", "11223466", "18330567", "15683199", "10889340", "6933296", "750713", "16090732", "2163890"], "inbound_citations": ["209323137", "212676352", "212657371", "209322955"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:96445267"}

The local vehicle trust module uses another SVM-based classifier to evaluate whether the vehicle is credible based on the behavior of the vehicle in terms of message propagation. Then, the TA vehicle trust module uses DST to aggregate multiple trust assessment reports about the same vehicle and derives a comprehensive trust value. Simulation results show that Gaussian kernel best fits our models compared with other functions.

The main intuition is to employ multiple generators, instead of using a single one as in the original GAN. The idea is simple, yet proven to be extremely effective at covering diverse data modes, easily overcoming the mode collapsing problem and delivering state-of-the-art results. A minimax formulation was able to establish among a classifier, a discriminator, and a set of generators in a similar spirit with GAN. Generators create samples that are intended to come from the same distribution as the training data, whilst the discriminator determines whether samples are true data or generated by generators, and the classifier specifies which generator a sample comes from. The distinguishing feature is that internal samples are created from multiple generators, and then one of them will be randomly selected as final output similar to the mechanism of a probabilistic mixture model. We term our method Mixture Generative Adversarial Nets (MGAN). We develop theoretical analysis to prove that, at the equilibrium, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between the mixture of generators\u2019 distributions and the empirical data distribution is minimal, whilst the JSD among generators\u2019 distributions is maximal, hence effectively avoiding the mode collapsing problem. By utilizing parameter sharing, our proposed model adds minimal computational cost to the standard GAN, and thus can also efficiently scale to large-scale datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic 2D data and natural image databases (CIFAR-10, STL-10 and ImageNet) to demonstrate the superior performance of our MGAN in achieving state-of-the-art Inception scores over latest baselines, generating diverse and appealing recognizable objects at different resolutions, and specializing in capturing different types of objects by the generators.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ICLR", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2787223504", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5707386", "9957731", "308212", "122512502", "6104263", "16367617", "5216145", "1033682", "10894094", "326772", "17206794", "5808102", "6628106", "13713980", "18268744", "207763512", "459456", "16489696", "6610705", "15539264", "1059659", "1099052", "11758569", "2930547", "1687220", "206592484", "3350443", "7208970", "57832010", "8317437"], "inbound_citations": ["208332809", "204961274", "209483918", "199001208", "53772404", "211210332", "199543664", "60440345", "52898626", "208268379", "212747939", "199543358", "145815549", "52051184", "102353017", "59553627", "53758121", "53282572", "3662488", "173990598", "208617364", "203626752", "184486827", "208280975", "202780019", "4377863", "202785189", "212673362", "46933230", "207880561", "198341267", "209444217", "53237543", "56208697"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3531476"}

The visual mapping from the target to the source domain is performed using unaligned GANs, resulting in a control policy that can be further improved using imitation learning from imperfect demonstrations.

The system was evaluated on the LIDC-IDRI public dataset of lung nodule images and 100-fold data augmentation was performed to ensure training efficiency. The trained system produced 81% accuracy, 84% sensitivity, and 78% specificity after 300 epochs, better than other available programs. In addition, a t-based confidence interval for the population mean of the validation accuracies verified that the proposed system would produce consistent results for multiple trials. Subsequently, a controlled variable experiment was performed to elucidate the net effects of two core factors of the system - fine-tuned GoogLeNet and MIPs - on its detection accuracy. Four treatment groups were set by training and testing fine-tuned GoogLeNet and Alexnet on MIPs and common 2D CT scans, respectively. It was noteworthy that MIPs improved the network's accuracy by 12.3%, and GoogLeNet outperformed Alexnet by 2%.

Vertical handoff happens when a mobile terminal makes a switch from one network to another (e.g., from WLAN to CDMA 1xRTT). The aim of this work is about determining the circumstances during which the vertical handoff has to be performed. Typically, a mobile user can roam and achieve the vertical handover making use of single criteria, like the Received Signal Strength (RSS). However the decision of single criteria vertical handover, might lead to a handoff that is inefficient, imbalanced network load, and service disruption. For the purpose of improving the accuracy pertaining the vertical handoff decision for use in radio heterogeneous network, this paper presents a Hybrid Particle swarm optimization based Multi criteria Vertical Handoff (HPMVHO) decision algorithm employing multi criteria metrics in the heterogeneous network environment that consists of three network interfaces: (i) Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), (ii) Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), and (iii) Worldwide Interoperability For Microwave Access (WiMAX). In vertical handover decision, the metrics including Received Signal Strength (RSS), Network Throughput, bandwidth available, Power consumption, Expenditure, Security and user choices are taken into consideration. In the HPMVHO decision algorithm proposed, Fuzzy logic is applied for representing the inaccurate information of some of the attributes and user preferences. The Fuzzy logic considers the crucial criteria of the vertical handoff in the form of the input variables and then the handoff decision is made on the basis of the weight values defined. The weight values to every service has to be assigned in accordance with the quality with respect to the services parameters to each of the sensor on the basis of the Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (HPSO). The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) assists in making the prediction for the number-of-users belonging to the after-handoff network that plays the role of a pivotal variable of the HPSO. This algorithm renders precise decision by using reasonable inference for designing the crucial multi criteria and then deciding over efficient decision technique. Finally, examples illustrating the proposed techniques are given, and the sensitivity of the strategies are examined.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5958/2249-7315.2016.01277.6", "venue": null, "journal": "Asian Journal of Research in Social Sciences and Humanities", "mag_id": "2560426444", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126295254"}

The reduction of oxygen (water quality) leads the fish to die and in some cases, may lead to fish diseases. This study correlates Barramundi fish-school behaviour with hunger condition through the hybrid data integration of image processing technique. The behaviour is clustered with respect to the position of the centre of gravity of the school of fish prior feeding, during feeding and after feeding. The clustered fish behaviour is then classified by means of a machine learning technique namely Support vector machine (SVM).

The design, application and implementation of a PPG system are quite inexpensive and have a very easy maintenance. Without having direct contact with the surface of the skin, PPG can easily take the measurements. Therefore, PPG has a good medical competency and due to its widespread availability, it has a lot of advantages. A PPG signal can sometimes be substituted or complemented by an Electrocardiography (ECG) signal as it can provide Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis. In this work, an in-depth analysis of classification of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is done with the help of Capnobase dataset.

However, it becomes more and more difficult for people to understand and evaluate what the general opinion about a particular product in manual way since the number of reviews available increases. Hence, the automatic way is preferred. One of the most popular techniques is using machine learning approach such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this study, we explore the use of Word2Vec model as features in the SVM based sentiment analysis of product reviews in Indonesian language. The experiment result show that SVM can performs well on the sentiment classification task using any model used. However, the Word2vec model has the lowest accuracy (only 0.70), compared to other baseline method including Bag of Words model using Binary TF, Raw TF, and TF.IDF. This is because only small dataset used to train the Word2Vec model.

The method uses a set of models that neither have a fixed functional form nor require a fixed set of parameters, and therefore are capable of capturing the complexities of the charge distribution in great detail. Random Forest regression is used to build separate charge models for elements H, C, N, O, F, S, and Cl, using training data consisting of partial charges along with a description of their surrounding chemical environments; training set charges are generated by fitting to the b3lyp/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) and are subsequently refined to improve consistency and transferability of the charge assignments. Using a set of 210 neutral, small organic molecules, the absolute hydration free energy calculated using these charges in conjunction with Generalized Born solvation model shows a low mean unsigned error, close to 1 kcal/mol, from the experimental data. Using another large and independent test set of chemically diverse organic molecules, the method is shown to accurately reproduce charge-dependent observables--ESP and dipole moment--from ab initio calculations. The method presented here automatically provides an estimate of potential errors in the charge assignment, enabling systematic improvement of these models using additional data.

We aimed at assessing the accuracy of brain FDG-PET in discriminating patients with MCI due to Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls. Sixty-two patients with amnestic MCI and 109 healthy subjects recruited in five centers of the European AD Consortium were enrolled. Group analysis was performed by SPM8 to confirm metabolic differences. Discriminant analyses were then carried out using the mean FDG uptake values normalized to the cerebellum computed in 45 anatomical volumes of interest (VOIs) in each hemisphere (90 VOIs) as defined in the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) Atlas and on 12 meta-VOIs, bilaterally, obtained merging VOIs with similar anatomo-functional characteristics. Further, asymmetry indexes were calculated for both datasets. Accuracy of discrimination by a Support Vector Machine and the AAL VOIs was tested against a validated method (PALZ). At the voxel level SMP8 showed a relative hypometabolism in the bilateral precuneus, and posterior cingulate, temporo-parietal and frontal cortices. Discriminant analysis classified subjects with an accuracy ranging between .91 and .83 as a function of data organization. The best values were obtained from a subset of 6 meta-VOIs plus 6 asymmetry values reaching an area under the ROC curve of .947, significantly larger than the one obtained by the PALZ score. High accuracy in discriminating MCI converters from healthy controls was reached by a non-linear classifier based on SVM applied on predefined anatomo-functional regions and inter-hemispheric asymmetries. Data pre-processing was automated and simplified by an in-house created Matlab-based script encouraging its routine clinical use.

The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm.

On this basis, we employ the second cGAN with a mask to enhance the information of dense structure in the final fused image, while preventing the functional information from being weakened.

Road quality categorization based on machine learning techniques, using real-time opportunistic data gathered from inexpensive open-source inertial systems, is a promising alternative. Existing open-source datasets for this problem are small and less representative of actual situation where data is imbalanced and skewed towards regular road surface instances. With the help of an inexpensive device and data collection platform developed by our lab, we have collected a large, heterogeneous dataset which is more realistic representative of the problem in real world settings. There are four kinds of Roadway Surface Disruptions (RSDs) considered in this work, namely, Cat eyes, Manholes, Potholes and Speed bumps. The feature set used consists of spectral features, time-series peaks, statistical features such as Kurtosis and Skewness and cepstral features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCC). Feature selection was conducted using Sequential Forward Selection and Relief Algorithm. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Random Forest (RF) and Nave Bayes (NB) were used for classification. The best results are reported by SVM with the True Positive Rate (TPR) of 95.2%. These anomaly classification results can be used as a low-cost road maintenance solution by road repairing authorities and the road quality maps thus generated can provide the passengers and drivers with the information of most comfortable route for their journey.

The only assumptions that MPMC makes is that good estimates of means and covariance matrices of the classes exist. However, as with Support Vector Machines, MPMC is computationally expensive and requires extensive cross validation experiments to choose kernels and kernel parameters that give good performance. In this paper we address the computational cost of MPMC by proposing an algorithm that constructs nonlinear sparse MPMC (SMPMC) models by incrementally adding basis functions (i.e. kernels) one at a time \u2013 greedily selecting the next one that maximizes the accuracy bound \u03a9.

Intrusion detection plays an essential role in computer network security since long. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is mainly used to detect an unauthorized access to a computer system or network. Moreover, it is capable to detect all types of malicious and harmful attacks in a network. The drawbacks of existing IDS are it can detect only the known attacks and it produces a large number of false alarms due to the unpredictable behavior of users and networks. It also requires extensive training sets in order to characterize the normal behavior of the nodes. In order to overcome these issues, an integration of Hidden Markov Model (HMM)\u2013Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) algorithm namely, Probabilistic Relevance Classification (PRC) is proposed to detect intrusions in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) network. Here, the power system attack dataset is used to detect the attacks in an SCADA network. In the preprocessing stage, the given data is preprocessed to segregate the relays as R1, R2, R3n and R4. Each relay contains the date, timestamp, control panel log report, relay log report, snort log report, marker, fault location, and load condition information. Then, the Boyer\u2013Moore (BM) technique is employed to perform the string matching operation. After that, the PRC technique is implemented to classify the attack as known or unknown. The novelty of this paper is it manually trains the data and features for unknown attacks. The main intention of this work is to reduce the set of features, amount of database, and to increase the detection rate. The experimental results evaluate the performance in terms of False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), Genuine Acceptance Rate (GA), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, error rate, and recall.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-13-9574-1_3", "venue": "Design Frameworks for Wireless Networks", "journal": "Design Frameworks for Wireless Networks", "mag_id": "2967174506", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201885076"}

Reaping the benefits of edge caching hinges on solving a myriad of challenges such as how, what and when to strategically cache contents subject to storage constraints, traffic load, unknown spatio-temporal traffic demands and data sparsity. Motivated by this, we propose a novel transfer learning-based caching procedure carried out at each small cell base station. This is done by exploiting the rich contextual information (i.e., users' content viewing history, social ties, etc.) extracted from device-to-device (D2D) interactions, referred to as source domain. This prior information is incorporated in the so-called target domain where the goal is to optimally cache strategic contents at the small cells as a function of storage, estimated content popularity, traffic load and backhaul capacity. It is shown that the proposed approach overcomes the notorious data sparsity and cold-start problems, yielding significant gains in terms of users' quality-of-experience (QoE) and backhaul offloading, with gains reaching up to 22% in a setting consisting of four small cell base stations.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1503.05448", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/WIOPT.2015.7151068", "venue": "2015 13th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)", "journal": "2015 13th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1722699250", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["206454719", "1216884", "1079645", "9010762", "14360318", "16226872", "17018647", "8455224", "46439857", "6236568", "6626771", "3711886", "898501", "740063", "1796701", "9768803"], "inbound_citations": ["12123795", "9931536", "67864953", "34087468", "8864245", "77391730", "38803303", "4997255", "119287372", "2421989", "32612724", "30642788", "1560971", "7027246", "51868872", "2656581", "203655609", "16599356", "21536965", "38958784", "211691959", "2777174", "211686414", "212646362", "9176372", "167222333", "67873582", "146121278", "210714153", "21725246", "27864443", "202630274", "894079", "210473356", "118645588", "4568464", "14009842", "61810118", "77437", "3645740", "86790472", "1290185", "207847753", "19476742", "44129757", "208125804", "57377124", "52816888", "53013585", "21456759", "6805380", "3865918", "88485791", "52111174", "34000479", "165163648", "66918371", "67749857", "102504273", "39039843"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1874599"}

To remedy this, we propose a regularization method based on maximum conditional entropy which penalizes peaky distributions and encourages exploration. We also introduce an entropy-based pruning method to dramatically reduce the number of CTC feasible paths by ruling out unreasonable alignments.

Producing very extensive blooms in the world's oceans in both hemispheres, a coccolithophore E. huxleyi is capable of affecting both the marine ecology and carbon fluxes at the atmosphere-ocean interface. At the same time, it is subject to the impact of multiple co-acting environmental forcings, which determine the spatio-temporal dynamics of E. huxleyi blooming phenomenon. To reveal the individual importance of each forcing factor (FF) that is known to significantly control the extent and intensity of E. huxleyi blooms and can be retrieved from remote sensing data, we used long-term spatial time series (1998\u20132016) of sea surface temperature and salinity, incident photosynthetically active radiation, and Ekman layer depth relevant to the marine environments located in the North Atlantic, Arctic and North Pacific oceans, namely the North, Norwegian, Greenland, Labrador, Barents and Bering seas. The FFs retrieved were subjected to statistical analyses. The descriptive statistical approach has shown that E. huxleyi phytoplankton were highly adaptive to the environmental conditions and capable of arising and developing within wide FFs ranges, which proved to be expressly sea-specific. It was also found that there were FFs optimal ranges (also sea-specific), within which the blooms were particularly extensive. The application of the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) approach to each target sea allowed to reliably rank the FFs considered in terms of their role in the spatio-temporal dynamics of E. huxleyi blooms. With the only exception of the Bering Sea, allegedly due to temporally established untypical hydrological conditions, the prediction ability of RFC modeling characterized in terms of precision, recall, and f1-score generally was in excess of 70 %, thus indicating the adequacy of the developed models for FFs prioritization with regard to E. huxleyi blooms.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/bg-2019-104", "venue": null, "journal": "Biogeosciences Discussions", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2931128426", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["121137624", "22536090", "53489923", "54683300", "129312701", "85289372", "129012896", "126517996", "12754074", "3626971", "58683223", "84688855", "127317413", "130006819", "128903448", "55602838", "54859526", "133879364", "135330679", "128241486", "87486096", "84002222", "84925521", "84921998", "8259988", "4683226", "43125112", "82643818", "129024929", "53519106", "40364272", "85716755", "129338500", "32335634", "59585456"], "inbound_citations": ["189977351"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135278460"}

Therefore, image analysis methods are needed for the detection and delineation of breast tumors, which portray crucial morphological information that will support reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we proposed a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) devised to segment a breast tumor within a region of interest (ROI) in a mammogram. The generative network learns to recognize the tumor area and to create the binary mask that outlines it. In turn, the adversarial network learns to distinguish between real (ground truth) and synthetic segmentations, thus enforcing the generative network to create binary masks as realistic as possible. The cGAN works well even when the number of training samples are limited. As a consequence, the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches. Our working hypothesis is corroborated by diverse segmentation experiments performed on INbreast and a private in-house dataset. The proposed segmentation model, working on an image crop containing the tumor as well as a significant surrounding area of healthy tissue (loose frame ROI), provides a high Dice coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 94% and 87%, respectively.

Our experiments in the DARPA Transfer Learning Program demonstrated the potentialities of H2O: given HTNs generated by a machine-learning system, which were much less optimal than an expert would encode, H2O was able to solve problems that SHOP2 could not.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "FLAIRS Conference", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "187499652", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6832395", "118297878", "6552475", "1620482", "1914873", "15166017", "2161139", "8917481", "538251"], "inbound_citations": ["26219262", "19251013", "3179991", "49411150", "5987954", "7466650"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16057654"}

Although HMMs are a natural choice to warp the time axis and model the temporal phenomena in the speech signal, their conditional independence properties limit their ability to model spectral phenomena well. In this paper, a new acoustic modeling paradigm based on augmented conditional random fields (ACRFs) is investigated and developed. This paradigm addresses some limitations of HMMs while maintaining many of the aspects which have made them successful. In particular, the acoustic modeling problem is reformulated in a data driven, sparse, augmented space to increase discrimination. Acoustic context modeling is explicitly integrated to handle the sequential phenomena of the speech signal.

The purpose of this study was to compare the classification performance of linear and nonlinear machine-learning algorithms for the evaluation of thyroid nodules using pathological reports as reference standard. Methods Ethical approval was obtained for this retrospective analysis, and the informed consent requirement was waived. A total of 1179 thyroid nodules (training cohort, n = 700; validation cohort, n = 479) were confirmed by pathological reports or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. The following ultrasonography (US) featu res were measured for each nodule: size (maximum diameter), margins, shape, aspect ratio, capsule, hypoechoic halo, composition, echogenicity, calcification pattern, vascularity, and cervical lymph node status. We analyzed five nonlinear and three linear machine-learning algorithms. The diagnostic performance of each algorithm was compared by using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve. We repeated this process 1000 times to obtain the mean AUC and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Overall, nonlinear machine-learning algorithms demonstrated similar AUCs compared with linear algorithms. The Random Forest and Kernel Support Vector Machines algorithms achieved slightly greater AUCs in the validation cohort (0.954, 95% CI: 0.939\u20130.969; 0.954 95%CI: 0.939\u20130.969, respectively) than other algorithms.

In clinical practices, many factors, such as tumor purity, clonal structure, etc., interfere the performance of calling mutations. The computational pipelines prefer to sensitively report the candidate calls, while a filter is applied for removing the false-positive calls. The existing filters rely on the whole genome/exome sequencing data, which can provide sufficient samples for training the filters. However, the gene-panel sequencing is more popular in clinical practices, but there is no practical filter for limited training samples. In light of this, we develop a semi-learning filter for gene-panel sequencing data, FilterLAP, which implemented via a label propagation framework. Given few labeled samples with a set of unlabeled ones, its basic idea is to predict the label information of unlabeled nodes from the label information of labeled nodes, and establishes a complete graph model by using the relationship between samples, by combining transductive inference with label propagation algorithm. For each node in the network, tags are propagated to adjacent nodes according to similarity and the probability distribution of similar nodes tends to be similar and can be divided into a class. We perform multiple sets of experiments on gene-panel sequencing data captured from Illumina platform. FilterLAP outperforms on both SNV and INDEL filtering, where the AUCs reach 0.90-0.97, and the average accuracies on overall mutation calls are over 90%. Comparing to GATK hard filters, FilterLAP present a 5% improvement on accuracy.

Previous models that attempted to utilize this information usually required the user to input empirical values for critical model parameters, leading to less optimal performance. Multi-view image information is useful for improving classification accuracy, but the methods to assimilate multi-view information to make it usable for context driven models have not been explored in the literature. Here we propose a novel method to exploit the multi-view information for generating class membership probability. Moreover, we develop a new conditional random field model to integrate multi-view information and context information to further improve landcover classification accuracy. This model does not require the user to manually input parameters because all parameters in the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model are fully learned from the training dataset using the gradient descent approach. Using multi-view data extracted from small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), we experimented with Gaussian Mixed Model (GMM), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) classifiers to test model performance. The results showed that our model improved average overall accuracies from 58.3% to 74.7% for the GMM classifier, 75.8% to 87.3% for the RF classifier, 75.0% to 84.4% for the SVM classifier and 80.3% to 86.3% for the DCNN classifier. Although the degree of improvement may depend on the specific classifier respectively, the proposed model can significantly improve classification accuracy irrespective of classifier type.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2018.06.031", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2884408792", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208016912", "52927363", "91184227", "202898449", "109932272", "88487209"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135258537"}

To get rid of interference from spark discharge, a data progressing system containing feature extractions, clustering and recognition technologies is developed. Clustering is realized by extracting five discharge features, including peak factor, form factor, skewness, kurtosis and mean square error. The unsupervised clustering Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) method is used to achieve fast separation for electrostatic discharges and provide training set for pattern recognition. Pattern recognition resorts to Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. For comparison, Back Propagation (BP) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) approaches are taken to test the recognition ability.

In this paper, a novel and generalized classification framework called Style Neutralization Generative Adversarial Classifier (SN-GAC), based on the GAN framework, is introduced to enhance the classification accuracy by neutralizing possible inconsistent style information existing in the original data. In the proposed model, the generator of SN-GAC is trained by mapping the original patterns with certain styles (source) to their style-neutralized or standard counterparts (standard-target), capable of generating the targeted style-neutralized one (generated-target). On the other hand, pairs of both standard (source + standard-target) and generated (source + generated-target) patterns are fed into the discriminator, optimized by not only distinguishing between real and fake, but also classifying the input pairs with correct class label assignment.

Due to the planarity of the linked rigid peptide bonds, these two angles can essentially determine the backbone geometry of proteins. Accordingly, the accurate prediction of protein backbone torsion angle from sequence information can assist the prediction of protein structures. In this study, we develop a new approach called TANGLE (Torsion ANGLE predictor) to predict the protein backbone torsion angles from amino acid sequences. TANGLE uses a two-level support vector regression approach to perform real-value torsion angle prediction using a variety of features derived from amino acid sequences, including the evolutionary profiles in the form of position-specific scoring matrices, predicted secondary structure, solvent accessibility and natively disordered region as well as other global sequence features. When evaluated based on a large benchmark dataset of 1,526 non-homologous proteins, the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of the Phi and Psi angle prediction are 27.8\u00b0 and 44.6\u00b0, respectively, which are 1% and 3% respectively lower than that using one of the state-of-the-art prediction tools ANGLOR. Moreover, the prediction of TANGLE is significantly better than a random predictor that was built on the amino acid-specific basis, with the p-value<1.46e-147 and 7.97e-150, respectively by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. As a complementary approach to the current torsion angle prediction algorithms, TANGLE should prove useful in predicting protein structural properties and assisting protein fold recognition by applying the predicted torsion angles as useful restraints.

Since wavelet transforms generate huge number of features, a dimensionality reduction step is necessary to make the classification and matching steps tractable and computationally feasible. In this paper, two well-known dimensionality reduction algorithms including Laplacian eigenmaps and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are used to reduce the size of feature space. Applying these dimensionality reduction methods not only decreases the computational cost of matching remarkably but also it improves the accuracy of recognition by reducing the unnecessary model complexity. Eventually multiple classification techniques are used in the transformed feature spaces for the final matching and recognition. CASIA datasets for iris and palmprint are used in this study. The experiments show the effectiveness of our feature level fusion method and also the dimensionality reduction methods we used. Based on our experiments, our multimodal biometric system always outperforms the unimodal recognition systems with higher accuracy. Moreover, an appropriate dimensionality reduction algorithm always helps to improve the accuracy of classifier. Finally, the log Gabor filter extracts the most discriminative features from images compared to other wavelet transforms.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CRV.2017.29", "venue": "2017 14th Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV)", "journal": "2017 14th Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2785374190", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11470183", "6679912", "2254081", "108636933", "686110", "2714905", "2552688", "6792954", "6938954", "14076504", "7321405", "3135427", "206769831", "6830633", "1648083", "14879317", "2893463"], "inbound_citations": ["54589889", "215723430"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3302046"}

However, owing to its random and intermittent instincts, a high permeability of wind power into a power network demands accurate and effective wind energy prediction models. This study proposes a multi-stage intelligent algorithm for wind electric power prediction, which combines the Beveridge\u2013Nelson (B-N) decomposition approach, the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), and a newly proposed intelligent optimization approach called the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA). For data preprocessing, the B-N decomposition approach was employed to disintegrate the hourly wind electric power data into a deterministic trend, a cyclic term, and a random component. Then, the LSSVM optimized by the GOA (denoted GOA-LSSVM) was applied to forecast the future 168 h of the deterministic trend, the cyclic term, and the stochastic component, respectively. Finally, the future hourly wind electric power values can be obtained by multiplying the forecasted values of these three trends. Through comparing the forecasting performance of this proposed method with the LSSVM, the LSSVM optimized by the Fruit-fly Optimization Algorithm (FOA-LSSVM), and the LSSVM optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-LSSVM), it is verified that the established multi-stage approach is superior to other models and can increase the precision of wind electric power prediction effectively.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/su10030881", "venue": null, "journal": "Sustainability", "mag_id": "2792041968", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["146803168", "111383153", "115802394", "211103538", "158611706"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:158162724"}

We first describe and analyse an SDN-based traffic flow matching control system that applies a reinforcement learning approach based on Q-learning algorithm in order to maximize the traffic flow granularity.

FAEs have gained importance in biofuel, medicine and food industries due to their capability of acting on a large range of substrates for cleaving ester bonds and synthesizing high-added value molecules through esterification and transesterification reactions. During the past two decades extensive studies have been carried out on the production and partial characterization of FAEs from fungi, while much less is known about FAEs of bacterial or plant origin. Initial classification studies on FAEs were restricted on sequence similarity and substrate specificity on just four model substrates and considered only a handful of FAEs belonging to the fungal kingdom. This study centers on the descriptor-based classification and structural analysis of experimentally verified and putative FAEs; nevertheless, the framework presented here is applicable to every poorly characterized enzyme family. 365 FAE-related sequences of fungal, bacterial and plantae origin were collected and they were clustered using Self Organizing Maps followed by k-means clustering into distinct groups based on amino acid composition and physico-chemical composition descriptors derived from the respective amino acid sequence. A Support Vector Machine model was subsequently constructed for the classification of new FAEs into the pre-assigned clusters. The model successfully recognized 98.2% of the training sequences and all the sequences of the blind test. The underlying functionality of the 12 proposed FAE families was validated against a combination of prediction tools and published experimental data. Another important aspect of the present work involves the development of pharmacophore models for the new FAE families, for which sufficient information on known substrates existed. Knowing the pharmacophoric features of a small molecule that are essential for binding to the members of a certain family opens a window of opportunities for tailored applications of FAEs.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1038/npre.2010.4762.1", "venue": null, "journal": "Nature Precedings", "mag_id": "100417418", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16369321", "214928587", "8267700", "190588", "54666726", "6775377", "6775377", "3269706", "12838819", "215483212", "10997456", "14907579", "5559839", "3850644", "208163920", "208521082", "18882271", "18861171", "215399767", "3849853", "23044305", "17805603"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:80630807"}

The authors describe a method that automatically estimates the reliability of ref- erence heart rates (HRr) derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveforms recorded by vital-signs monitors. The reliability is quantitatively expressed through a quality index (QI) for each HRr. Design: The proposed method estimates the reliability of heart rates from vital-signs monitors by (1) assessing the quality of the ECG and PPG waveforms, (2) separately computing heart rates from these waveforms, and (3) concisely combining this information into a QI that considers the physical redundancy of the signal sources and independence of heart rate calculations. The assessment of the waveforms is performed by a Support Vector Machine classifier and the independent computation of heart rate from the waveforms is performed by an adaptive peak identification technique, termed ADAPIT, which is designed to filter out motion-induced noise. Results: The authors evaluated the method against 158 randomly selected data samples of trauma patients collected during helicopter transport, each sample consisting of 7-second ECG and PPG waveform segments and their associated HRr. They compared the results of the algorithm against manual analysis performed by human experts and found that in 92% of the cases, the algorithm either matches or is more conservative than the human's QI qualification. In the remaining 8% of the cases, the algorithm infers a less conservative QI, though in most cases this was because of algorithm/human disagreement over ambiguous waveform quality.

Conventionally, volume of a brain region was considered to be an anatomical feature and quantified using structural magnetic resonance images. In the present study, however, we have initially proposed to measure the regional brain volumes using fMRI images. Brain volumes measured from fMRI images were denoted as functional volumes, which quantified the volumes of brain regions that were actually functioning during fMRI imaging. We compared the predictive power of functional volumes with that of regional brain volumes measured from anatomical images, which were denoted as anatomical volumes. The former demonstrated higher discriminative power than the latter for the classification of ADHD patients vs. TDCs. Combined with our two-step feature selection algorithm, our SVM classification model using functional volumes achieved a balanced accuracy of 67.7%, which was 16.1% higher than that of a relevant model published previously (Sato, Hoexter, Fujita, & Rohde, 2012). Furthermore, our classifier highlighted 10 brain regions that were most discriminative in distinguishing between ADHD patients and TDCs.

In this context, it is important to develop new pattern recognition methods and improve its accuracy in order to support the analysis of these huge volume of data. In particular, a valuable information of the genomic sequences is its nucleotides organization. This work presents an effective feature extraction approach for genomic sequences from complex networks, which is based on mapping the genomic sequences in its representation as complex networks. The nodes of the networks are defined by the combination of nucleotides, dinucleotides or trinucleotides within the sequence by adopting the parameters: Word Size (W S) and Step (ST). The edges are estimated by observing the respective adjacency among the nucleotides in the genomic sequence. These complex network measures are extracted and adopted in order to generate a feature vector for each genomic sequence. For each biological sequence, the entropy, sum of entropy and its maximum value are also adopted. A dataset containing 3 different genomic sequences: coding, intergenic and TSS (Transcriptional Starter Sites) were adopted in order to evaluate the proposed approach. The results were obtained by the following classification methods: Random Forest with 91.2%, followed by J48 with 89.1% and SVM with 84.8% of accuracy without including any source of a priori information, i.e., considering only the genomic sequences.

For these and other applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider \"similar.\" For instance, we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given examples of similar (and, if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in \u211dn, learns a distance metric over \u211dn that respects these relationships.

However, batch learning Neural Networks (NN), one of the most common approximators, has been rarely applied to RL. In this paper, possible reasons for this are laid out and a solution is proposed. Specifically, a Receding Horizon Cache (RHC) structure is designed to collect training data for NN by dynamically archiving state-action pairs and actively updating their Q-values, which makes batch learning NN much easier to implement.

This method enables us to recognize famous places, buildings, monuments, and other landmarks in user photos. The main challenge lies in the fact that it's very complicated to give a precise definition of what is and what is not a landmark. Some buildings, statues and natural objects are landmarks; others are not. There's also no database with a fairly large number of landmarks to train a recognition model. A key feature of using landmark recognition in a production environment is that the number of photos containing landmarks is extremely small. This is why the model should have a very low false positive rate as well as high recognition accuracy. We propose a metric learning-based approach that successfully deals with existing challenges and efficiently handles a large number of landmarks. Our method uses a deep neural network and requires a single pass inference that makes it fast to use in production. We also describe an algorithm for cleaning landmarks database which is essential for training a metric learning model. We provide an in-depth description of basic components of our method like neural network architecture, the learning strategy, and the features of our metric learning approach. We show the results of proposed solutions in tests that emulate the distribution of photos with and without landmarks from a user collection. We compare our method with others during these tests.

However, the existing NE based methods in spatial domain just employ single type of features for data representation, ignoring the compensatory information among multiple image features, resulting in bias in high resolution (HR) face image reconstruction. To tackle such problem, this paper presents a novel Multiple feature Learning model with Hierarchical Structure (MLHS) for face hallucination. Compared with conventional NE based methods, the proposed MLHS makes full use of multi-level information of face images, which can effectively remedy the flaw caused by just using single type of spatial pixel features, and adopts hierarchical structure to better maintain the manifold consistency hypothesis between the HR and low resolution (LR) patch spaces. The multiple learning strategy and hierarchical structure admit the proposed MLHS to well reconstruct the face details such as eyes, nostrils and mouth. The validity of the proposed MLHS method is confirmed by the comparison experiments in some public face databases.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2019.06.017", "venue": "Inf.

The ability to predict service performance can be viewed as an important added-value, one that can help users or third-part applications select the proper online service provider. With this aim in view, we have designed a measurement system and deployed it in eleven provinces and cities in China to monitor two popular websites, Youku and Tudou. The analysis indicates that the performance trend of these two service providers followed daily changing patterns, such as rush hour traffic and lower service workloads at midnight; this is consistent with user behaviors. It was also confirmed that the future performance was related to the historical records.

In addition, a hybrid model, which is generated by combining different machine learning models, is also studied as the baseline. An investigation shows that time series models are much more suitable to this prediction problem than baseline models in most situations.

Keeping in mind the end goal to accomplish it a noteworthy exertion must be put into screening programs and particularly into computerized screening programs. Diabetic retinopathy screening includes breaking down of the retina into blood vessels, optic disk, and exudates. The recognition of changes in vein structure because of vessel narrowing and blockages in veins is of extraordinary significance. Vein division is the fundamental establishment while creating retinal screening frameworks since vessels serve as one of the primary retinal historic point features. The venture exhibits a robotized strategy for improvement and division of veins in retinal images. An image processing algorithm that utilizes 2-D Gabor wavelet for vessel improvement because of their capacity to upgrade directional structures and classifier known as Support Vector Machine has been used. Hence, an automated system is built up to diagnose diabetes at an early stage.

This paper selected Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang as three cities from the Jingjinji Region for the study to come up with a new model of collaborative forecasting using Support Vector Regression (SVR) for Urban Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction in China. The present study is aimed to improve the forecasting results by minimizing the prediction error of present machine learning algorithms by taking into account multiple city multi-dimensional air quality information and weather conditions as input. The results show that there is a decrease in MAPE in case of multiple city multi-dimensional regression when there is a strong interaction and correlation of the air quality characteristic attributes with AQI.

By tracking the faces of casual walkers on more than 40 hours of egocentric video, we are able to cover tens of thousands of different identities and automatically extract nearly 5 million pairs of images connected by or from different face tracks, along with their weather and location context, under pose and lighting variations. These image pairs are then fed into a deep network that preserves similarity of images connected by the same track, in order to capture identity-related attribute features, and optimizes for location and weather prediction to capture additional facial attribute features. Finally, the network is fine-tuned with manually annotated samples. We perform an extensive experimental analysis on wearable data and two standard benchmark datasets based on web images (LFWA and CelebA).

In the past, many different types of features have been extracted (using both linear and nonlinear strategies) for classification problems. On the one hand, some approaches have exploited the original spectral information or other features linearly derived from such information in order to have classes which are linearly separable. On the other hand, other techniques have exploited features obtained through nonlinear transformations intended to reduce data dimensionality, to better model the inherent nonlinearity of the original data (e.g., kernels) or to adequately exploit the spatial information contained in the scene (e.g., using morphological analysis). Special attention has been given to techniques able to exploit a single kind of features, such as composite kernel learning or multiple kernel learning, developed in order to deal with multiple kernels. However, few approaches have been designed to integrate multiple types of features extracted from both linear and nonlinear transformations. In this paper, we develop a new framework for the classification of hyperspectral scenes that pursues the combination of multiple features. The ultimate goal of the proposed framework is to be able to cope with linear and nonlinear class boundaries present in the data, thus following the two main mixing models considered for hyperspectral data interpretation. An important characteristic of the presented approach is that it does not require any regularization parameters to control the weights of considered features so that different types of features can be efficiently exploited and integrated in a collaborative and flexible way. Our experimental results, conducted using a variety of input features and hyperspectral scenes, indicate that the proposed framework for multiple feature learning provides state-of-the-art classification results without significantly increasing computational complexity.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2014.2345739", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2041100636", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16008390", "62165049", "7993309", "16485432", "10893255", "10355395", "128848964", "64543020", "14495716", "29580629", "13284902", "7443466", "206688766", "10913825", "6906514", "26985497", "8909227", "25566901", "12821772", "14580622", "60633363", "1404751", "118639142", "16327957", "14173829", "5927350", "14293639", "41699975", "20180884", "11061993"], "inbound_citations": ["202888938", "189970134", "53233396", "199136198", "20850283", "29588647", "12854429", "11133773", "210721143", "3825668", "3408395", "195778756", "44095716", "59307433", "204940822", "23659454", "3693618", "127221845", "213579071", "12917263", "13970970", "50778953", "206910359", "86514293", "21828862", "42054387", "1253982", "199114677", "16327517", "49551582", "125381778", "9098358", "202931246", "9060540", "46772602", "53788514", "51614408", "12408263", "84186970", "57755864", "14893757", "59234674", "832044", "22833918", "49653826", "199018495", "28328275", "191159989", "4331966", "21327808", "210973703", "4880412", "42593833", "210965928", "191184049", "6611907", "9605204", "53230457", "6313726", "104293208", "52115220", "156054098", "21732148", "21245572", "209938799", "16729278", "49651992", "19262144", "52106580", "22677105", "1993158", "9393629", "196622677", "56172092", "132257563", "51870835", "212647521", "195565671", "3046524", "199489027", "24700944", "31521473", "20775644", "12056789", "21234154", "27631627", "67175264", "15812978", "19216104", "52111228", "208882529", "2376950", "211687999", "4316275", "24992843", "23394432", "50780417", "11965785", "40132269", "19749805", "58013453", "53233998", "8816235", "6209405", "25389737", "1525786", "210971115", "26731133", "54436965", "23178476", "209979565", "115142866", "125374516", "53099248", "4277234", "126543593", "67872726", "53208640", "37992828", "204765013", "125953171", "5191153", "22481931", "17237645", "53484300", "7100514", "25015744", "134136774", "4933382", "52107266", "19984061", "304215", "24541101", "127616255", "203655495", "33939905", "67750620", "24782425", "37089428", "104293053", "22209205", "208039584", "46752605", "10398275", "41973144", "197489108", "71151317", "57012581", "13366893", "13500095", "20582613", "52162806", "51870338", "19730356", "3481325", "13759473", "9862370", "35382151", "35382151", "35382151", "203614342", "11761837", "5734593", "19542611", "19542611", "3661078", "15889254", "202564706", "21210960", "2950207", "1124713", "146074069", "45757271", "69492504", "125528647", "3455779"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4629520"}

The dataset is obtained from the SIMAP-Information system for the European public procurement website, which is comprised of tenders described in XML files. The dataset was preprocessed using tokenization, removal of stop words, removal of punctuation marks etc. We implemented a neural machine learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) nodes for text generation and subsequent code classification. Text generation means that given a single line or just two or three words of the title, the model generates the sequence of a whole sentence. After generating the title, the model predicts the main applicable CPV code for that title. The LSTM model reaches an accuracy of 97% for the text generation and 95% for code classification using Support Vector Machine(SVM). This experiment is a first step towards developing a system that based on TED data is able to auto-generate and code classify tender documents, easing the process of creating and disseminating tender information to TED and ultimately relevant vendors.

We demonstrate that a hierarchical, multivariate, statistical machine learning algorithm, namely Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) can address Big Data challenges to drive decision making. The challenge of this study is lack of interoperability since the data, a collection of GIS shapefiles, remotely sensed imagery, and aggregated and interpolated spatio-temporal information, are stored in monolithic hardware components. For the modelling process, it was necessary to create one common input file. By merging the data sources together, a structured but noisy input file, showing inconsistencies and redundancies, was created. Here, it is shown that BRT can process different data granularities, heterogeneous data and missingness. In particular, BRT has the advantage of dealing with missing data by default by allowing a split on whether or not a value is missing as well as what the value is. Most importantly, the BRT offers a wide range of possibilities regarding the interpretation of results and variable selection is automatically performed by considering how frequently a variable is used to define a split in the tree. A comparison with two similar regression models (Random Forests and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, LASSO) shows that BRT outperforms these in this instance. BRT can also be a starting point for sophisticated hierarchical modelling in real world scenarios. For example, a single or ensemble approach of BRT could be tested with existing models in order to improve results for a wide range of data-driven decisions and applications.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4236/ojs.2017.75061", "venue": null, "journal": "Open Journal of Statistics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2766570310", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["90400110", "3975928", "117114892", "16036351", "7955044", "32396035", "62973643", "14669208", "16190154", "9214016", "53403127", "214975415", "1113678", "118736216", "60993494", "140617669", "2941443", "12852360", "2708071", "123001831", "44635588"], "inbound_citations": ["52278611", "58625967"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:173171640"}

Then, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique was applied to select the best features to reduce the dimension. Finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was used to distinguish between \"oil slicks\" and \"look-alikes oil slicks\" and verify the validity of the extracted features. Experiments were performed on the different datasets, and the results proved that the accuracy of recognition is improved with Curvelet transform. In addition, compared with other neural network algorithms, Curvelet transform is an effective way to extract a reduced set of discriminative features for SAR images.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/icitbs.2019.00143", "venue": "2019 International Conference on Intelligent Transportation, Big Data & Smart City (ICITBS)", "journal": "2019 International Conference on Intelligent Transportation, Big Data & Smart City (ICITBS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2923175878", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8553422", "12342689", "25934814", "111105602", "49650980", "196639818", "1775739", "37237747", "31118230"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85502634"}

{"paper_id": "6900341", "title": "Artificial Neural Network methods applied to sentiment analysis", "authors": [{"first": "Sebastian", "middle": [], "last": "Ebert", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Sentiment Analysis (SA) is the study of opinions and emotions that are conveyed by text. This field of study has commercial applications for example in market research (e.g., \u201cWhat do customers like and dislike about a product?\u201d) and consumer behavior (e.g., \u201cWhich book will a customer buy next when he wrote a positive review about book X?\u201d). A private person can benefit from SA by automatic movie or restaurant recommendations, or from applications on the computer or smart phone that adapt to the user\u2019s current mood. ::: In this thesis we will put forward research on artificial Neural Network (NN) methods applied to SA. Many challenges arise, such as sarcasm, domain dependency, and data scarcity, that need to be addressed by a successful system. ::: In the first part of this thesis we perform linguistic analysis of a word (\u201chard\u201d) under the light of SA. We show that sentiment-specific word sense disambiguation is necessary to distinguish fine nuances of polarity. Commonly available resources are not sufficient for this. ::: The introduced Contextually Enhanced Sentiment Lexicon (CESL) is used to label occurrences of \u201chard\u201d in a real dataset with its sense. That allows us to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with deep learning features that predicts the polarity of a single occurrence of the word, just given its context words. We show that the features we propose improve the result compared to existing standard features. Since the labeling effort is not negligible, we propose a clustering approach that reduces the manual effort to a minimum. ::: The deep learning features that help predicting fine-grained, context-dependent polarity are computed by a Neural Network Language Model (NNLM), namely a variant of the Log-Bilinear Language model (LBL). By improving this model the performance of polarity classification might as well improve. Thus, we propose a non-linear version of the LBL and the vectorized Log-Bilinear Language model (vLBL), because non-linear models are generally considered more powerful. In a parameter study on a language modeling task, we show that the non-linear versions indeed perform better than their linear counterparts. However, the difference is small, except for settings where the model has only few parameters, which might be the case when little training data is available and the model therefore needs to be smaller in order to avoid overfitting. ::: An alternative approach to fine-grained polarity classification as used above is to train classifiers that will do the distinction automatically. Due to the complexity of the task, the challenges of SA in general, and certain domain-specific issues (e.g., when using Twitter text) existing systems have much room to improve. Often statistical classifiers are used with simple Bag-of-Words (BOW) features or count features that stem from sentiment lexicons. We introduce a linguistically-informed Convolutional Neural Network (lingCNN) that builds upon the fact that there has been much research on language in general and sentiment lexicons in particular. lingCNN makes use of two types of linguistic features: word-based and sentence-based. Word-based features comprise features derived from sentiment lexicons, such as polarity or valence and general knowledge about language, such as a negation-based feature. Sentence-based features are also based on lexicon counts and valences. The combination of both types of features is superior to the original model without these features. Especially, when little training data is available (that can be the case for different languages that are underresourced), lingCNN proves to be significantly better (up to 12 macro-F1 points). ::: Although, linguistic features in terms of sentiment lexicons are beneficial, their usage gives rise to a new set of problems. Most lexicons consist of infinitive forms of words only. Especially, lexicons for low-resource languages. However, the text that needs to be classified is unnormalized. Hence, we want to answer the question if morphological information is necessary for SA or if a system that neglects all this information and therefore can make better use of lexicons actually has an advantage. Our approach is to first stem or lemmatize a dataset and then perform polarity classification on it. On Czech and English datasets we show that better results can be achieved with normalization. As a positive side effect, we can compute better word embeddings by first normalizing the training corpus. This works especially well for languages that have rich morphology. We show on word similarity datasets for English, German, and Spanish that our embeddings improve performance. On a new WordNet-based evaluation we confirm these results on five different languages (Czech, English, German, Hungarian, and Spanish). The benefit of this new evaluation is further that it can be used for many other languages, as the only resource that is required is a WordNet. ::: In the last part of the thesis, we use a recently introduced method to create an ultradense sentiment space out of generic word embeddings. This method allows us to compress 400 dimensional word embeddings down to 40 or even just 4 dimensions and still get similar results on a polarity classification task. While the training speed increases by a factor of 44, the difference in classification performance is not significant.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2617070002", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6900341"}

In order to make satisfactory approximations for the data with noise, some regression metamodels are adopted in current researches. The commonly used nugget-effect Kriging regards the variance of noise as a constant and ignores the difference of the noise influence, thus may not be effective enough in some cases. Therefore, a Kriging-based metamodel which combines the merits of Kriging and Support Vector Regression (SVR) is put forward for improving the performance in metamodeling with noisy data. The developed method, termed as SVEK, can capture the underlying trend of an unknown function efficiently by classifying the sample points and then regressing these classified points with different extents. Besides, a criterion for selecting the error margin e in SVR training is proposed to facilitate the parameter setting process. Moreover, a one-variable test example is used to illustrate the modeling theory and construction procedures of SVEK. Eight numerical benchmark problems with different important characteristics are used to validate the proposed method. Then an overall comparison between the nugget-effect Kriging and the proposed method has been made.

This new learning algorithm can be seen as an alternative training technique for Polynomial, Radial Basis Function and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers. An interesting property of this approach is that it is an approximate implementation of the Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) induction principle. The derivation of Support Vector Machines, its relationship with SRM, and its geometrical insight, are discussed in this paper. Training a SVM is equivalent to solve a quadratic programming problem with linear and box constraints in a number of variables equal to the number of data points. When the number of data points exceeds few thousands the problem is very challenging, because the quadratic form is completely dense, so the memory needed to store the problem grows with the square of the number of data points. Therefore, training problems arising in some real applications with large data sets are impossible to load into memory, and cannot be solved using standard non-linear constrained optimization algorithms. We present a decomposition algorithm that can be used to train SVM''s over large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present previous approaches, as well as results and important details of our implementation of the algorithm using a second-order variant of the Reduced Gradient Method as the solver of the sub-problems.

Recently, transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging the knowledge from related recommender systems where rich collaborative data are available. However, most previous transfer learning models assume that entity-correspondences across different systems are given as input, which means that for any entity (e.g., a user or an item) in a target system, its corresponding entity in a source system is known. This assumption can hardly be satisfied in real-world scenarios where entity-correspondences across systems are usually unknown, and the cost of identifying them can be expensive. For example, it is extremely difficult to identify whether a user A from Facebook and a user B from Twitter are the same person. In this paper, we propose a framework to construct entity correspondence with limited budget by using active learning to facilitate knowledge transfer across recommender systems.

In this paper, we propose a novel robust super-resolution GAN (i.e. namely RSR-GAN) which can simultaneously perform both the geometric transformation and recovering the finer texture details. Specifically, since the performance of the generator depends on the discreminator, we propose a novel discriminator design by incorporating the spatial transformer module with residual learning to improve the discrimination of fake and true images through removing the geometric noise, in order to enhance the super-resolution of geometric corrected images. Finally, to further improve the perceptual quality, we introduce an additional DCT loss term into the existing loss function. Extensive experiments, measured by both PSNR and SSIM measurements, show that our proposed method achieves a high level of robustness against a number of geometric transformations, including rotation, translation, a combination of rotation and scaling effects, and a cobmination of rotaion, transalation and scaling effects.

Satellite instruments provide an exceptional opportunity for global long-term observations of the land, the biosphere, the atmosphere, and the oceans. The collected data are used for estimation and better understanding of geophysical parameters such as land cover type, atmospheric properties, or ocean temperature. Achieving accurate estimations of such parameters is an important requirement for development of models able to predict global climate changes. One of the most challenging climate research problems is estimation of global composition, load, and variability of aerosols, small airborne particles that reflect and absorb incoming solar radiation. ::: The existing algorithm for aerosol prediction from satellite observations is deterministic and manually tuned by domain scientist. In contrast to domain-driven method, we show that aerosol prediction is achievable by completely data-driven approaches. These statistical methods consist of learning of nonlinear regression models to predict aerosol load using the satellite observations as inputs. Measurements from unevenly distributed ground-based sites over the world are used as proxy to ground-truth outputs. Although statistical methods achieve better accuracy than deterministic method this setup is appropriate when data are independently and identically distributed (IID). The IID assumption is often violated in remote sensing where data exhibit temporal, spatial, or spatio-temporal dependencies. In such cases, the traditional supervised learning approaches could result in a model with degraded accuracy. ::: Conditional random fields (CRF) are widely used for predicting output variables that have some internal structure. Most of the CRF research has been done on structured classification where the outputs are discrete. We propose a CRF model for continuous outputs that uses multiple unstructured predictors to form its features and at the same time exploits structure among outputs. By constraining the feature functions to quadratic functions of outputs, we show that the CRF model can be conveniently represented in a Gaussian canonical form. The appeal of proposed Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (GCRF) model is in its conceptual simplicity and computational efficiency of learning and inference through use of sparse matrix computations. Experimental results provide strong evidence that the GCRF achieves better accuracy than non-structured models. We improve the representational power of the GCRF model by (1) introducing the adaptive feature function that can learn nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs and (2) allowing the weights of feature functions to be dependent on inputs.

In this paper, we propose a Random Forest (RF) based crowd saliency prediction approach with optimal feature combination, i.e., the Feature Combination Selection for Crowd Saliency (FCSCS) framework. More specifically, we first define three representative crowd saliency features, namely, FaceSizeDiff, FacePoseDiff and FaceWhrDiff. Next, we adopt the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to construct our saliency learning model. Then, we evaluate the performance of FCSCS framework with different feature combinations (fifteen combinations in our experiments). Those selected features include low-level features (i.e., color, intensity, orientation), four crowd features (i.e., face size, face density, frontal face, profile face) and three new defined features (i.e., FaceSizeDiff, FacePoseDiff and FaceWhrDiff). We use FCSCS framework to obtain the optimal feature combination that is most suitable for crowd saliency prediction and further train the saliency model based on the optimal feature combination. After that, we evaluate the performance of the crowd saliency prediction classifiers.

RF-MEP is applied over Chile for 2000\u20142016, using daily measurements from 258 rain gauges for model training and 111 stations for validation. Two merged datasets were computed: RF-MEP3P (based on PERSIANN-CDR, ERA-Interim, and CHIRPSv2) and RF-MEP5P (which additionally includes CMORPHv1 and TRMM 3B42v7). The performances of the two merged products and those used in their computation were compared against MSWEPv2.2, which is a state-of-the-art global merged product. A validation using ground-based measurements was applied at different temporal scales using both continuous and categorical indices of performance. RF-MEP3P and RF-MEP5P outperformed all the precipitation datasets used in their computation, the products derived using other merging techniques, and generally outperformed MSWEPv2.2. The merged P products showed improvements in the linear correlation, bias, and variability of precipitation at different temporal scales, as well as in the probability of detection, the false alarm ratio, the frequency bias, and the critical success index for different precipitation intensities. RF-MEP performed well even when the training dataset was reduced to 10% of the available rain gauges.

In this work, we describe and analyze an emotion recognition system based on facial expressions robust to occlusions through Census Transform Histogram (CENTRIST) features. Initially, occluded facial regions are reconstructed by applying Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA). CENTRIST features are extracted from the facial expression representation, as well as Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Local Gradient Coding (LGC) and an extended Local Gradient Coding (LGC-HD). Then, the feature vector is reduced through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). For facial expression recognition, K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are applied and tested. Experimental results on two public data sets demonstrated that the CENTRIST representation achieved competitive accuracy rates for occluded and non-occluded facial expressions compared to other state-of-the-art approaches available in the literature.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7471886", "venue": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "journal": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2401982790", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16025584", "8827498", "26289057", "52061168", "589516", "14238476", "1128040", "14657654", "119847502", "28237082", "7128002", "122725444", "832721", "8581232", "120559756", "9054094", "2851587", "31810023", "13936305", "129084475", "3329621", "11489667", "29224683"], "inbound_citations": ["208632534", "209336459", "211506828", "53244961", "36438531", "3642586", "211228061", "212705109", "52050540"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8969978"}

Furthermore, by virtue of transfer learning, DeepRT enables utilization of the peptides datasets generated from different LC conditions and of different modification status, resulting in the RT prediction of 0.992 R2 for unmodified peptides and 0.978 R2 for post-translationally modified peptides.

It has become a driving force for the service-oriented computing (SOC) paradigm. In heterogeneous environments the SOC paradigm uses web services as the basic building block to support low costs as well as easy and rapid composition of distributed applications. A web service exposes its interfaces using the Web Service Description Language (WSDL). A central repository called universal description, discovery and integration (UDDI) is used by service providers to publish and register their web services. UDDI registries are used by web service consumers to locate the web services they require and metadata associated with them. Manually analyzing WSDL documents is the best approach, but also most expensive. Work has been done on employing various approaches to automate the classification of web services. However, previous research has focused on using a single technique for classification. This research paper focuses on the classification of web services using a majority vote based classifier ensemble technique. The ensemble model overcomes the limitations of conventional techniques by employing the ensemble of three heterogeneous classifiers: Naive Bayes, decision tree (J48), and Support Vector Machines. We applied tenfold cross-validation to test the efficiency of the model on a publicly available dataset consisting of 3738 real world web services categorized into 5 fields, which yielded an average accuracy of 92 %. The high accuracy is owed to two main factors, i.e., enhanced pre-processing with focused feature selection, and majority based ensemble classification.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12599-015-0407-z", "venue": null, "journal": "Business & Information Systems Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2275523025", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14314145", "63487772", "1820414", "109605988", "1724397", "18876876", "16888416", "38204365", "19882936", "8832999", "207429103", "18763212", "11759081", "30096146", "16424181", "6024088", "14767170"], "inbound_citations": ["59620293", "57379371", "126418990", "4624757", "37474427", "6247217"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21280368"}
