The algorithm creates a succession of sufficiently small linear programs that separate chunks of the data at a time. The key idea is that a small number of support vectors, corresponding to linear programming constraints with positive dual variables, are carried over between the successive small linear programs, each of which containing a chunk of the data. We prove that this procedure is monotonic and terminates in a finite number of steps at an exact solution that leads to an optimal separating plane for the entire dataset.

Near-infrared spectroscopy and mid-infrared spectroscopy data on natural honey and syrup-adulterated honey were integrated in the experiment. A method for identifying natural honey and syrup-adulterated honey was established by incorporating these data into a Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this experiment, 112 natural pure honey samples of 20 common honey types from 10 provinces in China were collected, and 112 adulterated honey samples with different percentages of syrup (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60%) were prepared using six types of syrup commonly used in industry. The total number of samples was 224. The near- and mid-infrared spectral data were obtained for all samples. The raw spectra were pre-processed by First Derivative (FD) transform, Second Derivative (SD) transform, Multiple Scattering Correction (MSC), and Standard Normal Variate Transformation (SNVT). The above-corrected data underwent low-level and intermediate-level data fusion. In the last step, Grid Search (GS), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) were employed as the optimization algorithms to find the optimal penalty parameter c and the optimal kernel parameter g for the SVM, and to establish the best SVM-based detection model for natural honey and syrup-adulterated honey. The results reveal that, compared to low-level data fusion, intermediate-level data fusion significantly improves the detection model.

It is well known that the online sequential learning algorithm (OS-ELM) based on recursive least squares [1] might result in ill-conditioning of the Hessian matrix and hence instability in the parameter estimation. To address this issue, the stability theory of Lyapunov is utilized to develop an online learning algorithm for temporal data from dynamic systems and time series.

If detected early and accurately, patients can retain their teeth for a longer time. Most cracks are not detected early because of the discontinuous symptoms and lack of good diagnostic tools. Currently used imaging modalities like Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and intraoral radiography often have low sensitivity and do not show cracks clearly. This paper introduces a novel method that can detect, quantify, and localize cracks automatically in high resolution CBCT (hr-CBCT) scans of teeth using steerable wavelets and learning methods. These initial results were created using hr-CBCT scans of a set of healthy teeth and of teeth with simulated longitudinal cracks. The cracks were simulated using multiple orientations. The crack detection was trained on the most significant wavelet coefficients at each scale using a bagged classifier of Support Vector Machines.

These unknowns are estimated in a probabilistic framework taking into account a dynamic model, prior scene information, and a state-of-the-art pedestrian detector and classifier. The classifier is based on the Random Forests-algorithm and is capable of being trained incrementally so that new training samples can be incorporated at runtime. This allows the classifier to adapt to the changing appearance of a target and to unlearn outdated features. The approach is evaluated on a publicly available dataset captured in a challenging outdoor scenario.

To take advantage of event cameras, some methods have been proposed to reconstruct intensity images from event streams. However, the outputs are still in low resolution (LR), noisy, and unrealistic. The low-quality outputs stem broader applications of event cameras, where high spatial resolution (HR) is needed as well as high temporal resolution, dynamic range, and no motion blur. We consider the problem of reconstructing and super-resolving intensity images from LR events, when no ground truth (GT) HR images and down-sampling kernels are available. To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end pipeline that reconstructs LR images from event streams, enhances the image qualities and upsamples the enhanced images, called EventSR. For the absence of real GT images, our method is primarily unsupervised, deploying adversarial learning. To train EventSR, we create an open dataset including both real-world and simulated scenes. The use of both datasets boosts up the network performance, and the network architectures and various loss functions in each phase help improve the image qualities.

This study investigated the use of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR data and Landsat-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to map the spatial distribution of paddy rice fields across parts of the Sanjiang plain, in northeast China. The satellite sensor data were acquired throughout the rice crop-growing season (May\u2013October). A co-registered set of 10 dual polarization (VH/VV) SAR and NDVI images depicting crop phenological development were used as inputs to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning classification algorithms in order to map paddy rice fields. The results showed a significant increase in overall classification when the NDVI time-series data were integrated with the various combinations of multi-temporal polarization channels (i.e. VH, VV, and VH/VV). The highest classification accuracies overall (95.2%) and for paddy rice (96.7%) were generated using the RF algorithm applied to combined multi-temporal VH polarization and NDVI data. The SVM classifier was most effective when applied to the dual polarization (i.e. VH and VV) SAR data alone and this generated overall and paddy rice classification accuracies of 91.6% and 82.5%, respectively. The results demonstrate the practicality of implementing RF or SVM machine learning algorithms to produce 10 m spatial resolution maps of paddy rice fields with limited ground data using a combination of multi-temporal SAR and NDVI data, where available, or SAR data alone.

It presents a hybrid approach based on the paradigm of Reservoir Computing. The practical applications based on recurrent spiking neurons are limited due to the lack of learning algorithms. Most of the previous work in the literature has focused on feed forward networks because computation in these networks is comparatively easy to analyse. The details of such networks have been reported in detail in (Haykin, 1999) (Pavlidis et al., 2005) (Bohte et al., 2000). Recently, a strategy proposed by Maass (Maass et al., 2002) and Jaeger (Jaeger, 2001) offers to overcome the burden of recurrent neural networks training. In this paradigm, instead of training the whole recurrent network only the output layer (known as readout neuron) is trained. This chapter investigates the potential of recurrent spiking neurons as the basic building blocks for the liquid or so called reservoir. These recurrent neural networks are termed as microcircuits which are viewed as basic computational units in cortical computation (Maass et al., 2002). These microcircuits are connected as columns which are linked with other neighboring columns in cortical areas. These columns read out information from each other and serve both as reservoir and readout. The reservoir is modeled as a dynamical system perturbed by the input stream where only readouts are trained to extract information from the reservoir. The basic motivation behind investigating recurrent neurons is their potential to memorise relevant events over short periods of time (Maass et al., 2002). The use of feedback enables recurrent networks to acquire state representation which makes them suitable for temporal based applications such as speech recognition. It is challenging to solve such problems with recurrent networks due to the burden of training. The paradigm of reservoir computing also referred to as liquid computing relaxes the burden of training because only an output layer is trained instead of training the whole network. The work presented in this chapter analyses the theoretical framework of Reservoir Computing and demonstrates results in terms of classification accuracy through the application of speech recognition. The design space for this paradigm is split into three domains; front end, reservoir, and back end. This work contributes to the identification of suitable front and back end processing techniques along with stable reservoir dynamics, which provides a reliable framework for classification related problems. The work presented in this chapter suggests a simple and efficient biologically plausible approach based on a hybrid implementation of recurrent spiking neurons and classical feed", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/10186", "venue": "Advances in Speech Recognition", "journal": "Advances in Speech Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1485861440", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60577818", "115384844", "1045112", "13232616", "2184251", "20552768", "16538082", "5118674", "2763403", "61008692", "61070677", "1400872", "14711886", "2048100", "9448547", "41613814", "14219816", "61322281", "59105273", "57332383", "41942483", "21778526", "5463972", "11166450", "141891255", "142225855", "4343886", "29656085"], "inbound_citations": ["46954981", "161049352", "7309110", "15693062", "57469057", "16700926", "55411641"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18227952"}

The conventional way to extent the SVM to multi-class scenarios is to decompose an m-class problem into a series of two-class problems, for which either the one-vs-one (OVO) or one-vs-all (OVA) approaches are used. In this paper, a practical and systematic approach using a kernelised SVM is proposed and developed such that it can be implemented in embedded hardware within a road-side camera.

The approach takes the meteorological data and air quality data for the past six days as one batch of input (the whole data set is for 46 days) and employs a multi-model fusion to provide an improved 24-hour prediction of PM2.5 pollutant concentration all over Beijing. During the above process, two focal feature groups are composed. The first focal feature group contains the historical meteorological data, while the second group includes the statistical information, the date information and the polynomial variations. Besides the two groups, we complement one million more data items by employing the time sliding means. Among the supplementary data, we select the most critical 500 features with Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model and send the features as the input to Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and LightGBM models. Meanwhile, we screen the most critical 300 features with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model and send them as the input to the three prediction models. Referring to each of the models, we respectively gain the optimal parameters through grid search methods and then fuse the models\u2019 contribution with the linear weighting.

These two learning machines were tested in two watersheds (Little River Experimental Watershed in Georgia and Mahatango Creek Experimental Watershed in Pennsylvania). The results show that SVM in general exhibited better generalization ability than ANN. In order to effectively and efficiently apply SVM to approximate SWAT, the effect of cross-validation schemes, parameter dimensions, and training sample sizes on the performance of SVM was evaluated and discussed. It is suggested that 3-fold cross-validation is adequate for training the SVM model, and reducing the parameter dimension through determining the parameter values from field data and the sensitivity analysis is an effective means of improving the performance of SVM.

In Things2Vec, we utilize the graph to model the function sequence relationships that are generated by the interaction of things, which is called the IoT context graph. Since these function sequence relationships are heterogeneous in terms of semantics, it causes general graph embeddings to fail to learn complete information.

In this work, we propose the use of semantic-guided generative adversarial network (SG-GAN) to automatically synthesize visible face images from their thermal counterparts. Specifically, semantic labels, extracted by a face parsing network, are used to compute a semantic loss function to regularize the adversarial network during training. These semantic cues denote high-level facial component information associated with each pixel. Further, an identity extraction network is leveraged to generate multi-scale features to compute an identity loss function.

The distinguishing features of the proposed approach are as follows: (a) The approach is a nonparametric one and the forecast error caused by the misjudgement of probability distribution type can be avoided; (b) The proposed approach has good generalization capability by using the sparse learning mechanism; and (c) The range constraint of wind generation can be systematically considered in the approach by applying DST.

After manual localization of ROI of LAA, we adopted the FCN in natural image segmentation and transferred their learned models by fine-tuning the networks to segment each 2-D LAA slice. Subsequently, we used a modified dense 3-D CRF that accounts for the 3-D spatial information and larger contextual information to refine the segmentations of all slices. Our method was evaluated on 150 sets of CTA data using five-fold cross validation.

Identification of RNA-binding residues (RBR) in proteins is an key step to understand the mutual recognition mechanism underlying the protein-RNA interactions. In this paper, we proposed a novel method, XPredRBR, to predict the RNA binding residues in proteins, by exploiting the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. Two types of new predictive features derived from residue interaction network and solvent exposures are combined with conventional sequence features and structural neighborhood features to predict RBR. We carried out empirical experiments on two datasets to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. By 10-fold cross-validations, our method achieved the accuracy of 0.861, sensitivity of 0.872, MCC of 0.584 and AUC of 0.941 on the RBP170 dataset. On another independent test set RBP101, XPredRBR outperformed three traditional classifiers and seven existing RNA-binding residue methods. A case study on the chain E of 3PLA protein illustrated XPredRBR effectively identified most RNA-binding and non RNA-binding sites.

Particle positions are then mapped onto training images that are processed to emphasize the features of interest and match attainable far-field videos of real animal groups. The training images serve as templates of recognizable patterns of collective behavior and are compactly represented in a low-dimensional space called embedding manifold. Two mappings from the manifold are derived: the manifold-to-image mapping serves to reconstruct new and unseen images of the group and the manifold-to-feature mapping allows frame-by-frame classification of raw video. We validate the combined framework on datasets of growing level of complexity.

Experiments were performed using 280 pairs of lumbar spine CT scans and MRT2 images. The MRT2 images were then synthesized from 15 other spine CT scans. To evaluate whether the synthetic MR images were realistic, two radiologists, two spine surgeons, and two residents blindly classified the real and synthetic MRT2 images. Two experienced radiologists then evaluated the similarities between subdivisions of the real and synthetic MRT2 images. Quantitative analysis of the synthetic MRT2 images was performed using the mean absolute error (MAE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). ::: ::: ::: Results ::: The mean overall similarity of the synthetic MRT2 images evaluated by radiologists was 80.2%. In the blind classification of the real MRT2 images, the failure rate ranged from 0% to 40%. The MAE value of each image ranged from 13.75 to 34.24 pixels (mean, 21.19 pixels), and the PSNR of each image ranged from 61.96 to 68.16 dB (mean, 64.92 dB). ::: ::: ::: Conclusion ::: This was the first study to apply GANs to synthesize spine MR images from CT images. Despite the small dataset of 280 pairs, the synthetic MR images were relatively well implemented. Synthesis of medical images using GANs is a new paradigm of artificial intelligence application in medical imaging. We expect that synthesis of MR images from spine CT images using GANs will improve the diagnostic usefulness of CT.

The protocol was elaborated for the treatment of patients suffering from a primary tumor with 6 cycles of TEC (3-weekly) prior to the surgical treatment. The selection of predictor genes was done with BRB-ArrayTools Version 3.3 using a model based on the Compound Covariate Predictor, Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis, Nearest Neighbor Classification, and Support Vector Machines with linear kernel.We estimated the prediction error of each model using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) as described by Simon R. 2000 random permutations were used.

In this paper, we propose a novel weighted classifier ensemble method through classifiers pruning with two stages. In the first stage, we use canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to model maximum correlation relationships between training data points and base classifiers. Based on such globally multi-linear projections, a sparse regression method is proposed to prune base classifiers so that each test data point will dynamically select a subset of classifiers to form a unique classifier ensemble, to decrease effects of noisy input data and incorrect classifiers in such a global view. In the second stage, the pruned classifiers are weighted locally by a fusion method, which utilizes the generalization ability of pruned classifiers among nearest neighbors of testing data points. By this way, each test data point can build a unique locally weighted classifier ensemble.

The advantage of the enhanced SELM with generalized correntropy to achieve better forecasting performance mainly relies on the following aspect. Generalized correntropy is a stable and robust nonlinear similarity measure while employing machine learning method to forecast wind speed, where the outliers may exist in some industrially measured values.

These subtypes are difficult to distinguish histologically but demand distinct courses of treatment, and applying the wrong treatment can be fatal. This presents a profound need for accurate classification tools to assist clinicians in their diagnoses. To address the need, we have developed a gene expression-based classifier to distinguish squamous and non-squamous NSCLC by using quantitative Nuclease Protection Assay1(qNPA). This assay does not require prior RNA extraction, and is automated to fit within standard clinical practice, thus can be applied easily in local hospital laboratories. ::: ::: Methods: First, we identified candidate biomarker genes through microarray analysis of both fresh frozen and formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from 134 NSCLC patients, plus in silico analysis of six microarray datasets from GEO. We then refined the set of marker genes and developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on a set of 161 FFPE samples. We obtained these samples from a variety of sources to model the heterogeneity of samples under both academic and community settings. Finally, we validated the performance of the classifier on an independent set of 97 FFPE samples. ::: ::: Results: The performance of the classifier was measured by its call concordance with three pathologists' IHC panel consensus reads. The classifier distinguished squamous and non-squamous NSCLC of the 97 FFPE independent samples with 95% accuracy. Two of the five discordant samples were confirmed as positive in our ALK screening assay; ALK fusions are generally limited to adenocarcinomas. The classifier, combining with an ALK screening assay can provide increased accuracy for NSCLC subtyping. ::: ::: The classifier's robustness was further demonstrated by diluting the tumor content with normal adjacent tissue, with as little as 20% of the original tumor content in the final sample. All diluted samples were predicted correctly. In addition, the estimated class probabilities did not vary significantly by dilution ratio, indicating that the classifications are robust to low tumor content. ::: ::: Conclusions: We have developed a robust, high-performance classifier for distinguishing squamous from non-squamous NSCLC lung cancer in FFPE samples without the need for prior RNA extraction using qNPA. The performance of classifier was validated by an independent set of cohort obtained from multiple sources. ::: ::: Reference: ::: ::: 1.Martel et al, Multiplexed screening assay for mRNA combining nuclease protection with luminescent array detection.

A nested uniform design (UD) methodology is proposed for efficient, robust and automatic model selection for support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed method is applied to select the candidate set of parameter combinations and carry out a k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the generalization performance of each parameter combination. In contrast to conventional exhaustive grid search, this method can be treated as a deterministic analog of random search. It can dramatically cut down the number of parameter trials and also provide the flexibility to adjust the candidate set size under computational time constraint. The key theoretic advantage of the UD model selection over the grid search is that the UD points are \u201cfar more uniform\u201dand \u201cfar more space filling\u201d than lattice grid points. The better uniformity and space-filling phenomena make the UD selection scheme more efficient by avoiding wasteful function evaluations of close-by patterns. The proposed method is evaluated on different learning tasks, different data sets as well as different SVM algorithms. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

{"paper_id": "67074482", "title": "Robust structural feature learning based facial expression recognition", "authors": [{"first": "Jain", "middle": ["Deepak"], "last": "Kumar", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Facial expression analysis and recognition are one of the most fast developing research areas due to its wide range of applications such as emotion analysis, biometrics, image retrieval etc. Facial expression recently becomes one of the most interesting subjects that face some challenges e.g., multiple illuminations, orientations and numerous variations. In general context, variant methods show different requirements and hinges to develop new models. These methods handle the post-processing and pre-processing of the facial images. The pre-processing models include the detection and extraction of face images using normalization schemes whereas post-processing models extract the relevant features for finding the facial expressions. For the above challenging problems, it is essential to enhance the robustness of facial expression recognition model with structured features and feature learning to provide effective and discriminative features for facial expression recognition. In the thesis, we proposed three approaches which is divided into three phases: The first phase designs a novel hybrid patch based diagonal pattern geometric appearance models which cover efficient feature extraction and co-training labels to increase the accuracy of our model. For the given input RGB-D images, the features are extracted using Geometric Appearance Models (GAM). The selected features are then processed onto Patch-Based Diagonal Pattern (PBDP). At last, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is used for classifying the facial expressions with labels neutral or smile. The proposed model is tested on two public datasets (EURECOMM and biographer dataset). Performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, jaccard coefficient, dice overlap, kappa coefficient and accuracy were studied. The proposed classifier RVM is compared with the radial basis function kernel(RBF) SVM and other recent approaches which proves that the proposed classifier significantly reduced the error rate. Moreover, the proposed model as compared to RBF kernel based SVM has very low cost, training time and less number of mathematical operations. The second phase concentrates on developing a multi-angle based optimal pattern deep convolution neural network for automatic facial expression recognition systems. The framework has aimed at resolving the projection of complex 3D actions on the image plane and inaccurate class alignment. In specific, sudden illumination changes of images are rectified from multi-angle based optimal configurations. The whole process is carried out in five stages, namely, Extended Boundary Background Subtraction (EBBS), Multi- angle Texture Pattern with spatio temporal matching, Densely Extracted SURF with Local Occupancy Pattern (LOP), Priority Particle Cuckoo Search Optimization and Long Short- Term Memory Convolutional Neural Network. Each process has a unique model which accurately predicts the relevant features to have better classification systems. The proposed algorithm is analyzed on CK+ and MMI datasets with the parameters of recognition rate and F1 measure. Each process has unique model which accurately predicts the relevant features for better classification system.However,the noise removal through the EBBS and novel feature extraction based on the multi-angle texture pattern contributed towards the illumination variation handling and the matching accuracy effectively.

The control system was tested subjected to external sagittal pulling and pushing forces. Biped robots have leg link structures similar to the human\u2019s anatomy. To be able to maintain its stability under dynamic situations such robotic systems require good mechanical designs and force sensors to acquire the zero moment point (ZMP). Research in biped robotics has recently had a great surge due to the challenges of the subject and the media impact of famous biped robots like Honda\u2019s. (Vukobratovic, 1990) developed a mathematical model of a biped robot and its method of control. Some research works (Zarrugh & Radcliffe, 1979), (Nakamura et al., 2004), (Jang et al., 2002) have reported the gait of biped robots based on human kinematics data, and a very good study of human body kinematics was done by Winter (Winter, 1990). Because a biped robot is easily knocked down, its stability must be taken into account in its gait design. Zheng (Zheng & Shen, 1990) proposed a method of gait synthesis taking into account the static stability. Chevallereau (Chevallereau et al., 1998) discussed dynamic stability through the analysis of the reaction force between the base of the foot and the ground. Unfortunately the defined trajectory does not assure the satisfaction of the stability restriction. To assure the dynamic stability of a biped robot, Shin (Shin et al., 1990) and Hirai (Hirai et al., 1998) proposed standard methods for gait synthesis based on the zero moment point (ZMP). Basically this method consists of designing a desired ZMP trajectory, duly correcting the movement of the torso to maintain the ZMP trajectory as designed. However, because the change of the ZMP to accommodate the movement of the torso is limited, not all desired ZMP trajectories are possible (Park & Kim, 1998). The ZMP position can be obtained computationally using a model of the robot. However there might be a significant difference between the real and the calculated ZMP due to the difference between the real robot\u2019s physical parameters and its approximated mathematical model. To avoid this error, four force sensors are usually used on each foot to obtain an estimate for the real ZMP.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/14445", "venue": "Biped Robots", "journal": "Biped Robots", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1498709830", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1746599", "961425", "8873237", "28986844", "7182619", "14689465", "16212930", "42257079", "33188076", "7443412", "18296263", "5612283", "54451267", "1632365", "118729521", "33262333"], "inbound_citations": ["26657920"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16615554"}

In this study, a novel method called iDNA-KACC is presented, which combines the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the auto-cross covariance transformation. The protein sequences are first converted into profile-based protein representation, and then converted into a series of fixed-length vectors by the auto-cross covariance transformation with Kmer composition. The sequence order effect can be effectively captured by this scheme. These vectors are then fed into Support Vector Machine (SVM) to discriminate the DNA-binding proteins from the non DNA-binding ones. iDNA-KACC achieves an overall accuracy of 75.16% and Matthew correlation coefficient of 0.5 by a rigorous jackknife test. Its performance is further improved by employing an ensemble learning approach, and the improved predictor is called iDNA-KACC-EL.

The mainstream approach is to represent input objects as feature vectors where each value encodes some of their aspects, e.g., syntax, semantics, etc. Feature-based methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks. However, designing good features is a highly empirical-driven process, it greatly depends on a task requiring a significant amount of domain expertise. Moreover, extracting features for complex NLP tasks ::: often requires expensive pre-processing steps running a large number of linguistic tools while relying on external knowledge sources that are often not available or hard to get. Hence, this process is not cheap and often constitutes one of the major challenges when attempting a new task or adapting to a different language or domain. ::: The problem of modelling input objects is even more acute in cases when the input examples are not just single objects but pairs of objects, such as in various learning to rank problems in Information Retrieval and Natural Language processing. An alternative to feature-based methods is using kernels which are essentially non-linear functions mapping input examples into some high dimensional space thus allowing for learning decision functions with higher discriminative power. Kernels implicitly generate a very large number of features computing similarity between input examples in that implicit space. A well-designed kernel function can greatly reduce the effort to design a large set of manually designed features often leading to superior results. However, in the recent years, the use of kernel methods in NLP has been greatly under-estimated primarily due to the following reasons: (i) learning with kernels is slow as it requires to carry out optimization in the dual space leading to quadratic complexity; (ii) applying kernels to the input objects encoded with vanilla structures, e.g., generated by syntactic parsers, often yields minor improvements over carefully designed feature-based methods. ::: In this thesis, we adopt the kernel learning approach for solving complex NLP tasks and primarily focus on solutions to the aforementioned problems posed by the use of kernels. In particular, we design novel learning algorithms for training Support Vector Machines with structural kernels, e.g., tree kernels, considerably speeding up the training over the conventional SVM training methods. We show that using the training algorithms developed in this thesis allows for training tree kernel models on large-scale datasets containing millions of instances, which was not possible before. Next, we focus on the problem of designing input structures that are fed to tree kernel functions to automatically generate a large set of tree-fragment features. We demonstrate that previously used plain structures generated by syntactic parsers, e.g., syntactic or dependency trees, are often a poor choice thus compromising the expressivity offered by a tree kernel learning framework. We propose several effective design patterns of the input tree structures for various NLP tasks ranging from sentiment analysis to answer passage reranking. The central idea is to inject additional semantic information relevant for the task directly into the tree nodes and let the expressive kernels generate rich feature spaces. For the opinion mining tasks, the additional semantic information injected into tree nodes can be word polarity labels, while for more complex tasks of modelling text pairs the relational information about overlapping words in a pair appears to significantly improve the accuracy of the resulting models. Finally, we observe that both feature-based and kernel methods typically treat words as atomic units where matching different yet semantically similar words is problematic. Conversely, the idea of distributional approaches to model words as vectors is much more effective in establishing a semantic match between words and phrases. While tree kernel functions do allow for a more flexible matching between phrases and sentences through matching their syntactic contexts, their representation can not be tuned on the training set as it is possible with distributional approaches. Recently, deep learning approaches have been applied to generalize the distributional word matching problem to matching sentences taking it one step further by learning the optimal sentence representations for a given task. Deep neural networks have already claimed state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language tasks. Following this trend, this thesis also explores the virtue of deep learning architectures for modelling input texts and text pairs where we build on some of the ideas to model input objects proposed within the tree kernel learning framework. In particular, we explore the idea of relational linking (proposed in the preceding chapters to encode text pairs using linguistic tree structures) to design a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture for modelling text pairs. We compare the proposed deep learning models that require even less manual intervention in the feature design process then previously described tree kernel methods that already offer a very good trade-off between the feature-engineering effort and the expressivity of the resulting representation. Our deep learning models demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance on a recent benchmark for Twitter Sentiment Analysis, Answer Sentence Selection and Microblog retrieval.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "773043280", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10796"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13170982"}

In ensemble learning, the construction method of training samples is a key. The larger difference between the training sample sub-sets leads to the stronger generalization ability of SVR. In this work, an improved method of sample construction is proposed to increase the differences between training sample sets. The proposed method divides the samples into several sub-categories by clustering algorithm. Each sub-category adds the samples closing to the clustering center from other sub-categories to form a new training sample set.

The key to realize this vision is an accurate thermal comfort model. We propose a novel machine learning based approach to learn an individual's thermal comfort model.

Our methodology focuses on generating a robust set of image-text projections capable of accurately representing any image, with an objective of achieving high recall.

In this paper we build on this concept and propose a new set of visual descriptors that provide a local space-time description of the visual activity. The proposed descriptors are extracted at spatiotemporal salient points detected on the estimated optical flow field for a given image sequence and are based on geometrical properties of three-dimensional piecewise polynomials, namely B-splines. The latter are fitted on the spatiotemporal locations of salient points that fall within a given spatiotemporal neighborhood. Our descriptors are invariant in translation and scaling in space-time. The latter is ensured by coupling the neighborhood dimensions to the scale at which the corresponding spatiotemporal salient points are detected. In addition, in order to provide robustness against camera motion (e.g. global translation due to camera panning) we subtract the motion component that is estimated by applying local median filters on the optical flow field. The descriptors that are extracted across the whole dataset are clustered in order to create a codebook of 'visual verbs', where each verb corresponds to a cluster center. We use the resulting codebook in a 'bag of verbs' approach in order to represent the motion of the subjects within small temporal windows. Finally, we use a boosting algorithm in order to select the most discriminative temporal windows of each class and Relevance Vector Machines (RVM) for classification.

However, ESNs have global parameters that should be tuned in order to improve their performance in a determined task.

The detection of abnormal events in large dynamic network has become increasingly important as networks grow in size and complexity.

This paper presents a new anomaly detection method based on deep learning models, specifically the feedforward neural network (FNN) model and convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The performance of the models is evaluated by several experiments with a popular NSL-KDD dataset. From the experimental results, we find the FNN and CNN models not only have a strong modeling ability for network anomaly detection, but also have high accuracy. Compared with several traditional machine learning methods, such as J48, Naive Bayes, NB Tree, Random Forest, Random Tree and SVM, the proposed models obtain a higher accuracy and detection rate with lower false positive rate.

Problems with classifying large amount of publication papers can be solved with automating the process of subject area classification using supervised machine learning approaches. This paper represents an experimental study that used support vector machines and naive bayes for automated classification of subject areas.

The proposed experimentation is consisted of two phases. In first phase, a list of co-words was generated from a collection of document in each of selected subject areas using text pre-processing technique.

We compiled an internal data set consisting of 260 compounds that are substrates for at least 1 of the 7 categories of drug transporters. Four physicochemical parameters (charge, molecular weight, lipophilicity, and plasma unbound fraction) of each compound were used as the basic descriptors. Furthermore, a greedy algorithm was used to select 3 additional physicochemical descriptors from 731 available descriptors. In addition, transporter nonsubstrates tend not to be in the public domain; we, thus, tried to compile an expert-curated data set of putative nonsubstrates for each transporter using personal opinions of 11 researchers in the field of drug transporters. The best prediction was finally achieved by a support vector machine based on 4 basic and 3 additional descriptors.

Various types of patterns can then be generated using these techniques, such as sequential patterns, frequent itemsets, and closed and maximum patterns. However, how to effectively exploit the discovered patterns is still an open research issue, especially in the domain of text mining. Most of the text mining methods adopt the keyword-based approach to construct text representations which consist of single words or single terms, whereas other methods have tried to use phrases instead of keywords, based on the hypothesis that the information carried by a phrase is considered more than that by a single term. Nevertheless, these phrase-based methods did not yield significant improvements due to the fact that the patterns with high frequency (normally the shorter patterns) usually have a high value on exhaustivity but a low value on specificity, and thus the specific patterns encounter the low frequency problem. ::: ::: ::: ::: This thesis presents the research on the concept of developing an effective Pattern Taxonomy Model (PTM) to overcome the aforementioned problem by deploying discovered patterns into a hypothesis space. PTM is a pattern-based method which adopts the technique of sequential pattern mining and uses closed patterns as features in the representative. A PTM-based information filtering system is implemented and evaluated by a series of experiments on the latest version of the Reuters dataset, RCV1. The pattern evolution schemes are also proposed in this thesis with the attempt of utilising information from negative training examples to update the discovered knowledge.

Uncovering disease-gene associations is critical for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. Computational algorithms which effectively predict candidate disease-gene associations prior to experimental proof can greatly reduce the associated cost and time. Most existing methods are disease-specific which can only predict genes associated with a specific disease at a time. Similarities among diseases are not used during the prediction. Meanwhile, most methods predict new disease genes based on known associations, making them unable to predict disease genes for diseases without known associated genes.In this study, a manifold learning-based method is proposed for predicting disease-gene associations by assuming that the geodesic distance between any disease and its associated genes should be shorter than that of other non-associated disease-gene pairs. The model maps the diseases and genes into a lower dimensional manifold based on the known disease-gene associations, disease similarity and gene similarity to predict new associations in terms of the geodesic distance between disease-gene pairs. In the 3-fold cross-validation experiments, our method achieves scores of 0.882 and 0.854 in terms of the area under of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for diseases with more than one known associated genes and diseases with only one known associated gene, respectively. Further de novo studies on Lung Cancer and Bladder Cancer also show that our model is capable of identifying new disease-gene associations.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6454152", "pubmed_id": "31001321", "doi": "10.3389/fgene.2019.00270", "venue": "Front.

This problem becomes even more complicated when the number of classes is high. In this multiclass scenario, it is assumed that the class labels are independent of each other, and thus, most techniques and methods proposed to improve the performance of the classifiers rely on it. An alternative way to address the multiclass problem is to hierarchically distribute the classes in a collection of multiclass subproblems by reducing the number of classes involved in each local subproblem. In this paper, we propose a new method for inducing a class hierarchy from the confusion matrix of a multiclass classifier. Then, we use the class hierarchy to learn a tree-like hierarchy of classifiers for solving the original multiclass problem in a similar way as the top-down hierarchical classification approach does for working with hierarchical domains. We experimentally evaluate the proposal on a collection of multiclass datasets showing that, in general, the generated hierarchies not only outperforms the original (flat) classification but also hierarchical approaches based on other alternative ways of constructing the class hierarchy.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procs.2017.05.218", "venue": "ICCS", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2622979832", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199835576", "199501644", "195223439", "209450357", "104294560", "214583314", "169035901", "50786076"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1631048"}

Hundreds and thousands of simulation model calls, while solving the optimization model, often lead to computational disaster. Establishing a surrogate model for the simulation model can effectively alleviate this drawback. When using extreme learning machine (ELM) to establish a surrogate model for a simulation model, the output weights are calculated using randomly given input weights and hidden-layer deviations, which may lead to inadequate accuracy of the surrogate model and insufficient generalization ability to samples not appearing in the training set. However, by combining the ELM with particle swarm optimization (PSO), the PSO can be used to optimize the selection of the input weights and hidden-layer deviations of the ELM; thus, calculating the output weights and establishing a surrogate model based on the PSO-ELM instead of the simulation model embedded in the optimization model to complete the GCSI. The uncertainty of the parameters is rarely considered when the simulation-optimization method is applied to GCSI. Thus, the uncertainty of the parameters is considered in GCSI based on the PSO-ELM. The results show that compared with the ELM, the PSO-ELM can establish the surrogate model with higher accuracy. The surrogate model based on PSO-ELM can be embedded in the optimization model to effectively solve GCSI problems.

Also, measurement samples from real processes are contaminated with noises of different statistical characteristics and are produced by one-by-one way. In this case, learning algorithms with better learning performance and compact model for systems with noises of various statistics are necessary. This paper proposes a new online extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm, namely, sparse recursive least mean p-power ELM (SRLMP-ELM). In SRLMP-ELM, a novel cost function, i.e., the sparse least mean p-power (SLMP) error criterion, provides a mechanism to update the output weights sequentially and automatically tune some parameters of the output weights to zeros.

However, a runoff series consists of complex nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics, which makes forecasting difficult. To contribute towards improved prediction accuracy, a novel hybrid model based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for annual runoff forecasting is proposed and applied in this paper. Firstly, the original annual runoff series is decomposed into a limited number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one trend term based on the EMD, which makes the series stationary. Secondly, it will be forecasted by a least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) when the IMF component possesses chaotic characteristics, and simulated by a polynomial method when it does not. In addition, the reserved trend term is predicted by a Gray Model. Finally, the ensemble forecast for the original runoff series is formulated by combining the prediction results of the modeled IMFs and the trend term. Qualified rate (QR), root mean square errors (RMSE), mean absolute relative errors (MARE), and mean absolute errors (MAE) are used as the comparison criteria. The results reveal that the EMD-based chaotic LSSVM (EMD-CLSSVM) hybrid model is a superior alternative to the CLSSVM hybrid model for forecasting annual runoff at Shangjingyou station, reducing the RMSE, MARE, and MAE by 39%, 28.6%, and 25.6%, respectively. To further illustrate the stability and representativeness of the EMD-CLSSVM hybrid model, runoff data at three additional sites, Zhaishang, Fenhe reservoir, and Lancun stations, were applied to verify the model. The results show that the EMD-CLSSVM hybrid model proved its applicability with high prediction precision.

We further derive a Neural-Network model that jointly learns a new representation of users and items in an embedded space as well as the preference relation of users over the pairs of items. The learning objective is based on three scenarios of ranking losses that control the ability of the model to maintain the ordering over the items induced from the users' preferences, as well as, the capacity of the dot-product defined in the learned embedded space to produce the ordering. The proposed model is by nature suitable for implicit feedback and involves the estimation of only very few parameters.

Due to a major disadvantage of the characteristic overlap and complexity, the wide bandwidth and the weak absorption of the Spectroscopy signals, it seems difficult to give a satisfactory solutions for the modeling problem. To address those problems, in the present paper, a summation wavelet extreme learning machine algorithm (SWELM(CS)) combined with Cuckoo research was adopted for drug discrimination by NIRS. Specifically, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was selected as the classifier model because of its properties of fast learning and insensitivity, to improve the accuracy and generalization performances of the classifier model; An inverse hyperbolic sine and a Morlet-wavelet are used as dual activation functions to improve convergence speed, and a combination of activation functions makes the network more adequate to deal with dynamic systems; Due to ELM' s weights and hidden layer threshold generated randomly, it leads to network instability, so Cuckoo Search was adapted to optimize model parameters; SWELM(CS) improves stability of the classifier model. Besides, SWELM(CS) is based on the ELM algorithm for fast learning and insensitivity; the dual activation functions and proper choice of activation functions enhances the capability of the network to face low and high frequency signals simultaneously; it has high stability of classification by Cuckoo Research. This compact structure of the dual activation functions constitutes a kernel framework by extracting signal features and signal simultaneously, which can be generalized to other machine learning fields to obtain a good accuracy and generalization performances. Drug samples of near in- frared spectroscopy produced by Xian-Janssen Pharmaceutical Ltd were adopted as the main objects in this paper.

Thus far, however, few studies have dealt with the sustainability of such technologies and its associated socioeconomic dimensions. As a result, arsenic awareness prediction has not yet been fully conceptualized. Accordingly, this study evaluated arsenic awareness among arsenic-affected communities in rural India, using a structured questionnaire to record socioeconomic, demographic, and other sociobehavioral factors with an eye to assessing their association with and influence on arsenic awareness. First a logistic regression model was applied and its results compared with those produced by six state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine [SVM], Kernel-SVM, Decision Tree [DT], k-Nearest Neighbor [k-NN], Na\u00efve Bayes [NB], and Random Forests [RF]) as measured by their accuracy at predicting arsenic awareness. Most (63%) of the surveyed population was found to be arsenic-aware. Significant arsenic awareness predictors were divided into three types: (1) socioeconomic factors: caste, education level, and occupation; (2) water and sanitation behavior factors: number of family members involved in water collection, distance traveled and time spent for water collection, places for defecation, and materials used for handwashing after defecation; and (3) social capital and trust factors: presence of anganwadi and people's trust in other community members, NGOs, and private agencies. Moreover, individuals' having higher social network positively contributed to arsenic awareness in the communities. Results indicated that both the SVM and the RF algorithms outperformed at overall prediction of arsenic awareness-a nonlinear classification problem. Lower-caste, less educated, and unemployed members of the population were found to be the most vulnerable, requiring immediate arsenic mitigation. To this end, local social institutions and NGOs could play a crucial role in arsenic awareness and outreach programs. Use of SVM or RF or a combination of the two, together with use of a larger sample size, could enhance the accuracy of arsenic awareness prediction.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29408061", "doi": "10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.01.044", "venue": "Journal of environmental management", "journal": "Journal of environmental management", "mag_id": "2789447613", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["192651086", "73446051", "203063294", "199474205"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206005717"}

In this paper, we introduce a higher-order tensor framework for video analysis. We represent image frame, audio, and text in video shots as data points by the 3rd-order tensor. Then we propose a novel dimension reduction algorithm which explicitly considers the manifold structure of the tensor space from contextual temporal associated cooccurring multimodal media data. Our algorithm inherently preserves the intrinsic structure of the sub- manifold where tensorshots are sampled and is also able to map out-of-sample data points directly.

It investigates, in particular, what type of neural circuitry can produce and modulate the two locomotor programs identified within the salamander's spinal cord; namely, a traveling wave of neural activity for swimming and a standing wave for trotting. A two-dimensional biomechanical simulation of the salamander's body is developed whose muscle contraction is determined by the locomotion controller simulated as a leaky-integrator neural network. While the connectivity of the neural circuitry underlying locomotion in the salamander has not been decoded for the moment, this article presents the design of a neural circuit that has a general organization corresponding to that hypothesized by neurobiologists. In particular, the locomotion controller is based on a body central pattern generator (CPG) corresponding to a lamprey-like swimming controller, and is extended with a limb CPG for controlling the salamander's limbs. The complete controller is developed in three stages: first the development of segmental oscillators, second the development of intersegmental coupling for the making of a lamprey-like swimming CPG, and finally the development of the limb CPG and its coupling to the body CPG. A genetic algorithm is used to determine the parameters of the neural circuit for the different stages, given a high-level description of the desired state space trajectories of the different subnetworks. A controller is thus developed that can produce neural activities and locomotion gaits very similar to those observed in the real salamander. By varying the tonic (i.e. non-oscillating) excitation applied to the network, the speed, direction and type of gait can be varied.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "11357547", "doi": "10.1007/s004220000211", "venue": "Biological cybernetics", "journal": "Biological cybernetics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2029517350", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["61058347", "17621549", "42196865", "16329458", "12778426", "31598921", "5927192", "37791728", "14188212", "2246288", "45627695", "21340845", "2743389", "84119766", "59798950", "15960971", "7262799", "22296787", "117092742", "16472569", "14863127", "320933", "115306515", "56527940", "36548280", "13373306", "41178407", "1400872", "43418053", "82819350", "22932306", "5262616", "5758379", "115883524", "38147899", "22558568", "1666829"], "inbound_citations": ["125243808", "12817376", "3214220", "6980609", "18871870", "2436059", "5876945", "12455739", "1132928", "12074238", "14863432", "15572741", "14846233", "16217535", "26923859", "3856296", "11969816", "13943490", "10511157", "36088443", "6054750", "16824037", "903460", "16671520", "1108515", "22543803", "8030364", "2073780", "11414176", "33299867", "4677155", "19019440", "11827181", "9795899", "18733297", "61892943", "110584415", "2043533", "18262205", "12030982", "2636955", "28626196", "9834758", "18236386", "52261738", "20318816", "9256117", "4945064", "28731927", "212681252", "46898851", "6167798", "14465254", "17105209", "14492485", "23091171", "122855448", "53413135", "5498913", "54493662", "10264834", "14091863", "3104794", "1360269", "2517260", "15565240", "15631650", "5995083", "10932350", "35782645", "15935226", "15066954", "6504766", "37432209", "61567862", "184466660", "6832681", "214833548", "9515801", "2521636", "215625153", "53319809", "6859767", "18111035", "8209524", "354913", "11169936", "16232239", "215205811", "2305204", "14190870", "14693618", "10345565", "8470242", "15630731", "15812890", "11159187", "649295", "53556084", "17978942", "211526347", "14205038", "8157957", "2075022", "5071611", "67373064", "211560509", "15554089", "7417240", "12464873", "17864429", "13419840", "16437839", "13972290", "5178299", "23301972", "3446481", "24683464", "30132547", "15844545", "2000113", "1798276", "1801481", "858461", "15013831", "18767159", "17345833", "16541356", "17317828", "7207018", "215555388", "16567248", "10456330", "2875994", "55690251", "16376934", "15984112", "2431443", "43272588", "14286351", "16850869", "8197007", "13998583", "18326502", "17746183", "4324370", "14050655", "57108406", "17940666", "20889363", "12159469", "775807", "410145", "10686632", "17945596", "375850", "1808121", "2752141", "16265005", "18080532", "25922523", "29975929", "125832520", "15669956", "15579398", "7380861", "25817173", "17906855", "85038783", "49227088", "41030658", "19107988", "3275562", "57754571", "15779425", "54905881", "15952703", "11229175", "49571655", "206658498", "18393149", "108257826", "14962724", "18781453", "20333376", "16028707", "15032055", "6292953", "5738086", "13986580", "6032830", "17464287", "16885185", "14291777", "162181422", "5572616", "13418365", "14126103", "8245545", "46974859", "7549259", "8180633", "59525933", "17120106", "65282178", "43395637", "2052410", "5342278", "22234494", "14501533", "1677445", "28597129", "49338957", "10673945", "53628423", "17330369", "22874745", "6779784"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6670632"}

Starting with the background knowledge represented by a propositional logic program, a translation algorithm is applied generating a neural network that can be trained with examples. The results obtained with this refined network can be explained by extracting a revised logic program from it. Moreover, the neural network computes the stable model of the logic program inserted in it as background knowledge, or learned with the examples, thus functioning as a parallel system for Logic Programming.

In this paper, we are motivated to explore the key features that can classify and describe the behaviors of Android malware families to enable fingerprinting the malware families with these features. We present a framework for signature-based key feature construction. In addition, we propose a frequency-based feature elimination algorithm to select the key features. Finally, we construct the fingerprints of ten malware families, including twenty key features in three categories.

As the amount of dopamine decreases, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease emerge. Parkinson's disease is a slow-developing disease, and symptoms such as hands, arms, legs, chin and face tremors are increasing over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty in walking and speaking. There is no definitive treatment for Parkinson's disease; however, with the help of some drugs, the symptoms of the disease can be reduced. Although there is no definitive treatment for Parkinson's disease, the patient can continue his normal life by controlling the problems caused by the disease. At this point, it is important to prevent early detection and progression of the disease. In this study, different types of classification methods such as Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest are compared in order to predict Parkinson's disease. A total of 1208 speech data sets consisting of 26 features obtained from Parkinson's patients and non-patients were used in the classification stage. The feature space of the dataset is expanded due to correlation maps. These correlation maps are constructed with the features which are obtained by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Information Gain (IG) and all features respectively.

Promptly recognizing wafer map defects is an effective way to increase manufacturing process stability and then to improve yields. Deep learning has been widely applied and obtained many successes in image and visual analysis. This paper proposes an effective deep learning method, enhanced stacked denoising autoencoder (ESDAE) with manifold regularization for wafer map pattern recognition (WMPR) in manufacturing processes. This study will concentrate on developing a deep learning model to learn effective discriminative features from wafer maps through a deep network architecture for WMPR improvement. An indication based on ESDAE is developed for detecting map defects online. An ESDAE-based classifier is finally developed to implement recognition of wafer map defects. The most motivation for developing deep learning and manifold regularization techniques is to achieve higher accuracy and applicability than that of some regular recognizers.

This problem is solved by a two-step process: data capturing using impractical, intrusive and expensive devices that is then used as input in complex models for obtaining the biomechanical variables of interest. In this work we present a first step towards capturing input data through a more automated, non-intrusive and economic process, specifically weight held by an arm subject to isometric contraction as a measure of muscular effort. We do so, by processing RGB images of the arm with computer vision (Local Binary Patterns and Color Histograms) and estimating the effort with machine learning algorithms (SVM and Random Forests). In the best case we obtained an FMeasure \\(=70.68\\,\\%\\), an Accuracy \\(=71.66\\,\\%\\) and a mean absolute error in the predicted weights of 554.16 grs (over 3 possible levels of effort). Considering the difficulty of the problem, it is enlightening to achieve over random results indicating that, despite the simplicity of the approach, it is possible to extract meaningful information for the predictive task.

It is proportional to the decrease in tree accuracy, estimated on the out-of-bag (OOB) samples, when permuting a particular variable. Such multivariate index takes into account the interactions between variables but is not straightforward to interpret in a statistical sense. In particular, it is hard to decide which variables are statistically significant and, specifically, to assign a p-value to such a decision. We proposed a statistical procedure to measure variable importance, that tests if variables are significantly useful in combination with others in a forest in (Paul et al. 2013). The importance J_\u03c7\u00b2 of a variable is defined as the p-value, corrected for multiple testing, that the tree class vote distribution changes when permuting the feature. Those changes are estimated on the OOB samples and assessed by a Pearson's chi squared test. The outputted p-values offer a natural threshold to decide which features are statistically significant. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real high-dimensional datasets show that J_\u03c7\u00b2 correctly identifies relevant variables provided a large number of trees (typically 10,000). The feature ranking is also largely correlated with Breiman's index. Further analyses (Paul and Dupont, 2014) compare J_\u03c7\u00b2 to two alternative procedures proposed in (Huynh-Thu et al. 2012): 1Probe and mr-Test. They also allow to convert Breiman's importance into p-values. However, they are conceptually and computationally more complex than J_\u03c7\u00b2. Indeed, they resort on a resampling process that repeatedly builds RFs in order to estimate a null importance distribution from which p-values can be computed. Since J_\u03c7\u00b2 is directly estimated on the OOB samples with no need of additional resamplings, it appears that it requires an order of magnitude less trees than the two other approaches to yield similar sets of selected variables. One potential drawback of J_\u03c7\u00b2 is that the assumption of independence of the J_\u03c7\u00b2 test may become strongly violated when growing forest with exceedingly many trees while the number of independent samples in the dataset is left unchanged. One can address this potential issue by considering a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test while providing similar results to J_\u03c7\u00b2. We also evaluate here alternative statistical procedures based on the tree accuracy distributions with and without permuting variables. To sum up, we study several RF feature importance indices with the objective of relating them to well defined statistical tests. Such relation offers a statistical interpretation of those indices after translating them into p-values. It also provides a natural threshold to highlight relevant variables. Practical experiments, both on artificial and real data from DNA microarrays, show that one is able to retrieve important variables while drastically reducing the computational cost of recently proposed alternatives.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1755340045", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:120063308"}

Its applications in real-world assessments, however, have been lagging behind its theoretical development. Reasons include but are not limited to requirement of large sample size, computational complexity, and lack of model fit. In this article, the authors propose to use the support vector machine (SVM), a popular supervised learning method to make classification decisions on each attribute (i.e., if the student masters the attribute or not), given a training dataset. By using the SVM, the problem of fitting and calibrating a cognitive diagnostic model (CDM) is converted into a quadratic optimization problem in hyperdimensional space. A classification boundary is obtained from the training dataset and applied to new test takers. The present simulation study considers the training sample size, the error rate in the training sample, the underlying CDM, as well as the structural parameters in the underlying CDM. Results indicate that by using the SVM, classification accuracy rates are comparable with those obtained from previous studies at both the attribute and pattern levels with much smaller sample sizes. The method is also computationally efficient.

Materials and Methods This study consisted of 128 ICC patients. We focused on evaluating six pathological features: microvascular invasion, perineural invasion, differentiation, Ki-67, vascular endothelial growth factor, and cytokeratin 7. Region of interest (ROI) of ICC was identified by manually plotting the tumor contour on the grayscale US image. We extracted radiomics features from medical US imaging. Then, dimensionality reduction methods and classifiers were used to develop radiomic signatures for evaluating six pathological features in ICC. Finally, independent validation datasets were used to assess the radiomic signatures performance. Results We extracted 1076 quantitative characteristic parameters on the US medicine images. Based on extracted radiomics features, the best performing radiomic signatures for evaluating microvascular invasion features were produced by hypothetical test + support vector machine (SVM), perineural invasion subgroup were least absolute shrinkage and selection operator + principal component analysis + support vector machine, differentiation subgroup were hypothetical test + decision tree, Ki-67 subgroup were hypothetical test + logistic regression, vascular endothelial growth factor subgroup were hypothetical test + Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and cytokeratin 7 subgroup were hypothetical test + bagging, respectively.

However, few studies have focused on improving LST downscaling in arid regions (especially in deserts) because of inaccurate remote sensing LST products. In this study, LST was downscaled by a random forest model between LST and multiple remote sensing indices (such as soil-adjusted vegetation index, normalized multi-band drought index, modified normalized difference water index, and normalized difference building index) in an arid region with an oasis\u2013desert ecotone. The proposed downscaling approach, which involves the selection of remote sensing indices, was evaluated using LST derived from the MODIS LST product of Zhangye City in Heihe Basin. The spatial resolution of MODIS LST was downscaled from 1 km to 500 m. Results of visual and quantitative analyses show that the distribution of downscaled LST matched that of the oasis and desert ecosystem. The lowest (approximately 22 \u00b0C) and highest temperatures (higher than 37 \u00b0C) were detected in the middle oasis and desert regions, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieves relatively satisfactory downscaling results, with coefficient of determination and root mean square error of 0.84 and 2.42 \u00b0C, respectively. The proposed approach shows higher accuracy and minimization of the MODIS LST in the desert region compared with other methods. Optimal availability occurs in the vegetated region during summer and autumn. In addition, the approach is also efficient and reliable for LST downscaling of Landsat images.

In this work, we present a Locus-specific Retention Predictor (LsRP) for precise prediction of peptide RT, which is based on amino acid locus information and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm. Corresponding to amino acid locus, each peptide sequence was converted to a featured locus vector consisting of zeros and ones. With locus vector information from LC-MS/MS data sets, an SVR computational process was trained and evaluated. LsRP finally provided a prediction correlation coefficient of 0.95~0.99. We compared our method with two common predictors. Results showed that LsRP outperforms these methods and tracked up to 30% extra peptides in an extraction RT window of 2 min.

Transfer learning (TL), a method of reusing knowledge which has been gained in one task to improve the performance in another, has been used to speed up learning in single RL agent systems. TL requires learning on a source task to complete before transferring it to a target task, i.e., transfer is done offline. Parallel Transfer Learning (PTL), a technique which enables the source and target tasks to run concurrently, has been proposed to enable online transfers. However, the online selection of knowledge to be transferred, as well as online ways of integration of that knowledge on the receiving agents remain open issues. This paper proposes methods for selecting the knowledge to be transferred in PTL, frequency and size of transfers, and methods for knowledge integration into the target task.

Gradient boosting is an additive expansion algorithm in which a series of models are trained sequentially to approximate a given function. A one hidden layer neural network can also be seen as an additive model where the scalar product of the responses of the hidden layer and its weights provide the final output of the network. Instead of training the network as a whole, the proposed algorithm trains the network sequentially in $T$ steps. First, the bias term of the network is initialized with a constant approximation that minimizes the average loss of the data. Then, at each step, a portion of the network, composed of $K$ neurons, is trained to approximate the pseudo-residuals on the training data computed from the previous iteration. Finally, the $T$ partial models and bias are integrated as a single NN with $T \\times K$ neurons in the hidden layer. We show that the proposed algorithm is more robust to overfitting than a standard neural network with respect to the number of neurons of the last hidden layer. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method design permits to reduce the number of neurons to be used without a significant reduction of its generalization ability. This permits to adapt the model to different classification speed requirements on the fly.

Prominent applications of such programs have been concerned with determining \u201cstructure-activity\u201d relationships in the areas of molecular biology and chemistry. Typically the task here is to predict the \u201cactivity\u201d of a compound (for example, toxicity), from its chemical structure. A summary of the research in the area is: (a) ILP programs have largely been restricted to qualitative predictions of activity (\u201chigh\u201d, \u201clow\u201d etc.)s (b) When appropriate attributes are available, ILP programs have equivalent predictivity to standard quantitative analysis techniques like linear regression. However ILP programs usually perform better when such attributes are unavailables and (c) By using structural information as background knowledge, an ILP program can provide comprehensible explanations for biological activity. This paper examines the use of ILP programs as a method of \u201cdiscovering\u201d new attributes. These attributes could then be used by methods like linear regression, thus allowing for quantitative predictions while retaining the ability to use structural information as background knowledge. Using structure-activity tasks as a test-bed, the utility of ILP programs in constructing new features was evaluated by examining the prediction of biological activity using linear regression, with and without the aid of ILP learnt logical attributes. In three out of the five data sets examined the addition of ILP attributes produced statistically better results. In addition six important structural features that have escaped the attention of the expert chemists were discovered. The method used here to construct new attributes is not specific to the problem of predicting biological activity, and the results obtained suggest a wider role for ILP programs in aiding the process of scientific discovery.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1023/A:1009815821645", "venue": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery", "journal": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1619260253", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["26736242", "60993494", "16334652", "44869423", "19990980", "7042570", "59726352", "52866062", "122946044", "28746278", "10571081", "15772014", "16875156", "607255", "9380408", "1122828", "36237350", "7523281", "18018701", "61536073", "35312999", "12643399", "16762143", "6183510", "14992676", "59857647", "62688491", "12312264", "10116897", "7940424", "5275805", "15680189", "10537848", "125134461", "119951166", "5899434"], "inbound_citations": ["18720761", "14778859", "14546274", "904005", "29828273", "15680189", "1437368", "15574267", "6559378", "5471491", "115864364", "5871816", "14181563", "2365814", "18355880", "6471341", "14184740", "13325475", "16293514", "17731438", "7459116", "16875314", "23324426", "17395555", "15030110", "195882891", "16104731", "166721", "6138108", "39944625", "30642293", "14343698", "18843561", "15879659", "2127626", "7266473", "11123158", "6517579", "7395900", "2534946", "1526216", "17107296", "14927835", "2211677", "16658265", "2763853", "14187512", "242887", "20180158", "889128", "6985751", "14363594", "18615641", "34028114", "14776251", "2777903", "16954790", "14535491", "4302025", "11261417", "27293359"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15680189"}

In this paper, two artificial intelligence techniques, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a genetic algorithm (GA), were used to optimize the SVM model parameters. Data regarding meteorological variables (e.g., ambient temperature and wind direction) and the NH3 concentration levels were employed to develop our two models. The simulation results indicate that both PSO-SVM and GA-SVM methods are effective tools to model the NH3 concentration levels and can yield good prediction performance based on statistical evaluation criteria. PSO-SVM provides higher retrieval accuracy and faster running speed than GA-SVM. In addition, we used the PSO-SVM technique to estimate 17 drop-off NH3 concentration values. We obtained forecasting results with good fitting characteristics to a measured curve. This proved that PSO-SVM is an effective method for estimating unavailable NH3 concentration data at 3, 4, 5, and 6 parts per billion (ppb), respectively. A 4-ppb NH3 concentration had the optimum prediction performance of the simulation results.

Furthermore, recent events have highlighted awareness that chemical and biological agents (CBAs) may become the preferred, cheap alternative WMD, because these agents can effectively attack large populations while leaving infrastructures intact. Despite the availability of numerous sensing devices, intelligent hybrid sensors that can detect and degrade CBAs are virtually nonexistent. This paper reports the integration of multi-array sensors with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for the detection of organophosphates nerve agents using parathion and dichlorvos as model stimulants compounds. SVMs were used for the design and evaluation of new and more accurate data extraction, preprocessing and classification. Experimental results for the paradigms developed using Structural Risk Minimization, show a significant increase in classification accuracy when compared to the existing AromaScan baseline system. Specifically, the results of this research has demonstrated that, for the Parathion versus Dichlorvos pair, when compared to the AromaScan baseline system: (1) a 23% improvement in the overall ROC Az index using the S2000 kernel, with similar improvements with the Gaussian and polynomial (of degree 2) kernels, (2) a significant 173% improvement in specificity with the S2000 kernel. This means that the number of false negative errors were reduced by 173%, while making no false positive errors, when compared to the AromaScan base line performance. (3) The Gaussian and polynomial kernels demonstrated similar specificity at 100% sensitivity.

We evaluated the role of different CpGs from multiple genes as methylation biomarkers for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).ResultsWe applied a mass spectrometry-based platform to survey the quantitative methylation levels of 34 CpG units from SOX1, PAX1, NKX6-1, LMX1A, and ONECUT1 genes in 100 cervical formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. We then used nonparametric statistics and Random Forest algorithm to rank significant CpG methylations and support vector machine with 10-fold cross validation and 200 times bootstrap resampling to build a predictive model separating CIN II/III from CIN I/normal subjects. We found only select CpG units showed significant differences in methylation between CIN II/III and CIN I/normal groups, while mean methylation levels per gene were similar between the two groups for each gene except PAX1. An optimal classification model involving five CpG units from SOX1, PAX1, NKX6-1, and LMX1A achieved 81.2% specificity, 80.4% sensitivity, and 80.8% accuracy.ConclusionsOur study suggested that during CIN development, the methylation of CpGs within CpG islands is not uniform, with varying degrees of significance as biomarkers.

Expanding on previous analysis that identified sensitive plant species, we extracted data from 45 articles published between 1996 and 2016 that included 169 experimental case studies of plant response to RF-EMF. Raw-data from these case studies included six different attributes: frequency, specific absorption rate (SAR), power flux density, electric field strength, exposure time and plant type (species). This dataset has been tested with two different classification algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Random Forest (RF). The outputs are estimated using k-fold cross-validation method to identify and compare classifier mean accuracy and computation time. We also developed an optimization technique to distinguish the trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation time based on the classification algorithm. Our analysis illustrates kNN (91.17%) and RF (89.41%) perform similarly in terms of mean accuracy, nonetheless, kNN takes less computation time (3.38 s) to train a model compared to RF (248.12 s). Very strong correlations were observed between SAR and frequency, and SAR with power flux density and electric field strength. Despite the low sample size (169 reported experimental case studies), that limits statistical power, nevertheless, this analysis indicates that ML algorithms applied to bioelectromagnetics literature predict impacts of key plant health parameters from specific RF-EMF exposures. This paper addresses both questions of the methodological importance and relative value of different methods of ML and the specific finding of impacts of RF-EMF on specific measures of plant growth and health.

Specifically, the transfer approximator maps the state of the target task symmetrically to states of the source task with a certain mapping rule, and activates the related knowledge (components of the action-value function) of the source task as the input of the ANNs; it then predicts the quality of the actions in the target task with the ANNs. The target learner uses the PPR scheme to bias the RL with the suggested action from the transfer approximator. In this way, the transfer approximator builds a symmetric knowledge path between the target task and the source task. In addition, two mapping rules for the transfer approximator are designed, namely, Full Mapping Rule and Group Mapping Rule. Experiments performed on the RoboCup soccer Keepaway task verified that the proposed transfer learning methods outperform two other transfer learning methods in both jumpstart and time to threshold metrics and are more robust to the quality of source knowledge.

Inclusion of appropriate sensors and modifying the geometry of an already existing open channel in the transport of drilling fluids are possible approaches for estimating the flowrate of the drilling fluid. Forming a Venturi flume in the already existing open channel structure of the transporting conduit for the drilling fluid offers some interesting possibilities. Using a set of three ultrasonic level meters for determining the levels at various points in the open channel and fusing the data from other sensors in the test loop, the flow rate in a Venturi channel is successfully estimated.

The overfit of an algorithm is the degree to which the concept learned is representative of the data available at the time the learning takes place, but not of the mechanism which generated the data. ::: In the context of classification, the overfit is expressed as the difference between the degree of success of classification of the training set and that of the classification of a test set. ::: This dissertation deals with the analysis of the overfit behavior of several classes of classification algorithms. The analysis provides insight into the sources of overfit and yields bounds which can be used to control the overfit of some well-known algorithms, such as classification trees, the perceptron and edited nearest neighbors. ::: The structure of the dissertation is as follows: Chapter 2 gives definitions and formalizations together with informal remarks. A probabilistic formulation of the problem of learning from examples is given, and some widely used algorithms are presented. ::: Chapter 3 contains a brief overview of the Vapnik-Cervonenkis (VC) theory. The VC theory, dating back to the end of the 1960's, gives a very satisfactory analysis of the overfit behavior of a class of algorithms known as risk minimization algorithms. The techniques introduced in this seminal theory are used in obtaining some of the results of this dissertation. ::: Chapter 4 presents a new result describing the overfit behavior for a class of algorithms that is not covered by the VC framework. Chapter 5 utilizes the result of Chapter 4 to provide some more refined results for a special type of algorithms. These are algorithms that use a sequence of local searches, rather than one global search, to obtain the trained classifier.

Once the protein is targeted correctly in the cell, the SP is cleaved, releasing the mature protein. Accurate prediction of the presence of these short amino-acid SP chains is crucial for modelling the topology of membrane proteins, since SP sequences can be confused with transmembrane domains due to similar composition of hydrophobic amino acids. This paper presents a cascaded Support Vector Machine (SVM)-Neural Network (NN) classification methodology for SP discrimination and cleavage site identification. The proposed method utilises a dual phase classification approach using SVM as a primary classifier to discriminate SP sequences from Non-SP. The methodology further employs NNs to predict the most suitable cleavage site candidates. In phase one, a SVM classification utilises hydrophobic propensities as a primary feature vector extraction using symmetric sliding window amino-acid sequence analysis for discrimination of SP and Non-SP. In phase two, a NN classification uses asymmetric sliding window sequence analysis for prediction of cleavage site identification. The proposed SVM-NN method was tested using Uni-Prot non-redundant datasets of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins with SP and Non-SP N-termini. Computer simulation results demonstrate an overall accuracy of 0.90 for SP and Non-SP discrimination based on Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) tests using SVM. For SP cleavage site prediction, the overall accuracy is 91.5% based on cross-validation tests using the novel SVM-NN model.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24480169", "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.11.017", "venue": "Computers in biology and medicine", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1994398083", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["21946516", "6858687", "93621470", "9948906", "36224301", "25150743", "28885921", "22976935", "3066664", "15390763", "6759682", "15384421", "17794879", "9235187", "23423836", "9194103", "7830956", "7710224", "13701548", "48822883", "28545480", "4469531", "21650959", "52798249", "16509924", "36284193", "24027251", "7884361", "14529569", "7377854", "13435250", "34476522", "88744704", "84092027", "13742100", "6017311", "11000285", "35202496", "19791752", "86426456", "206787478"], "inbound_citations": ["52152908", "46236241", "23665392"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15138822"}

This new approach promises to give better therapeutic measurements to cancer patients by diagnosing cancer types with improved accuracy. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the classification methods successfully applied to the cancer diagnosis problems. However, its optimal extension to more than two classes was not obvious, which might impose limitations in its application to multiple tumor types. We briefly introduce the Multicategory SVM, which is a recently proposed extension of the binary SVM, and apply it to multiclass cancer diagnosis problems. Results: Its applicability is demonstrated on the leukemia data (Golub et al., 1999) and the small round blue cell tumors of childhood data (Khan et al. ,2 001). Comparable classification accuracy shown in the applications and its flexibility render the MSVM a viable alternative to other classification methods.

Available computational methods for word recognition do not perform as well on spontaneous speech as we would hope. Even a state of the art recognizer achieves slightly worse than 70\\% word accuracy on (nearly) spontaneous speech in a conversation about a specific problem. .pp To address this problem, I will explore novel methods for post-processing the output of a speech recognizer in order to correct errors. I adopt statistical techniques for modeling the noisy channel from the speaker to the listener in order to correct some of the errors introduced there. The statistical model accounts for frequent errors such as simple word/word confusions and short phrasal problems (one-to-many word substitutions and many-to-one word concatenations). To use the model, a search algorithm is required to find the most likely correction of a given word sequence from the speech recognizer. The post-processor output should contain fewer errors, thus making interpretation by higher levels, such as parsing, more reliable. .pp Spontaneous speech is also challenging to process because it is more incremental than written language. Utterances frequently form brief phrases and fragments rather than full sentences; they tend to come in installments and refinements. Known methods for parsing do not perform as well as we would like in the face of these linguistic ambiguities and idiosyncrasies. Even state of the art algorithms for parsing spontaneous language sustain high error rates. .pp To address the incrementality of spontaneously spoken utterances, I will develop methods for segmenting a given utterance into ``chunks'''' representing individual thoughts. Given an utterance of spontaneous speech, a tool for automatic prosodic feature extraction will analyze the output of the error-correcting post-processor and the acoustic waveform to generate prosodic cues. These cues will aid a robust parser using a prosody-wise grammar to identify the incremental phrases in the utterance and to provide a syntactic analysis. .pp These components will augment the {\\sc Trains-95} conversational planning assistant.", "year": 1995, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "IEEE, Bob O'Hara and Al", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1525797625", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["6528206", "9115562", "2496958"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60607031"}

We carry out a rigorous comparison of five MLAs: Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks, in the context of a supervised lithology classification task using widely available and spatially constrained remotely sensed geophysical data. We make a further comparison of MLAs based on their sensitivity to variations in the degree of spatial clustering of training data, and their response to the inclusion of explicit spatial information (spatial coordinates). Our work identifies Random Forests as a good first choice algorithm for the supervised classification of lithology using remotely sensed geophysical data. Random Forests is straightforward to train, computationally efficient, highly stable with respect to variations in classification model parameter values, and as accurate as, or substantially more accurate than the other MLAs trialed. The results of our study indicate that as training data becomes increasingly dispersed across the region under investigation, MLA predictive accuracy improves dramatically. The use of explicit spatial information generates accurate lithology predictions but should be used in conjunction with geophysical data in order to generate geologically plausible predictions.

In this paper, we consider the problem of inferring social relations in collaboration networks, such as the fields that researchers collaborate in, or the categories of projects that Github users work on together. Social relation inference can be formalized as a multi-label classification problem on graph edges, but many popular algorithms for semi-supervised learning on graphs only operate on the nodes of a graph. To bridge this gap, we propose a principled method which leverages the natural homophily present in collaboration networks. First, observing that the fields of collaboration for two people are usually at the intersection of their interests, we transform an edge labeling into node labels. Second, we use a label propagation algorithm to propagate node labels in the entire graph. Once the label distribution for all nodes has been obtained, we can easily infer the label distribution for all edges.

In the proposed method, first, the classification of each data is separately performed using Support Vector Machine algorithm. In this case, extracted Normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) and pulse intensity are used in classification of LiDAR data, and three spectral visible bands (Red, Green, Blue) are considered as feature vector for the orthoimage classification. Moreover, combining the extracted features of the image and Lidar data another classification is also performed using all the features. The outputs of these classifications are integrated in a decision level fusion system according to the their confusion matrices to find the final classification result. The proposed method was evaluated using an urban area of Zeebruges, Belgium. The obtained results represented several advantages of image fusion with respect to a single shot dataset.

A handwriting sample consists of various types of features. These features are unique due to the writer\u2019s characteristics and individuality, which challenges the identification process. Some features do not provide useful information and may cause to decrease the performance of a classifier. Thus, feature selection process is implemented in WI process. Feature selection is a process to identify and select the most significant features from presented features in handwriting documents and to eliminate the irrelevant features. Due to the WI framework, discretization process is applied before the feature selection process. Discretization process was proven to increase the classification performances and improved the identification performance in WI. An algorithm and framework of Improved Random Forest (IRF) tree was applied for feature selection process. RF tree is a collection of tree predictors used to ensemble decision tree models with a randomized selection of features at each split. It involved Classification and Regression Tree (CART) during the development of tree. Important features are measured by using Variable Importance (VI). While Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values use to identify the variance between writers, VI value was used for splitting process in tree and MAE value is to ensure the intra-class (same writer) invariance is lower than inter-class (different writer) invariance because lower intra-class invariance indicates accuracy to the real author. Number of selected features and the classification accuracy is used to indicate the performances of feature selection method. Experimental results have shown that the performances of IRF tree in discretized dataset produced third feature (f3) as the most important feature with average classification accuracy 99.19%.

Methods The headset used for this purpose comprises of an EEG cap which has a total of 16 electrodes connected out of which 14 electrodes are used for acquiring data and the rest 2 are used as ground and reference. To operate the wheelchair the subject has to place the cap on his/her head and different facial expressions (clench, smile, blink, etc.) are performed. The movement of muscles around the face due to facial expressions can be observed from the EEG signals being recorded. Each expression is linked to movement of the wheelchair. Signal is preprocessed to remove the artifacts and then features are extracted using Fast Fourier Transform.

The information processing method is experimentally demonstrated with a non-linear Schmitt trigger oscillator. A neuronally inspired concept called reservoir computing has been implemented. The synchronization frequency prediction tasks are utilized as benchmarks to reduce the computational load. The oscillator's oscillation frequency is affected by the sensor input, further affecting the storage pattern of the oscillatory neural network. This paper proposes a method of information processing by training and modulating the weights of the intrinsic electronic neural network to achieve the next step prediction. The effects on the frequency of a single oscillator in a coupled oscillatory neural network are studied under asynchronous and synchronization modes.

However, low-frequency soot blowing can cause heat transfer efficiency to decrease. High-frequency soot blowing not only wastes high-pressure steam, but also abrades surface pipes, reducing the working life of a heat exchange device. Therefore, it is necessary to design an online ash fouling monitoring system to perform soot blowing that is dependent on the status of ash accumulation. This study presents an online monitoring model of ash-layer thermal resistance that reflects the degree of ash fouling. A wavelet threshold denoising algorithm was applied to smooth the thermal resistance of the ash layer calculated by the heat balance mechanism model. Thus, the variation in thermal resistance becomes more visible, which is more conducive to optimizing the operation of soot blowing. The designed Support Vector Regression (SVR) model could achieve the online prediction of thermal resistance denoising for low-temperature superheaters. Experimental analysis indicates that the prediction accuracy was 98.5% during the testing phase.

In this paper, we present a novel feature-augmented random forest (FARF) for image super-resolution, where the conventional gradient-based features are augmented with gradient magnitudes and different feature recipes are formulated on different stages in an RF. The advantages of our method are that, firstly, the dictionary-learning-based features are enhanced by adding gradient magnitudes, based on the observation that the non-linear gradient magnitude are with highly discriminative property. Secondly, generalized locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is used to replace principal component analysis (PCA) for feature dimensionality reduction and original high-dimensional features are employed, instead of the compressed ones, for the leaf-nodes' regressors, since regressors can benefit from higher dimensional features. This original-compressed coupled feature sets scheme unifies the unsupervised LSH evaluation on both image super-resolution and content-based image retrieval (CBIR). Finally, we present a generalized weighted ridge regression (GWRR) model for the leaf-nodes' regressors.

This usually relies on two critical assumptions: firstly, sufficient labeled training data are available; secondly, training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution and the same feature space. Unfortunately, in most cases, the actual situation is difficult to meet the above conditions. Transfer learning scheme is naturally proposed to alleviate this problem. In order to get robust classifiers with relatively lower computational costs, we incorporate the rationale of Support Vector Machine (SVM) into transfer learning scheme and propose a novel SVM-based transfer learning model, abbreviated as TrSVM. In this method, support vector sets are extracted to represent the source domain. New training datasets are respectively constructed by combining each support vector set and target labeled dataset. On the basis of these training datasets, a number of new base classifiers can be acquired. Since performance of a classifiers ensemble is generally superior to that of individual classifiers, ensemble selection is utilized in our work. A hybrid transfer learning algorithm, integrating the Genetic Algorithm based Selective Ensemble (GASEN) with TrSVM, is proposed, and abbreviated as TrGASVM, naturally. GASEN is a genetic algorithm-based heuristic algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It can not only enhance the generalization ability of an ensemble, but also alleviate the local minimum problem of greedy ensemble pruning methods. Since TrGASVM is under frame of TrSVM and GASEN, it inevitably inherits the advantages of both algorithms. The reasonable incorporation of TrSVM with GASEN endows TrGASVM with favorable transfer learning capability, with its effectiveness being demonstrated by the experimental results on three real-world text classification datasets.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2019.03.027", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.", "journal": "Pattern Recognit.", "mag_id": "2932279522", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132287871"}

Tools based on RST are found to be useful in addressing data mining tasks such as classification, clustering and rule mining. In RST all computations are performed directly on the supplied data and works by making use of the granularity structure of the data. Association rules, which play an important role in data mining, provide associations among attributes and generally they are helpful for decision making. A problem of using conventional association rule algorithms is that too many rules are generated by these algorithms and it is very difficult to analyze these rules. This paper proposes a rough set based approach to generate rules from an inconsistent information system consisting of the preprocessed data collected from coconut cultivators of the Keezhur Chavassery Grama Panchayath using stratified random sampling method. An existing algorithm, namely, Learning from Examples Module version 2 (LEM2) is modified to incorporate some conditions, leading to the generation of significant rules. By applying the proposed algorithm, a set of significant rules are generated. These rules are expected to be helpful to the farmers of the state to design their farming plans, which will enable them to improve their coconut production.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCCET.2011.5762519", "venue": "2011 International Conference on Computer, Communication and Electrical Technology (ICCCET)", "journal": "2011 International Conference on Computer, Communication and Electrical Technology (ICCCET)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2132215025", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["46207399", "58242824", "116248009", "16592236", "16350143", "14236274", "12021388", "13409676", "13206070"], "inbound_citations": ["201833653", "64693984", "18388959"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7924365"}

The main problem is a large number of possible of authors, which hinders the effective identification of a true author.

We describe the task formally and present algorithms for constructing the suspected author list. For evaluation we propose using a simple Winner-Takes-All (WTA) metric as well as a set of gain-discount model based metrics from the information retrieval domain (mean reciprocal rank, discounted cumulative gain and rank-biased precision).

In order to achieve this, multiple methods have been proposed to determine semantic maps across concepts from different representations. Previous research has focused on developing different individual matching methods, i.e., ones that compute mapping based on a single matching measure. These efforts assume that some weighted combination can be used to obtain the overall maps. We analyze the problem of combination of multiple individual methods to determine requirements specific to product development and propose a solution approach called FEedback Matching Framework with Implicit Training (FEMFIT). FEMFIT provides the ability to combine the different matching approaches using ranking Support Vector Machine (ranking SVM). The method accounts for nonlinear relations between the individual matchers. It overcomes the need to explicitly train the algorithm before it is used, and further reduces the decision-making load on the domain expert by implicitly capturing the expert's decisions without requiring him to input real numbers on similarity. We apply FEMFIT to a subset of product constraints across a commercial system and the ISO standard.

Tensor factorization is a general form of matrix factorization that has been successfully exploited in recommendation systems that suggest items to users based on their existing preference on a small number of items. Our application, using Bayesian probabilistic modelling, extends the capacity of matrix factorization to model multiple relationships between and among targets and indications. We use the model to show that our predicted probabilities of success correlate with clinical phases, and within clinical phase we can predict which trials are most likely to succeed.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/272740", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2794287851", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["20246434", "14101836", "16074195", "12577605", "3950035", "1909293", "467086", "14937958", "14114345", "62425365", "7513918", "42639", "7955044", "4650265", "1723809", "3644962", "32678597", "89164831", "10415058", "8747241", "25393359", "22947725", "802377", "34369235", "13294219", "8118473"], "inbound_citations": ["91200317"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196633829"}

We formulate the study of drug specificity as a problem of predicting interactions between drugs and proteins at the proteome scale. We build several benchmark datasets, and propose NN-MT, a multi-task Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm that is trained on a limited number of data points, in order to solve the computational issues or proteome-wide SVM for chemogenomics. We compare NN-MT to different state-of-the-art methods, and show that its prediction performances are similar or better, at an efficient calculation cost. Compared to its competitors, the proposed method is particularly efficient to predict (protein, ligand) interactions in the difficult double-orphan case, i.e. when no interactions are previously known for the protein nor for the ligand.

Traditional ear recognition methods based on handcrafted features and conventional machine learning classifiers were the prominent techniques during the last two decades. Arguably, feature extraction is the crucial phase for the success of these methods due to the difficulty in designing robust features to cope with the variations in the given images. Currently, ear recognition research is shifting towards features extracted by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have the ability to learn more specific features robust to the wide image variations and achieving state-of-the-art recognition performance. This paper presents and compares ear recognition models built with handcrafted and CNN features. First, we experiment with seven top performing handcrafted descriptors to extract the discriminating ear image features and then train Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on the extracted features to learn a suitable model. Second, we introduce four CNN based models using a variant of the AlexNet architecture. The experimental results on three ear datasets show the superior performance of the CNN based models by 22%. To further substantiate the comparison, we perform visualization of the handcrafted and CNN features using the t-distributed Stochastic Neighboring Embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique and the characteristics of features are discussed.

Although deep learning-based segmentation methods have achieved great success in computer vision domain, there are still several challenges in medical image domain. In comparison with natural images, medical image databases are usually small because the annotation is extremely time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Thus, effective use of unannotated data is essential for medical image segmentation. On the other hand, medical images have many anatomical priors in comparison to non-medical images such as the shape and position of organs. Incorporating the anatomical prior knowledge in deep learning is a vital issue for accurate medical image segmentation. To address these two problems, in this paper we proposed a semi-supervised adversarial learning model with Deep Atlas Prior (DAP) to improve the accuracy of liver segmentation in CT images. We trained the semi-supervised adversarial learning model using both annotated and unannotated images. The DAP, which is based on the probability atlas of organ (liver) and contains prior information such as the shape and position, is combined with the conventional focal loss to aid segmentation. We call the combined loss as Bayesian loss and the conventional focal loss that utilizes the predicted probabilities of training data in the previous learning epoch as a likelihood loss. Experiments on ISBI LiTS 2017 challenge dataset showed that the performance of the semi-supervised network was significantly improved by incorporating with DAP.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-32226-7_17", "venue": "MICCAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2979792663", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204539397"}

Individual Fairness [Dwork, Hardt, Pitassi, Reingold, Zemel, 2012], which requires that similar individuals be treated similarly, is a highly appealing definition as it gives strong guarantees on treatment of individuals. Unfortunately, the need for a task-specific similarity metric has prevented its use in practice. In this work, we propose a solution to the problem of approximating a metric for Individual Fairness based on human judgments. Our model assumes that we have access to a human fairness arbiter, who can answer a limited set of queries concerning similarity of individuals for a particular task, is free of explicit biases and possesses sufficient domain knowledge to evaluate similarity. Our contributions include definitions for metric approximation relevant for Individual Fairness, constructions for approximations from a limited number of realistic queries to the arbiter on a sample of individuals, and learning procedures to construct hypotheses for metric approximations which generalize to unseen samples under certain assumptions of learnability of distance threshold functions.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1906.00250", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2947986740", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["168956", "1443041", "4724909", "13496699", "202772345", "8393813", "1769114", "1555909", "3426898", "3160690", "12845273", "55485900", "3814093", "7366085", "143452957", "9483520", "7482099", "15716784"], "inbound_citations": ["195816399", "204837871", "214802179", "214802179", "202539873"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:173990865"}

The principal objective of this multi-scale (core, well log, and regional) study is to use the petrophysical response of lithofacies defined in core from a very limited number of wells to identify different shale lithofacies in the Bakken Formation in the numerous and geographically extensive wells with wireline log suites. Shale lithofacies are defined in the core using quantitative mineralogy, Total Organic Carbon content, and petrophysical properties. These lithofacies are calibrated to advanced geochemical spectroscopy logs and conventional well logs at well scales. A machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine, is used to recognize the pattern of different shale lithofacies, associated with basic petrophysical parameters from ubiquitous conventional well log suites. Sequential Indicator Simulation is used to populate all lithofacies in a 3D grid, covering a large portion of the Williston basin in North Dakota. The results show that the Bakken shale members are vertically and laterally heterogeneous, but are successfully classified into five different lithofacies.

Using this temperature data, together with six landscape variables, we interpolated (using Kriging and Random Forest) air temperatures across the city for each collection period. Our results estimated temperatures with small mean square errors (ranging from 0.03 to 0.14); landscape metrics explained between 60 and 91% of temperature variations (higher when the previous day\u2019s average temperatures were included as a variable). For all days, similar spatial patterns appeared for cooler and warmer areas in mornings, with distinctive patterns as landscapes warmed during the day and over successive days. Our results revealed that the most potent landscape variables vary according to season and time of day. Our analysis contributes new dimensions and new levels of spatial and temporal detail to urban microclimate research.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2016/8736263", "venue": null, "journal": "Advances in Meteorology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1944494962", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["56566635", "129485216", "122734066", "129454711", "128472514", "129630839", "84488117", "129914119", "11228593", "56574198", "140545055", "21819830", "13843872", "109387608", "128469384", "130629354", "123540670", "120387039", "119753135", "110419638", "25719853", "16713557", "54058030", "55712836", "55389131", "89141", "125893266"], "inbound_citations": ["47021136"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55912295"}

This algorithm introduces simulated annealing ideas into Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which adopts cooling process functions to replace the inertia weight function and constructs the time variant inertia weight function featured in annealing mechanism. Meanwhile, it employs the APSO procedure to search for the optimized resolution of Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) for image reconstruction. In order to overcome the soft field characteristics of ECT sensitivity field, some image samples with typical flow patterns are chosen for training with LS-SVM. Under the training procedure, the capacitance error caused by the soft field characteristics is predicted, and then is used to construct the fitness function of the particle swarm optimization on basis of the capacitance error. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed SAP algorithm has a quick convergence rate. Moreover, the proposed SAP outperforms the classic Landweber algorithm and Newton-Raphson algorithm on image reconstruction.

Using modern machine learning techniques, it is generally becoming easier to build complex models to predict the future. For those models, a set of past information are used to make explanatory variables, however, we don9t have enough knowledge as to how long we should collect data backward. In some cases, very late tendencies are influencing the future status of disease while in the other cases, old events were the importance causes of the change of the disease status. Our interest thus lies in how old data we have to process to make the good prediction models. Method: In this paper, we discuss a set of machine learning algorithms to predict the diabetic nephropathy stage in the future using sets of input variables which were collected from different time span of past records. To compare the performance of algorithms we used Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Decision tree, Multi-layer Perceptron, and Random Forest. We then provide different set of variables of EHR that include past 30-, 60-, 90-, 180-, 210-, 240-, 270-, 300-, 330-, and 360-day data sets, from which we extracted several longitudinal statistics for input variables. From about 65 thousand type 2 diabetes patients, the models classify whether the nephropathy stage gets aggravated or stay in 180 days. Results: For almost all algorithms, AUC is getting improved when using older data, and 360-day data sets gave the best. Among the algorithms, Gradient Boosting gave the best AUC of 0.77 when using 360-day data set. When using 360-day data sets, Decision Tree gave worst AUC of 0.61. Conclusion: We observed that when using to past data up to 360 days, the oldest data set gave the best prediction performance. Longitudinal statistics in rather long span gives good explanatory information for future nephropathy development. Disclosure A. Koseki: Employee; Self; IBM. M. Ono: None. M.

In this paper, we modeled transcripts into complex networks and enriched them with word embedding (CNE) to better represent short texts produced in neuropsychological assessments. The network measurements were applied with well-known classifiers to automatically identify MCI in transcripts, in a binary classification task. A comparison was made with the performance of traditional approaches using Bag of Words (BoW) and linguistic features for three datasets: DementiaBank in English, and Cinderella and Arizona-Battery in Portuguese. Overall, CNE provided higher accuracy than using only complex networks, while Support Vector Machine was superior to other classifiers. CNE provided the highest accuracies for DementiaBank and Cinderella, but BoW was more efficient for the Arizona-Battery dataset probably owing to its short narratives.

The rise of informal code-switched multilingual languages makes it tough for automated systems to monitor instances of hate speech, which are further intelligently disguised through the use of spelling variations, code-mixing, homophones, homonyms, and the absence of sophisticated grammar rules. Machine transliteration can be employed for converting the code-switched text into a singular script but poses the challenge of the semantical breakdown of the text. To overcome this drawback, this chapter investigates the application of transfer learning. The CNN-based neural models are trained on a large dataset of hateful tweets in a chosen primary language, followed by retraining on the small transliterated dataset in the same language. Since transfer learning can act as an effective strategy to reuse already learned features in learning a specialized task through cross-domain knowledge transfer, hate speech classification on a large English corpus can act as source tasks to help in obtaining pre-trained deep learning classifiers for the target task of classifying tweets translated in English from other code-switched languages.

Failure of this significant infrastructure could affect important social, environmental, and economic impacts. Furthermore, recognizing the optimized timeline for inspection of sewer pipelines are challenging tasks for the utility managers and other authorities. Regular examination of sewer networks is not cost-effective due to limited time and high cost of assessment technologies and a large inventory of pipes. To avoid such obstacles, various researchers endeavored to improve infrastructure condition assessment methodologies to maintain sewer pipe systems at the desired condition. Sewer condition prediction models are developed to provide a framework to forecast the future condition of pipes to schedule inspection frequencies. The main goal of this study is to develop a predictive model for wastewater pipes using random forest classification. Predictive models can effectively predict sewer pipe condition and can increase the certainty level of the predictive results and decrease uncertainty in the current condition of wastewater pipes.

However when dealing with big search spaces the algorithm goes through several low function value regions before reaching the optimum of the function. Since the function evaluations are expensive in terms of both money and time, it may be desirable to alleviate this problem. One approach to subside this cold start phase is to use prior knowledge that can accelerate the optimisation. In its standard form, Bayesian optimisation assumes the likelihood of any point in the search space being the optimum is equal. Therefore any prior knowledge that can provide information about the optimum of the function would elevate the optimisation performance. In this paper, we represent the prior knowledge about the function optimum through a prior distribution. The prior distribution is then used to warp the search space in such a way that space gets expanded around the high probability region of function optimum and shrinks around low probability region of optimum. We incorporate this prior directly in function model (Gaussian process), by redefining the kernel matrix, which allows this method to work with any acquisition function, i.e. acquisition agnostic approach.

With the popularity of open source, an enormous amount of project source code can be accessed, and the exhaustiveness and instability of manually naming methods could now be relieved by automatically learning a naming model from a large code repository. Nevertheless, building a comprehensive naming system is still challenging, due to the gap between natural language functional descriptions and method names. Specifically, there are three challenges: how to model the relationship between the functional descriptions and formal method names, how to handle the explosion of vocabulary when dealing with large repositories, and how to leverage the knowledge learned from large repositories to a specific project. To answer these questions, we propose a neural network to directly generate readable method names from natural language description. The proposed method is built upon the encoder-decoder framework with the attention and copying mechanisms. Our experiments show that our method can generate meaningful and accurate method names and achieve significant improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline models.

As there are errors associated with the sensor, in addition to other uncertain factors, human motion sequential sensor data usually includes some irrelative and error features. To improve the recognition rate, an effective method is to reduce the amount of irrelative and error features from original sequential data. Feature selection methods for static situations, such as photo images, are widely used.

With aspect to this notion, incremental learners use incoming data to further train and adjust the existing models, rather to retrain them from the beginning. Both of the aforementioned approaches come with a number of advantages, which established them as promising techniques among researchers.

Furthermore, the proposed BayesCNN architecture is applied to tasks like Image Classification, Image Super-Resolution and Generative Adversarial Networks. The results are compared to point-estimates based architectures on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets for Image CLassification task, on BSD300 dataset for Image Super Resolution task and on CIFAR10 dataset again for Generative Adversarial Network task. ::: BayesCNN is based on Bayes by Backprop which derives a variational approximation to the true posterior.

An integrable fall detection sensor is an essential component toward achieving smart healthcare solutions. Traditional vision-based methods rely on tracking a skeleton and estimating the change in height of key body parts such as head, hips, and shoulders. These methods are often challenged by occluded body parts and abrupt posture changes. This paper presents a fall detection system consisting of a novel skeleton-free posture recognition method and an activity recognition stage. The posture recognition method analyzes local variations in depth pixels to identify the adopted posture. An input depth frame acquired using a Kinect-like sensor is densely represented using a depth comparison feature and fed to a random decision forest to discriminate among standing, sitting, and fallen postures.

Physicians work with patients to make difficult treatment decisions. They are often aided by a multitude of prognostic models to assess risk and predict outcomes. These survival analysis models may analyze features characterizing biomolecular and histomorphic properties of the solid tumor sample. Commonly, multiple samples per patient are analyzed and features are combined in some way to generate a single result, such as by taking the median measurement. Recently, support vector regression approaches paired with a semi-supervised transduction framework have proven powerful in building such prognostic models. Separately, there has been work presenting the use of interval kernels to capture the range of measurements across multiple samples as an \u201cinterval\u201d via the Hausdorff distance within a kernel based support vector approach. This paper presents the first results in exploring a combination of these two concepts. Namely, using an interval kernel based support vector approach within the aforementioned transduction framework to build prognostic models leveraging information from multiple tumor samples per patient. The results show that interval kernels yield more accurate prognostic models, and the semi\u2014supervised transduction framework further improves performance.

Further validation was performed in an independent cohort of 279 patients. High PAK6 expression was associated with poor prognosis and increased chemoresistance to 5-FU/oxaliplatin chemotherapy. The CS-SVM classifier distinguished patients with stage II and III GC into low- and high-CS-SVM groups, with significant differences in the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in chemotherapy patients. Moreover, chemotherapy significantly prolonged the DFS and OS of the high CS-SVM patients in the training and validation cohorts. In conclusion, PAK6 was an independent prognostic factor and increased chemoresistance.

In view of this global epidemic, there is an urgent need to facilitate fast and efficient lead identification methodologies. Target based screening of large compound libraries has been widely used as a fast and efficient approach for lead identification, but is restricted by the knowledge about the target structure.

The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as those provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for generating accurate datasets on available crop types, in ready-to-use vector data format. Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping, based on high resolution remote sensing data, are mainly focused on pixel-based analysis of time series data. This paper evaluates how a time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method that uses Sentinel-2 time series performs when applied to pixel-based and object-based classifications of various crop types in three different study areas (in Romania, Italy and the USA). The classification outputs were compared to those produced by Random Forest (RF) for both pixel- and object-based image analysis units. The sensitivity of these two methods to the training samples was also evaluated. Object-based TWDTW outperformed pixel-based TWDTW in all three study areas, with overall accuracies ranging between 78.05% and 96.19%; it also proved to be more efficient in terms of computational time. TWDTW achieved comparable classification results to RF in Romania and Italy, but RF achieved better results in the USA, where the classified crops present high intra-class spectral variability. Additionally, TWDTW proved to be less sensitive in relation to the training samples. This is an important asset in areas where inputs for training samples are limited.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2017.10.005", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2767953525", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207960263", "208039418", "52276017", "133838880", "204885365", "204445082", "201803656", "69406783", "202558411", "146187111", "174818943", "52445533", "52914674", "127836293", "211687574", "102341847", "210130942", "54452554", "199458791", "202595981", "53754958", "174800312", "208039770", "202899497", "53711153", "208034063", "204837460", "125412763", "204702023", "208040170", "84833796", "56481829", "209434142", "53237085", "117942794", "167219174", "212425645", "135352714", "60442717", "198232831", "77390886", "144208072", "209419729", "60443057", "135353979", "211050840", "201599923", "126544753", "60443071", "213887431", "214882763", "173169783", "115598471", "157061192", "51883270", "52549487", "54449937", "52129454", "203369894", "204946959", "133587814", "182324747", "52159296", "198426159"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135310826"}

Their development has encountered bottlenecks. Although a few people try to use neural network based models to improve the ORE task performance recently, it is always intractable for ORE to produce supervised systems based on various neural architectures. We analyze and review the neural ORE methods. Further, we construct a large-scale automatically tagging training set and design a tagging scheme to frame ORE as a supervised sequence tagging task. A hybrid neural sequence tagging model (NST) is proposed which combines BiLSTM, CNN and CRF to capture the contextual temporal information, local spatial information, and sentence level tag information of the sequence by using the word and part-of-speech embeddings.

The submission procedure followed a similar format to that of previous conferences, and was particularly close to that used in ILP 2006. Submissions were requested in two phases. The first phase involved submission of short papers (6 pages) which were then presented at the conference and posted on the website prior to the event itself. In the second phase, reviewers selected papers for long paper submission (15 pages). These were assessed by the same reviewers, who then decided which papers to include in the journal special issue, and which ones in the conference proceedings. The post-conference proceedings of ILP 2011 have been published as Volume 7207 in the Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. A separate latebreaking paper proceedings is being published by Imperial College Press under the title \u201cLatest Advances in Inductive Logic Programming\u201d. In the first phase there were 66 papers. Each paper was reviewed by 3 reviewers. Out of these 31 were invited as long papers. Out of the long paper submissions 5 were selected for the Machine Learning journal special issue and 23 were accepted for the proceedings. In addition, one paper (\u201cMachine Learning a Probabilistic Network of Ecological Interactions\u201d) was nominated by PC referees for the applications prize (the \u201cMichie ILP Application Prize\u201d sponsored by Syngenta Ltd) and one (\u201ck-Optimal: A Novel Approximate Inference Algorithm for ProbLog\u201d) for the theory prize (the \u201cTuring ILP Theory Prize\u201d sponsored by the Machine Learning Journal).

However, these methods often produce artifacts and can only be able to convert low-level information, but fail to transfer high-level semantic part of images. The reason is mainly that generators do not have the ability to detect the most discriminative semantic part of images, which thus makes the generated images with low-quality. To handle the limitation, in this paper we propose a novel Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Network (AGGAN), which can detect the most discriminative semantic object and minimize changes of unwanted part for semantic manipulation problems without using extra data and models. The attention-guided generators in AGGAN are able to produce attention masks via a built-in attention mechanism, and then fuse the input image with the attention mask to obtain a target image with high-quality. Moreover, we propose a novel attention-guided discriminator which only considers attended regions. The proposed AGGAN is trained by an end-to-end fashion with an adversarial loss, cycle-consistency loss, pixel loss and attention loss.

For fixed functional form of the kernel, model selection amounts to tuning kernel parameters and the slack penalty coefficient C. We begin by reviewing a recently developed probabilistic framework for SVM classification. An extension to the case of SVMs with quadratic slack penalties is given and a simple approximation for the evidence is derived, which can be used as a criterion for model selection. We also derive the exact gradients of the evidence in terms of posterior averages and describe how they can be estimated numerically using Hybrid Monte-Carlo techniques. Though computationally demanding, the resulting gradient ascent algorithm is a useful baseline tool for probabilistic SVM model selection, since it can locate maxima of the exact (unapproximated) evidence. We then perform extensive experiments on several benchmark data sets. The aim of these experiments is to compare the performance of probabilistic model selection criteria with alternatives based on estimates of the test error, namely the so-called \u201cspan estimate\u201d and Wahba's Generalized Approximate Cross-Validation (GACV) error. We find that all the \u201csimple\u201d model criteria (Laplace evidence approximations, and the span and GACV error estimates) exhibit multiple local optima with respect to the hyperparameters. While some of these give performance that is competitive with results from other approaches in the literature, a significant fraction lead to rather higher test errors. The results for the evidence gradient ascent method show that also the exact evidence exhibits local optima, but these give test errors which are much less variable and also consistently lower than for the simpler model selection criteria.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": "cond-mat/0203334", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S0925-2312(03)00375-8", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2082311728", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Physics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["194951", "60486887", "7089418", "14204055", "14209424", "1001206", "16986874", "10063289", "1247234", "1888591", "6884486", "37547604", "8018871", "60809283", "7138354", "28637672", "16029995", "793899", "1871891", "14607075", "2646636", "42041158", "2931477", "18841569"], "inbound_citations": ["112312784", "8191467", "16344229", "125038237", "17927880", "16311949", "22884875", "7953841", "157577674", "1511605", "14322622", "29639446", "155094160", "15390507", "17553226", "24484949", "19496463", "17585998", "14183575", "52931460", "15014295", "18392127", "16057850", "19017768", "40877154", "15413550", "35540880", "15648991", "12512548", "14241456", "10101957", "14548043", "13522486", "159043185", "20415401", "16339768", "15078221", "20243061", "7696791", "23387480", "135721177", "15129707", "9327811", "15021853", "26016233", "27527227", "52860446", "210906109", "5227020", "39273693", "26326606", "14832008", "17961076", "2220732", "14949070", "14202649", "57754898", "3284633", "981789", "18039102", "9389075", "1496442", "3084970", "6782895", "208187164", "1455137", "14023069", "22255175", "67344415", "24960370", "55677644", "20745713", "55895180", "14474309", "17281468", "25724627", "9102530", "7449833", "14423693", "13993542", "42849217", "69698127", "15866406", "17902068", "15523794", "16004673", "675013", "30270999", "29580629", "44223502", "18295581", "197548202", "9919279", "15612060", "10727095", "8258569", "109942164", "210696103"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11188135"}

In the current practice, of modelling fluvial reservoirs, the geometry of sandbodies is based on uninformative, deterministic or two- dimensional geological priors. These priors can lead to a broad field of unrealistic models, which may not be appropriate for a specific case. We propose a new approach to resolve these problems by developing robust models of the non- uniform geological parameters space that should be sampled from to find realistic geological models, which could be then incorporated into a framework for automated history matching and uncertainty quantification. In this work we show how reservoir models based on realistic geological priors can reduce the uncertainty in oil production. We built multi-dimensional geological priors using intelligent techniques, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and One-Class SVM (OC-SVM). These techniques allow the priors to capture hidden relations from multiple data sources (modern depositional environments and outcrops). We sample from the realistic priors within the history-matching framework to achieve the flow responses that match the production data.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2187248756", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["128377543", "128409210", "131210117", "131127891"], "inbound_citations": ["59417600", "56261710"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55044278"}

Moreover, based on MetricGAN, the metric scores of the generated data can also be arbitrarily specified by users. We tested the proposed MetricGAN on a speech enhancement task, which is particularly suitable to verify the proposed approach because there are multiple metrics measuring different aspects of speech signals.

Unfortunately, these extensions forfeit one or more of the favorable properties of decision forests based on axis-aligned splits, such as robustness to many noise dimensions, interpretability, or computational efficiency. We introduce yet another decision forest, called \"Sparse Projection Oblique Randomer Forests\" (SPORF).

To illustrate how SPORF addresses the limitations of both axis-aligned and existing oblique decision forest methods, we conduct extensive simulated experiments.

In this paper, we present the impact on the two approaches if a seventh facial expression is included. This seventh expression is known as the contemptuous expression (an expression that has rarely been explored in the machine learning literature). Together, the 7 facial expressions are known in the psychology literature as Ekman's Universal Facial Expressions of Emotion. To replicate our previous experiments, we use the same number of image preprocessing techniques (grayscale, Local Binary Patterns, Sobel and Canny edge detection, and manually inserted feature points which we refer to as components) that are organised into four approaches: holistic, holistic action, component and component action (where an action approach is produced by a difference between a neutral and an expressive face). The facial expressions are classified using a standard multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a pairwise adaptive multiclass SVM (pa-SVM) - which uses pairwise adaptive model parameters. The significance of this study is to provide a thorough understanding of the choices that impact a classifier's performance and the performance dynamics between expression pairs when the contemptuous expression is now considered. In particular, we extend the issues and justify the use of the contemptuous expression by noting its universal presence in human expression and its asymmetric nature, which is not shared with other expressions. Using our face model, which uses feature points around the eyes, brows and mouth, we obtained a best correct classification rate of 98.57% with the contemptuous expression included.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CICAC.2013.6595214", "venue": "2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Creativity and Affective Computing (CICAC)", "journal": "2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Creativity and Affective Computing (CICAC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2022777388", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["61092326", "15823252", "15090080", "18168722", "961425", "15874442", "7470862", "14013552", "141196166", "143817186", "45213489", "142688192", "145221765", "62289168", "1416870", "115951", "13562483", "144136682", "16251989", "11034879", "699530", "13454240", "46144287", "17447274", "3329621", "1586662", "143333167", "5271980", "35578413", "4823006", "205013679", "42445591", "589516", "28637672", "2053081", "27202859", "42211683", "584690", "1483488"], "inbound_citations": ["8643585", "15816525", "27060042"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11467001"}

Such approaches require the extraction of the human-body's silhouette, contour, or skeleton from the images, and therefore their performance highly depends on the silhouette segmentation accuracy.

SVM impulse detection determines whether the pixels are corrupted by noise or not according to an optimal discrimination function. ASM filtering implements the image filtering with a variable window size to effectively remove the noisy pixels determined by the SVM impulse detection. Experimental results show that the SVM-ASM filter performs significantly better than many other existing filters for denoising impulse noise even in highly corrupted images with regard to noise suppression and detail preservation.

To this end we use a trainable statistical pattern recognition system. The chapter \"Supervised and unsupervised classification --- The case of IRAS point sources\" provides an short introduction to and review of supervised and un\\-supervised classification. The chapter \"Mapping the extragalactic sky with IRAS PSC data\" describes the selection of galaxy candidates from the IRAS Point Source Catalog. The distributions of the infrared colours are approximated as multivariate Gaussian distributions. The selection is carried out by statistical classifiers based on the maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) principles. The chapter \"Young stellar objects in the IRAS Point Source Catalog\" uses essentially the same methods for selecting young stellar object (YSO) candidates from the IRAS Point Source Catalog. In this case the information provided by the infrared colours alone is insufficient for a good discrimination of YSO candidates against other objects. However with the help of additional uncertain information provided by the spatial clustering properties of the objects on the sky, the selection can be significantly improved. The chapter \"Statistical inferencing in the design of a sky-survey project\" attempts to bridge the wide gap remaining between a selection of interesting candidates from some catalogue and the design of a suitably optimised strategy for follow-up observations. Part II of this thesis deals with the problem of how to create and optimise a long-term schedule for an astronomical telescope. Specifically the case of scheduling the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations is considered. It is shown how an artificial neural network with a novel stochastic dynamics can be used to efficiently solve the underlying constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). The chapter \"The processing of HST observing programmes\" introduces the HST long range planning problem and explains why the scheduling of pointed observations with this astronomical satellite in a low Earth orbit is difficult. The chapter \"Connectionism and neural networks\" provides some conceptual background on artificial neural networks. It is shown how a simple scheduling problem can be mapped onto the topology of an artificial neural network. Adding a suitable network dynamics turns such a network into an efficient problem solver. The chapter \"A discrete stochastic neural network algorithm for constraint satisfaction problems\" describes the novel \"guarded discrete stochastic\" (GDS) network algorithm, a relative of the standard Hopfield-Tank network, which is surprisingly efficient in finding solutions to large constraint satisfaction problems even on serial machines. The chapter \"Scheduling with neural networks --- The case of Hubble Space Telescope\" finally describes how the GDS network is integrated into Spike, the scheduling system developed at the Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, for creating long range HST observing schedules. The methodology described here is quite general and is applicable to scheduling other ground-based or space-born astronomical observatories.", "year": 1995, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1086/133597", "venue": null, "journal": "Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific", "mag_id": "1967181556", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:119694729"}

During the last decade, a significant progress in both the theoretical aspects and the applications of neural networks on the image analysis, and processing, has been made. The constant development of computers has led to several major enhancements in terms of data processing. The computational power has sped up, doing millions of calculations per second. Along with the elaboration of computational force, data has also been increasing in size at rapid rate (Big-Data). Main working modules include feature extraction module which is able to use and then compares different learning techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks, with old-fashioned engineering tools like SIFT for feature extraction. Then classification module containing models like Support Vector Machines, k-NN, decision trees for classification. The system is built to utilise most of the computational power. Moreover, it is based on database centric approach in order to decrease computational cost and join different modules.This project aims to present a image/video analysis system using digital image processing techniques with the help of neural networks which will be a part of machine learning and will be used to analyses and distinguish images. We will also be using a big data platform to store and process large amount of data that will be generated during the implementation and execution of the project. An IOT platform will also be used to relay the data generated by the implementation and execution of image analysis system using digital image processing techniques with the help of neural networks. The data will be send via a wireless network (ZigBee).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Imperial journal of interdisciplinary research", "mag_id": "2691847190", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55507675"}

By analogy with auto-encoders, we propose Context Encoders -- a convolutional neural network trained to generate the contents of an arbitrary image region conditioned on its surroundings. In order to succeed at this task, context encoders need to both understand the content of the entire image, as well as produce a plausible hypothesis for the missing part(s). When training context encoders, we have experimented with both a standard pixel-wise reconstruction loss, as well as a reconstruction plus an adversarial loss. The latter produces much sharper results because it can better handle multiple modes in the output. We found that a context encoder learns a representation that captures not just appearance but also the semantics of visual structures. We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned features for CNN pre-training on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Furthermore, context encoders can be used for semantic inpainting tasks, either stand-alone or as initialization for non-parametric methods.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1604.07379", "acl_id": null,

In particular we perform analysis demonstrating potential energy savings which could be obtained were Great Britain to maintain daylight savings time (DST) over winter, instead of reverting to Greenwich mean time (GMT). We review the literature on the effect of DST on energy consumption and show that this indicates a justification for considering the issue. Our headline result is in agreement with many related studies in that advancing the clock by an hour in winter would lead to energy savings of at least 0.3% of daily demand in Great Britain. In deriving this result we have adopted methodologies currently used in load prediction, in particular Support Vector Regression, to estimate energy demand on a half-hourly basis. Corresponding cost savings are found to be higher (due to the nonlinear increase of costs) and we find them to be on the order of 0.6% over the months considered. In terms of environmental impact we find the saving to be approximately equivalent to 450,000\u00c2 ton of CO2.

The combined system provides continuous and accurate navigation solution when compared to standalone INS or GPS. Different fusion methodology such as those based on Kalman filtering and particle filtering has been proposed that estimates and models the INS error during the GPS signal availability. In the case of outages, the developed model provides an INS error estimates, thereby improving its accuracy. However, these fusion approaches possess several inadequacies related to sensor error model, immunity to noise and computational load. Alternatively, Neural Network (NN) based approaches has been proposed. In the case of low-cost INS, the NN suffers from poor generalization capability due to the presence of high amount of noises. The paper thus introduces a novel and hybrid fusion methodology utilizing Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory augmented by Support Vector Machines (SVM), known as DS-SVM. The INS and GPS data fusion is carried using DS fusion whereas SVM models the INS error. During GPS availability, DS provides accurate solution; whereas during outages, the trained SVM model corrects the INS error thereby improving the positioning accuracy.

Existing graph representation learning methods can be classified into two categories: generative models that learn the underlying connectivity distribution in the graph, and discriminative models that predict the probability of edge existence between a pair of vertices. In this paper, we propose GraphGAN, an innovative graph representation learning framework unifying above two classes of methods, in which the generative model and discriminative model play a game-theoretical minimax game. Specifically, for a given vertex, the generative model tries to fit its underlying true connectivity distribution over all other vertices and produces \"fake\" samples to fool the discriminative model, while the discriminative model tries to detect whether the sampled vertex is from ground truth or generated by the generative model. With the competition between these two models, both of them can alternately and iteratively boost their performance. Moreover, when considering the implementation of generative model, we propose a novel graph softmax to overcome the limitations of traditional softmax function, which can be proven satisfying desirable properties of normalization, graph structure awareness, and computational efficiency.

Eye movement data for different reading speeds is recorded using a laboratory developed Electrooculogram acquisition system.

Reading speeds are classified using different pattern classifiers from which an average accuracy of 94.67% over all classes and participants is obtained using Radial Basis Function (RBF) Support Vector Machine (SVM) Tree classifier and AAR Parameters as features. Friedman test is done to select the best classifier. The trained classifier is used to recognize the reading speeds of a set of new normal individuals. If the reading speeds are less than a preset threshold, that individual is trained repeatedly for 10 days for improvement. An improvement of reading speed is observed by the decrease in the misclassification rate from 45.1% to 9.92% in 10 days for the fastest speed (1 sentence/2 s) over all the subjects.

In this work, we propose three strategies of data abstraction, namely, exemplar extraction, attribute selection and attribute abstraction. We first propose an effective method called exemplar extraction to extract representative subsets from the original massive data prior to building the detection models. Two clustering algorithms, Affinity Propagation (AP) and traditional k-means, are employed to find the exemplars from the audit data. k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for the detection. We then employ another two strategies, attribute selection and attribute extraction, to abstract audit data for anomaly intrusion detection. Two http streams collected from a real computing environment as well as the KDD\u201999 benchmark data set are used to validate these three strategies of data abstraction.

Both the prediction accuracy and interpretability of a classifier could be enhanced by performing the classification based only on a set of discriminative genes. Analyzing overlapping between gene expression of different classes is an effective criterion for identifying relevant genes. However, genes selected according to maximizing a relevance score could have rich redundancy. We propose a scheme for minimizing selection redundancy, in which the Proportional Overlapping Score (POS) technique is extended by using a recursive approach to assign a set of complementary discriminative genes.

The approach is validated by comparing its classification performance with other feature selection methods, Wilcoxon Rank Sum, mRMR, MaskedPainter and POS, for several benchmark gene expression datasets using three different classifiers: Random Forest; k Nearest Neighbour; Support Vector Machine.

For this purpose, we used the convolutional layers of the pretrained deep neural network VGG16 as a feature extractor. To simplify the problem, we only took two prominent horizontal slices throgh the aortic root, the coaptation plane and the commissure plane, into account by stitching the features of both images together and training a Random Forest classifier on the resulting feature vectors. We evaluated this method on a data set of 48 images (24 healthy, 24 dilated) using 10-fold cross validation. Using the deep learned features we could reach a classification accuracy of 84 %, which clearly outperformed the handcrafted features (71 % accuracy). Even though the VGG16 network was trained on RGB photos and for different classification tasks, the learned features are still relevant for ultrasound image analysis of aortic root pathology identification.

A screening instrument should consist of only a few items and have good accuracy in classifying cases and non-cases. Variable/item selection methods such as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Elastic Net, Classification and Regression Tree, Random Forest, and the two-sample t-test can be used in such context. Unlike situations where variable selection methods are most commonly applied (e.g., ultra high-dimensional genetic or imaging data), psychiatric data usually have lower dimensions and are characterized by the following factors: correlations and possible interactions among predictors, unobservability of important variables (i.e., true variables not measured by available questionnaires), amount and pattern of missing values in the predictors, and prevalence of cases in the training data. We investigate how these factors affect the performance of several variable selection methods and compare them with respect to selection performance and prediction error rate via simulations. Our results demonstrated that: (1) for complete data, LASSO and Elastic Net outperformed other methods with respect to variable selection and future data prediction, and (2) for certain types of incomplete data, Random Forest induced bias in imputation, leading to incorrect ranking of variable importance. We propose the Imputed-LASSO combining Random Forest imputation and LASSO; this approach offsets the bias in Random Forest and offers a simple yet efficient item selection approach for missing data.

The diagnostic of breast cancer is an intricate process. Therefore, an accurate and reliable prediction system for breast cancer is indispensable to avoid misleading results.In this regard, improved decision support systems are essential for breast cancer prediction. Consequently, this thesis focuses on the development of intelligent decision making systems using ensemble classification for the early prediction of breast cancer. ::: Proteins of a breast tissue generally reflect the initial changes caused by successive genetic mutations, which may lead to cancer. In this research, such changes in protein sequences are exploited for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. It is found that substantial variation of Proline, Serine, Tyrosine, Cysteine, Arginine, and Asparagine amino acid molecules in cancerous proteins offer high discrimination for cancer diagnostic. Molecular descriptors derived from physicochemical properties of amino acids are used to transform primary protein sequences into feature spaces of amino acid composition (AAC), split amino acid composition (SAAC), pseudo amino acid composition-series (PseAAC-S), and pseudo amino acid composition-parallel (PseAAC-P). ::: The research work in this thesis is divided in two phases. In the first phase, the basic framework is established to handle imbalanced dataset in order to enhance true prediction performance. In this phase, conventional individual learning algorithms are employed to develop different prediction systems. Firstly, in conjunction with oversampling based Mega-Trend-Diffusion (MTD) technique, individual prediction systems are developed. Secondly, homogeneous ensemble systems \"CanPro-IDSS\" and \"Can-CSCGnB\" are developed using MTD and cost-sensitive classifier (CSC) techniques, respectively. It is found that assimilation of MTD technique for the CanPro-IDSS system is superior than CSC based technique to handle imbalanced dataset of protein sequences. In this connection, a web based CanPro-IDSS cancer ::: prediction system is also developed. Lastly, a novel heterogeneous ensemble system called \"IDMS-HBC\" is developed for breast cancer detection. ::: The second phase of this research focuses on the exploitation of variation of amino acid molecules in cancerous protein sequences using physicochemical properties. In this phase, unlike traditional ensemble prediction approaches, the proposed \"IDM-PhyChm-Ens\" ensemble system is developed by combining the decision spaces of a specific classifier trained on different feature spaces. This intelligent ensemble system is constructed using diverse learning algorithms of Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Naive Bayes (NB). It is observed that the combined spaces of SAAC+PseAAC-S and AAC+SAAC possess the best discrimination using ensemble-RF and ensemble-NB. Lastly, a novel classifier stacking based evolutionary ensemble system \"Can-EvoEns\" is also developed, whereby Genetic programming is used as the ensemble method. This study revealed that PseAAC-S feature space carries better discrimination power compared to AAC, SAAC, and PseAAC-P based feature extraction strategies. ::: Intensive experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed intelligent decision making systems for cancer/non-cancer and breast/nonbreast cancer datasets. The proposed approaches have demonstrated improvement over previous state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed systems may be useful for academia, practitioners, and clinicians for the early diagnosis of breast cancer using protein sequences.

To regionalize pasture degradation proxies, the transferability of the locally derived ML-models to high resolution multispectral satellite data is assessed. 1183 hyperspectral measurements and vegetation records were performed at 18 locations on the QTP. Random Forests models with recursive feature selection were trained to estimate vegetation cover and AGB using narrow-band indices (NBI) as predictors. Separate models were calculated using NBI from hyperspectral data as well as from the same data resampled to WorldView-2, QuickBird and RapidEye channels. The hyperspectral results were compared to the multispectral results. Finally, the models were applied to satellite data to map vegetation cover and AGB on a regional scale. Vegetation cover was accurately predicted by Random Forest if hyperspectral measurements were used (cross validated R 2 = 0.89). In contrast, errors in AGB estimations were considerably higher (cross validated R 2 = 0.32). Only small differences in accuracy were observed between the models based on hyperspectral compared to multispectral data. The application of the models to satellite images generally resulted in an increase of the estimation error. Though this reflects the challenge of applying in situ measurements to satellite data, the results still show a high potential to map pasture degradation proxies on the QTP. Thus, this study presents robust methodology to remotely detect and monitor pasture degradation at high spatial resolutions.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2016.10.001", "venue": "Int.

These methods have mostly been performed using separation operations from the background based on a pre-processing stage. However, the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) method, which provides high performance in object recognition, is used to obtain textural features from images without need for a pre-processing stage. In this paper, we propose different approaches based on LBP for the recognition of plant leaves using extracted texture features from plant leaves. While the original LBP converts color images to gray tones, the proposed methods are applied by using the R and G color channel of images. In addition, we evaluate the robustness of the proposed methods against noise such as salt & pepper and Gaussian. Later, the obtained features from the proposed methods were classified and tested using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method. The experimental works were performed using various plant leaf datasets such as Flavia, Swedish, ICL, and Foliage. According to the obtained performance results, the calculated accuracy values for Flavia, Swedish, ICL and Foliage datasets were 98.94%, 99.46%, 83.71%, and 92.92%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method was more successful when compared to the original LBP, improved LBP methods, and other image descriptors for both noisy and noiseless images.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2019.121297", "venue": null, "journal": "Physica A-statistical Mechanics and Its Applications", "mag_id": "2943973036", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:164501580"}

Experimental results tackle the training problem of SVMs by using a high-end DSP architecture on real-world benchmarks, and confirm both the effectiveness and the general validity of the approach.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247212", "venue": "The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings", "journal": "The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2130006271", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["28637672", "60486887", "1536643", "5658362", "961425", "14487094", "207597853", "14607075", "1753032", "3144723", "209099422"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14364944"}

This design takes into account uncertainties in aquifer properties, pollution transport processes, and climate. The methodology utilizes a statistical learning algorithm called relevance vector machines (RVM), which is a sparse Bayesian framework that can be used for obtaining solutions to regression and classification tasks. Application of the methodology is illustrated using the Eocene Aquifer in the northern part of the West Bank, Palestine. The procedure presented in this paper utilizes a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation process to capture the uncertainties in recharge, hydraulic conductivity, and nitrate reaction processes through the application of a groundwater flow model and a nitrate fate and transport model. This MC modeling approach provides several thousand realizations of nitrate distribution in the aquifer. Subsets of these realizations are then used to design the monitoring network. This is done by building a best-fit model of nitrate concentration distribution everywhere in the aquifer for each Monte Carlo subset using RVM. The outputs from the RVM model are the distribution of nitrate concentration everywhere in the aquifer, the uncertainty in the characterization of those concentrations, and the number and locations of \u201crelevance vectors\u201d (RVs). The RVs form the basis of the optimal characterization of nitrate throughout the aquifer and represent the optimal locations of monitoring wells. In this paper, the number of monitoring wells and their locations where chosen based on the performance of the RVM model runs. The results from 100 model runs show the consistency of the model in selecting the number and locations of RV\u2018s.

Here, we study two groups of feature ranking scores for MTR: scores (Symbolic, Genie3 and Random Forest score) based on ensembles (bagging, random forests, extra trees) of predictive clustering trees, and a score derived as an extension of the RReliefF method. We also propose a generic data-transformation approach to MTR feature ranking and thus have two versions of each score. For both groups of feature ranking scores, we analyze their theoretical computational complexity. For the extension of the RReliefF method, we additionally derive some theoretical properties of the scores. Next, we extensively evaluate the scores on 24 benchmark MTR datasets, in terms of the quality of the ranking and the computational complexity of producing it.

ZSD aims to detect previously unseen objects during inference. Existing ZSD works suffer from two critical issues: (a) large domain-shift between the source (seen) and target (unseen) domains since the two distributions are highly mismatched. (b) the learned model is biased against unseen classes, therefore in generalized ZSD settings, where both seen and unseen objects co-occur during inference, the learned model tends to misclassify unseen to seen categories. This brings up an important question: How effectively can a transductive setting address the aforementioned problems? To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a transductive zero-shot object detection approach that convincingly reduces the domain-shift and model-bias against unseen classes. Our approach is based on a self-learning mechanism that uses a novel hybrid pseudo-labeling technique. It progressively updates learned model parameters by associating unlabeled data samples to their corresponding classes. During this process, our technique makes sure that knowledge that was previously acquired on the source domain is not forgotten.

To sort the fruits based on quality is a challenging task. Human grades the fruit but this process is inconsistent, stagnant, expensive and get influenced by the surrounding. Thus an effective system for grading fruit is desired. In this paper, an automated fruit grading system has been developed for mono and bi-colored apples. An automated fruit grading system involves three steps, namely, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. In this work, segmentation of defected area has been carried out using fuzzy c-means and for feature extraction, the various combination of Statistical/ Textural, Geometrical, Gabor Wavelet and, Discrete Cosine Transform feature have been considered. For classification three different classifiers i.e. k-NN (k- Nearest Neighbor)), SRC (Sparse Representation Classifier), SVM (Support Vector Machine) have been applied. The proposed system has been validated for four different databases of apples one having 1120 samples of which 984 were defective, the second having 333 samples of which 247 were defective, the third having 100 samples with 26 defective and the fourth with 56 defectives. The maximum accuracy of 95.21%, 93.41%, 92.64% and 87.91% for four datasets respectively, achieved by the system is encouraging and is comparable with the state of art techniques. The system performance has been validated using the k-fold cross-validation technique by considering k = 10. Results showed that a combination of features provides improved performance and the SVM classifier has the highest performance among k-NN, SRC.

To address these complexities, software quality engineering methods should be updated accordingly and enhance their quality assuring methods. Fault prediction, a sub-task of SQE, is designed to solve this issue and provide a strategy to identify faulty parts of a program, so that the testing process can concentrate only on those regions. This will improve the testing process and indirectly help to reduce development life cycle, project risks, resource and infrastructure costs. Measuring quality using software metrics for fault identification is gaining wide interest in software industry as they help to reduce time and cost. Existing system use either traditional simple metrics or object oriented metrics during fault detection combined with single classifier prediction system. This study combines the use of simple and object oriented metrics and uses a multiple classifier prediction system to identify module faults. In this study, a total of 20 metrics combining both traditional and OO metrics are used for fault detection. To analyze the performance of these metrics on fault module detection, the study proposes the use of ensemble classifiers that uses three frequently used classifiers, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). A novel classifier aggregation method is proposed to combine the classification results. Four methods, Sequential Selection, Random Selection with No Replacement, Selection with Bagging and Selection with Boosting, are used to generate different variants of input dataset. The three classifiers were grouped together as 2-classifier and 3-classifier prediction ensemble models. A total of 16 ensemble models were proposed for fault prediction. The performance of the proposed prediciton models was analyzed using accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure. When comparing with single classifier systems all the proposed models produced improved classification performance and among the 16 multiple classifier models, the 3-classifier model that combined BPNN, SVM and KNN produced best results.

Although recurrence can be reduced with adjuvant chemotherapy, the toxicity and low response rates of this treatment restrict its use to patients at highest risk. We developed a neurofuzzy model (NFM) to predict disease recurrence following RC and PLND in patients who are not usually administered adjuvant chemotherapy. Experimental Design: The study comprised 1,034 patients treated with RC and PLND for bladder urothelial carcinoma. Four hundred twenty-five patients were excluded due to lymph node metastases and/or administration of chemotherapy. For the remaining 609 patients, we obtained complete clinicopathologic data relating to their tumor. We trained, tested, and validated two NFMs that predicted risk (Classifier) and timing (Predictor) of post-RC recurrence. We measured the accuracy of our model at various postoperative time points. Results: Cancer recurrence occurred in 172 (28%) patients. With a median follow-up of 72.7 months, our Classifier NFM identified recurrence with an accuracy of 0.84 (concordance index 0.92, sensitivity 0.81, and specificity 0.85) and an excellent calibration.

Mainstream methods focus on designing highly discriminative features, which suffer from high dimension. As for human experience, discriminative parts, such as hands or legs, play an important role for identifying human actions. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose a Random Forest (RF) Out-of-Bag (OB) estimation based approach to extract discriminative parts for each action. First, all the features of joint-based parts are separately fed into the RF Classifier. The OB estimation of each part is used to evaluate the discrimination of the joints in the part. Second, joints with high discrimination for the whole dataset are selected to design feature. Therefore, feature dimension is reduced efficiently.

The base code for most simulated soccer teams only partially changes from one competition to another, thus the previous competitions logs and binaries (the historical data) can be used for such analysis. Research in this field is still largely unexplored, not having proved itself in competitions like RoboCup Soccer Simulation 2D league yet. In this thesis a three step approach for such system is proposed. The first component is responsible for generating a human-readable opponent model based on detected events (match statistics), such events are defined by an expert panel and their detection is manually validated, this tool is also used to analyse the matches of the 2009 RoboCup simulation league competition. The manual validation indicates that the tool is capable of successfully detecting the desired events with minimal flaws. The second component focus on classifying an opponent based on the previously described model, to achieve those results, the opponents are clustered according to their characteristics using the K-means clustering algorithm. Then, based on the previously described model three classifiers are trained to identify to which cluster corresponds each model. The classifiers all obtain a classification rate superior to 80%\u2013SVM (96.4%), Random Forest (93.59%) and Bagging (80.151%). The Friedman rank test rejected the null hypothesis of equivalence between the three classifiers (Bagging, Random Forest and SVM) and the Nemenyi test showed that SVM and Random Forest are better than Bagging but cannot show which is better between SVM and Random Forest. In the light of these results and considering that SVM is the fastest of the three to train, it is considered the best. The final component encompasses all of the previous components and is responsible for advising its team in a real-time scenario. To be able to do this the best tactic to face each opponent cluster is identified before the match, using that information, the SVM classifier and an online generated opponent model, it is able to identify the best tactic for each of the opponent play styles. The results are obtained by comparing the results of the FC Portugal team without and with this module at varying advise intervals. The null hypothesis is rejected by the Friedman rank test, but the Bonferroni-Dunn test does not allow to conclude if the changes made result in better or worse behaviour than the control group. In the future the obtained results can be further studied. The project can be extended by varying more tactic parameters or even applied it to another sport or environment (real instead of simulated).", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2125863463", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:145383739"}

Over the last decade, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Multi-Classifier Systems (MCS) have become popular tools for HSI analysis. Random Feature Selection (RFS) for MCS is a popular approach to produce higher classification accuracies. In this study, we present a Non-Uniform Random Feature Selection (NU-RFS) within a MCS framework using SVM as the base classifier. We propose a method to fuse the output of individual classifiers using scores derived from kernel density estimation. This study demonstrates the improvement in classification accuracies by comparing the proposed approach to conventional analysis algorithms and by assessing the sensitivity of the proposed approach to the number of training samples. These results are compared with that of uniform RFS and regular SVM classifiers.

This study seeks to integrate multiple clinicopathological and genomic factors with dimensional reduction across machine learning algorithms to compare survival predictions. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of the data from a prospective cohort study of female patients with breast cancer enrolled in the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC). We constructed a series of predictive models: ensemble models (Gradient Boosting and Random Forest), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) for 5-year survival based on clinicopathological and gene expression data after K-means clustering with K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classification. Model performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, accuracy, and calibration slope (CS). Model stability was assessed over 10 random runs in terms of ROC, accuracy, CS, and variable importance. Results: The analytic cohort is composed of 1874 patients with breast cancer. Overall, the median age was 62 years; the 5-year survival rate was 75%. ROC and accuracy were not significantly different between models (ROC and accuracy around 0.67 and 0.72 across models, respectively). However, ensemble methods resulted in better fit (CS) with stable measures of variable importance across 10 random training/validation splits. K-means clustering of gene expression profiles on training data points along with KNN classification of validation data points was a robust method of dimensional reduction. Furthermore, the gene expression cluster with the highest mortality risk was an influential factor in model prediction. Conclusions: Using machine learning methods to construct predictive models for 5-year survival in patients with breast cancer, we demonstrated discrimination ability across models with new insight into the stability and utility of dimensional reduction on genomic features in breast cancer survival prediction.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6238199", "pubmed_id": "30455569", "doi": "10.1177/1176935118810215", "venue": null, "journal": "Cancer Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2900020327", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["6067341", "17622089", "21035755", "503714", "22431132", "10189561", "2165524", "214633022", "15315839", "15793236", "3490144", "986965", "42095678", "28199791", "205308531", "10418677", "3076580", "41383615", "13545404", "25393176", "15416698", "30969677", "5961511"], "inbound_citations": ["211059953", "208050735", "76665695", "212655804"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53712848"}

The One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a widely used kernel-based technique to address this problem.

We address this issue by presenting a new class of SVM-like algorithms which help to approach multi-class classification and novelty detection from a new perspective. We introduce a new coupling term between classes which leverages the problem of finding a good decision boundary while preserving the compactness of a support with the l ::: 2 ::: -norm penalty.

Next we propose a Least-Squares formulation which results in a linear system which drastically reduces computational costs. Finally we derive a Pegasos-based formulation which can effectively cope with large data sets that cannot be handled by many existing QP solvers.

From a Machine learning perspective, the overlap between acoustic codes for emotional expression in music and speech opens new possibilities to enlarge the amount of data available to develop music and speech emotion recognition systems. In this article, we investigate time-continuous predictions of emotion (Arousal and Valence) in music and speech, and the Transfer Learning between these domains. We establish a comparative framework including intra- (i.e., models trained and tested on the same modality, either music or speech) and cross-domain experiments (i.e., models trained in one modality and tested on the other).

Our results demonstrate an excellent cross-domain generalisation performance with and without feature representation transfer in both directions. In the case of music, cross-domain approaches outperformed intra-domain models for Valence estimation, whereas for Speech intra-domain models achieve the best performance.

In order to eliminate the huge computational burden in the label propagation algorithm, we employ the weighted support vectors as the critical instances to represent all the anaphoricity-labeled NP instances in the training texts.

The frame problem arises in the context of modelling the human ability to see the relevant consequences of events in a situation. It has been claimed to be unsolvable for classical cognitive science, but easily manageable for connectionism. We will focus on a representational approach to the frame problem which advocates the use of intrinsic representations. We argue that although connectionism's distributed representations may look promising from this perspective, doubts can be raised about the potential of distributed representations to allow large amounts of complexly structured information to be adequately encoded and processed. It is questionable whether connectionist models that are claimed to effectively represent structured information can be scaled up to a realistic extent.

Additionally, Compared with existing peer researches, both training and testing phases of FCGAN are end-to-end pipeline without pre/post-processing. To enhance the convergence speed and strengthen feature propagation, the Generator and Discriminator networks are designed with a skip-connection architecture, and both using an auto-encoder structure.

SVMs are optimized by minimizing a bound on a generalized error (risk) measure, rather than just the mean square error over a training set. The utility of this SVM regression approach is demonstrated through applications to the short term forecasts of the biweekly GSL volume. The SVM based reconstruction is used to develop time series forecasts for multiple lead times ranging from the period of two weeks to several months. The reliability of the algorithm in learning and forecasting the dynamics is tested using split sample sensitivity analyses, with a particular interest in forecasting extreme states. Unlike previously reported methodologies, SVMs are able to extract the dynamics using only a few past observed data points (Support Vectors, SV) out of the training examples.

In this research, a framework is proposed that leverages Transfer Learning and CNN to classify crop distributions of Horticulture Plantations. The Hyperspectral dataset consists of images and known labels, also known as groundtruth. However, some of the HSIs are unlabelled due to the lack of groundtruth available for the same. Hence, the proposed method adopts the Transfer Learning technique to overcome this. The model was trained on a publicly available and labelled hyperspectral dataset. This was then tested on the field samples of Chikkaballapur district of Karnataka, India which was provided by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The CNN built leverages both the spectral and spatial correlations of the HSIs. Due to the amount of detail in HSIs, they are fed in as patches into the convolutional layers of the network. The diverse information provided by these images is exploited by deploying a three-dimensional kernel. This joint representation of both spectral and spatial information provides higher discriminating power, thus allowing a more accurate classification of the crop distributions in the field.

For the LDW system, the lane position information is analyzed and the warning is triggered if there is a lane departure without the use of blinkers. The proposed camera based system can provide advantages over the traditional radar/laser based warning systems, in which both the LDW and the FCW information cannot be provided with the same system.

However, vanilla dense ELMs are affected by the overfitting problem when the number of hidden neurons is high. Further direct consequences of the density are decreases in both the training and prediction speeds. In this study, we propose an incremental method for sparsifying the ELM using a newly devised indicator driven by the condition number in the ELM design matrix, in which we call sparse pseudoinverse incremental-ELM (SPI-ELM). SPI-ELM exhibits better generalization performance and lower run-time complexity compared with ELM. However, the sparsification process may negatively affect the learning speed of SPI-ELM; thus, we introduce an iterative matrix decomposition algorithm to address this issue. We also demonstrate that there is a useful relationship between the condition number in the ELM design matrix and the number of hidden neurons. This relationship helps to understand the random weights and nonlinear activation functions in ELMs. We evaluated the SPI-ELM method based on 20 benchmark data sets from the University of California Irvine repository and three real-world databases from the computer vision domain.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2018.01.087", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2790733271", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["68114325", "52954768", "102350933", "91183901"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:39779545"}

We present SmartPark, a smartphone based system that relaxes the requirement for specialized infrastructure by relying on the smartphone's sensors and ubiquitous Wi-Fi and cellular infrastructure.

It addresses each challenge using a combination of thorough statistical analysis of the sensor readings and a novel Random Forest based classification algorithm. Experimental results from 12 volunteers, using 7 different smartphones, in 3 different cities show that SmartPark can distinguish 9 different transportation modes with accuracy between 95.57\u2013100%, enabling it to correctly detect unparking events virtually 100% of the time.

Indirect surveying relies on the delineation of visible parcel boundaries from such images. Despite advances in automated detection and localization of objects from images, indirect surveying is rarely automated and relies on manual on-screen delineation. We have previously introduced a boundary delineation workflow, comprising image segmentation, boundary classification and interactive delineation that we applied on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data to delineate roads. In this study, we improve each of these steps. For image segmentation, we remove the need to reduce the image resolution and we limit over-segmentation by reducing the number of segment lines by 80% through filtering. For boundary classification, we show how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be used for boundary line classification, thereby eliminating the previous need for Random Forest (RF) feature generation and thus achieving 71% accuracy. For interactive delineation, we develop additional and more intuitive delineation functionalities that cover more application cases. We test our approach on more varied and larger data sets by applying it to UAV and aerial imagery of 0.02\u20130.25 m resolution from Kenya, Rwanda and Ethiopia. We show that it is more effective in terms of clicks and time compared to manual delineation for parcels surrounded by visible boundaries.

Second, the investigation of possible drop-out reasons, which allows making the necessary personalized interventions. To meet these needs, we present a supervised machine learning based drop-out prediction system that uses Predictive algorithms (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) for automated intervention solutions, and Explicative algorithms (Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree) for personalized intervention solutions.

It has been shown that, when purely deductive reasoning falls short, this problem can be solved as a prediction task to be accomplished through inductive classification models built upon the statistical evidence elicited from ontological knowledge bases. However also these data-driven alternative classification models may turn out to be inadequate when instances are unevenly distributed over the various targeted classes To cope with this issue, a framework based on logic decision trees and ensemble learning is proposed. The new models integrate the Dempster\u2013Shafer theory with learning methods for terminological decision trees and forests. These enhanced classification models allow to explicitly take into account the underlying uncertainty due to the variety of branches to be followed up to classification leaves (in the context of a single tree) and/or to the different trees within the ensemble model (the forest).

The purpose of this research work is to predict breast cancer, using several machine-learning algorithms that are Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors K-NN, and Multilayer Perception MLP, in order to select the most effective algorithm with and without FCBF. The experimental results show that SVM gives the highest accuracy of 97.9% without FCBF but if we apply this method we find that the SVM and MLP show the best results in comparison with other algorithms. The results will help to choose the best learning algorithm machine classification for breast cancer prediction.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/isaect.2018.8618688", "venue": "2018 International Symposium on Advanced Electrical and Communication Technologies (ISAECT)", "journal": "2018 International Symposium on Advanced Electrical and Communication Technologies (ISAECT)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2913994456", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["140109802", "57587660", "18951403", "5394579", "63525829", "10962353", "55360822", "10844549", "17726648", "24700078", "14463568", "88520060", "13861754"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59234251"}

However, in the present paper, we will only deal with the problem of speaker discrimination using a new relative reduced modelization for the speaker, restricting then our analysis to the new relative speaker characteristic used as input feature of the learning machines (NN and SVM). Speaker discrimination consists in checking whether two speech signals belong to the same speaker or not, by using some features of the speaker directly from his own speech. Our new proposed feature is based on a relative characterization of the speaker, called Relative Speaker Characteristic (RSC) and is well adapted for NN and SVM trainings. RSC consists in modeling one speaker relatively to another one, meaning that each speaker model is determined from both its speech signal and its dual speech. This investigation shows that the relative model, used as input of the classifier, optimizes the training, by speeding up the learning time and enhancing the discrimination accuracy of that classifier. ::: ::: Experiments of speaker discrimination are done on two different databases: Hub4 Broadcast-News database and a telephonic speech database, by using two learning machines: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Support Vector Machines (SVM) with several input characteristics. Another comparative investigation is conducted by using two classical discriminative measures (Covariance-based mono-Gaussian distance and Kullback-Leibler distance) on the same databases. ::: ::: The originality of this relativist approach is that the new characteristic gives to the speaker a flexible model, since it changes every time that the competing speaker model changes. Results show that the new input characteristic is interesting in speaker discrimination. Furthermore, by using the Relative Speaker Characteristic, we reduce the size of the classifier input and the training time.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10772-012-9132-x", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Speech Technology", "mag_id": "2080688978", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["9629752"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28814996"}

Although a considerable effort has been made to investigate sophisticated features that encode textual characteristics of named entities (e.g. PEOPLE, LOCATION, etc.), little attention has been paid to segment representations (SRs) for multi-token named entities (e.g. the IOB2 notation). In this paper, we investigate the effects of different SRs on NER tasks, and propose a feature generation method using multiple SRs. The proposed method allows a model to exploit not only highly discriminative features of complex SRs but also robust features of simple SRs against the data sparseness problem. Since it incorporates different SRs as feature functions of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), we can use the well-established procedure for training. In addition, the tagging speed of a model integrating multiple SRs can be accelerated equivalent to that of a model using only the most complex SR of the integrated model. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating multiple SRs into a single model improves the performance and the stability of NER.

Machine learning approaches provide useful features to explore interactions more effectively and efficiently. We have proposed an integrated method that combines two machine learning methods - Random Forests (RF) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) - to identify a subset of important SNPs and detect interaction patterns. In this two-stage RF-MARS (TRM) approach, RF is first applied to detect a predictive subset of SNPs, and then MARS is used to identify the interaction patterns among the selected SNPs. We evaluated the TRM performances in four models: three causal models with one two-way interaction and one null model. RF variable selection was based on outof-bag classification error rate (OOB) and variable important spectrum (IS). First, we compared the selection of important variable of RF and MARS. Our results support that RFOOB had better performance than MARS and RFIS in detecting important variables. We also evaluated the true positive rate and false positive rate of identifying interaction patterns in TRM and MARS. This study demonstrates that TRMOOB, which is RFOOB plus MARS, has combined the strengths of RF and MARS in identifying SNP-SNP interaction patterns in a scenario of 100 candidate SNPs. TRMOOB had greater true positive rate and lower false positive rate compared with MARS, particularly for searching interactions with a strong association with the outcome. Therefore the use of TRMOOB is favored for exploring SNP-SNP interactions in a large-scale genetic variation study.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3243917", "pubmed_id": "22150548", "doi": "10.1111/j.1469-1809.2011.00692.x", "venue": "Annals of human genetics", "journal": "Annals of human genetics", "mag_id": "1910047189", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["20473112", "5045280", "215143708", "4555526", "28847885", "9840457", "42516855", "17244234", "13117866", "215228666", "67910592", "23308", "11229566", "49321106", "215607853", "44916949", "15926821", "2960783"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23289157"}

Recent years witnessed unprecedented growth in the number of medical equipment manufactured to aid high-quality patient care at a fast pace. With this growth of medical equipment, hospitals need to adopt optimal maintenance strategies that enhance the performance of their equipment and attempt to reduce their maintenance costs and effort. In this work, a Predictive Maintenance (PdM) approach is presented to help in failure diagnosis for critical equipment with various and frequent failure mode(s). The proposed approach relies on the understanding of the physics of failure, real-time collection of the right parameters using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, and utilization of machine learning tools to predict and classify healthy and faulty equipment status. Moreover, transforming traditional maintenance into PdM has to be supported by an economic analysis to prove the feasibility and efficiency of transformation. The applicability of the approach was demonstrated using a case study from a local hospital in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where the Vitros-Immunoassay analyzer was selected based on maintenance events and criticality assessment as a good candidate for transforming maintenance from corrective to predictive. The dominant failure mode is metering arm belt slippage due to wear out of belt and movement of pulleys which can be predicted using vibration signals. Vibration real data is collected using wireless accelerometers and transferred to a signal analyzer located on a cloud or local computer. Features extracted and selected are analyzed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect the faulty condition. In terms of economics, the proposed approach proved to provide significant diagnostic and repair cost savings that can reach up to 25% and an investment payback period of one year.

In this paper, we make contributions to audio tagging in two parts, respectively, acoustic modeling and feature learning. We propose to use a shrinking deep neural network DNN framework incorporating unsupervised feature learning to handle the multilabel classification task. For the acoustic modeling, a large set of contextual frames of the chunk are fed into the DNN to perform a multilabel classification for the expected tags, considering that only chunk or utterance level rather than frame-level labels are available. Dropout and background noise aware training are also adopted to improve the generalization capability of the DNNs. For the unsupervised feature learning, we propose to use a symmetric or asymmetric deep denoising auto-encoder syDAE or asyDAE to generate new data-driven features from the logarithmic Mel-filter banks features. The new features, which are smoothed against background noise and more compact with contextual information, can further improve the performance of the DNN baseline.

Hence, there is a need for a system that can infer higher level meaning from collected sensor data. We demonstrate that probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs) can be used as a basis for such a system. To recognize events from raw sensor network measurements, we use a PCFG inference method based on Stolcke(1994) and Chen(1996). We present a fast algorithm for deriving a concise probabilistic context free grammar from the given observational data. The algorithm uses an evaluation metric based on Bayesian formula for maximizing grammar a posteriori probability given the training data. We also present a real-world scenario of monitoring a parking lot and the simulation based on this scenario. We described the use of PCFGs to recognize events in the results of such a simulation. We finally demonstrate the deployment details of such an event recognition system. its construction. Second, we are using a novel method for fast calculation of the metric that takes advantage of the properties of the chunk and merge operations, originally introduced by Stolcke. Please note that what we are presenting in this paper is actually a supervised learning method because the definitions of the events to be recognized are initially given to the learning algorithm. Then, the recognition phase takes place during which new data are classified into events using the grammar created in the learning stage. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

There have been several attempts to construct corpora for handling such chemical-related information based on different corpus-construction guidelines. Even though these guidelines contain common types of chemical information, they differ in several ways. As a result, chemical NER tools developed for a particular guideline might be able to extract common chemical named entities, but they may have problems extracting other chemical-related entities. Assuming the differences between these guidelines are consistent, the pattern of success and failure of the chemical NER tools might also be consistent. In this paper, we present an ensemble-learning approach that uses the conditional random field (CRF) as a machine-learning technique to fuse a variety of different characteristic chemical NER tools based on different guidelines to construct a chemical NER for a particular guideline. To achieve consistent tokenization across these different tools, we applied a post-tokenization mechanism. We evaluated the system using the BioCreative IV, CHEMDNER task datasets. We confirmed that the ensemble-learning approach using a combination of chemical NER tools is better than a simple domain-adaptation approach using just one chemical NER tool. We also confirmed that the ensemble-learning approach could improve the performance of a well-tuned rule-based chemical NER tool on certain tasks.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Trans.

Despite the abundance of data available through tax forms and other sources, it is unclear which factors influence private donation, and a reliable predictive mechanism remains elusive. This study aims to develop predictive models to accurately estimate future charitable giving based on a set of potentially influential factors. We have selected several factors, including unemployment rate, household income, poverty level, population, sex, age, ethnicity, education level, and number of vehicles per household. This study sheds light on the relationship between donation and these variables. We use Stepwise Regression to identify the most influential variables among the available variables, based on which predictive models are developed. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and machine learning techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are used to develop the predictive models.

As this data is growing at rapid rate, there is dire need to process this huge amount of data to better address the need of respective stakeholders. Therefore, in this study, our aim is to develop a machine learning system that can automatically extract information out of public reported judgments of Lahore High Court. This information, once extracted, can be utilized in betterment for society and policy making in Pakistan. This study takes the first step to achieve this goal by means of extracting various entities from legal judgments. Total ten entities are being extracted that include dates, case numbers, reference cases, person names, respondent names etc. In order to automatically extract these entities, primary requirement was to construct dataset using legal judgments. Hence, firstly annotation guidelines are prepared followed by preparation of annotated dataset for entity extraction. Finally, various algorithms including Markov models and Conditional Random Fields are applied on annotated dataset. Experiments show that these approaches achieve reasonable well results for legal data extraction.

In this paper, we propose a multi-view deep network architecture coupled with n-pair loss (JNPL) to eliminate the complex view discrepancy and learn nonlinear mapping functions that are view-invariant. We show that the problem of the large variation in viewpoints of a pedestrian can be well solved using a multi-view network. We simultaneously exploit the complementary representation shared between views and propose an adaptive similarity loss function to better learn a similarity metric. In detail, we first extract view-invariant feature representation from n-pair of images using multi-stream CNN and then aggregate these features for predictions. Given n-positive pairs and a negative example, the network aggregate the feature map of the n-positive pairs and predicts the identity of the person and at the same time learns features that discriminate positive pairs against the negative sample.

The thermophysical properties of pure ILs and their binary mixtures with water or alcohols are required for various usages. In this communication, in order to determine the density values of ILs, a large data bank containing a large number of ILs binary mixtures (1510 data sets) was gathered from previously published literature. The Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) strategy as a reliable and powerful computational prediction method was utilized for predicting the density of binary mixtures at atmospheric pressure. Additionally, a second LSSVM model was developed for predicting the density of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate + methanol binary mixture at different pressures using 405 data points. Coupled Simulated Annealing (CSA) optimization tool was employed in order to optimize the parameters of both models. For the first model, the inputs were density of each compound at standard condition, temperature, and mole fraction of IL and for the second model temperature, pressure, and mole fraction of IL were considered as the input parameters. Moreover, in order to evaluate the performance of these models, various graphical and statistical error analyses were performed. These analyses demonstrated that the developed models are able to predict the density of ILs with high accuracy and reliability. Finally, in order to detect the applicability domain of the models, the Leverage approach was applied, which led to the detection of the probable data outliers.

The sequence of a mature microRNA, especially the 'seeding sequence', largely determines its binding ability and specificity to target mRNAs. Therefore, methods that predict mature microRNA sequences with high accuracy will benefit the identification and characterization of novel microRNAs and their targets, and contribute to inferring the post-transcriptional regulation network at a genome scale. ::: ::: ::: METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS ::: We have developed a method, MiRmat, to predict the mature microRNA sequence. MiRmat is essentially composed of two parts: the prediction of Drosha processing site and the identification of Dicer processing site. Based on the analysis of microRNAs from 12 species, we found that the patterns of free energy profiles are conserved among vertebrate microRNA hairpins. Therefore, we introduced in our method the free energy distribution pattern of the downstream part of pri-microRNA secondary structure and Random Forest algorithm to predict the mature microRNA sequence. Based on the evaluation on an independent test dataset from 10 vertebrates, MiRmat was shown to identify 77.8% of the Drosha processing sites and 92.8% of the Dicer sites within a deviation of 2 nt. In a more stringent evaluation by excluding the microRNAs sharing the same family between the training set and test set, MiRmat kept a rather well performance of 71.9% and 87.2% of the identification rate on the Drosha and Dicer site respectively, which represents the ability to deal with the novel microRNA family. MiRmat outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and has a high degree of efficacy for the prediction of mature microRNA sequences of vertebrates. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: MiRmat was developed for identifying microRNA mature sequence(s) by introducing the free energy distribution of RNA stem-loop structure and the Random Forest algorithm. We prove that MiRmat has better performance than the existing tools and is applicable among vertebrates.

The datasets used for the creation of evidence maps for the gold prospectivity mapping include a comprehensive lake sediment geochemical dataset, interpreted geological structures (form lines), mapped and interpreted faults, lithology, topographic features (lakes), and known Au occurrences. The RF method performed well in that the gold prospectivity map created was a better predictor of the known Au occurrences than the KD gold prospectivity map. This was further validated by a fivefold repetition using a subset of the input training areas. Several advantages to the use of RF include (1) the ability to take both continuous and/or categorical data as variable inputs, (2) an internal, unbiased estimation of the mapping error (out-of-bag error) removing the need for a cross-validation of the final outputs to determine accuracy, and (3) the estimation of importance of each input variable.

Methods and Materials Clinical data and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were collected from 261 patients who received 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer with at least 5 years of follow-up. The series was split 1000 times into training and validation cohorts. A RF was trained to predict the risk of 5-year overall rectal toxicity and bleeding. Parameters of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) model were identified and a logistic regression model was fit. The performance of all the models was assessed by computing the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results The 5-year grade \u22652 overall rectal toxicity and grade \u22651 and grade \u22652 rectal bleeding rates were 16%, 25%, and 10%, respectively. Predictive capabilities were obtained using the RF-NTCP model for all 3 toxicity endpoints, including both the training and validation cohorts. The age and use of anticoagulants were found to be predictors of rectal bleeding. The AUC for RF-NTCP ranged from 0.66 to 0.76, depending on the toxicity endpoint. The AUC values for the LKB-NTCP were statistically significantly inferior, ranging from 0.62 to 0.69.

The increasing sophistication and diversity of the malicious Android apps render the conventional malware detection techniques ineffective, which results in a large number of malicious applications remaining undetected. This calls for more effective techniques for detection and classification of Android malware. Hence, in this paper, we present an Android malicious application detection framework based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Active Learning technologies. In our approach, we extract applications' activities while in execution and map them into a feature set, we then attach timestamps to some features in the set. We show that our novel use of time-dependent behavior tracking can significantly improve the malware detection accuracy. In particular, we build an active learning model using Expected error reduction query strategy to integrate new informative instances of Android malware and retrain the model to be able to do adaptive online learning. We evaluate our model through a set of experiments on the DREBIN benchmark malware dataset. Our evaluation results show that the proposed approach can accurately detect malicious applications and improve updatability against new malware.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.23919/CNSM.2017.8256035", "venue": "2017 13th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM)", "journal": "2017 13th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2783334894", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["390252", "14242198", "14727192", "207212541", "206452028", "433048", "40095", "207208264", "13143337", "3752040", "1039430", "207197053", "510695", "27248410", "10659969", "12771053", "7516542", "44853183", "16708948", "12887517", "41204951", "11798451", "324600", "8197231", "22396287", "2690523"], "inbound_citations": ["59283914", "52012534", "204861075", "212419713", "19216366"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:902643"}

Most of these methods are aimed at classification problems in high dimensional input space. However, it is shown that there are many drawbacks for these widely used methods. These weaknesses pose new challenges in analyzing large data sets in various domains, such as QSAR. With no optimal solution from existing methods, a universal and robust new variable selection method, which is not confined by these known restrictions, is needed. ::: The new univariate variable selection method, which is built on top of Random Forest, is shown to be effective. The method not only has exceptional performance on real and artificial data sets, but also is computationally fast and efficient. The performance of this method is demonstrated to be at least as good as the performance of existing methods. The usefulness of this new technique is further proved through the application to the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge. ::: Currently, there is not much emphasis on variable selection on pairs of variables that have a significant joint effect but do not have much influence by themselves. Unfortunately, univariate variable selection methods are not suitable in selecting pairs of linked variables. To address this issue, a new bivariate variable selection method is proposed, which is illustrated to possess the desired property of identifying pairs of significant variables. The performance of this method is verified with real and simulated data sets along with permutation tests, which provide baseline measurement for assessing the significance of identified pairs of variables. Furthermore, a graphical device is introduced to display the relationship between each coupling pair and the response variable.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "176215349", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["15653204"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117471117"}

Instead of breaking it down into two separate tasks---pedestrian detection and person re-identification, we jointly handle both aspects in a single convolutional neural network. An Online Instance Matching (OIM) loss function is proposed to train the network effectively, which is scalable to datasets with numerous identities.

Over the past few decades, several severity scoring systems and machine learning mortality prediction models have been developed for predicting hospital mortality. By contrast, early mortality prediction for intensive care unit patients remains an open challenge. Most research has focused on severity of illness scoring systems or data mining (DM) models designed for risk estimation at least 24 or 48 h after ICU admission. Objectives This study highlights the main data challenges in early mortality prediction in ICU patients and introduces a new machine learning based framework for Early Mortality Prediction for Intensive Care Unit patients (EMPICU). Materials and methods The proposed method is evaluated on the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database. Mortality prediction models are developed for patients at the age of 16 or above in Medical ICU (MICU), Surgical ICU (SICU) or Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit (CSRU). We employ the ensemble learning Random Forest (RF), the predictive Decision Trees (DT), the probabilistic Naive Bayes (NB) and the rule-based Projective Adaptive Resonance Theory (PART) models. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The explanatory variables included demographic, physiological, vital signs and laboratory test variables. Performance measures were calculated using cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to minimize bias. 11,722 patients with single ICU stays are considered. Only patients at the age of 16 years old and above in Medical ICU (MICU), Surgical ICU (SICU) or Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit (CSRU) are considered in this study. Results The proposed EMPICU framework outperformed standard scoring systems (SOFA, SAPS-I, APACHE-II, NEWS and qSOFA) in terms of AUROC and time (i.e. at 6 h compared to 48 h or more after admission). Discussion and conclusion The results show that although there are many values missing in the first few hour of ICU admission, there is enough signal to effectively predict mortality during the first 6 h of admission. The proposed framework, in particular the one that uses the ensemble learning approach \u2013 EMPICU Random Forest (EMPICU-RF) offers a base to construct an effective and novel mortality prediction model in the early hours of an ICU patient admission, with an improved performance profile.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29132626", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.10.002", "venue": "International journal of medical informatics", "journal": "International journal of medical informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2764165920", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10668328", "52805624", "19162791", "15249735", "45494044", "4899361", "13545404", "13712287", "27709297", "12872746", "73154015", "22292284", "37937550", "6394904", "891441", "2323467", "11714369", "15611860", "19619286", "22662049", "34985998", "21754617", "42341790", "5596332", "32357383", "19273129", "35065673", "72710100", "24429980", "24429980", "70668431", "23801905", "17318773", "23397990", "26678332", "13861754", "2367747", "2457143", "25255948", "1554582", "205387438", "33285731"], "inbound_citations": ["199521604", "53789737", "204818982", "212420571", "215497116", "204244459", "3985337", "109422267", "207828589", "207944954", "214618895", "209506583", "44070104", "53749437", "211027890", "209099750", "53147966", "59339119", "190912683", "212647191", "102350832", "167220454", "214675804"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24168513"}

In this work, we propose a feature selection framework for constructing an occupancy estimator. The framework has two main components: a filter component, which uses a filter method of feature selection and a wrapper component, which implements a wrapper method of feature selection with a machine learning based occupancy estimator. The framework is thus a kind of filter-wrapper hybrid feature selection method. However, the framework is novel in that it uses a combination of static and dynamic features. We use the static features for the purpose of speed, since filter methods of feature selection (which work with static features) are quite fast. Thus, the overall computation time of the framework is kept low, while ensuring good accuracy of estimation due to the use of dynamic features in the wrapper stage. To perform occupancy estimation within the proposed framework, we present a novel technique called the Hybrid Feature-Scaled Extreme Learning Machine (HFS-ELM).

Alcohol affects neuromotor functions such as walk patterns, making them a reliable bio-measure of intoxication. In this paper, we present AlcoWear, a machine learning based system that passively senses a drinker's Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) by classifying accelerometer and gyroscope data gathered from their smartphone and smartwatch. While gait sensor readings taken from a device attached to the user's trunk (smartphone) are the most accurate, users often do not carry their phones (e.g. leave them on a table) while walking around during their day. Smartwatches are worn continuously but are less accurate due to noisier sensor readings (e.g. confounding hand gestures). AlcoWear extracts and classifies features such as sway area (gyroscope) and cadence (accelerometer) from smartphone sensor data, and features such as Total Harmonic Distortion (accelerometer) and angular velocity (gyroscope) from the same users' smartwatches. On the smartphone, the J48 classifier was the most accurate, classifying user gait patterns into BAC ranges of [0.00\u20130.08), [0.08\u20130.15), [0.15\u20130.25), [0.25+) with an accuracy of 89.45%. For the smartwatch, AlcoWear classifies users as being in BAC ranges [ = 0.08] (2 bins) with a 79.8% accuracy using a Random Forest classifier.

Prior work uses artificial data augmentation techniques such as cropping, and color jitter which can only affect the image in superficial ways and are not aligned with how objects actually change e.g. occlusion, deformation, viewpoint change. In this paper, we argue that videos offer this natural augmentation for free. Videos can provide entirely new views of objects, show deformation, and even connect semantically similar but visually distinct concepts.

Using a state-of-the-art metric learning model that encodes both class-level and fine-grained semantic information, we are able to generate samples that are semantically similar to a given source image. The semantic information extracted by the metric learning model transfers to out-of-distribution novel classes, allowing the generative model to produce samples that are outside of the training distribution. We show that our proposed method is able to generate 256$\\times$256 resolution images from novel classes that are of similar visual quality to those from the training classes.

We show that interpolation in the feature space and latent space results in semantically and visually plausible transformations in the image space.

A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was used to determine discriminative success between the classes of plankton organisms or geometric shapes respectively. The discriminative success was compared between a model using standard features and additional RQA and ESQ. For the high intra- and low interclass variance of the plankton contour line data set the included features enhanced discriminative success by 3 % to a maximum of 65.8 %. For the data set of geometric shapes an increase of 6.8 % to 95.2 % was observed. Although the overall increase of discriminative success was not extraordinary high by using a linear model, it can be seen that both RQA and ESQ are valuable auxiliary features to split specific classes from the entire population.

However, possible inaccuracies in the collected data from case histories as well as natural variability of parameters and other uncertainties associated with natural phenomenon have yet prohibited a conclusive definition for this threshold. Various classification techniques have been used to define the most reliable correlations. However, available liquefied to non-liquefied data imbalance has caused learning bias to the majority class in the learning model of the pattern recognition systems. This has adversely affected the outcome of such approaches and in order to overcome this problem Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) strategy is employed to ''up sample'' the minority data. In other words SVDD, which is robust against noisy samples, is used to generate virtual data points for the minority class, bearing the same characteristics as the non-virtual samples. In order to specify the most appropriate data range a sphere boundary around the main body of the data are sought through an optimization process. The data inside the obtained boundary are the target data and the ones outside it are the outliers or so-called ''noise'', to be neglected. This procedure reduces the issue of class intermixture in the fringe zone and produces relatively well defined class that then is fed into the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) classifier for determination of liquefaction potential. The predictions are then examined to evaluate the reliability and validation of the overall technique and compared with other prediction methods using confusion matrix. It is shown that the overall accuracy of the proposed technique is higher than all previously proposed methods and only equal to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique.

In this study, attempt has been made to develop method for predicting subcellular location of mycobacterial proteins.ResultsThe models were trained and tested on 852 mycobacterial proteins and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation technique. First SVM (Support Vector Machine) model was developed using amino acid composition and overall accuracy of 82.51% was achieved with average accuracy (mean of class-wise accuracy) of 68.47%. In order to utilize evolutionary information, a SVM model was developed using PSSM (Position-Specific Scoring Matrix) profiles obtained from PSI-BLAST (Position-Specific Iterated BLAST) and overall accuracy achieved was of 86.62% with average accuracy of 73.71%. In addition, HMM (Hidden Markov Model), MEME/MAST (Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation/Motif Alignment and Search Tool) and hybrid model that combined two or more models were also developed. We achieved maximum overall accuracy of 86.8% with average accuracy of 89.00% using combination of PSSM based SVM model and MEME/MAST. Performance of our method was compared with that of the existing methods developed for predicting subcellular locations of Gram-positive bacterial proteins.ConclusionA highly accurate method has been developed for predicting subcellular location of mycobacterial proteins.

These models generate text by sampling words sequentially, with each word conditioned on the previous word, and are state-of-the-art for several machine translation and summarization benchmarks. These benchmarks are often defined by validation perplexity even though this is not a direct measure of the quality of the generated text. Additionally, these models are typically trained via maxi- mum likelihood and teacher forcing. These methods are well-suited to optimizing perplexity but can result in poor sample quality since generating text requires conditioning on sequences of words that may have never been observed at training time. We propose to improve sample quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which explicitly train the generator to produce high quality samples and have shown a lot of success in image generation. GANs were originally designed to output differentiable values, so discrete language generation is challenging for them. We claim that validation perplexity alone is not indicative of the quality of text generated by a model. We introduce an actor-critic conditional GAN that fills in missing text conditioned on the surrounding context. We show qualitatively and quantitatively, evidence that this produces more realistic conditional and unconditional text samples compared to a maximum likelihood trained model.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1801.07736", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2951433039,2784823820,2963574252", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["14096841", "1820089", "2852525", "748227", "2940568", "15953218", "1033682", "2118350", "10894094", "7443908", "2428314", "6628106", "14994977", "98180", "1998416", "1428702", "252796", "17048224", "9016624", "11080756", "836219", "397556", "7147309", "7961699", "9166388", "1211821", "3203345", "13756489", "3603249", "3439214", "12713052"], "inbound_citations": ["211080824", "118684820", "195847946", "210921264", "102486945", "204852130", "208229926", "213152193", "168169995", "53302674", "53687745", "4621743", "50782526", "204867723", "49426397", "207925994", "207953522", "202577225", "174800569", "202714537", "213184715", "202781916", "202584395", "52898626", "204754882", "53773501", "166228140", "201698174", "53248119", "13696127", "53164266", "197935188", "201066650", "145815549", "204800442", "53297505", "209315287", "211204849", "174797842", "204960955", "209832390", "53160180", "202558804", "52292169", "3662488", "52816759", "196831420", "202665779", "153314078", "58005863", "59261859", "212414759", "203610243", "48357995", "88493117", "201814361", "52177946", "196181371", "195774866", "201657071", "174819514", "57590015", "198341975", "57373791", "184486899", "201665978", "53771922", "214692951", "52090464", "52091366", "54434209", "198179579", "4451272", "214694085", "77393522", "52017098", "201725307", "52947736", "204401935", "210839653", "214714561", "170079223", "209832430", "204960694", "214802863", "53208122", "52075090", "146120891", "195345672", "204838079", "208077138", "201103950", "212671670", "202712565", "198994956", "57373775", "166228565", "202578016", "59553516", "21725995", "208139016", "102353164", "199661586", "44234288"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3655946"}

The influence of chemotherapy was investigated on breast cancer patients by obtaining well separated Kaplan-Meier survival curves for three classes of patients. A novel approach was proposed for using a minimal number of data points in order to generate an accurate classifier. Substantial progress was also made towards achieving new results in the field of data mining by using the extremely versatile and highly effective approach of support vector machines. In particular, minimal kernel classifiers were constructed that use minimal subset of the data. A new type of classifier, the proximal classifier, was proposed and implemented which is basically an order of magnitude faster than conventional classifiers. The effect of chemotherapy on breast cancer patients was more accurately assessed.

The first algorithm aims to solve SVM model selection problem. ACO originally deals with discrete optimization problem. In applying ACO for solving SVM model selection problem which are continuous variables, there is a need to discretize the continuously value into discrete values. This discretization process would result in loss of some information and hence affects the classification accuracy and seeking time. In this algorithm we propose to solve SVM model selection problem using IACOR without the need to discretize continuous value for SVM. The second algorithm aims to simultaneously solve SVM model selection problem and selects a small number of features. SVM model selection and selection of suitable and small number of feature subsets must occur simultaneously because error produced from the feature subset selection phase will affect the values of SVM model selection and result in low classification accuracy. In this second algorithm we propose the use of IACOMV to simultaneously solve SVM model selection problem and features subset selection. Ten benchmark datasets were used to evaluate the proposed algorithms. Results showed that the proposed algorithms can enhance the classification accuracy with small size of features subset.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "47231917", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["37565028", "16653420", "12342641", "17401198", "15034664", "17337072", "7341459", "27749977", "206743178", "35379659", "16546374", "552473", "14595780", "62196304", "22180758", "17872869", "19605535", "17097794", "5628229", "27504113", "205700001", "6794051", "15941305", "206829177", "24331029", "15099710", "38351020"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56870432"}

The intuition behind these models is that if we translate from one domain to the other and back again we should arrive at where we started. However, existing methods always adopt a symmetric network architecture to learn both forward and backward cycles. Because of the task complexity and cycle input difference between the source and target image domains, the inequality in bidirectional forward-backward cycle translations is significant and the amount of information between two domains is different. In this paper, we analyze the limitation of the existing symmetric GAN models in asymmetric translation tasks, and propose an AsymmetricGAN model with both translation and reconstruction generators of unequal sizes and different parameter-sharing strategy to adapt to the asymmetric need in both unsupervised and supervised image-to-image translation tasks. Moreover, the training stage of existing methods has the common problem of model collapse that degrades the quality of the generated images, thus we explore different optimization losses for better training of AsymmetricGAN, and thus make image-to-image translation with higher consistency and better stability. Extensive experiments on both supervised and unsupervised generative tasks with several publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed AsymmetricGAN achieves superior model capacity and better generation performance compared with existing GAN models. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the asymmetric GAN framework on both unsupervised and supervised image-to-image translation tasks.

The authors describe the Columbia Classification Algorithm for Suicide Assessment (C-CASA), a standardized suicidal rating system that provided data for the pediatric suicidal risk analysis of antidepressants conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). ::: ::: ::: METHOD ::: Adverse events (N=427) from 25 pediatric antidepressant clinical trials were systematically identified by pharmaceutical companies. Randomly assigned adverse events were evaluated by three of nine independent expert suicidologists using the Columbia classification algorithm. Reliability of the C-CASA ratings and agreement with pharmaceutical company classification were estimated. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Twenty-six new, possibly suicidal events (behavior and ideation) that were not originally identified by pharmaceutical companies were identified in the C-CASA, and 12 events originally labeled as suicidal by pharmaceutical companies were eliminated, which resulted in a total of 38 discrepant ratings. For the specific label of \"suicide attempt,\" a relatively low level of agreement was observed between the C-CASA and pharmaceutical company ratings, with the C-CASA reporting a 50% reduction in ratings. Thus, although the C-CASA resulted in the identification of more suicidal events overall, fewer events were classified as suicide attempts. Additionally, the C-CASA ratings were highly reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.89). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Utilizing a methodical, anchored approach to categorizing suicidality provides an accurate and comprehensive identification of suicidal events. The FDA's audit of the C-CASA demonstrated excellent transportability of this approach. The Columbia algorithm was used to classify suicidal adverse events in the recent FDA adult antidepressant safety analyses and has also been mandated to be applied to all anticonvulsant trials and other centrally acting agents and nonpsychotropic drugs.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3804920", "pubmed_id": "17606655", "doi": "10.1176/appi.ajp.164.7.1035", "venue": "The American journal of psychiatry", "journal": "The American journal of psychiatry", "mag_id": "2138959943", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["12260808", "2535474", "18647894", "18840493", "13613441", "9301043", "17842367", "202001033", "27802257", "16063740", "20552188", "46721060", "15115668", "22690838", "8887806", "7704742", "41209750", "14778682", "211102636", "44080484", "9773631", "37371221", "210715916", "53483516", "4974011", "23060776", "2092262", "10335178", "18882447", "4951007", "207891764", "53100498", "44960008", "12038754", "202234785", "4895362", "1814281", "16619314", "11098371", "211089167", "13362985", "207912663", "10025397", "23691249", "29401672", "10771239", "37255244", "8043228", "877488", "14800412", "11256306", "25890525", "24993006", "23352608", "36130078", "215601228", "3939970", "433100", "33280506", "6065136", "11210181", "17060271", "205459980", "13860184", "211084016", "202701710", "215696669", "13756399", "46872596", "144187226", "4035825", "878049", "6588124", "18136088", "9250163", "1023637", "1625392", "202896710", "58572099", "6428127", "40922794", "1167809", "4281735", "4855672", "52302813", "215118196", "52918928", "73727302", "34316789", "22432112", "5415420", "28312506", "212428289", "8992442", "213187594", "56016489", "15207717", "3080863", "26418578", "22240027", "13715108", "12737292", "2942501", "195872843", "14537271", "51611779", "10100984", "6452762", "31908411", "2308282", "13335978", "103002169", "103002169", "24870988", "17475968", "5037067", "35674144", "39695649", "215084510", "27828404", "215497289", "208170473", "35799819", "1037068", "210181593", "4902089", "52925693", "22458256", "6510365", "212641628", "215048197", "209469115", "53668798", "211076928", "10209127", "54460511", "51697866", "67801942", "11617957", "46777150", "3559171", "206773264", "14191408", "10013979", "8909578", "32864582", "214845974", "210130412", "17423994", "10179309", "58666893", "11444207", "14950188", "2267078", "54466194", "44278419", "73725430", "9520915", "10207325", "25522118", "2343739", "11177478", "9368741", "215457288", "52178234", "612477", "12174557", "160014464", "614080", "21355367", "215179620", "6415666", "13355868", "38806484", "2067797", "6769554", "30300014", "10427301", "17855857", "43039936", "15080672", "40118965", "204738614", "146806863"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21893905"}

In this study, we used simultaneously acquired hyperspectral and LiDAR data from LiCHy (Hyperspectral, LiDAR and CCD) airborne system to classify tree-species in subtropical forests of southeast China. First, each individual tree crown was extracted using the LiDAR data by a point cloud segmentation algorithm (PCS) and the sunlit portion of each crown was selected using the hyperspectral data. Second, different suites of hyperspectral and LiDAR metrics were extracted and selected by the indices of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the mean decrease in Gini index (MDG) from Random Forest (RF). Finally, both hyperspectral metrics (based on whole crown and sunlit crown) and LiDAR metrics were assessed and used as inputs to Random Forest classifier to discriminate five tree-species at two levels of classification. The results showed that the tree delineation approach (point cloud segmentation algorithm) was suitable for detecting individual tree in this study (overall accuracy = 82.9%). The classification approach provided a relatively high accuracy (overall accuracy > 85.4%) for classifying five tree-species in the study site. The classification using both hyperspectral and LiDAR metrics resulted in higher accuracies than only hyperspectral metrics (the improvement of overall accuracies = 0.4\u20135.6%).

The objective of this study is to deliver healthcare services to patients outside the conventional settings by connecting the patient and healthcare providers with technology. As technologies for telehealth monitoring have become more advanced, they have become fully integrated into delivery of healthcare service. One of the most publicized telehealth services is the use of telemammography in the early diagnosis of breast cancer from remote and rural locations. Automated detection and classification of tumor in telemammographic images is of high importance for physicians for accurate prediction of the diseases. This study presents advances in telehealth services and also proposes novel telemammography system for early detection of breast cancer from remote and underserved areas. In this study, we have used efficient wavelet-based image processing techniques for preprocessing, detection, and enhancing the resolution of mammographic images. A detailed comparative analysis is performed to select the best classification model using different classification algorithms. We have used Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks, J48 decision trees, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbor classifier for classifying the tumor into three categories namely: benign, malignant, and normal. The classification is based on the area, volume, and boundaries of tumor masses. All the tumor features and classification methods are compared using Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, and Mean Square Error.

Obtaining reliable performance assessments at the earliest stages of test development can also be problematic. We describe a novel approach to classifier development designed to create clinically useful tests together with reliable estimates of their performance. The method incorporates elements of traditional and modern machine learning to facilitate the use of cohorts where the number of samples is less than the number of measured patient attributes. It is based on a hierarchy of classification and information abstraction and combines boosting, bagging, and strong dropout regularization. We apply this dropout-regularized combination approach to two clinical problems in oncology using mRNA expression and associated clinical data and compare performance with other methods of classifier generation, including Random Forest. Performance of the new method is similar to or better than the Random Forest in the two classification tasks used for comparison. The dropout-regularized combination method also generates an effective classifier in a classification task with a known confounding variable. Most importantly, it provides a reliable estimate of test performance from a relatively small development set of samples. The flexible dropout-regularized combination approach is able to produce tests tailored to particular clinical questions and mitigate known confounding effects.

Following the manifold regularization approach, Laplacian Support Vector Machines (LapSVMs) have shown the state of the art performance in semi-supervised classification. In this paper we present two strategies to solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the original dual formulation. In particular, training a LapSVM in the primal can be efficiently performed with preconditioned conjugate gradient. We speed up training by using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or, if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. The computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced from O(n3) to O(kn2), where n is the combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples and k is empirically evaluated to be significantly smaller than n. Due to its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for dealing with large data sets.

APOE4 is robustly associated with increased AD risk compared to the neutral APOE3 and protective APOE2. APOE alleles have also been associated with differential inflammation and gastrointestinal recovery after insult in human and murine studies, leading us to hypothesize that APOE alleles impact the gut microbiome. Methods: To assess this hypothesis, we compared 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon-based microbiome profiles in a cohort of mice that were homozygous for APOE2, APOE3, or APOE4, and included both males and females as well as carriers and non-carriers of five familial AD (5xFAD) mutations. Fecal samples were analyzed from mice at 4 and 6 months of age. APOE genotype, as well as sex and 5xFAD status, was then tested for influence on alpha diversity (Shannon H index) and beta diversity (principal coordinate analyses and PERMANOVA). A Random Forest analysis was used to identify features that predicted APOE, sex and 5xFAD status. Results: The richness and evenness (alpha diversity) of the fecal microbiome was not robustly associated with APOE genotype, 5xFAD status or sex. In contrast, microbial community composition (beta-diversity) was consistently and strongly associated with APOE genotype. The association between beta-diversity and sex or 5xFAD status was less consistent and more modest. Comparison of the differences underlying APOE effects showed that the relative abundance of multiple bacterial taxa was significantly different as a function of APOE genotype. Conclusions: The structure of the gut microbiome was strongly and significantly associated with APOE alleles in this murine model. Further evaluation of these findings in humans, as well as studies evaluating the impact of the APOE-associated microbiota on AD-relevant phenotypes in murine models, will be necessary to determine if alterations in the gut microbiome represent a novel mechanism whereby APOE genotype impacts AD.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7034241", "pubmed_id": "32117315", "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2020.00200", "venue": "Frontiers in Immunology", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3006412153", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["46045450", "207011076", "8597413", "25637847", "14834065", "25018891", "10944530", "10280322", "3832913", "16745828", "2110579", "5973514", "10285777", "20350036", "4782436", "3267252", "205325824", "40267333", "11050545", "13788981", "24609843", "25501176", "17974113", "2743932", "205748413", "18797375", "16014330", "3045922", "3788324", "5494061", "130201729", "2099459", "89141", "11691351", "8620592", "14052240", "2078725", "14728954", "46775621", "13948323", "3681086", "24278208", "24958723", "35725078", "43362792", "19489349", "22894277", "215067153", "7060963", "8805148", "20839979", "5654131", "162184565", "13159131", "15256944", "79924833", "13902817", "25044302", "15830252", "7221410", "13879489", "3778782", "4977038", "4416280", "201839104", "4868013", "3489126", "3507789", "208142392", "4645454", "6297887", "7287463", "4411617", "2347786", "8894114", "14213893", "11274593", "8499365", "42617535"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211109668"}

A priori, it is not obvious how we may generalize such methods to manifolds. We consider specifically the problem of distance metric learning, and present a framework that solves it on a large class of manifolds, such that similar data are located in closer proximity with respect to the manifold distance function. In particular, we extend the existing metric learning algorithms, and derive the corresponding sample complexity rates for the case of manifolds.

The approach taken in this paper involves training a network to map linguistic spatial assertions onto a task enviroment, such that the meanings of the assertions become encoded in terms of how the system has processed them. By analogy with Classical computation, such meanings can be referred to as procedural. Cluster analyses of weights and activations are employed to investigate how such procedural meanings might be implemented in a connectionist system.

The quality of view synthesis directly affects the user experience. Therefore, the quality assessment of view synthesis is of great significance. Distortions in the texture/depth map and distortions caused by imperfect rendering methods can cause the loss of texture naturalness in the synthesized views. The human visual system exhibits multi-scale property when perceiving visual scenes. Inspired by these facts, we propose a blind quality evaluation metric for the Synthesized Views based on multi-scale Texture naturalness (SVT). We first build the scale space of the synthesized view. Then the Gray level Gradient Co-occurrence Matrix (GGCM) map at each scale is computed for texture extraction. Two groups of texture features are calculated from the GGCM maps to quantify the texture naturalness.

However, as the data are being generated explosively in this big data era, many machine learning algorithms, including the random forest algorithm, may face the difficulty in maintaining and processing all the required data in the main memory. Instead, intensive data movements (i.e., data swappings) between the faster-but-smaller main memory and the slowerbut-larger secondary storage may occur excessively and largely degrade the performance. To address this challenge, the emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies are placed great hopes to substitute the traditional random access memory (RAM) and to build a larger-than-ever main memory space because of its higher cell density, lower power consumption, and comparable read performance as traditional RAM. Nevertheless, the limited write endurance of NVM cells and the read-write asymmetry of NVMs may still limit the feasibility of performing machine learning algorithms directly on NVMs. Such dilemma inspires this study to develop an NVM-friendly bagging strategy for the random forest algorithm, in order to trade the \u201crandomness\u201d of the sampled data for the reduced data movements in the memory hierarchy without hurting the prediction accuracy.

There is an urgent requirement to improve on existing methods for detecting, mapping and establishing the precise extent of oil-impacted and oil-free vegetation. This is needed to quantify existing spill extents, formulate effective remediation strategies and to enable effective pipeline monitoring strategies to identify leakages at an early stage. An effective oil spill detection algorithm based on optical image spectral responses can benefit immensely from the inclusion of multi-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, especially when the effect of multi-collinearity is sufficiently reduced. This study compared the Fuzzy Forest (FF) and Random Forest (RF) methods in detecting and mapping oil-impacted vegetation from a post spill multispectral optical sentinel 2 image and multifrequency C and X Band Sentinel \u2013 1, COSMO Skymed and TanDEM-X SAR images. FF and RF classifiers were employed to discriminate oil-spill impacted and oil-free vegetation in a study area in Nigeria. Fuzzy Forest uses specific functions for the selection and use of uncorrelated variables in the classification process to yield an improved result. This method proved an efficient variable selection technique addressing the effects of high dimensionality and multi-collinearity, as the optimization and use of different SAR and optical image variables generated more accurate results than the RF algorithm in densely vegetated areas. An Overall Accuracy (OA) of 75% was obtained for the dense (Tree Cover Area) vegetation, while cropland and grassland areas had 59.4% and 65% OA respectively.

First, considering the semantic complementary, how can we represent the concurrent media objects and fuse the complementary information they carry to understand the integrated semantics precisely. Second, considering the modality complementary, how can we accomplish the modality bridge to establish the cross-index and facilitate the cross-media retrieval? To solve the two problems, we first construct a Multimedia Document (MMD) Semi-Semantic Graph (MMDSSG) and then adopt Multidimensional Scaling to create an MMD Semantic Space (MMDSS). Both long-term and short-term feedbacks are proposed to boost the system performance. The first one is used to refine the MMDSSG and the second one is adopted to introduce new items that are not in the training set into the MMDSS. Since all of the MMDs and their component media objects of different modalities lie in the MMDSS and they are indexed uniformly by their coordinates in the MMDSS regardless of their modalities, the semantic subspace is actually a bridge of media objects which are of different modalities and the cross-media retrieval can be easily achieved.

Smolensky [1987] argued successfully, that (in Van Gelders words), \u201cConnectionist representations can be compositional without being strictly combinatorial in the Classical sense\u201d. Van Gelder went on to show that Classical concatenative compositionality is just one form of compositionality, and that one strength of ANNs lies in another, which he calls functional compositionality. Its existence can be demonstrated through an analysis of the hidden representations which form during the training of both feedforward and recurrent multi-layer perceptrons. These representations are a point of particular interest because of their potential to enable the development of effective models of natural language which do not rely upon the combinatorial syntax and traditional, explicitly algorithmic methods of Computational Linguistics.

We formalize this problem within the full-information adversarial bandit framework, where we evaluate the capability of an algorithm to select mixtures of discriminators for providing the generator with feedback during learning. To this end, we propose a reward function which reflects the progress made by the generator and dynamically update the mixture weights allocated to each discriminator. We also draw connections between our algorithm and stochastic optimization methods and then show that existing approaches using multiple discriminators in literature can be recovered from our framework. We argue that less expressive discriminators are smoother and have a general coarse grained view of the modes map, which enforces the generator to cover a wide portion of the data distribution support. On the other hand, highly expressive discriminators ensure samples quality. Finally, experimental results show that our approach improves samples quality and diversity over existing baselines by effectively learning a curriculum.

Surficial geology maps are an integral data source for mineral and energy exploration. Moreover, they provide information such as the location of gravels and sands, which are important for infrastructure development. Currently, surficial geology maps are produced through expert interpretation of aerial photography and field data. However, interpretation is known to be subjective, labour-intensive and difficult to repeat. The expert knowledge required for interpretation can be challenging to maintain and transfer. In this research, we seek to assess the potential of deep neural networks to aid surficial geology mapping by providing an objective surficial materials initial layer that experts can modify to speed map development and improve consistency between mapped areas. Such an approach may also harness expert knowledge in a way that is transferable to unmapped areas. For this purpose, we assess the ability of convolution neural networks (CNN) to predict surficial geology classes under two sampling scenarios. In the first scenario, a CNN uses samples collected over the area to be mapped. In the second, a CNN trained over one area is then applied to locations where the available samples were not used in training the network. The latter case is important, as a collection of in situ training data can be costly. The evaluation of the CNN was carried out using aerial photos, Landsat reflectance, and high-resolution digital elevation data over five areas within the South Rae geological region of Northwest Territories, Canada. The results are encouraging, with the CNN generating average accuracy of 76% when locally trained. For independent test areas (i.e., trained over one area and applied over other), accuracy dropped to 59\u201370% depending on the classes selected for mapping. In the South Rae region, significant confusion was found between till veneer and till blanket as well as glaciofluvial subclasses (esker, terraced, and hummocky ice-contact). Merging these classes respectively increased accuracy for independent test area to 68% on average. Relative to the more widely used Random Forest machine learning algorithm, this represents an improvement in accuracy of 4%.

The classifier agent employs in its training concepts of Self-Organized Maps and Multiple Instance Learning. The motivation for this proposal was the need of a classifier for the processing of signals from partial discharges (PD) in electrical power systems. The monitoring of these signals allows building a database that can be a reference for the detection of failures in equipment and thus support predictive maintenance routines. The simplicity of calculations, which are based on the Manhattan distance (City Block metric), makes it very suitable for use in embedded systems, field-programmable-logic based systems (e. g. FPGAs) and application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Further improvements can be achieved with pipelining and parallelism techniques, leading to significant maximization of sample rates. The classifier can operate with multiple classes without requiring complex configurations. Other advantages include automatic fitting to the complexity of the problem, the ability to deal with input vectors with different characteristics (inheritance of multiple instance learning) and, depending on implementation, it may be easily upgraded to allow operation with new input patterns (other than those used in the initial training). To evaluate the proposal, we used a set of PD databases obtained by simulations and laboratory measurements.

A conventional method to inspect the varietal purity of rice seeds is based on manually selecting random samples of rice seed from a batch and evaluating the physical grain properties through a process of human visual inspection. This is a tedious, laborious, time consuming and extremely inefficient task where only a very small subset of the entire batch of the rice seed can be examined. There is, therefore, a need to automate this process to make it repeatable and more efficient while allowing a larger sample of rice seeds from any batch to be analysed. This paper presents an automatic rice seed inspection method which combines hyperspectral imaging and tools from machine learning to automatically detect seeds which are erroneously contained within a batch when they actually belong to a completely different species. Image data from Near-infrared (NIR) and Visible Light (VIS) hyperspectral cameras are acquired for six common rice seed varieties. Two different classifiers are applied to the data: a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Random Forest (RF), where each consists of six one-versus-rest binary classifiers. The results show that combining spectral and shape-based features derived from the rice seeds results in an increase in the precision (PPV) of the multi-label classification to 84% compared with 74% when only visual features are used.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2535350686", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["11640159", "33868950", "20005406", "29251581", "124568025"], "inbound_citations": ["203994925"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55534894"}

Such benefits include the mapping of economically useful tree species, which are a key source of food production and fuel wood for the local communities, and of problematic alien invasive and bush encroaching species, which can threaten the integrity of the environment and livelihoods of the local communities. Species level mapping is particularly challenging in African savannas which are complex, heterogeneous, and open environments with high intra-species spectral variability due to differences in geology, topography, rainfall, herbivory and human impacts within relatively short distances. Savanna vegetation are also highly irregular in canopy and crown shape, height and other structural dimensions with a combination of open grassland patches and dense woody thicket \u2013 a stark contrast to the more homogeneous forest vegetation. This study classified eight common savanna tree species in the Greater Kruger National Park region, South Africa, using a combination of hyperspectral and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived structural parameters, in the form of seven predictor datasets, in an automated Random Forest modelling approach. The most important predictors, which were found to play an important role in the different classification models and contributed to the success of the hybrid dataset model when combined, were species tree height; NDVI; the chlorophyll b wavelength (466 nm) and a selection of raw, continuum removed and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) bands. It was also concluded that the hybrid predictor dataset Random Forest model yielded the highest classification accuracy and prediction success for the eight savanna tree species with an overall classification accuracy of 87.68% and KHAT value of 0.843.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2012.03.005", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2089806346", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["61808816", "18564919", "14328219", "41316462", "27655793", "214857835", "201803656", "15209224", "557546", "17564727", "3815880", "123796043", "14637498", "124459467", "17378895", "215289669", "55808280", "7839824", "42961359", "215639909", "59468728", "2235261", "73434162", "18245569", "36913168", "1761627", "46897307", "129725862", "33341095", "13826115", "211476023", "55622396", "26994832", "58013164", "198677", "197547954", "85555916", "202757724", "19645400", "104293226", "204230630", "42134834", "29471802", "5086469", "17999146", "45891689", "1286898", "41142612", "58981728", "16256003", "3553371", "55186592", "12872756", "18468806", "57361626", "3485851", "70350320", "27715643", "54454862", "4679260", "27254922", "26725165", "22862566", "67362010", "201099006", "24489818", "111383370", "9193278", "208039114", "2561251", "52278356", "134621707", "11429929", "17821964", "2654777", "10690758", "40481", "52115383", "55965430", "6387294", "33373963", "203898046", "134903302", "4810687", "203642335", "159042517", "58013916", "125867781", "135028333", "46396586", "28761933", "31715126", "210843399", "26583702", "67773689"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129258567"}

Moreover, the geological conditions restrictions may have so much influence on the results that may lead this method to out of function. In order to overcome these shortcomings, in this paper the responses of shearer's cutting force was detected to monitor the shearer's cutting state. The response of shearer's cutting force was influenced by multiple factors, such as coal rupture form and working environment. This requires the signal should be processed by using multiple waveforms which can represent multiple factors and finally can find the response of shearer's signal which hide behind the mixed total signal. In order to solve this problem, a multiple scaling functions based multiwavelet algorithm was proposed which can represent the coal-rock interface characteristic signal. A characteristic library was been built by using multiwavelet band energy which can represent the coal-rock response feature of Shearer. By doing numbers of physical simulation tests, it is found that the multiwavelet band energy extract the coal-rock response feature has more advanced than that of the single wavelet analyses.

Many real-world text corpora however are evolving, in that documents can be added, deleted and modified. An example of evolving text is Wikipedia. Therefore, to keep extracted information up to date, we often must apply IE repeatedly, to consecutive corpus snapshots. How to efficiently execute such repeated IE? ::: In this dissertation I describe solutions that efficiently execute such repeated IE by recycling previous IE efforts. Specifically, given a current corpus snapshot U, these solutions first identify text portions of U that also appear in the previous corpus snapshot V. Since these solutions have already executed the IE program over V, they can now recycle the IE results of these parts, by combining these results with the results of executing IE over the remaining parts of U, to produce the complete IE results for U. We describe three systems that deal with successively more complex IE programs. The first system, Cyclex, recycles for IE programs that contain a single IE blackbox. The second system, Delex, recycles for IE programs that consist of multiple IE blackboxes. The third system, CRFlex, also considers multi-blackbox IE programs, but some of these blackboxes are based on a leading statistical learning model: Conditional Random Fields.

However, equipping WSNs with GPS sensors entails the additional costs of hardware logic and increased power consumption, thereby lowering the lifetime of the sensor, which is normally operated on a non-rechargeable battery. Range-free-based localization schemes have shown promise compared to range-based approaches as preferred and cost-effective solutions. Typical range-free localization algorithms have a key advantage: simplicity. However, their precision must be improved, especially under varying node densities, sensing coverage conditions, and topology diversity. Thus, this work investigates the probable integration of two soft-computing techniques, namely, Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), with the goal of enhancing the approximate localization precision while considering the above factors. In stark contrast to ELMs, FL methods yield high accuracy under low node density and limited coverage conditions. In addition, as a hybrid scheme, extra steps are integrated to compensate for the effects of irregular topology (i.e., noisy signal density due to obstacles). Signal and weight are normalized during the fuzzy states, while the ELM uses a deep learning concept to adjust the signal coverage, including the spring force error estimation enhancement.

It provides a closed form equation for a change of error for exchanging assignments between two random samples (called a swap), and an extreme speed-up over the original method even for a very large corpus like the MNIST Handwritten Digits dataset. The method starts from random assignment, and continues in a greedy optimization algorithm by randomly swapping pairs of samples, keeping the swaps that reduce the error. The toolbox speed reaches a million of swaps per second, and thousands of model updates per second for successful swaps in GPU implementation, even for very large dataset like MNIST Handwritten Digits.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2016.04.039", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2349615607", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["9435027", "20390335", "52988144", "21937841", "32096229"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207114046"}

During the past decade, Support Vector Machine (SVM), a learning scheme for classification, has drawn tremendous attention due to its theoretical merit and practical success. However, limitations still exist when SVM meets real-world applications. The major thesis of this dissertation is to introduce new formulations that are derived to overcome the limitations of SVM and thus extend its horizon in practice. Furthermore, based on SVM and the extensions a novel approach toward video object (VO) extraction is presented to add another practical dimension to this powerful learning machine. ::: The first extension to be introduced is \u03c8-learning. It is motivated by the observation that the theory of SVM, which is well developed for separable cases, becomes less solid when extended to nonseparable cases. By replacing the hinge loss function in SVM with a designed \u03c8 function, \u03c8-learning fully takes into account the generalization errors in nonseparable cases and consequently improves the classification accuracy in such situations. ::: The second limitation of SVM is the requirement of Boolean (or hard) memberships. To address this problem, we reformulate SVM to be a new learning machine named Soft SVM, which allows samples to belong to different classes by different degrees and adjust the classification boundary from them accordingly. ::: Thirdly, this dissertation considers the generalization of SVM from binary classification, which is the scenario the classifier is originally designed for, to multi-class as well as single-class scenarios. For the multi-class case, we introduce both static and dynamic reliability measures into the framework of the traditional one-against-all multi-class scheme, and then based on these reliability measures we propose a new decision strategy for a better one-against-all method. One-class classification, on the other hand, is one special problem that raises the issue of describing the target class rather than discriminating between classes as in the binary and multi-class problems. In the context of SVM, we propose a new one-class classifier named minimum enclosing and maximum excluding machine (MEMEM), which offers capabilities for both pattern description and discrimination. ::: In practice, run time is always a critical factor, and the problem of slow training of SVM has been a bottleneck. In this dissertation, we tackle this efficiency issue in the area of feature selection. Two steps are taken. First, a new criterion is proposed to effectively filter out non-essential features before each training step begins. Secondly, we dynamically maintain a subset of training samples and use them rather than all the available samples for every necessary training. As a result, the total computational load is significantly reduced. ::: Lastly, a novel approach toward VO extraction is presented. Each VO is considered as a class, and VO extraction is realized by classifying every pixel to one of the available classes. It is significantly different from the traditional approaches yet overcomes many of their shortcomings. SVM, \u03c8-learning, and Soft SVM are employed as the classifier and experimental results demonstrate the great potential of machine learning in the area of VO extraction.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2533241869", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["27144828"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62965760"}

Pedestrians\u2019 events are pedestrian movements as the first step of H2020 project called SimuSafe with a goal to reduce traffic fatalities by doing risk assessments of the pedestrians. The movements the MLs\u2019 models are attempting to classify are standing, walking, and running. Data, i.e. IMU, GPS sensor signals and other contextual information are collected by a smartphone through a controlled procedure. The smartphone is placed in five different positions onto the body of participants, i.e. arm, chest, ear, hand and pocket. The recordings are filtered, trimmed, and labeled. Next, samples are generated from small overlapping sections from which time and frequency domain features are extracted. Three different experiments are conducted to evaluate the performances in term of accuracy of the MLs\u2019 models in different circumstances. The best performing MLs\u2019 models determined by the average accuracy across all experiments is Extra Tree (ET) with a classification accuracy of 91%.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "International journal of artificial intelligence", "mag_id": "2997099743,2976993238", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204081457"}

The zoo dataset taken from UCI data repository contains data items that describe animals according to certain attributes that categorize them under seven different classes. Our central aim in this paper is to provide a detailed comparative study of few of the major ensemble learners with respect to the base learner. We are also looking into all the factors that are primarily responsible for reaching the conclusion and how they affect the decision and select the most important ones.

Attacks can be deployed with minimal cost and effort, enabling attackers to launch large volumes of attacks in short spaces of time. The fast-paced nature of phishing makesautomated detection processes critical for the safe-guarding of Internet users.This study investigates the use of machine learning for phishing detection, with features extracted from the URL only. Through experimentation, a set of 87 effective features were identified, including a significant number of novel features not found in existing research. An evaluation of classificationalgorithms identified that a Random Forest model with 150 trees maximized classification performance,obtaining an F1 score of 0.92 and ROC AUC of 0.97 when testing on a noisy data set of URLs obtained from spam email - a major communication channel where phishing attacks are found. A comparison against existing research indicated that the model built in this study outperforms state-of-the-artlexical classifiers, and often outperforms classifiers that use external features too.The obtained results were used to build a large-scale lexical classifier, Poseidon, that is able to acceleratethe classification of phishing sites, reducing the load on a more expensive classification process by99%. It is shown that Poseidon outperforms existing systems of this nature with respect to various evaluation metrics. Testing on a live feed of 2 million unlabelled URLs/day, Poseidon is able to detect 6000 phishing attacks/month, costing $0.01 per true positive when using a mainstream cloud servicesprovider.This study is one of the few to evaluate classification in a real-life scenario, using phishing and benign URLs retrieved from an environment in which a large proportion of phishing attacks operate.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2780066557", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59056550"}
