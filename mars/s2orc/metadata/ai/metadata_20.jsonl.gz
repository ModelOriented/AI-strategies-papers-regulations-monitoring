Moreover, existing methods may require that the camera parameters are known limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a new method to estimate the sunlight direction from a single (outdoor) image by inferring casts shadows through object modeling and recognition. First, objects (e.g., cars or persons) are first (automatically) recognized in images by exemplar-SVMs. Instead of training the Support Vector Machine (SVMs) using natural images (limited variation in viewpoints), we propose to train on 2D object samples generated from 3D object models. Then, the recognized objects are used as sundial cues (probes) to estimate the sunlight direction by inferring the corresponding shadows generated by 3D object models considering different illumination directions.

Abstract Recent connectionist models and theories of embodied cognition offer new perspectives on language comprehension. We review the latest accounts on the issue and present an SRN- based model, which incorporates ideas of embodiment theories and avoids (1) vast architectural complexity, (2) explicit structured semantic input, and (3) separated training regimens for processing components. Keywords: language acquisition, comprehension, production; sentence processing; language-vision integration; visual attention; embodied cognition; connectionist modeling; SRNs. Connectionist models of language comprehension Several connectionist architectures deal with the task of language comprehension and integration of language and events, proposing different realizations of semantic representation and implementations of the integration process. Rohde (2002) introduced the Connectionist Sentence Comprehension and Production Model, an architecture based on extended simple recurrent networks (SRNs, Elman, 1990) which is capable of comprehending and producing complex sentences, covering a wide range of well-known empirical phenomena. The model clearly focuses on scalability, however possibly at the expense of explanatory power and psychological plausibility. Especially relevant for our issue is the realization of the semantic component: Rohde's model is trained with explicit propositional representations prior to the corresponding target sentence. This greatly assists the network, leaving no way to tell whether it simply succeeds because the semantic representation provided all crucial information explicitly. Learning of the propositions is achieved through a query mechanism, inquiring each of its parts, a process questionable in its cognitive adequacy. The problem of explicit information holds similarly for the Incremental Nonmonotonic Self-organization of Meaning Network (Mayberry, 2003). The semantic representations used in the model are based on Minimal Recursion Semantics (Copestake et al., 2005), which makes them very powerful and complex information carriers. The model is capable of parsing natural language corpora, an impressive achievement, reached at the expense of a highly complex, opaque architecture and pre-fabricated semantic content. In a more recent study Mayberry, Crocker and Knoeferle (2005) introduced the Coordinated Interplay Account Network which integrates a scene representation with the incremental input of a sentence description, enabling adaptive use of context information. Since the presented scenes are externally segmented into agent, action and patient, the major part of semantic interpretation is provided to the model explicitly. While these models certainly achieved good results concerning their aims, they show several shortcomings making them unsuitable for our approach. Firstly, extensive use of different layers and components makes it impossible to deduce responsible structures and working mechanisms Introduction 'Gavagai!' If we heard a native speaking a foreign language utter this word upon seeing a rabbit, we would be faced with the problem Quine described in Ontological Relativity (1968): How do we know what exactly an utterance refers to in an infinitely rich set of objects, events and relations our environment provides? But this problem appears almost trivial compared to a human child confronted with the task to acquire its mother's language. Several sub-tasks have to be solved simultaneously to achieve this grounding of speech to referential meaning: there is the problem of a highly complex world rich in details, happenings and relations. There is the problem of a continuous stream of words. There is the large problem of relating the one to the other. And there is the problem that there is no previously given language to help finding this relation. In other words, the task is to bind a holistic situation to a sequential series of related linguistic expressions. This affords to integrate representations of language and the outside world, both represented in distinctive forms, following completely different rules and depending on different hierarchical and causal relations. A central aspect of models of language comprehension and acquisition is how they account for these questions. In connectionist models, language interpretation and integration of situational context is based on mechanisms of association and self-organization. Theories in embodied cognition research offer an account for assignment of linguistic structures to constructions of coherent semantic interpretations. Language comprehension is considered to be a simulation of perceptual experiences of the hearer, and the linguistic structure serves as an instruction for the correct construction of the situation.

Despite obvious benefits, their use is often limited to an academic context, largely because of expensive domain customizations, which means that the performance in domain-specific applications often fails to meet expectations. This paper presents cost-efficient remedies: a selection mechanism increases the precision of document retrieval and a fused approach to transfer learning is proposed in order to improve the performance of answer extraction. Here knowledge is inductively transferred from a related, yet different, tasks to the domain-specific application, while accounting for potential differences in the sample sizes across both tasks.

This could be explained both by the complex arrangement of heterogeneous land-cover classes and by the high diversity of urban patterns which can be encountered throughout the scene. In this context, using a single segmentation parameter to obtain satisfying segmentation results for the whole scene can be impossible. Nonetheless, it is possible to subdivide the whole city into smaller local zones, rather homogeneous according to their urban pattern. These zones can then be used to optimize the segmentation parameter locally, instead of using the whole image or a single representative spatial subset. This paper assesses the contribution of a local approach for the optimization of segmentation parameter compared to a global approach. Ouagadougou, located in sub-Saharan Africa, is used as case studies. First, the whole scene is segmented using a single globally optimized segmentation parameter. Second, the city is subdivided into 283 local zones, homogeneous in terms of building size and building density. Each local zone is then segmented using a locally optimized segmentation parameter. Unsupervised segmentation parameter optimization (USPO), relying on an optimization function which tends to maximize both intra-object homogeneity and inter-object heterogeneity, is used to select the segmentation parameter automatically for both approaches. Finally, a land-use/land-cover classification is performed using the Random Forest (RF) classifier. The results reveal that the local approach outperforms the global one, especially by limiting confusions between buildings and their bare-soil neighbors.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2278422", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2763677584", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["54741771", "23702320", "121562264", "54976265", "62166600", "120684371", "14415030", "14080761", "10296432", "30537967", "17371657", "16485211", "129221037", "28559299", "11041696", "36928206", "129114844", "121634338", "126372879", "11395084", "123982202", "32291744", "10204564", "17082001", "89141", "120495115"], "inbound_citations": ["3778573", "201621634", "52931228", "52017616", "68096248"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67096275"}

In the early steps of learning, such methods record a new instance by allocating it a new kernel. In the later steps, however, useless memory must be forgotten to make space for recording important and new instances once the number of kernels reaches an upper bound. In such cases, it is important to find a way to determine what memory should be forgotten. This is an important process for yielding a high generalization capability. In this paper, we propose a new method that selects between one of two forgetting strategies, depending on the redundancy of the memory in the learning machine. If there is redundant memory, the learner replaces the most redundant memory with a new instance. If there is less redundant memory, the learner replaces the least recently used / least frequently used memory.

Real-time TSA allows for deciding and monitoring of the relevant preventive/corrective control actions depending on the dynamic behavior of the system components.

After determination of the coherent machines, any corrective or preventive action can be initiated by the system operator to maintain stability of the system during occurrence of any severe contingency. The Transient Severity Index (TSI) introduced in this paper has proven to be an interesting alternative for determining generator coherency. Furthermore, the numerical values of this index are employed to construct a supervised learning-based classifier and the ranking method with the help of system load and generation as input features.

Accelerated efforts to identify presymptomatic stages of AD and biomarkers to classify the disease are urgent needs. Currently, no biomarkers can perfectly discriminate individuals into multiple disease categories of AD (no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia). Although many biomarkers for diagnosis and their various features are being studied, we lack advanced statistical methods which can fully utilize biomarkers to classify AD accurately, thereby facilitating evaluation of putative markers both alone and in combination. In this paper, we propose two approaches: 1) a forward addition procedure in which we adapt an additive logistic regression model to the setting for disease with ordered multiple categories. Using this approach, we select and combine multiple cross-sectional biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy, and 2) a method by extending the Neyman-Pearson Lemma to the ordered three disease categories to construct optimal cutoff points to distinguish multiple disease categories. We evaluate the robustness of the proposed model using a simulation study. Then we apply these two methods to data from the Religious Orders Study to examine the feasibility of combining biomarkers, and compare the diagnostic accuracy between the proposed methods and existing methods including model-based methods (ordinal logistic regression and quadratic discriminant analysis), a tree-based method CART, and the Youden index method.

Recently, deep learning methods have been used for breast lesion diagnosis with raw image input.

Specifically, these features are difficult to relate to clinically relevant phenomena. ::: ::: ::: PURPOSE ::: Inspired by the cognition process of radiologists, we propose a Knowledge-driven Feature Learning and Integration (KFLI) framework, to discriminate between benign and malignant breast lesions using Multi-sequences MRI. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Starting from sequence division based on characteristics, we use domain knowledge to guide the feature learning process so that the feature vectors of sub-sequence are constrained to lie in characteristic-related semantic space. Then, different deep networks are designed to extract various sub-sequence features. Furthermore, a weighting module is employed for the integration of the features extracted from different sub-sequence images adaptively. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The KFLI is a domain knowledge and deep network ensemble, which can extract sufficient and effective features from each sub-sequence for a comprehensive diagnosis of breast cancer.

In conclusion, a unified cross-fertilization was proposed for knowledge representation and modeling based on lattice theory with emphasis on clustering, classification, and regression applications (Kaburlasos, 2006). Of particular interest in practice is the totally-ordered lattice (R,\u2264) of real numbers, which has emerged historically from the conventional measurement process of successive comparisons. It is known that (R,\u2264) gives rise to a hierarchy of lattices including the lattice (F,\u2264) of fuzzy interval numbers, or FINs for short (Papadakis & Kaburlasos, 2007). This article shows extensions of two popular neural networks, i.e. fuzzy-ARTMAP (Carpenter, Grossberg, Markuzon, Reynolds & Rosen 1992) and self-organizing map (Kohonen, 1995), as well as an extension of conventional fuzzy inference systems (Mamdani & Assilian, 1975), based on FINs. Advantages of the aforementioned extensions include both a capacity to rigorously deal with nonnumeric input data and a capacity to introduce tunable nonlinearities. Rule induction is yet another advantage.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4018/978-1-59904-849-9.ch181", "venue": "Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence", "journal": null, "mag_id": "34447654", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27923112"}

Smaller EEG headsets such as the Emotiv are now available and can be used during daily activities.

For discourse feature extraction, we propose a novel parts-of-speech (POS) tagging technique that effectively reduces the dimensionality of discourse features. To classify discourse information, we exploit two classifiers such as a HMM and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We further obtain classifier fusion between HMM and SVM to improve discourse classification.

The input and output systems communicate with both the internal and external environments of the cognizer and transmit codes to and from the rule governed, central processing system which operates on structured representational expressions in the internal environment. The connectionist approach, by contrast, suggests that the cognitive architecture should be thought of as a network of interconnected neuron-like processing elements (nodes) which operates rather like a brain. Connectionism distinguishes input, output and central or \"hidden\" layers of nodes. Connectionists claim that internal processing consists not of the rule governed manipulation of structured symbolic expressions, but of the excitation and inhibition of activity and the alteration of connection strengths via message passing within and between layers of nodes in the network. A central claim of the thesis is that neither symbol processing nor connectionism provides an adequate characterization of the role of the external environment in cognitive computation. An alternative approach, called the External Tape Hypothesis (ETH), is developed which claims, on the basis of Turing's analysis of routine computation, that the Turing machine model can be used as the basis for a theory which includes the environment as an essential part of the cognitive architecture. The environment is thought of as the tape, and the brain as the control of a Turing machine. Finite state automata, Turing machines, ::: and universal Turing machines are described, including details of Turing's original universal machine construction. A short account of relevant aspects of the history of digital computation is followed by a critique of the symbol processing approach as it is construed by influential proponents such as Allen Newell and Zenon Pylyshyn among others. The External Tape Hypothesis is then developed as an alternative theoretical basis. In the final chapter, the ETH is combined with the notion of a self-describing Turing machine to provide the basis for an account of thinking and the development of internal representations.", "year": 1994, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1512764659", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43755913"}

In this paper, we propose a method for abnormal activity detection without any manual labeling of the training samples. By leveraging the Field of View (FOV) modulation, the spatio-temporal characteristic of human activity is encoded into low-dimension data stream generated by the ceiling-mounted Pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) sensors. The similarity between normal training samples are measured based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of each pair of them. The natural clustering of normal activities is discovered through a self-tuning spectral clustering algorithm with unsupervised model selection on the eigenvectors of a modified similarity matrix. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are employed to model each cluster of normal activities and form feature vectors.

This indicates that I3D is better at capturing high-level temporal patterns than low-level motion signals.

First, we use GAN to generate a large number of CISLs from small annotated data, which are difficult to be distinguished from real counterparts. These generated samples are used to pre-train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying CISLs. Second, we fine-tune the CNN classification model with real data. Experiments were conducted on the LISS database of CISLs. We successfully convinced radiologists that our generated CISLs samples were real for 56.7% of our experiments. The pre-trained CNN model achieves 88.4% of mean accuracy of binary classification, and after fine-tuning, the mean accuracy is significantly increased to 95.0%. For multi-classification of all types of CISLs and normal tissues, through the two stages of training, the mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are up to about 91.83%, 92.73% and 99.0%, respectively.

The present work aims at providing a contribution to the definition of a more effective recognition of movement in the DR applications. To this aim we describe the implementation of a Movement Segmentation procedure which permits to distinguish between posture change movements, such as lying down and standing up, and cyclic movements such as walking, walking downstairs and upstair.

The D-Leaf model achieved a comparable testing accuracy of 94.88 percent as compared to AlexNet (93.26 percent) and fine-tuned AlexNet (95.54 percent) models. In addition, CNN models performed better than the traditional morphometric measurements (66.55 percent). The features extracted from the CNN are found to be fitted well with the ANN classifier.

With recent breakthroughs on the estimation of geographical ancestry and physical appearance, the estimation of chronological age comes to complete this circle of information. Recent studies have identified methylation sites in the human genome that correlate strongly with age and can be used for the development of age-estimation algorithms. In this study, 110 whole blood samples from individuals aged 11\u201393 years were analysed using a DNA methylation quantification assay based on bisulphite conversion and massively parallel sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of 12 CpG sites. Using this data, 17 different statistical modelling approaches were compared based on root mean square error (RMSE) and a Support Vector Machine with polynomial function (SVMp) model was selected for further testing. For the selected model (RMSE = 4.9 years) the mean average error (MAE) of the blind test (n = 33) was calculated at 4.1 years, with 52% of the samples predicting with less than 4 years of error and 86% with less than 7 years. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the method was assessed both in terms of methylation quantification accuracy and prediction accuracy in the first validation of this kind. The described method retained its accuracy down to 10 ng of initial DNA input or \u223c2 ng bisulphite PCR input. Finally, 34 saliva samples were analysed and following basic normalisation, the chronological age of the donors was predicted with less than 4 years of error for 50% of the samples and with less than 7 years of error for 70%.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30243148", "doi": "10.1016/j.fsigen.2018.09.003", "venue": "Forensic science international.

In this paper a new hybrid intelligent method is proposed for short term load forecasting. In this method, load and temperature of previous days are used for prediction of the next hour electrical load consumption. Since electrical load signals are non-stationary, Wavelet Transform (WT) as a powerful signal analyzer is applied for the signal decomposing. For elimination of redundant data from input matrices, the Feature Selection (FS) method based on Gram\u2013Schmidt (GS) is used for selection of more valuable features. The elimination of redundant data can speed up learning process and improve the generalization capability of the prediction scheme. Support Vector Machine (SVM) with simple structure and few tuning parameters is applied as a powerful regression tool. Two separate structures are considered for prediction of weekday and weekend electrical load consumption. Besides, in order to increase the forecasting accuracy, indices are determined for each day. The simulation results reveal that the Coiflet wavelet function with 2 decomposition levels lead to the best detection accuracy. Moreover, 30 dominant features of previous 50 days should be used to obtain minimum forecasting error.

Urban areas despite being heterogeneous in nature are characterized as mixed pixels in medium to coarse resolution imagery which renders their mapping as highly inaccurate. A detailed classification of urban areas therefore needs both high spatial and spectral resolution marking the essentiality of different satellite data. Hyperspectral sensors with more than 200 contiguous bands over a narrow bandwidth of 1\u201310 nm can distinguish identical land use classes. However, such sensors possess low spatial resolution. As the exchange of rich spectral and spatial information is difficult at hardware level resolution enhancement techniques like super resolution (SR) hold the key. SR preserves the spectral characteristics and enables feature visualization at a higher spatial scale. Two SR algorithms: Anchored Neighbourhood Regression (ANR) and Sparse Regression and Natural Prior (SRP) have been executed on an airborne hyperspectral scene of Advanced Visible/Near Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) for the mixed environment centred on Kankaria Lake in the city of Ahmedabad thereby bringing down the spatial resolution from 8.1 m to 4.05 m. The generated super resolved outputs have been then used to map ten urban material and land cover classes identified in the study area using supervised Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification methods.

Random forest induction is a bagging method that builds decision trees by selecting in each node the \u201dbest\u201d feature, not out of all available features, but out of a random subset of features (which may be different for each node). The motivation for this work is based on two observations. On the one hand, random forests have been shown to work well when many features are available. Hence, their use seems especially interesting for relational data mining, for which it is typical that there is a large number of features, many of which are expensive to compute. On the other hand, using random forests allows an extension of the feature space by including aggregate functions, possibly refined with selection conditions on the set to be aggregated. This combination of aggregation and selection in relation learning is not a trivial task, because the feature set grows quickly, and because the search space is less well-behaved due to the non-monotonicity problem. However, the use of random forests tackles both problems.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In Proceedings of the ICML Workshop on Statistical Relational Learning and its Connections", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "245759112", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["166928892", "16425225", "1341209", "207738357", "56776745", "1836349", "16821651", "10748648", "35312999", "594009"], "inbound_citations": ["14500701", "5736951", "3709825", "8852726", "16484608", "18966017", "69376539"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16930772"}

However, it is quite labor-intensive and time-consuming to collect and annotate a large amount of videos. Moreover, training deep neural networks on large-scale video datasets always demands huge computational resources which further hold back many researchers and practitioners. To resolve that, collecting and training on annotated images are much easier. However, thoughtlessly applying images to help recognize videos may result in noticeable performance degeneration due to the well-known domain shift and feature heterogeneity. This proposes a novel symmetric adversarial learning approach for heterogeneous image-to-video adaptation, which augments deep image and video features by learning domain-invariant representations of source images and target videos. Primarily focusing on an unsupervised scenario where the labeled source images are accompanied by unlabeled target videos in the training phrase, we present a data-driven approach to respectively learn the augmented features of images and videos with superior transformability and distinguishability. Starting with learning a common feature space (called image-frame feature space) between images and video frames, we then build new symmetric generative adversarial networks (Sym-GANs) where one GAN maps image-frame features to video features and the other maps video features to image-frame features. Using the Sym-GANs, the source image feature is augmented with the generated video-specific representation to capture the motion dynamics while the target video feature is augmented with the image-specific representation to take the static appearance information. Finally, the augmented features from the source domain are fed into a network with fully connected layers for classification. Thanks to an end-to-end training procedure of the Sym-GANs and the classification network, our approach achieves better results than other state-of-the-arts, which is clearly validated by experiments on two video datasets, i.e., the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31144637", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2019.2917867", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2946169958", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["26967833", "11562208", "22269195", "1033682", "12757870", "16689170", "4974063", "15118984", "10628224", "15273903", "10319651", "7646250", "8548594", "1283257", "5023039", "5832928", "196129418", "407822", "6480652", "13798326", "17105302", "14701603", "5702881", "4908577", "10360019", "5698233", "7419723", "17169365", "556999", "745350", "6755881", "12453047", "16439870", "34369127", "4357800", "59942932", "2871880", "4445132", "4547917", "206595056", "10756563", "10627900", "206770979", "43564031", "15044501", "1122604", "4883312", "19046372", "3783306", "16991836", "2683207", "6704804", "206771128", "21668618", "7197134", "7455708", "2939703", "206592218", "206594692", "6628106", "52874011", "6742009", "1990988", "19598463", "49883347", "3861990", "740063"], "inbound_citations": ["208267638", "214647360"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:169038473"}

Moreover, the high dimensional of the feature vectors has make the analysis task more challenging. In this research, two emotion recognition experiments were performed in order to classify human emotional states into high/low valence or high/low arousal. The first experiment was aimed to evaluate the performance of Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT) in extracting relevant features, while the second experiment was conducted to identify the combination of electrode channels that optimally recognize emotions based on the valence-arousal model. Additionally, in this study, a leave-one-out cross validation was performed using Radial Basis Function-Support Vector Machines (RBF-SVM) as the classifier on a public ally available data set.

This paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering method by learning a shared generative latent representation that obeys a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The motivation is based on the fact that the multi-view data share a common latent embedding despite the diversity among the views. Specifically, benefited from the success of the deep generative learning, the proposed model not only can extract the nonlinear features from the views, but render a powerful ability in capturing the correlations among all the views.

Combining several models to make a final prediction is not often considered. Using an ensemble or a collection of models rather than a single model can improve the accuracy and robustness of prediction results. In this study, we investigate two well-established ensemble learning methods (stochastic gradient boosting and random forest) and propose two new ensembles (ensemble by partial least squares and bag-boosting) in the application of predicting the loss given default. We demonstrate that an ensemble approach significantly increases the discriminatory power of the model compared with a single decision tree. In addition, the ensemble learning methods can be applied directly to predicting the exposure at default and probability of default with some simple modifications. The proposed approaches introduce a novel modeling framework that banks and other financial institutions can use to estimate and validate credit risk parameters based on the internal data of different portfolios.

This work addresses this limitation by means of a triplet-based deep metric learning specifically tailored to deal with human motion data, in particular with the prob- lem of varying input size and computationally expensive hard negative mining due to motion pair alignment. Specifically, we propose (1) a novel metric learn- ing objective based on a triplet architecture and Maximum Mean Discrepancy; as well as, (2) a novel deep architecture based on attentive recurrent neural networks. One benefit of our objective function is that it enforces a better separation within the learned embedding space of the different motion categories by means of the associated distribution moments.

However, despite ANN\u2019s superior performance some problems such as over-fitting and poor explanatory power arise.

Next, the simulated data are used to pre-train the generative adversarial networks (GANs), which initializes their parameters to fit the general distribution of numeral features. Finally, we adopt the real handwritten numerals to fine-tune the GANs, which greatly increases the authenticity of generated numeral samples. In this case, the outputs of the GANs can be employed to augment original numeral datasets for training the follow-up inference models. Considering that all simulation and augmentation are operated in 1-D vector space, the proposed augmentation framework is more computationally efficient than those based on 2-D images.

The procedure started with an adaptive thresholding approach to extract Region of Interest (ROIs) from in situ plankton images, followed by a procedure to suppress the background noise and enhance target features for each extracted ROI. The enhanced ROIs were classified into seven categories by a pre-trained classifier which was a combination of a CNN and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The CNN was selected to improve feature description and the SVM was utilized to improve classification accuracy. A series of comparison experiments were then conducted to test the effectiveness of the pre-trained classifier including the combination of CNN and SVM versus CNN alone, and the performance of different CNN models. Compared to CNN model alone, the combination of CNN and SVM increased classification accuracy and recall rate by 7.13% and 6.41%, respectively.

Inthis paper, weimplement a Probabilistic FrameworkforSupport VectorMachine (PSVM)thatallows forautomatic tuning ofthepenalty coefficient parameters andthekernel parameters viaMarkov ChainMonteCarlo(MCMC)methodandapply ittoweb searching viatextcategorization. Thisprobabilistic framework was tested on wellknownbenchmark textcategorization dataset. Theresult fromPSVM wascompared against the conventional SVM,andK-Nearest Neighbor withP-Tree (KNN-PTree) andKNN.Theproposed methodology isapplied todevelop awebsearch engine.

The proposed method involves the extraction of patterns between general geometrical, functional and environmental bridge descriptors with the posting status in the national inventory of reinforced concrete slab bridges. Decision Tree and Random Forest classification algorithms were selected as the primary tools and were carefully trained, tested and tuned on a dataset of over 40,000 bridges considering several resampling and cost- sensitive classification scenarios to deal with the inherent class imbalance. Upon the selection and tuning of final models, validations were performed on an independent unseen dataset of over 5,000 bridges and generalizability of models was confirmed. Finally, the application of the same models on the population of bridges without plans demonstrated that 17% of currently unposted bridges and 8.4% of currently posted bridges need further evaluations thus highlighting the relative inefficiency of human judgment in detecting hidden deterioration processes.

However, learning temporal logical for- malisms, which are typically utilized by logic-based Event Recognition systems is a challenging task, which most ILP systems cannot fully undertake. In addition, event-based data are usually massive and collected at dierent times and under various circumstances. Ideally, systems that learn from temporal data should be able to operate in an incremental mode, that is, revise prior constructed knowledge in the face of new evidence. Most ILP systems are batch learners, in the sense that in order to account for new evidence they have no alternative but to forget past knowledge and learn from scratch. Given the increased inherent complexity of ILP and the volumes of real-life temporal data, this results to algorithms that scale poorly.

To address this challenge, unsupervised methods are strongly preferred for training neural networks without using any labeled data. In this paper, we present a novel paradigm of unsupervised representation learning by Auto-Encoding Transformation (AET) in contrast to the conventional Auto-Encoding Data (AED) approach. Given a randomly sampled transformation, AET seeks to predict it merely from the encoded features as accurately as possible at the output end. The idea is the following: as long as the unsupervised features successfully encode the essential information about the visual structures of original and transformed images, the transformation can be well predicted. We will show that this AET paradigm allows us to instantiate a large variety of transformations, from parameterized, to non-parameterized and GAN-induced ones.

The whole process is divided into three stages i.e. Signal Generation, Feature Extraction and Classification. There are 6 types of modulated signals i.e. BPSK, QPSK, FSK, ASK, 4ASK and QAM generated and decomposed by Biorthogonal wavelet to obtain the detail components from each signal. The energy level of each detail components are calculated and forms a feature vector representing the identification of the signal itself prepared to be classified in the vector space of SVM classifier. The classification results shows that the performance of classification works well if the signal to noise ratio (SNR) above 13dB in the range from 1dB to 30dB, which indicates it is feasible working under a certain noise level to classify those defined 6 types of modulated signals. Furthermore, we analyze the reasons that cause the different performance of the signals on the classification test and also discuss the limitation and the possible development of the method in the end.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1486390163", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14342228"}

METHODS: We developed a low-cost stethoscope and mobile phone software that can record lung sounds and detect adventitious sounds (Chamberlain et al. 2015). The system was used to record lung sounds from 155 patients who visited hospitals and clinics in India. Each patient9s sound files were reviewed by a pulmonologist who indicated the presence of wheezes or crackles. For each sound file, a spectrogram was generated and used to extract features based on variation in both time and frequency. Using these features and previously published features (Aydore et al. 2009), we trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify wheezes and crackles. RESULTS: Using leave-one-out cross validation, our crackle detector algorithm yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.87 and the wheeze algorithm produced an AUC value of 0.71.

The attack uses a massively distributed large-scale botnet to generate low-rate benign traffic aiming to congest selected network links, so-called target links. The adoption of benign traffic, while simultaneously targeting multiple network links, makes detecting the Crossfire attack a serious challenge.

For attack detection, we report results of using two supervised machine learning approaches: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) for classification of network traffic to normal and abnormal traffic, i.e, attack traffic.

The goal of this paper is to establish methodological best practices for the application of machine learning (ML) to Triage in pediatric ED, providing a comprehensive comparison of the performance of ML techniques over a large dataset. Our work is among the first attempts in this direction. Following very recent works in the literature, we use the clinical outcome of a case as its label for supervised ML model training, instead of the more uncertain labels provided by experts. The experimental dataset contains the records along 3 years of operation of the hospital ED. It consists of 189,718 patients visits to the hospital. The clinical outcome of 9,271 cases (4.98%) wa hospital admission, therefore our dataset is highly class imbalanced. Our reported performance comparison results focus on four ML models: Deep Learning (DL), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Data preprocessing includes class imbalance correction, and case re-labeling. We use different well known metrics to evaluate performance of ML models in three different experimental settings: (a) classification of each case into the standard five Triage urgency levels, (b) discrimination of high versus low case severity according to its clinical outcome, and (c) comparison of the number of patients assigned to each standard Triage urgency level against the Triage rule based expert system currently in use at the hospital. RF achieved greater AUC, accuracy, PPV and specificity than the other models in the dychotomic classification experiments. On the implementation side, our study shows that ML predictive models trained according to clinical outcomes, provide better Triage performance than the current rule based expert system in operation at the hospital.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2019.07.005", "venue": "Expert Syst.

The main idea of the proposed method is to avoid the error pooling step of many factors (in frequential and spatial domain) commonly applied to obtain a final quality score. A classification process based on the Support Vector Machine method is designed to obtain the final quality class with respect to the standard quality scale provided by the UIT. Thus, for each degraded color image, a feature vector is computed including several Human Visual System characteristics, such as, contrast masking effect, color correlation, and so on. In that way, a machine learning expert, providing a final class number is designed. Introduction When designing a quality metric (including or not Human Visual System features), the main weakness is the computation of the final score. Actually, to develop a quality metric, the usually applied scheme consists in performing 1) a color space transformation to obtain decorrelated color coordinates and 2) a decomposition of these new coordinates towards perceptual channels. An error is then estimated for each one of these channels. The final quality score is obtained by pooling these errors in both spatial and frequential domain. Nevertheless, the pooling stage is based on the use of the Minkowski error metric. Recent studies [1] have shown that this summation does not perform well even if it is the most widely used. One can obtained the same Minkowski value for two different distorted images while the visual quality drastically differs from one distorted image to the other. This can be explained by the fact that the implicit assumption of this metric is that all signal samples are independant. Yet, this is not the case when one uses perceptual channels. When applying an \u201cerror pooling\u201d of the obtained estimated errors within each perceptual channels, the Minkowski metric fails to generate a good final score. Actually, the final goal of each metric is to score by a single note the quality of an image. Then, to assess how the metric performs well, a correlation measure between the designed quality metric value and the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is computed. The MOS is obtained from a set of human observers scores with respect to a normalized scale defined by the UIT [2]. The higher degree, the more the metric proceeds as the human observer does. From the above remarks, one main constatation can be formulated: the need to obtain a final quality score is not necessary the best way to quantify the quality. Actually, in the recommendations given by the UIT [2], the human observers have to choose a quality class from a scale containing five notes (cf. Table 1). Those notes characterize the quality of the reconstructed images. In that way, the human observers make then neither more nor less one classification. In this paper, the quality measure is based on a learned classification process in order to respect the one of human observers. Instead of computing a final note, our method classifies the qualTable 1: Quality scale of the UIT-R.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "in Third Eur.

Therefore, microscopic inspection of tissue requires chemical staining to create contrast. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) is the most widely used chemical staining technique in histopathology. However, such staining creates obstacles for automated image analysis systems. Due to different chemical formulations, different scanners, section thickness, and lab protocols, similar tissues can greatly differ in appearance. This huge variability is one of the main challenges in designing robust and resilient automated image analysis systems. Moreover, staining process is time consuming and its chemical effects deform structures of specimens. In this work, we develop a method to virtually stain unstained specimens. Our method utilizes dimension reduction and conditional adversarial generative networks (cGANs) which build highly non-linear mappings between input and output images. Conditional GANs ability to handle very complex functions and high dimensional data enables transforming unstained hyperspectral tissue image to their H&E equivalent which comprises highly diversified appearance. In the long term, such virtual digital H&E staining could automate some of the tasks in the diagnostic pathology workflow which could be used to speed up the sample processing time, reduce costs, prevent adverse effects of chemical stains on tissue specimens, reduce observer variability, and increase objectivity in disease diagnosis.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCVW.2017.15", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)", "journal": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2771464104", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2931722", "38401802", "3088043", "7972589", "23871666", "17616833", "7421439", "10185969", "16875063", "36991455", "4812577", "120023354", "27350524", "6200260", "1033682", "2298645", "3719281", "18781152", "207761262"], "inbound_citations": ["58589358", "204512185", "199442274", "67855391", "43919703", "173991200", "1300420", "58004749", "52289143", "214199901", "52289182", "53056164", "202159238", "198905138", "195791662", "53115456", "164637600", "119102145", "210042280", "52305483", "59234295", "53230645", "211038794"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2785592"}

In spite of the non-convex nature of our model, we are able to perform a rigorous theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior. Our analysis reveals an interesting dichotomy: a GAN with an optimal discriminator provably converges, while first order approximations of the discriminator steps lead to unstable GAN dynamics and mode collapse.

Therefore, the classification of protein domain is becoming very importance in order to produce new sequence with new function. However the main issue in protein domain classification is to classify the domain correctly into their category since the sequence coincidently classify to both category. Therefore, to overcome this issue, this paper proposed a computational method to classify protein domain from protein subsequences and protein structure information using sigmoid kernel function. The proposed method consists of three phases: pre-processing, protein structure information generating and post-processing. The pre-processing phase selects potential protein. The protein structure information generating phase used several calculations to generate protein structure information in order to optimize the domain signal information. The classification phase involves Sigmoid SVM and performance evaluation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of sensitivity and specificity on single-domain and multiple-domain using dataset SCOP 1.75. This method showed an improvement of prediction in term of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Protein domains are considered as structural and functional units of protein where the protein domains are defined using multiple or combination of protein sequence criteria. The protein domain classification is important to understand the protein structure and function. Because of this, previous research works have proposed various structures of protein domain classification methods based on protein sequence, but the information from sequence is limited. The merging of protein domains classification in protein sequence is an evolutionary process, contributing to the great diversity of proteins that produces a lot of favourable energy. However, the classification of protein domain based on protein sequence only is more likely to introduce incorrectly folded regions and making the classification to single and multiple domain categories are difficult task. To analyze new protein with new function, accurate classification of protein domain is much needed to make scientist work easier since protein domain is important to analyze the different functions of protein sequences. The different functions of protein sequence enable us to probe the function of the protein, perform drug design and construct novel protein. However, various problems are found in protein domain classification throughout the years is coincidently classified to both categories either single or multiple domain. Currently there are several computational protein domain classification methods available such as method based on similarity and multiple sequence alignment, known protein structure, dimensional structure, used model based and protein sequence information. Methods based on similarity and use multiple sequence alignments to represent protein domain. A sequence database search provides information on pairwise similarities. Example works done in this category are SVM- Fold (1), EVEREST (2) and Biozon (3).

This system is called the Polymer Informatics Knowledge System (PIKS). Methods of storing polymer data electronically are examined.

Polymer markup language (PML) is the only data-format capable of storing this information. A novel extension to the PML language, allowing copolymers produced with a depletion of reactants is introduced. Without the extension only Markov-chains can be produced. An informatics analysis of Unilever data of cleaning efficacy of polymers is performed. A representative macromolecule was produced for each polymer sample. Descriptors were calculated over these and used for machine learning to predict the cleaning efficacy. From these models a monomer was identified which was very strongly correlated with good cleaning performance. The monomer in question cannot be revealed as it is a trade secret. Polymer data from the PoLyInfo database are extracted and converted into XML. A summary of the data available in the PoLyInfo Database is presented. The PIKS tools were used to automatically validate this data for internal consistency, as well as against another data source. The monomers and polymers were analysed for consistency, as well as CML reactions being produced for the polymerisation reactions in the database which were also checked for constancy. The error in the structures was found to be 5.8% for the monomers, 7.3% for the polymers and 2.9% for the reactions. Some of the causes of the discrepancies are presented.

The main contributions of our method lie in the following aspects. 1) Instead of using voxel intensity information alone, patch-based representation in the discriminative feature space with logistic sparse LASSO is used as anatomical signature to deal with low contrast problem in prostate CT images. 2) Based on the proposed patch-based signature, a new multi-atlases label fusion method formulated under sparse representation framework is designed to segment prostate in the new treatment images, with guidance from the previous segmented images of the same patient. This method estimates the prostate likelihood of each voxel in the new treatment image from its nearby candidate voxels in the previous segmented images, based on the nonlocal mean principle and sparsity constraint. 3) A hierarchical labeling strategy is further designed to perform label fusion, where voxels with high confidence are first labeled for providing useful context information in the same image for aiding the labeling of the remaining voxels. 4) An online update mechanism is finally adopted to progressively collect more patient-specific information from newly segmented treatment images of the same patient, for adaptive and more accurate segmentation. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on a prostate CT image database consisting of 24 patients where each patient has more than 10 treatment images, and further compared with several state-of-the-art prostate CT segmentation algorithms using various evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves higher segmentation accuracy than any other methods under comparison.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3845245", "pubmed_id": "23204280", "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2012.2230018", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1988626696", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10972294", "3135141", "13982095", "9626105", "2269279", "8777840", "17770303", "18846096", "14178347", "27557137", "9442803", "7236378", "34520151", "1318313", "17763741", "5609071", "7521004", "8337890", "24904155", "7592584", "54616712", "967430", "13210177", "20924986", "16894221", "6809168", "8735600", "14246679", "12220680", "5684727", "2356353", "206590483", "1344879", "12339860", "1664302", "7599191", "29691098", "118612072", "5884735", "62288331", "13949879", "6961580", "16201824", "14322900", "3025202", "19779362", "15555957", "7677466", "14111511", "1299500", "15850341", "330039", "3011166"], "inbound_citations": ["52291170", "73412855", "53106563", "3796738", "34909311", "85520825", "23396922", "209541047", "7111285", "4532000", "3644401", "4952230", "126304001", "5895359", "49885430", "609852", "206748223", "42864035", "17763387", "89618615", "26014961", "15847308", "204028372", "37403949", "5468283", "4566758", "19452106", "3570232", "3743288", "52099661", "13586761", "2683809", "6373134", "88496820", "22763326", "29029548", "9640753", "4897816", "2259054", "29378483", "21887742"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13920184"}

Prediction of 30-day readmission for diabetes patients is therefore of prime importance. The existing models are characterized by their limited prediction power, generalizability and pre-processing. For instance, the benchmarked LACE (Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Charlson comorbidity index and Emergency visits) index traded prediction performance against ease of use for the end user. As such, this study propose a comprehensive pre-processing framework in order to improve the model\u2019s performance while exploring and selecting a prominent feature for 30-day unplanned readmission among diabetes patients. In order to deal with readmission prediction, this study will also propose a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model on data collected from 130 US hospitals.

Random Forest algorithm for feature selection and SMOTE algorithm for data balancing are some example of methods used in the proposed pre-processing framework.

It is an important problem in computational and structural biology. Experimental measurement of binding affinity in the wet-lab is expensive and time consuming. Therefore, machine learning approaches are widely used to predict protein interactions and binding affinities by learning from specific properties of existing complexes. In this work, we propose an innovative computational model to predict binding affinities and interaction based on sequence, structural and interface features of the interacting proteins that are robust to binding associated conformational changes. We modeled the prediction of binding affinity as classification and regression problem with least-squared and support vector regression models using structure and sequence features of proteins. Specifically, we have used the number and composition of interacting residues at protein complexes interface as features and sequence features. We evaluated the performance of our prediction models using Affinity Benchmark Dataset version 2.0 which contains a diverse set of both bound and unbound protein complex structures with known binding affinities. We evaluated our regression performance results with root mean square error (RMSE) as well as Spearman and Pearson's correlation coefficients using a leave-one-out cross-validation protocol. We evaluate classification results with AUC-ROC and AUC-PR Our results show that Support Vector Regression performs significantly better than other models with a Spearman Correlation coefficient of 0.58, Pearson Correlation score of 0.55 and RMSE of 2.41 using 3-mer and sequence feature. It is interesting to note that simple features based on 3-mer features and the properties of the interface of a protein complex are predictive of its binding affinity.

Skilled operators usually refer to changing trends of GUR to guide the next step of production. For these reasons, this paper establishes a soft sensing scheme based on an improved extreme learning machine (ELM) to predict GUR. In order to enhance the modeling capability of ELM for industrial data, an improved ELM, named GR-ELM, is proposed based on grey relational analysis (GRA) and residual modification mechanism. In GR-ELM, considering the different effective information contained in each input attribute for modeling, the input attribute optimization is proposed combining with GRA and entropy weight method. Then, because the modeling capability of ELM is limited and the data collected from industrial process are usually contaminated, the residual modification mechanism is implemented to improve the reliability of the model. In addition, considering the influence of time delay in BF ironmaking process, generalized correlation coefficient method based on mutual information is used for time delay analysis to eliminate the influence. The real data collected from a BF are applied and validated the performance and effectiveness of the proposed soft sensing scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed soft sensing scheme is available and can achieve better performance than some state-of-the-art algorithms.

A variety of investment assets around the world make this multi-faceted decision problem very complicated. Econometric and statistical models as well as machine learning and data mining techniques have been used by many researchers and analysts to propose heuristic solutions for portfolio optimization. However, a literature review shows that the existing models are still not practical as they do not always perform better than even the naive strategy of investing in all available assets in the market. The methodology proposed in this thesis is an alternative heuristic solution to help investors make stock investment decisions through a semi-automated process. The proposed solution is based on the fact that the investment decision cannot be fully automated because investors\u2019 preferences that are the key factors in making investment decision, vary among different people. For this purpose, a semi-automated framework called SMPOpt (Stock Market Portfolio Optimizer) has been designed and implemented. In the proposed framework, the goal is to learn from the historical fundamental analysis of companies to discover the optimum portfolio by considering investors\u2019 preferences. The Portfolio optimization problem is formulated and broken down into steps to be able to apply data mining techniques such as Clustering and Ranking, and Social Network Analysis.

The experiment results show that Mean Absolute Percentage Error is controlled below 10% through this method, and the prediction accuracy is improved compared with the value of support vector machines regression with the single-factor.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICNC.2009.725", "venue": "2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation", "journal": "2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2146373464", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "58698067", "866142", "18315563", "123976179", "124947959", "57701457", "7235454"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19234595"}

This paper proposes a decision support system that detects renal cell cancer using abdominal images of healthy and renal cell cancer tissues. Renal cell cancer detection involves two main stages as segmentation and cancer detection. In the first step, the kidney areas have been obtained by segmentation based on clustering analysis. In the second step, classification has been made by computer-assisted detection system to identify renal cell cancer. Feature vectors that support the originality of the study at this stage have been created. Subsequently, classification has been made using these feature vectors with the Support Vector Machines (SVMs). For detecting the renal abnormality, 130 different images obtained from the image archiving system of the Radiodiagnostic Department of Firat University Medical Faculty were used. Thirty of these images have been used to train the K-means classifier. Performance evaluations have been made for both segmentation and classification.

The probabilistic regional and boundary terms in the energy function are estimated from the training samples collected locally from the the human expert via interactive tool or a training database. In this paper, we present a simple acceleration technique that dramatically improves the speed without sacrificing the accuracy of the segmentation. In the context of slice-by-slice medical image segmentation, we accelerate the process by partially reusing the graph constructed from a previous segmented slice based on the likeness of two consecutive images. Experiment results in 5 liver cases show differences between the manually segmented volumes and our estimated volumes were less than 5%. The differences are within the normal variation of manual segmentation from inter- and intra-observers. Accelerated segmentations show no degradation in terms of accuracy compared to full segmentations.

However, most of the existing quality descriptors (e.g., luminance, contrast, and gradient) do not seem to be consistent with human perception, and the effects pooling is often done in ad-hoc ways. In this paper, we propose a novel full-reference IQA metric. It applies non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to measure image degradations by making use of the parts-based representation of NMF. On the other hand, a new machine learning technique [extreme learning machine (ELM)] is employed to address the limitations of the existing pooling techniques.

Automatic classification of EEG signals is gradually becoming the research focus, which contains two procedures: feature extraction and classification.

In order to eliminate irrelevant and redundant features, feature selection based on class separability is employed to select the optimal feature subset. In the phase of classification, this paper presents a novel ensemble extreme learning machine based on linear discriminant analysis. Linear discriminant analysis is used to transform training subsets that are generated by bootstrap method, through which we can increase the differences of basic classifiers and reduce generalization errors of ensemble extreme learning machine. Experiments on two different EEG datasets are conducted in this study. Class separability is investigated to verify the effectiveness of feature extraction methods.

Its popularity has been increasing, but relatively few studies address the parameter selection process: a critical step in model fitting. Due to numerous assertions regarding the performance reliability of the default parameters, many RF models are fit using these values. However there has not yet been a thorough examination of the parameter-sensitivity of RFs in computational genomic studies. We address this gap here.ResultsWe examined the effects of parameter selection on classification performance using the RF machine learning algorithm on two biological datasets with distinct p/n ratios: sequencing summary statistics (low p/n) and microarray-derived data (high p/n). Here, p, refers to the number of variables and, n, the number of samples. Our findings demonstrate that parameterization is highly correlated with prediction accuracy and variable importance measures (VIMs). Further, we demonstrate that different parameters are critical in tuning different datasets, and that parameter-optimization significantly enhances upon the default parameters.ConclusionsParameter performance demonstrated wide variability on both low and high p/n data.

Ideally, forest managers can source this information from climate analogs within their jurisdictions, but the emergence of unfamiliar climates is a distinct possibility with particular challenges. Here, we present an assessment of the emergence of mid-21st-century climates with no analog in the 20th-century climates of British Columbia (BC), and the extent to which these novel climates are described by climate analogs elsewhere in North America. We use a recently developed linear method of novel climate detection in parallel with Random Forest classification to evaluate the robustness of novel climate inferences. Our results suggest that a majority of the province\u2019s area will remain free of novel climates over this time period, and therefore that BC\u2019s ecological knowledge system, the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification, can remain the dominant source of climate analogs for mid-21st-century forest management planning horizons. Nevertheless, we detected a robust pattern of climates that are novel to BC in mid-21st-century climate projections at low elevations in the coastal, southern interior, and northeastern regions of the province. There appears to be potential to inform forest management in some of these novel climates with analogs from adjacent states and provinces. We demonstrate that extrapolations into novel climates typically understate the magnitude of climate change and modeling uncertainty, creating a false impression of robust predictions in locations where model performance is poorest. By identifying portions of their landscapes that are prone to emergence of novel climates, forest managers can avoid management errors and prioritize the search for analogs beyond the boundaries of their knowledge systems.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.foreco.2017.12.036", "venue": null, "journal": "Forest Ecology and Management", "mag_id": "2776565796", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199564905", "207888361"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:90026202"}

In order to study FDI and condition monitoring, accurate model of GT is needed. In this paper, the nonlinear Rowen's model is developed in Matlab/Simulink software to simulate the GT system behavior. Then, regarding the gain of artificial intelligence systems in FDI, the neurofuzzy inference system with capability of reliable learning and data approximating, is employed in developing the proposed FDI algorithm. In this paper, three types of faults have been considered, fault in the fuel flow rate, fault in the performance of turbine which affects the turbine exit gas temperature, and fault in the turbine which affects the turbine output torque. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the method in detecting and isolating the specified faults.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have brought significant advances in image segmentation.

Thus, it is challenging for these methods to cope with the growing amount of medical images. This paper proposes a unified approach to unsupervised deep representation learning and clustering for segmentation. Our proposed method consists of two phases. In the first phase, we learn deep feature representations of training patches from a target image using joint unsupervised learning (JULE) that alternately clusters representations generated by a CNN and updates the CNN parameters using cluster labels as supervisory signals. We extend JULE to 3D medical images by utilizing 3D convolutions throughout the CNN architecture. In the second phase, we apply k-means to the deep representations from the trained CNN and then project cluster labels to the target image in order to obtain the fully segmented image. We evaluated our methods on three images of lung cancer specimens scanned with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The automatic segmentation of pathological regions in micro-CT could further contribute to the pathological examination process. Hence, we aim to automatically divide each image into the regions of invasive carcinoma, noninvasive carcinoma, and normal tissue.

For the training SVM 1158 daily AT, SR, Wind Speed (U) and Relative Humidity (RH) meteorological parameters are used and model is tested using 385 daily parameters. Data set is taken from St. Johns, Florida, USA weather station. To understand the abilities of SVM for ET prediction against Hargreaves-Samani formula, the test set is applied to this empirical equation. Determination coefficient of SVM with observed daily ET values is calculated as 0.913 and determination coefficient of Hargreaves-Samani formula with observed daily ET is found as 0.910.

There are various systems to capture these brain activities called \u201cbrain rhythms.\u201d Out of all, the electroencephalography (EEG) is the most used signal recording method due to its fine spatial and temporal resolution, cost effectiveness, and portability.

Besides the good performances of such models, key results of previous studies highlight how classifiers tend to perform similarly even though they are able to correctly predict the change-proneness of different code elements, possibly indicating the presence of some complementarity among them. In this paper, we aim at analyzing the extent to which ensemble methodologies, i.e., machine learning techniques able to combine multiple classifiers, can improve the performances of change-prediction models. Specifically, we empirically compared the performances of three ensemble techniques (i.e., Boosting, Random Forest, and Bagging) with those of standard machine learning classifiers (i.e., Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes).

Machine learning, non-parametric Random Forests for Survival was used to explore risk-adjusted thrombosis based on 87 pre-implant and implant variables, including implant date. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: A total of 995 pumps thrombosed, with risk peaking within weeks of implant. The risk-adjusted increase in pump thrombosis began in 2010, reached a maximum in 2012, and then plateaued at a level that was 3.3-times higher than pre-2010. Pump exchange, younger age, and larger body mass index were important predictors, and institutional variability was largely explained by implant date, patient profile, and duration of support.

At landscape level the best correlations between soil spectra and OM (0.90 \u2264 R2 \u2264 0.93; 0.12 \u2264 RMSEP\u22640.14) were obtained with LWR, followed by K2O with LWR (0.77 \u2264 R2 \u2264 0.79; 3.47 \u2264 RMSEP\u22643.62), Olsen P (0.69 \u2264 R2 \u2264 0.81; 0.27 \u2264 RMSEP\u22640.35) and Oniani P (0.64 \u2264 R2 \u2264 0.65; 3.31 \u2264 RMSEP\u22643.61) both with SVM. Also, the nonlinear regression models gave the best results within a field. The higher values for OM (R2 = 0.92; RMSEP = 0.14) and Olsen P (0.68 \u2264 R2 \u2264 0.83; 0.27 \u2264 RMSEP\u22640.34) were observed with SVM, while for K2O (0.16 \u2264 R2 \u2264 0.63; 5.13 \u2264 RMSEP\u22645.88), and Oniani P (0.70 \u2264 R2 \u2264 0.72; 2.32 \u2264 RMSEP\u22642.52) were obtained with LWR.

Different functional and multivariate statistical supervised classification methods are used for this task: a nonparametric Nadaraya\u2013Watson kernel functional estimator (K-NFDA), using the complete TG curves, and multivariate supervised classification approaches, such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k Nearest Neighbors ( k -NN), Naive Bayes (NBC), Neural Networks (NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Before applying the multivariate techniques, the TG curves are discretized using principal component analysis (PCA) or fitting a four-component generalized logistic model. The results show that the classical method of LDA using the logistic parameters had the best performance, although high correct classification percentages were also obtained with the rest of the approaches. The work is completed with a comprehensive simulation study, comparing the classification techniques in different scenarios.

Plaut (plaut@cmu.edu) Department of Psychology and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA Abstract principles which can, by virtue of the domain-general nature of the framework, have wide-spread implications for domains well beyond response selection (e.g., semantic cognition). Past work by Ratcliff, Van Zandt, and McKoon (1999) pro- vides some initial insight into the performance of connec- tionist models of 2AFC tasks relative to that of the diffu- sion model in simulating performance in a numerosity judg- ment task. In this task, participants were presented with a 10\u00d710 array which was filled with a number of asterisks sam- pled from two overlapping distributions with \u2018low\u2019 and \u2018high\u2019 mean numbers of asterisks, and made responses indicating which distribution they believed had been sampled from to generate the stimulus. The model comparisons revealed that the connectionist models failed to capture important aspects of the behavioral data (e.g., latency-accuracy functions, trial- by-trial adaptive effects). To address some of these limitations, Usher and McClel- land (2001) introduced a revised connectionist formalism in the leaky, competing accumulator model. Changes in this model included explicit constraints on the sign of the weights between competing units and from the underlying source of evidence that drives the response units, and the use of a threshold-linear activation function that is not differentiable at all points in time. A critical implication of the latter change is that it violates the mathematical principles that underlie standard gradient descent learning algorithms such as back- propagation (Hinton, 1989). Collectively, these changes ren- dered the accumulator functionally analogous to the diffusion model, and generally showed identical or superior fits to that model. This notwithstanding, a fundamental issue with this type of domain-specific connectionist model is what strengths of the standard connectionist framework were given up dur- ing model development. In particular, the disconnect between these models and standard connectionist learning algorithms prevents these models from being effortlessly extended to other response selection tasks\u2014let alone cognitive process- ing and learning in other domains. An alternative approach to developing improved connec- tionist models of response selection is to focus, instead, on improving the domain-general assumptions of the frame- work. One way to do this that is independent of the partic- ular constraints needed to simulate response selection is to more accurately instantiate the known connectivity and pro- cessing characteristics of the brain. For instance, neurons Ratcliff, Van Zandt, and McKoon (1999, Psych. Rev.) claim that connectionist models fail to simulate many aspects of how individuals select one of two possible responses. Here, these claims are re-evaluated via computational and behavioral in- vestigations of an extended version of the original numeros- ity judgment task. The results of the experiment indicate that some of the empirical effects that the models failed to cap- ture do not generalize and were likely due to idiosyncratic as- pects of the original methodology. The simulations show that a more biologically-plausible model captures the bulk of the new effects, including some trial-by-trial adaptive effects that are outside the scope of models tested against aggregate data, and emergent asymptotic stability that has previously required an explicit leak parameter. Keywords: response selection, decision making, connection- ism, numerosity judgment, overall and trial-by-trial effects Understanding how one of multiple candidate responses is selected in a given task is a long-standing and critical issue in cognitive science, and is one of the earliest domains to have been investigated with computational models. To date, much of the work has focused on the sub-issue of how individu- als perform in tasks in which they must rapidly select one of two possible responses (i.e., speeded two-alternative forced- choice tasks; 2AFC tasks). This has led to the development of several models that can be fit to data from 2AFC tasks with a high degree of precision (e.g., the diffusion model; Ratcliff, 1978). One of several key limitations of these models, how- ever, is that they are highly domain-specific and are not nat- urally extendable to studying other intuitively related issues, such as \u2018closed-set\u2019 response selection tasks involving three or more pre-specified candidate responses, or \u2018open-set\u2019 re- sponse selection tasks which require the production of novel responses such as nonword naming. These models are also often fit to aggregated data and do not explain how the deci- sion system adapts over time based on its past experiences. One possible avenue for addressing these limitations is the development of a connectionist model of response selection, given the connectionist framework\u2019s grounding in domain- general learning, representation, and processing principles that are drawn from systems and cellular neuroscience. Not only might such a model be able to explain the overall and adaptive effects in 2AFC tasks, it should also be readily ex- tendable to the other response tasks described previously. Moreover, insofar as connectionist models fail in these en- deavors, this can serve to guide the development of improved", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CogSci", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2404081354", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9299097", "7840452", "16135872", "6277458", "1166147", "9041959", "15778703"], "inbound_citations": ["18969889", "12361865", "12638645"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12029450"}

Our intention is to identify important proteins that may be predisposed to be potential candidates as drug targets for therapeutic interventions. Target proteins usually have more interaction partners than non-target proteins, but there are no hard-and-fast rules for defining the actual number of interactions. We devise a statistical measure for identifying hub proteins, we score our target proteins with gene ontology annotations. The important druggable protein targets are likely to have similar biological functions that can be assessed for their potential therapeutic value. Our system provides a statistical analysis of the local and distant neighborhood protein interactions of the potential targets using complex network measures. This approach builds a more accurate model of drug-to-target activity and therefore the likely impact on treating diseases. We integrate high quality protein interaction data from the HINT database and disease associated proteins from the DrugTarget database. Other sources include biological knowledge from Gene Ontology and drug information from DrugBank. The problem is a very challenging one since the data is highly imbalanced between target proteins and the more numerous nontargets.

An example of such a subspace is the chemical space spanned by endogenous metabolites, defined as 'naturally occurring' products of an organisms' metabolism. In order to understand this part of chemical space in more detail, we analyzed the chemical space populated by human metabolites in two ways. Firstly, in order to understand metabolite space better, we performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering and scaffold analysis of metabolites and non-metabolites in order to analyze which chemical features are characteristic for both classes of compounds. Here we found that heteroatom (both oxygen and nitrogen) content, as well as the presence of particular ring systems was able to distinguish both groups of compounds. Secondly, we established which molecular descriptors and classifiers are capable of distinguishing metabolites from non-metabolites, by assigning a 'metabolite-likeness' score. It was found that the combination of MDL Public Keys and Random Forest exhibited best overall classification performance with an AUC value of 99.13%, a specificity of 99.84% and a selectivity of 88.79%. This performance is slightly better than previous classifiers; and interestingly we found that drugs occupy two distinct areas of metabolite-likeness, the one being more 'synthetic' and the other being more 'metabolite-like'. Also, on a truly prospective dataset of 457 compounds, 95.84% correct classification was achieved. Overall, we are confident that we contributed to the tasks of classifying metabolites, as well as to understanding metabolite chemical space better.

The further researches noticed that relations and entities might be able to have different representation to be cast into real world relations. Thus it improved the embedding accuracy of embeddings.

Unlike traditional CNs, DLS uses the knowledge available in Gene Ontology (GO) to generate informative training sets that guide the discovery of expression signatures: expression patterns that are discriminative for genes involved in the biological process of interest. By linking genes co-expressed with these signatures, DLS is able to construct a discriminative CN that links both, known and previously uncharacterized genes, for the selected biological process. This article focuses on the algorithm behind DLS and shows its predictive power using an Arabidopsis thaliana dataset and a representative set of 101 GO terms from the Biological Process Ontology. Our results show that DLS has a superior average accuracy than both SVMs and CNs.

However, the existing methods for predicting linear B-cell epitopes are far from perfection. In this study, an attempt has been made to develop an improved method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes. We have retrieved experimentally validated B-cell epitopes as well as non B-cell epitopes from Immune Epitope Database and derived two types of datasets called Lbtope_Variable and Lbtope_Fixed length datasets. The Lbtope_Variable dataset contains 14876 B-cell epitope and 23321 non-epitopes of variable length where as Lbtope_Fixed length dataset contains 12063 B-cell epitopes and 20589 non-epitopes of fixed length. We also evaluated the performance of models on above datasets after removing highly identical peptides from the datasets. In addition, we have derived third dataset Lbtope_Confirm having 1042 epitopes and 1795 non-epitopes where each epitope or non-epitope has been experimentally validated in at least two studies. A number of models have been developed to discriminate epitopes and non-epitopes using different machine-learning techniques like Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor. We achieved accuracy from \u223c54% to 86% using diverse s features like binary profile, dipeptide composition, AAP (amino acid pair) profile.

We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed techniques using four case studies: 1) dc/dc converter ripple noise analysis; 2) phase-locked loop lock-time verification; 3) reliability analysis of a ring oscillator with respect to process variations and initial conditions; and 4) prediction of chip peak temperature using a limited number of on-chip temperature sensors.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCAD.2015.2413840", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1970407113", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206787478", "28637672", "15058645", "9595871", "14511890", "1040964", "5539574", "8426686", "5903095", "15419100", "207319017", "16567278", "8326832", "20748621", "14664067", "16818283", "1438164", "12590342", "15560058", "15140283", "16691169", "1247234", "5543127", "8473633", "1323789", "10953312", "17999128", "18338608"], "inbound_citations": ["25675997", "16111605", "10726235"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12005456"}

The product of this work will be a cognitively plausible computational learning model which integrates instructed learning with inductive generalization from examples. The success of this model will require the attainment of both a technical and a scientific goal. The technical goal is the design of a computational mechanism in which induction and instruction are smoothly integrated. The design of such a multistrategy learner might be implemented within a symbolic rule-based framework (Huffman, Miller, & Laird 1993), within a framework strong in inductive generalization, such as connectionism (Noelle & Cottrell 1995), or within a hybrid architecture (Maclin & Shavlik 1994). This work pursues the second of these three general approaches. Following an intuition concerning the primacy of induction (which precedes linguistic rule following both phylogenetically and ontogenetically) and with an eye on future reduction to neurological explanations, the model proposed here is built within a wholly connection& framework.

We benchmark this dataset before and after SMOTE oversampling to observe the effect on minority performance.

It is very often the case that some roll-outs result in failure behaviors, causing premature experiment detention. In such cases, the designer is forced to decide on heuristic cost penalties because the acquired data is often scarce, or not comparable with that of the stable policies. To overcome this, we propose a Bayesian model that captures exactly what we know about the cost of unstable controllers prior to data collection: Nothing, except that it should be a somewhat large number. The resulting Bayesian model, approximated with a Gaussian process, predicts high cost values in regions where failures are likely to occur. In this way, the model guides the BO exploration toward regions of stability. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model in several illustrative and statistical synthetic benchmarks, and also in experiments on a real robotic platform.

Recently, convolutional neural networks demonstrate promising progress in the joint OD and OC segmentation.

In this paper, we present a novel patch-based output space adversarial learning framework ( ${p}$ OSAL) to jointly and robustly segment the OD and OC from different fundus image datasets. We first devise a lightweight and efficient segmentation network as a backbone. Considering the specific morphology of OD and OC, a novel morphology-aware segmentation loss is proposed to guide the network to generate accurate and smooth segmentation. Our ${p}$ OSAL framework then exploits unsupervised domain adaptation to address the domain shift challenge by encouraging the segmentation in the target domain to be similar to the source ones. Since the whole-segmentation-based adversarial loss is insufficient to drive the network to capture segmentation details, we further design the ${p}$ OSAL in a patch-based fashion to enable fine-grained discrimination on local segmentation details. We extensively evaluate our ${p}$ OSAL framework and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the segmentation performance on three public retinal fundus image datasets, i.e., Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE.

Given all instances, labeled and unlabeled, from all domains, we build a large similarity graph between them, where an edge exists between two instances if they are close according to some metric. Instead of using predefined metric, as commonly performed, we feed the labeled instances into metric-learning algorithms and (re)construct a data-dependent metric, which is used to construct the graph. We employ different types of edges depending on the domain-identity of the two vertices touching it, and learn the weights of each edge.

The analysis highlights that prediction accuracy of MARS models for minimum temperature forecast are promising for short term forecast (lead days 1 to 3) with mean absolute error (MAE) less than 1 \u00b0C and the prediction efficiency and skill degrades in medium term forecast (lead days 4 to 7) with slightly above 1 \u00b0C.

We globalize the query-oriented algorithm GVE by specifying a minimal query set and allowing observed variables as \"bucket\" variables. In any network, the set of all leaf nodes is the minimal query set. The proposed algorithm builds a bucket tree of data structure buckets and then updates the bucket tree to produce the marginal probability density for every variable in the network. This algorithm relies solely on independence relations and probability manipulation, without requiring any complex graph theory, thus making it easy to understand and implement. ::: The second part (Chapter 4) of this dissertation investigates the performance of Bayesian networks in classification and compares its performance with Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods and the Classification tree method, QUEST. When the relationship between variables is known, the Bayesian network method usually works better than SVM methods, especially in high dimensional problems. The advantage of the Bayesian network method also lies in its ability in handling missing values inside both the training and the test set. When the training set is not very large, discarding records with missing values will affect the performance of classification. Bayesian network methods utilize records with missing values and can provide classification comparable to non-missing training set with the same size. Also Bayesian networks can classify records with missing values, whereas SVM does not have this nice property. The Bayesian network method is better than QUEST when missing values present in test set. ::: The computational parts of this dissertation use Kevin Murphy's Bayes Net Toolbox for Matlab, SVM and Kernel Methods Matlab Toolbox from Insa de Rouen, QUEST Classification Tree (version 1.9.2) by Wei-Yin Loh and Yu-Shan Shih.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2552477883", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63321719"}

However, the variability of the weather phenomena is an unavoidable obstacle in the prediction of the energy produced by the solar radiation conversion. The use of the data collected in the past can be useful to capture the daily and seasonal variability, while measurement of the recent past can be exploited to provide a short term prediction. It is well known that a good measurement of the solar radiation requires not only a high class radiometer, but also a correct management of the instrument. In order to reduce the cost related to the management of the monitoring apparatus, a solution could be to evaluate the PV plant performance using data collected by public weather station installed near the plant. In this paper, two experiments are conducted. In the first, the plausibility of the short term prediction of the solar radiation, based on data collected in the near past on the same site is investigated. In the second experiment, the same prediction is operated using data collected by a public weather station located at ten kilometers from the solar plant. Several prediction techniques belonging from both computational intelligence and statistical fields have been challenged in this task. In particular, Support Vector Machine for Regression, Extreme Learning Machine and Autoregressive models have been used and compared with the persistence and the k -NN predictors.

In addition, we derived a single-objective convex problem and showed that a Pareto optimal solution for the proposed multiobjective SVM is obtained by solving single-objective problems.

Therefore, in this paper we extend the hard-margin SVM for the data by using penalty functions for the margin slack variables between outliers and the corresponding discriminant hyperplane.

The authors first discuss the relationship between SVM and kernel Fisher analysis. Based on the intrinsic nullspace property of the SVM proven by the authors, which shows that the normal vector of the SVM decision plane is of the nullspace property in terms of the support vectors-based within-class scatter matrix, a support vectors-based method is presented to construct the Kernelized Decision Boundary Feature Matrix (KDBFM) by using the SVM normal vectors. Furthermore the difference vector of the mean support vectors is combined to construct the Extended Kernelized Decision Boundary Feature Matrix (Ex-KDBFM). Finally, the nullspace Kernel Fisher method is exploited to seek the projection space, which is used to extract the discriminant features from the original face images. In addition, the proposed discriminant method includes two steps, and the tedious sigularity problem can be avoided.

It may happen that none of the labels of the nodes is known and additionally there is no information about number of classes to which nodes can be assigned. In such a case a subset of nodes has to be selected for initial label acquisition. The question that arises is:\"labels of which nodes should be collected and used for learning in order to provide the best classification accuracy for the whole network?\". Active learning and inference is a practical framework to study this problem. A set of methods for active learning and inference for within network classification is proposed and validated. The utility score calculation for each node based on network structure is the first step in the process. The scores enable to rank the nodes. Based on the ranking, a set of nodes, for which the labels are acquired, is selected (e.g. by taking top or bottom N from the ranking). The new measure-neighbour methods proposed in the paper suggest not obtaining labels of nodes from the ranking but rather acquiring labels of their neighbours. The paper examines 29 distinct formulations of utility score and selection methods reporting their impact on the results of two collective classification algorithms: Iterative Classification Algorithm and Loopy Belief Propagation. We advocate that the accuracy of presented methods depends on the structural properties of the examined network.

Therefore, Quality of Experience (QoE), which is the measure of the user-perceived quality of a received service, has become a pivotal topic in the academic research. Generally, an efficient QoE model should be able to handle dynamic environments with large scale data, in order to continuously acquire feedback from the user, and then provide a real-time and accurate description of his perception. This paper proposes a novel online QoE estimation model, which is able to classify user perception toward video streaming service, using incremental multiclass SVM (multiclass-iSVM). The proposed online QoE model investigates the effectiveness of incremental learning, in order to handle large scale dynamic data and to improve prediction accuracy of QoE. In fact, it uses the mathematical properties of SVM and updates its unknown weights, as well as, the classification results incrementally, as new observations are considered. Comparative evaluation of the proposed multiclass iSVM-based QoE model is performed to show its superiority over relevant batch learning based models, in terms of QoE prediction accuracy and computational complexity.

The need to boost the methods concerning the interoperability is growing as well; therefore, trustworthy interactions of the different systems are a priority. Trust as a computer science concept has been studied in the recent years. Nevertheless, in the literature, very little focus is placed on how to assess the correctness of the interactions between the entities; even if most approaches rely on the estimation of trust based on the accumulated measures of these values. To broadly determine the correctness of interactions without targeting a specific domain or application, an approach using Distributed On-line Network Monitoring (DONM) was proposed. Furthermore, a prototype tool-set was developed to automatically test the trust properties. DONM is a form passive testing; it analyzes systems' responses and test the correctness of the interactions via network traces. Since it relies on the stated properties to test, a novel approach was proposed to automatically extract relevant properties to test. Our approach deeply relies on the operation of On-line Monitoring Systems. That is the reason why we propose new methods to enhance the state of the art techniques to: a) efficiently evaluate properties in O(n) time complexity using an Extended Finite State Automata (EFSA) auxiliary data structure; and b) to expand the language expressiveness to properly express the constraints of such systems, such as, timeouts in order to avoid resource starvation. Finally, using the evaluation of the entities' interactions provided by our approach, trust management engines will help trustors to decide with whom and how to interact with other users or applications. We propose a new framework that is flexible for any domain, allowing trustors to define the trust features used to evaluate trustees in different contexts. Furthermore, with the evaluations of the trust features, we propose a trust model which achieves close-to-human inference of the trust assessment, by using a machine learning based trust model, namely solving a multi-class classification problem using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Using the SVM-based trust model, experiments were performed with simulated trust features to estimate trust level; an accuracy of more than 96% was achieved", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2468856074", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["29867461"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38252730"}

Options for interventions aimed at improving the energy situation for households include the dissemination of improved cook stoves (ICSs), increase of households possibilities to switch to more modern fuels, for example through subsidies for LPG, as well as increase of the rate of electrification. However, few stove programs have been successful and the rate of fuel switching in rural areas remains low. ::: The aim of this thesis is to add to the existing literature of rural household\u2019s fuel usage and furthermore to examine implications of fuel use variations on an ICS program. This is done through two papers concerned with current fuel use and one paper which present a modeling of stove interventions in six different villages. ::: Methods used to model current fuel usage are regression and a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest. Furthermore, a simplistic household model is developed and used for examining variations in effects from a possible future ICS dissemination in different areas. Both primary data from a survey carried out in the V\u0129nh Phuc province of northern Vietnam and as well as secondary data from another survey in Vietnam are used. ::: Results of the regressions include that current fuel usage can to a high degree be modeled by the distance to town or household density together with the household income. The outcome of the Random Forest method confirms these results but also emphasizes a high dependence on a stable household economy over a longer period of time in order for fuel switching to occur. Results from the modeling of stove interventions revealed large differences between the respective villages and possible non-linear relationship between stove efficiency and benefits. ::: The possibility of modeling household usage by household density or distances to urban centers, casts doubt on a casual interpretation of, in the literature, previously described relations between various development factors and fuel switching, but also towards a possibility of predicting policy effects in different regions without detailed household surveys. Combining these results with a further development of the household modeling and field measurements may also provide possibilities to predict the effects of ICSs dissemination programs.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2807084542", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:169433793"}

The feature selection and classification of cancer using microarray gene expression data is a computationally difficult task. Even now, the computation of gene selection and classification is a challenging area to provide an exact biological related gene that causes cancer. In this work, three methods have been proposed. One is the Fish Swarm Optimization algorithm along with both Support Vector Machine and Random Forest technique for cancer feature selection and classification. But the above methods have reduced very few features from the datasets. Thus, they are considered as an existing method for this work. Now, the second proposed method namely an enhanced Krill Herd Optimization (KHO) technique was employed for selecting the genes and Random Forest (RF) Technique was employed to classify the cancer types. The Random Forest classification has been used because of its accurate classification accuracy. First, the subset of features is selected using KHO and the Random Forest classification is applied to the selected features. Ten different gene microarray cancer datasets were used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed.

The idea is to improve the operations of vehicles without losing the output power such that the engine speed and torque work with the minimum fuel consumption rate. It relies on the complete map of engine speed and torque to fuel consumption rate, known as the engine universal characteristic map. Unfortunately, such a map is often incomplete (fuel consumption rate not observed under most engine speed and torque combinations) and inconsistent (different fuel consumption rates observed under the same engine speed and torque combination). In this paper, we propose to predict the fine-grained fuel consumption rate of each engine speed and torque combination, by learning a model from the incomplete and inconsistent observation data. A novel FuelNet is designed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Deconvolution is employed to predict the incomplete fuel consumption rates, while the discriminator can successfully tolerate the inconsistent fuel consumption rate observations. Experiments show that our FuelNet outperforms the existing approaches in both imputing the incomplete and repairing the inconsistent fuel consumption rates.

Such applications have led to breakthroughs in the domain of interest and have driven the development of ILP systems. The application of AI techniques to mathematical discovery tasks, however, has largely involved computer algebra systems and theorem provers rather than machine learning systems. We discuss here the application of the HR and Progol machine learning programs to discovery tasks in mathematics. While Progol is an established ILP system, HR has historically not been described as an ILP system. However, many applications of HR have required the production of first order hypotheses given data expressed in a Prolog-style manner, and the core functionality of HR can be expressed in ILP terminology. In Colton (2003), we presented the first partial description of HR as an ILP system, and we build on this work to provide a full description here. HR performs a novel ILP routine called Automated Theory Formation, which combines inductive and deductive reasoning to form clausal theories consisting of classification rules and association rules. HR generates definitions using a set of production rules, interprets the definitions as classification rules, then uses the success sets of the definitions to induce hypotheses from which it extracts association rules. It uses third party theorem provers and model generators to check whether the association rules are entailed by a set of user supplied axioms.HR has been applied successfully to a number of predictive, descriptive and subgroup discovery tasks in domains of pure mathematics. We survey various applications of HR which have led to it producing number theory results worthy of journal publication, graph theory results rivalling those of the highly successful Graffiti program and algebraic results leading to novel classification theorems. To further promote mathematics as a challenge domain for ILP systems, we present the first application of Progol to an algebraic domain\u2014we use Progol to find algebraic properties of quasigroups, semigroups and magmas (groupoids) of varying sizes which differentiate pairs of non-isomorphic objects. This development is particularly interesting because algebraic domains have been an important proving ground for both deduction systems and constraint solvers. We believe that AI programs written for discovery tasks will need to simultaneously employ a variety of reasoning techniques such as induction, abduction, deduction, calculation and invention. We argue that mathematics is not only a challenging domain for the application of ILP systems, but that mathematics could be a good domain in which to develop a new generation of systems which integrate various reasoning techniques.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10994-006-8259-x", "venue": "Machine Learning", "journal": "Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2111038026", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60826522", "60446979", "17886212", "118570485", "878992", "115465700", "118130982", "32585967", "34137122", "12061015", "5528784", "32954866", "2388982", "43140682", "59848711", "616627", "125978729", "16054072", "10953323", "13228951", "43678180", "122507144", "16417306", "12643399", "5262555", "62236484", "60306958"], "inbound_citations": ["312923", "11639840", "49526569", "799489", "16839910", "16496909", "52082835", "5976108", "6364155", "17896300", "24554543", "14596006", "8410720", "538636", "14922439", "19166311", "18451737", "49528625", "12028810", "2876679", "9443911", "1975763"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7437627"}

Many studies aim to investigate these disturbances by analyzing the behavior of the electrical signal through the classification of short circuit faults in power transmission lines as a way to assist the administration and maintenance of the electrical system. However, most fault classification methods generate a high computational cost that do not always yield satisfactory results; these methods utilize front ends in data processing before being processed by conventional classification algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) that are adopted into the Frame Based Sequence Classification (FBSC) architecture that uses the front ends Wavelet energy, Waveletconcat, RAW, Root Mean Square front ends (RMS) and Con cat Front End. An alternative method for classifying faults without having to use front ends employs the UFPAFaults database and the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm that directly treats the electrical signal in the form of multivariate time series. The results indicate the HMM algorithm as a potential classifier because its comparatively low error rate of 0.03% exceeds the performance of the conventional classifiers ANN, SVM, KNN and RF as used with the FBSC architecture. When the statistical test with a significance of \u03b1 =5 % is applied, only the ANN and RF classifiers present a result close to what the HMM algorithm provides. Another relevant factor is that the HMM algorithm considerably decreases the computational cost by more than 90% of processing time as compared to the conventional classifiers of the FBSC architecture, thereby validating its potential in the direct classification of faults in electric power system transmission lines.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2934938", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2969166952", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["106968862", "63112522", "11567103", "8165252", "15190695", "3785514", "114008203", "608240", "59503134", "113781616", "109115421", "20715825", "2684111", "21122919", "26512802", "13618539", "29426210", "29426210", "8808218", "15160669", "110732358", "12822010", "120064925"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201657599"}

Instead of handcrafting a set of features for classification, we scale each candidate as a 10-by-10 image patch and use its raw RGB pixel values as the input of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The classifiers are trained only using a Singapore dataset, and are tested on the US LISA dataset. The cross validation justifies the generalizability of our classifiers. The evaluation results show that our hybrid candidate extraction method lowers the chance of miss-detection and the proposed featureless classification approach has a high recognition precision.

We compared the accuracy of 5 different ML models with traditional Cox and Logistic Regression, and report the most important variables in the best performing models.

The key to extract strong features that characterize the complex nature of voice signals is to identify their discriminatory subspaces. Diagnosis of pathological voice is one of the most important issues in biomedical applications of speech technology. There are some approaches for separating pathological from normal voice signals but a few ones are sophisticated to separate two or more kinds of speech pathologies from each other. This paper introduces an algorithm to discriminate voice pathologies signals from each other via adaptive growth of Wavelet Packet tree, based on the criterion of local discriminant bases (LDB). Two dissimilarity measures were used in the process of selecting the LDB nodes and extracting features from them. Moreover, Genetic Algorithm is employed for selecting the best feature set and Support Vector Machines as classifier to obtain as much as possible better results. To evaluate the proposed approach, we apply our algorithm to separate paralysis, paresis, and nodule from each other. Experimental results show the superior performance of this combinational approach against its incomplete versions (e.g. in the case of separating paresis and nodule, the proposed approach leads to 100% performance against 94.44% for where only complete wavelet packet features without applying LDB algorithm are used).", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/MED.2008.4602260", "venue": "2008 16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation", "journal": "2008 16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2145173566", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["37222666", "9026403", "62014074", "38443934", "17416385", "8069538"], "inbound_citations": ["54708430", "17471610", "9112751"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15102786"}

It aims at assigning a label to each image pixel and needs a significant number of pixel-level annotated data, which is often unavailable. To address this lack of annotations, in this paper, we leverage, on one hand, a massive amount of available unlabeled or weakly labeled data, and on the other hand, non-real images created through Generative Adversarial Networks. In particular, we propose a semi-supervised framework \u2013 based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) \u2013 which consists of a generator network to provide extra training examples to a multi-class classifier, acting as discriminator in the GAN framework, that assigns sample a label y from the K possible classes or marks it as a fake sample (extra class). The underlying idea is that adding large fake visual data forces real samples to be close in the feature space, which, in turn, improves multiclass pixel classification. To ensure a higher quality of generated images by GANs with consequently improved pixel classification, we extend the above framework by adding weakly annotated data, i.e., we provide class level information to the generator.

The delineation of Organs at Risk (OAR) in thoracic CT images is a necessary step before radiotherapy, for preventing irradiation of healthy organs. However, due to low contrast, multi-organ segmentation is a challenge. In this paper, we focus on developing a novel framework for automatic delineation of OARs. Different from previous works in OAR segmentation where each organ is segmented separately, we propose two collaborative deep architectures to jointly segment all organs, including esophagus, heart, aorta and trachea. Since most of the organ borders are ill-defined, we believe spatial relationships must be taken into account to overcome the lack of contrast. The aim of combining two networks is to learn anatomical constraints with the first network, which will be used in the second network, when each OAR is segmented in turn. Specifically, we use the first deep architecture, a deep SharpMask architecture, for providing an effective combination of low-level representations with deep high-level features, and then take into account the spatial relationships between organs by the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Next, the second deep architecture is employed to refine the segmentation of each organ by using the maps obtained on the first deep architecture to learn anatomical constraints for guiding and refining the segmentations.

Current trends in machine learning demands the capacity of dealing with large data sets while exploiting the capabilities of massively parallel architectures based on GPUs.

In this regard, our method proposed an integrated approach to identify the mRNA targets of dysregulated miRNAs using next-generation sequencing data from six cancer types. For this analysis, a sensible combination of data mining tools is chosen. In particular, Random Forest, log-transformed Fold change, and Pearson correlation coefficient are considered to find the potential miRNA-mRNA pairs. During this study, we have identified six cancer-specific overlapping sets of miRNAs whose classification accuracy is always higher than 91%. Furthermore, a promising correlation signature of significantly dysregulated miRNAs and mRNAs are recognized. A comprehensive analysis found that the cumulative percentage of negative correlation coefficients is higher than its positive counterpart. Moreover, experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions databases called miRTarBase is used to validate significantly correlated mRNAs. According to our study, the smallest set of significantly dysregulated miRNAs is 43 in PRAD data, while for mRNAs the smallest set is 238 in the LUAD cancer type. The obtained miRNA-mRNA pairs are subjected to do pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis. Regulatory roles of these dysregulated miRNAs with associated diseases are identified by constructing a regulatory network between miRNAs and associated diseases. Moreover, the relation between miRNAs expression level and patient survival is also analyzed.

In this work, a novel approach is proposed to classify defects in metallic plates in terms of their depth starting from a set of experimental measurements. The problem is solved by means of a system based on wavelets approach extracting information on the specimen under test from the measurements and, then, implementing Fuzzy Inference Systems in order to determine its depth. Shannon Fuzzy Entropy and Subsethood operators have been taken into account to improve the procedure. Finally, a comparison with Support Vector Machines is presented. 1. Introduction to the Problem NDT in the field of defects identification in metallic elements plays a remarkable role with special regard to those sectors where the integrity of the material is strictly required. The detection of defects in metallic plates together with the relevant shape classification provides the operator useful information on the actual mechanical integrity of the specimen (1). It should be considered that defects rarely look as well-known geometrical shapes. At the state-of-the-art, non-destructive identification systems allow to locate a defect but without being capable to determine its shape. In addition, different defects give rise to totally similar signals. This paper aims to deal with the classification of defects, both Inner (ID) (the probe lies on the same side of the plate where the defect is located) and Outer (OD) ones (probe and defect are on opposite sides of the plate), in terms of their depth introducing an approach based on Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs) obtaining banks of IF\u2026THEN fuzzy rules, in virtue of which the system under investigation behaves as a linguistic structure. A previously proposed pre-processing based on Wavelet Transforms (WTs) is exploited to extract features related to the local trend of the signal. In this way, a device capable to classify defects into two macro-classes have been carried out. In order to refine the procedure, Shannon Fuzzy Entropy (SFE) and Subsethood Operator (SO) which gives a membership measure of a value to an assigned class, have been taken into account. The conventional approaches to classification which assign a specific class for each defect are often inadequate because each defect may embrace more than a single class. Fuzzy set theory, which has been developed to deal with imprecise information, can provide a more appropriate solution to this problem.

Regions of interest (ROIs) were required to be specified for extracting features that characterize malignancy of lesions. Although analyses have been performed in small rectangular ROIs identified manually by expert observers, the results were subject to observer variability and the analysis of small ROIs would potentially miss out important features available in other parts of the lesion. Recent investigations extracted features from the entire lesion segmented by B-mode ultrasound images either manually or semi-automatically, but lesion delineation using existing techniques is time-consuming and prone to variability as intensive user interactions are required. In addition, rich diagnostic features were available along the rim surrounding the lesion. The width of the rim analyzed was subjectively and empirically determined by expert observers in previous studies after intensive visual study on the images, which is time-consuming and susceptible to observer variability. This paper describes an analysis pipeline to segment and classify lesions efficiently. The lesion boundary was first initialized and then deformed based on energy fields generated by the dyadic wavelet transform. Features of the SWE images were extracted from inside and outside of a lesion for different widths of the surrounding rim. Then, feature selection was performed followed by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. This strategy obviates the empirical and time-consuming selection of the surrounding rim width before the analysis. The pipeline was evaluated on 137 lesions. Feature selection was performed 20 times using different sets of 14 lesions (7 malignant, 7 benign). Leave-one-out SVM classification was performed in each of the 20 experiments with a mean sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 95.1%, 94.6% and 94.8% respectively. The pipeline took an average of 20 s to process a lesion. The fact that this efficient pipeline generated classification accuracy superior to that of existing algorithms suggests that improved efficiency did not compromise classification accuracy. The ability to streamline the quantitative assessment of SWE images will potentially accelerate the adoption of the combined use of ultrasound and elastography in clinical practice.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29275098", "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.12.006", "venue": "Computers in biology and medicine", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2773867184", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["37973434", "99105", "24992334", "8877452", "27401372", "7025907", "24051825", "422003", "13043461", "25492355", "4251896", "1309037", "205536730", "2366127", "41985843", "11168489", "1480824", "1244545", "11534612", "43039040", "10340825", "7853624", "1244545", "27085815", "28648503", "18526202", "215113269", "684644", "70638765", "5015946", "207610265", "46102646", "3148179", "20705083", "22288167", "125161961", "12976880", "2851466", "17974137", "5023689", "16770619", "32230069", "15305793", "31454953", "30861980", "119585997", "7602622", "206786900", "121791485", "5023942", "2443126", "6237406", "31835487", "39069188", "39930784"], "inbound_citations": ["208031525", "54957533", "70218112"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5013066"}

However, the prevailing approach has shifted to the application of deep learning concepts, with focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In general, this kind of technique requires large datasets containing a wide variety of conditions to work properly. This is an important limitation, given the many challenges involved in the construction of a suitable image database. In this context, this study investigates how the size and variety of the datasets impact the effectiveness of deep learning techniques applied to plant pathology. This investigation was based on an image database containing 12 plant species, each presenting very different characteristics in terms of number of samples, number of diseases and variety of conditions. Experimental results indicate that while the technical constraints linked to automatic plant disease classification have been largely overcome, the use of limited image datasets for training brings many undesirable consequences that still prevent the effective dissemination of this type of technology.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compag.2018.08.013", "venue": "Comput.

However, as modern systems become more complex, there are many configuration parameters that may interact and we end up learning an exponentially large configuration space. Naturally, this does not scale when relying on real measurements in the actual changing environment. We propose a different solution: Instead of taking the measurements from the real system, we learn the model using samples from other sources, such as simulators that approximate performance of the real system at low cost. We define a cost model that transform the traditional view of model learning into a multi-objective problem that not only takes into account model accuracy but also measurements effort as well.

Clearly, for a depth video clip, the 3DMTM yields a set of three motion information images and a set of three static information images about the front, side and top projections of all the action video frames. Next, those images are transformed into the binary coded images by the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) operator. Finally, the Gradient Local Auto-Correlation (GLAC) algorithm is employed on those binary coded images for representing depth actions through the auto-correlation features. To classify the multiple actions with the gained features, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is adopted here with the kernel trick.

Typically the goal of these studies is to develop methods to predict, at any one moment of time, the activity or activities that the resident(s) of the home are engaged in, which may in turn be used for determining normal or abnormal patterns of behaviour (e.g. in a health-care setting). Classification algorithms, such as Conditional Random Field (CRFs), typically consider sensor activations as features but these are often treated as if they were independent, which in general they are not. Our hypothesis is that learning patterns based on combinations of sensors will be more powerful than single sensors alone. The exhaustive approach to take all possible combinations of sensors and learn classifier weights for each combination is clearly computationally prohibitive. We show that through the application of signal processing and information-theoretic techniques we can learn about the sensor topology in the home (i.e. learn an adjacency matrix) which enables us to determine the combinations of sensors that will be useful for classification ahead of time. As a result we can achieve classification performance better than that of the exhaustive approach, whilst only incurring a small cost in terms of computational resources.

Large, rich datasets hold promises of new insights into complex natural phenomena that will help advance the frontier of science. Here we aim to develop new statistics/data science principles and scalable algorithms for extracting reliable and reproducible information from these data.Chapter 1 provides an overview of the work contained in this thesis. It discusses the growing availability of genomic data and the statistical machine learning tools that are being used to provide a systems-level understanding of genomic phenomena.Chapter 2 introduces the predictability, computability, and stability (PCS) framework. The PCS framework builds on key ideas in machine learning, using predictability as a reality check and evaluating computational considerations in data collection, data storage and algorithm design. It augments predictability and computability with an overarching stability principle, which expands statistical uncertainty considerations to assesses how results vary with respect to choices (or perturbations) made across the data science life cycle. In this chapter, we develop PCS inference through perturbation intervals and PCS hypothesis testing to investigate the reliability of data results. We compare PCS inference with existing methods in high-dimensional sparse linear model simulations to demonstrate that our approach compares favorably to others, in terms of ROC curves, over a wide range of simulation settings. Finally, we propose documentation based on R Markdown, iPython, or Jupyter Notebook, with publicly available, reproducible codes and narratives to justify human choices made throughout an analysis.As an example of the PCS framework in practice, chapter 3 develops the iterative Random Forest algorithm (iRF). iRF trains a feature-weighted ensemble of decision trees to detect stable, high-order interactions with same order of computational cost as Random Forests (RF). We demonstrate the utility of iRF for high-order interaction discovery in two prediction problems: enhancer activity in the early Drosophila embryo and alternative splicing of primary transcripts in human derived cell lines. In Drosophila, 80% of the pairwise transcription factor interactions iRF identified as stable have been previously reported as physical interactions. Moreover, novel third-order interactions, e.g. between Zelda (Zld), Giant (Gt), and Twist (Twi), suggest high-order relationships that are candidates for follow-up experiments. In human-derived cells, iRF re-discovered a central role of H3K36me3 in chromatin-mediated splicing regulation, and identified novel 5th and 6th order interactions, indicative of multi-valent nucleosomes with specific roles in splicing regulation. By decoupling the order of interactions from the computational cost of identification, iRF opens new avenues of inquiry into the molecular mechanisms underlying genome biology.Chapter 4 refines iRF to explicitly map responses as a function of interacting features. Our proposed method, signed iRF (siRF), describes \"subsets\" of rules that frequently occur on RF decision paths. We refer to these rule subsets as signed interactions. RF decision paths containing the same signed interaction share not only a set of interacting features but also exhibit similar thresholding behavior, and thus describe a consistent functional relationship between interacting features and responses. We formulate stable and predictive importance metrics (SPIMs) to rank signed interactions in terms of their stability, predictive accuracy, and strength of interaction. For each SPIM, we define null importance metrics that characterize its expected behavior under known structure. We evaluate siRF in biologically inspired simulations and two case studies: predicting enhancer activity and spatial gene expression patterns. In the case of spatial gene expression patterns, siRF recovered all 11 reported links in the gap gene network. In the case of enhancer activity, siRF discovered rules that identify enhancer elements in Drosophila embryos with high precision, suggesting candidate biological mechanisms for experimental studies. By refining the process of interaction discovery, siRF has the potential to guide mechanistic inquiry into systems whose scale and complexity is beyond human comprehension.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2972700488", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211112678"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203169009"}

This claim is examined and confirmed through simple experiments in which a robot generates corresponding behaviors from unlearned sentences by analogy with the correspondences between learned sentences and behaviors.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "NIPS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2167069442", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2763403", "141355121", "170904723", "3204300", "54158883", "1874331", "8611016", "11990798", "62245742", "15738746", "14648520", "12867479", "13905759", "56798209"], "inbound_citations": ["16638698", "215538335", "7993466", "15143945", "14582266", "13326629", "155282", "3130718"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14111302"}

In this study, we investigated the impact of localized irradiation of the skin on the early alteration of the serum proteome of mice in an effort to discover markers associated with the exposure and severity of impending damage. Using two different large-scale quantitative proteomic approaches, 2D-DIGE-MS and SELDI-TOF-MS, we performed global analyses of serum proteins collected in the clinical latency phase (days 3 and 7) from non-irradiated and locally irradiated mice exposed to high doses of 20, 40 and 80 Gy which will develop respectively erythema, moist desquamation and necrosis. Unsupervised and supervised multivariate statistical analyses (principal component analysis, partial-least square discriminant analysis and Random Forest analysis) using 2D-DIGE quantitative protein data allowed us to discriminate early between non-irradiated and irradiated animals, and between uninjured/slightly injured animals and animals that will develop severe lesions. On the other hand, despite a high number of animal replicates, PLS-DA and Random Forest analyses of SELDI-TOF-MS data failed to reveal sets of MS peaks able to discriminate between the different groups of animals. Our results show that, unlike SELDI-TOF-MS, the 2D-DIGE approach remains a powerful and promising method for the discovery of sets of proteins that could be used for the development of clinical tests for triage and the prognosis of the severity of radiation-induced skin lesions.

However, most of the state-of-the-art MF models share the same drawback that the established models are static. They are only capable of handling CF systems with static settings, but never practical for a real-world system, which involves dynamic scenarios like new user signing in, new item being added and new rating being given now and then. For conventional MF models, they have to conduct repetitive learning every time dynamic scenario occurs. It is computational expensive and hard to meet the real-time demand. Therefore, an incremental learning framework based on Weighted NMF is proposed.

In this paper we recorded the activities of population ganglion cells in bullfrog retina in response to time-varying natural images (natural scene movie) using multi-electrode arrays. In response to some different brief section pairs of the movie, synchronous groups of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) fired with similar but different spike events. We attempted to discriminate the movie sections based on temporal firing patterns of single cells and spatiotemporal firing patterns of the synchronous groups of RGCs characterized by a measurement of subsequence distribution discrepancy.

Here we make use of BAT to optimize the parameters of ELM so that the prediction task is carried out efficiently. The main aim of ELM is to predict the data with minimum error. For attaining a minimal error we have tested Wisconsin Breast Cancer Prognostic (WBCP) dataset upon three different learning functions (sigmoid, sin and tanh) and the function which produces the best result has been considered as the final. We carried out two case studies to support our model. In case study I the objective was to predict whether the breast cancer is recurrent or non-recurrent.

Deep learning approaches are learn-from-data methods involving computational modeling of the learning process. This approach is similar to how human brain works using dierent interpretation levels or layers of most representative and useful features resulting into a hierarchical learned representation. These methods have been shown to outpace traditional approaches of most challenging problems in several areas such as speech recognition and object detection. Invasive breast cancer detection is a time consuming and challenging task primarily because it involves a pathologist scanning large swathes of benign regions to ultimately identify the areas of malignancy. Precise delineation of IDC in WSI is crucial to the subsequent estimation of grading tumor aggressiveness and predicting patient outcome. DL approaches are particularly adept at handling these types of problems, especially if a large number of samples are available for training, which would also ensure the generalizability of the learned features and classier. The DL framework in this paper extends a number of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for visual semantic analysis of tumor regions for diagnosis support. The CNN is trained over a large amount of image patches (tissue regions) from WSI to learn a hierarchical part-based representation. The method was evaluated over a WSI dataset from 162 patients diagnosed with IDC. 113 slides were selected for training and 49 slides were held out for independent testing. Ground truth for quantitative evaluation was provided via expert delineation of the region of cancer by an expert pathologist on the digitized slides. The experimental evaluation was designed to measure classier accuracy in detecting IDC tissue regions in WSI. Our method yielded the best quantitative results for automatic detection of IDC regions in WSI in terms of F-measure and balanced accuracy (71.80%, 84.23%), in comparison with an approach using handcrafted image features (color, texture and edges, nuclear textural and architecture), and a machine learning classier for invasive tumor classication using a Random Forest. The best performing handcrafted features were fuzzy color histogram (67.53%, 78.74%) and RGB histogram (66.64%, 77.24%). Our results also suggest that at least some of the tissue classication mistakes (false positives and false negatives) were less due to any fundamental problems associated with the approach, than the inherent limitations in obtaining a very highly granular annotation of the diseased area of interest by an expert pathologist.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2043872", "venue": "Medical Imaging", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2062177968", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["17622089", "24314528", "8981590", "745031", "11810731", "9522480", "39418106", "16261617", "207178999", "393948", "10663248", "7587705", "398770", "18235792", "175089", "2161592", "207763512", "15929280", "15286576", "214880929", "16234956", "14542261", "206949548", "7152779", "5448638", "15222519", "18181626", "5955557", "9573124", "15205125", "2087532", "1397618", "369876", "9384006", "8575576", "89141"], "inbound_citations": ["58675933", "58589358", "44133841", "3797027", "3311283", "2565651", "35546107", "21702335", "198179756", "206402767", "199528347", "195833171", "52822035", "199508915", "21730881", "54463541", "57760479", "189892302", "172136838", "16405142", "57825742", "208211902", "15237647", "214727706", "6043186", "210995965", "52274062", "85547085", "167217402", "201106825", "67875563", "32725852", "23429929", "208006688", "3831945", "196622605", "1718592", "17822068", "58564748", "44661243", "53210685", "15706228", "199043823", "3673165", "3810478", "35739022", "148574307", "202687556", "90262073", "14819648", "52191417", "4712844", "69649876", "49185039", "14941438", "3418122", "85497281", "51982231", "209516000", "23839386", "53283825", "203605266", "198333099", "208821758", "5019792", "38401802", "209862943", "166227844", "53098684", "22592624", "15580443", "119308856", "52314753", "214693360", "15881626", "3459421", "21697959", "214751602", "189824040", "29151643", "1645469", "49390656", "13179309", "198161146", "21664130", "212647945", "215171849", "92280846", "4035079", "119301174", "209853066", "2088679"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14197771"}

This paper presents an oil and gas pipeline failure prediction system using LRUT in conjunction with Euclidean-SVM approach. ? The conventional NDT pipeline failure prediction systems are deployed at pre-determined intervals. ? LRUT pipeline failure prediction system with Euclidean-SVM provides continuous monitoring for pipelines and makes decision without human errors and misinterpretations. ? In contrast to the conventional SVM, Euclidean-SVM is less dependent on the choice of the kernel function and parameters. ? Experimental results show that Euclidean-SVM has more consistent and better classification performance as compared to the conventional SVM. This paper presents an intelligent failure prediction system for oil and gas pipeline using long range ultrasonic transducers and Euclidean-Support Vector Machines classification approach. Since the past decade, the incidents of oil and gas pipeline leaks and failures which happened around the world are becoming more frequent and have caused loss of life, properties and irreversible environmental damages. This situation is due to the lack of a full-proof method of inspection on the condition of oil and gas pipelines. Onset of corrosion and other defects are undetected which cause unplanned shutdowns and disruption of energy supplies to consumers. Existing failure prediction systems for pipeline which use non-destructive testing (NDTs) methods are accurate, but they are deployed at pre-determined intervals which can be several months apart. Hence, a full-proof and reliable inspection method is required to continuously monitor the condition of oil and gas pipeline in order to provide sufficient information and time to oil and gas operators to plan and organize shutdowns before failures occur. Permanently installed long range ultrasonic transducers (LRUTs) offer a solution to this problem by providing an inspection platform that continuously monitor critical pipeline sections. Data are acquired in real-time and processed to make decision based on the condition of the pipe. The continuous nature of the data requires an automatic decision making software rather than manual inspection by operators. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classification approach has been increasingly used in a multitude of domains including LRUT and has shown better performance than other classification algorithms. SVM is heavily dependent on the choice of kernel functions as well as fine tuning of the kernel and soft margin parameters. Hence it is unsuitable to be used in continuous monitoring of pipeline data where constant modifications of kernels and parameters are not unrealistic. This paper proposes a novel classification technique, namely Euclidean-Support Vector Machines (Euclidean-SVM), to make a decision on the integrity of the pipeline in a continuous monitoring environment. The results show that the classification accuracy of the Euclidean-SVM approach is not dependent on the choice of the kernel function and parameters when classifying data from pipes with simulated defects. Irrespective of the kernel function and parameters chosen, classification accuracy of the Euclidean-SVM is comparable and also higher in some cases than using conventional SVM. Hence, the Euclidean-SVM approach is ideally suited for classifying data from the oil and gas pipelines which are continuously monitored using LRUT.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2012.10.006", "venue": "Expert Syst.

In this paper, we propose a two-part network consisting of a DNN-based architecture followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF) module for facial expression recognition in videos. The first part captures the spatial relation within facial images using convolutional layers followed by three Inception- ResNet modules and two fully-connected layers.

In this paper, we propose a new framework combining Structured Random Forests (SRF), a machine learning technique that shows great potential for edge detection, with Active Shape Models and we compare our segmentation results with state-of-the-art algorithms.

The paper takes the approach towards understanding and building integrative connectionist systems, that integrate principles and rules from different hierarchical levels of information processing in their dynamic interaction, as an approach to develop intelligent machines. Examples given include: simple evolving connectionist systems; evolving spiking neural networks; integrative neurogenetic models; genetically defined robots; quantum evolutionary algorithms for exponentially faster optimization; integrative quantum neural networks. Some of the new integrative models are significantly faster in feature selection and learning and can be used to solve efficiently NP complete biological and engineering problems for adaptive, incremental learning in a large dimensional space-an important feature of the human intelligence.

In this paper, a novel short-term Empirical Mode Decomposition-Grey Relational Analysis-Modified Particle Swarm Optimization-Least Squares Support Vector Machine (EMD-GRA-MPSO-LSSVM) load forecasting model is proposed. The model uses the de-noising method combining empirical mode decomposition and grey relational analysis to process the original load series and forecasts the processed subsequences by the algorithm of modified particle swarm optimization and least square support vector machine. Then, the final forecasting results can be obtained after reconstructing the forecasting series. This paper takes the Jibei area as an example to produce an empirical analysis for load forecasting. The model input includes the hourly load one week before the forecasting day and the daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, daily average temperature, relative humidity, wind force, date type of the forecasting day. The model output is the hourly load of the forecasting day.

These ongoing processes should be considered when designing afforestation measures and policies. We analyzed the temporal tree dynamics in 800 randomly selected plots of 100 m radius in dehesas and treeless pasturelands of Extremadura by comparing aerial images taken in 1956 and 2012. Based on this data, spatial models that predict areas prone to undergo or lack natural tree recruitment were developed using three data mining algorithms: MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines), Random Forest (RF) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (TreeNet, TN). A number of 51 candidate environmental, physical and land use and cover spatial variables were used as predictors in models, from which the main 15 were selected. The statistical models developed were deployed to the spatial context of the rangelands in Extremadura and, separately, to the afforested areas performed under the UE First Afforestation of Agricultural Land program between 1992 and 2013. The percentage of area predicted as prone to tree recruitment was calculated in each case. The three data mining algorithms used showed high fitness and low misclassification rates. Although the drivers and patterns of the different models were similar, outstanding differences were observed among models attending the area prone to tree recruitment. A model ensemble was also produced as a map of agreement reflecting the majority vote among models. Despite these differences, when maps of the model results were related to the afforested surfaces, the three algorithms pointed to the similar conclusion, i.e., the afforestations performed in the studied rangelands barely discriminated between areas that already showed or lacked natural tree regeneration. In conclusion, data mining technics are suitable to develop high-performance spatial models of vegetation dynamics.

Constantly improving the performance of prediction models is the key to ensuring the efficient operation of energy systems. Moreover, accuracy is no longer the only factor in revealing model performance, it is more important to evaluate the model from multiple perspectives, considering the characteristics of engineering applications. Based on the idea of model integration, this paper proposes a novel improved integration model (stacking model) that can be used to forecast building energy consumption. The stacking model combines advantages of various base prediction algorithms and forms them into \u201cmeta-features\u201d to ensure that the final model can observe datasets from different spatial and structural angles. Two cases are used to demonstrate practical engineering applications of the stacking model. A comparative analysis is performed to evaluate the prediction performance of the stacking model in contrast with existing well-known prediction models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Decision Tree, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor. The results indicate that the stacking method achieves better performance than other models, regarding accuracy (improvement of 9.5%\u201331.6% for Case A and 16.2%\u201349.4% for Case B), generalization (improvement of 6.7%\u201329.5% for Case A and 7.1%-34.6% for Case B), and robustness (improvement of 1.5%\u201334.1% for Case A and 1.8%\u201319.3% for Case B).

Due the high number of events recorded during pre-eruptive periods by the seismic monitoring networks, cataloging each event can be complex and time-consuming if done by human operators. Automatic seismic signal processing methods are thus essential to build consistent catalogs based on objective criteria. We evaluated the performance of the \u201cRandom Forests\u201d (RF) machine-learning algorithm for classifying seismic signals recorded at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano, La Reunion Island (France). We focused on the discrimination of the dominant event types (rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes) using over 19,000 events covering two time periods: 2009\u20132011 and 2014\u20132015. We parametrized the seismic signals using 60 attributes that were then given to RF algorithm. When the RF classifier was given enough training samples, its sensitivity (rate of good identification) exceeded 99%, and its performance remained high (above 90%) even with few training samples. The sensitivity collapsed when using an RF classifier trained with data from 2009 to 2011 to classify data from 2014 to 2015 catalog, because the physical characteristics of the rockfalls and hence their seismic signals had evolved between the two time-periods. The main attribute families (waveform, spectrum, spectrogram or polarization) were all found to be useful for event discrimination. Our work validates the performance of the RF algorithm and suggests it could be implemented at other volcanic observatories to perform automatic, near real-time, classification of seismic events.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2017.04.015", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research", "mag_id": "2608518078", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52987507", "209991301", "209526906", "134253603", "164245708", "54441758", "197430756", "189985774", "211118132", "207830151", "203592096"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132603357"}

The applied GAN is composed of two adversarial networks, namely generator G and discriminator D. Generator G learns the spatial characteristics of an input radar image to construct a mapping from an input to output image with suppressed ghosts. Discriminator D evaluates the difference (namely, the residual multipath ghosts) between the output image and the ground-truth image without multipath ghosts. On the one hand, by training G, the image difference is gradually diminished. In other words, multipath ghosts are increasingly suppressed in the output image of G. On the other hand, D is trained to improve in evaluating the diminishing difference accompanied with multipath ghosts as much as possible. These two networks, G and D, fight with each other until G eliminates the multipath ghosts. The simulation results demonstrate that GAN can effectively eliminate multipath ghosts in TWRI. A comparison of different methods demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method, such as the exemption of prior wall information, no target images with degradation, and robustness for different scenes.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/electronics8060626", "venue": null, "journal": "Electronics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2948293669", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["8494537", "122248994", "38782769", "2107988", "7300997", "46803680", "21841467", "46895934", "28032403", "119999864", "29604160", "1033682", "6200260", "3719281", "18781152", "11758569", "2202933", "1541706"], "inbound_citations": ["204700797", "213360558"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195395722"}

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a more recent field of EEG research that provides one such stimulus. In this paper, we present a new process for identifying the EEG state wherein system identification theory is implemented to model the transformation of the EEG due to a time specific TMS pulse. An AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARMAX) structure was classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The maximum classification accuracy of 88% for a single subject, used a quadratic kernel and alpha frequency, but we also report results from different implementations. The information transfer rate, however, is only 5.1bits/min.

Driver fatigue is a major case of traffic accidents worldwide and considered as a significant problem in recent decades. In this paper, a hybrid deep generic model (DGM)-based support vector machine is proposed for accurate detection of driver fatigue. Traditionally, a probabilistic DGM with deep architecture is quite good at learning invariant features, but it is not always optimal for classification due to its trainable parameters are in the middle layer. Alternatively, Support Vector Machine (SVM) itself is unable to learn complicated invariance, but produces good decision surface when applied to well-behaved features. Consolidating unsupervised high-level feature extraction techniques, DGM and SVM classification makes the integrated framework stronger and enhance mutually in feature extraction and classification. The experimental results showed that the proposed DBN-based driver fatigue monitoring system achieves better testing accuracy of 73.29 % with 91.10 % sensitivity and 55.48 % specificity.

We propose to use Kinect as a tool for collecting ground truth to a purely visual dataset (for reasons defined by the application, use of Kinect or similar structured light-based approaches is impossible). Since Kinect annotation of individual joints might be imprecise at certain moments, manual post-processing of the acquired data is necessary and we propose a scheme for efficient and reliable manual post-annotation. We produced a dataset of 6,322 annotated frames, involving 11 human subjects recorded in various lighting conditions, different clothing, and varying background. Each frame contains one seated person in frontal view with annotation of pose and optical flow data. We used detectors of body parts based on Random Forest on the produced dataset in order to verify its usability. These preliminary results show that the detector can be trained successfully on the developed dataset and that the optical flow contributes to the detection accuracy considerably. The dataset and the intermediary data used during its creation is made publicly available.

It is a complex and time-consuming process. Recent advancements in parallel and distributed approaches have led to the evolution of big data analytics. It also claimed bigger data may not always be better data. Toward scalable solutions for big data analytics, it is highly demanded to have a scalable and dynamic process with more representative and relevant sets of data. We envision that if the condensed and representative sample can be drawn from very large-scale datasets in a parallel and distributed manner and this can be defined as signature learning, this approach can provide more accurate results in an efficient manner. Using signature learning with relevant datasets in a parallel and distributed manner, the complexity of big data problems can be reduced. ::: In this thesis, we propose the SigSpace-Text framework that is an extension of our previous model of signature-based learning (SigSpace) that proved the effectiveness of signature-based classification with image signatures and audio signatures. SigSpace was not feasible with text data due to the inherent problems in the text domain such as a high-dimensional feature space and sparse feature vectors. In order to handle these issues, we explore using Natural Language Processing, that features extraction and feature selection techniques (TFIDF, Word2Vec). Signature learning in SigSpace-Text is based on a class-level clustering approach, in which a generic pattern is identified for a given category using state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, i.e., K-Means, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). These signatures are used (instead of raw data) as a feature set to the classification. Through extension, the proposed SigSpace-Text approach brings vital, practical information to signature learning approaches on several text classification tasks. The SigSpace-Text model supports incremental, distributed, and parallel learning using big data analytics including Apache Spark and the Machine Learning library such as Spark MLlib. In experiments with the SigSpace-Text framework, the effectiveness of the proposed signature learning model was evaluated for various parameters (such as the signature size, classification algorithms, local signatures/global signatures) and was also validated with a number of classification algorithms (i.e., Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forests) using 20 newsgroup dataset.

Mining these complex data for clinically relevant patterns is a daunting task for which no definitive best method exists. In this paper, we explore the expressive power of the multi-relational Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) data mining approach, using combined trial data of the EU E-COMPARED depression trial. Methods We explored the capability of ILP to handle and combine (implicit) multiple relationships in the E-COMPARED data. This data set has the following features that favor ILP analysis: 1) Time reasoning is involved; 2) there is a reasonable amount of explicit useful relations to be analyzed; 3) ILP is capable of building comprehensible models that might be perceived as putative explanations by domain experts; 4) both numerical and statistical models may coexist within ILP models if necessary. In our analyses, we focused on scores of the PHQ-8 self-report questionnaire (which taps depressive symptom severity), and on EMA of mood and various other clinically relevant factors. Both measures were administered during treatment, which lasted between 9 to 16 weeks. Results E-COMPARED trial data revealed different individual improvement patterns: PHQ-8 scores suggested that some individuals improved quickly during the first weeks of the treatment, while others improved at a (much) slower pace, or not at all. Combining self-reported Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA), PHQ-8 scores and log data about the usage of the ICT4D platform in the context of blended care, we set out to unveil possible causes for these different trajectories.

For supervised classification of hyperspectral data, obtaining suitable training set is essential for ensuring good performance. However, obtaining labeled training sample is often difficult, expensive, and time consuming in hyperspectral images (HSIs) and other image analysis applications. To overcome this problem, active learning (AL) technique plays a crucial role in the image analysis framework. As per literature, classification of HSI using AL has been focused in terms of accuracy, but learning rate in terms of computation time has not been focused yet. In this paper, multiview-based AL technique has been integrated with kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) classifier. Further, we have compared our approach with popularly used kernel-based support vector machine (KSVM). To validate our study, experiments were conducted on two Hyperspectral Images: Kennedy Space Centre (KSC) and Botswana (BOT) datasets. The proposed approach (KELM-AL) achieved the classification accuracy up to 91.15% in KSC dataset while 95.02% in case of BOT dataset with computation time of 149.78 s and 104.98 s, respectively.

On the other hand, there still remains a big hurdle to analyze personal big data on cloud services because the leakage of personal information is a critical issue. As a remedy for this, we propose a privacy preserving machine learning algorithm for Extreme Learning Machine (PP-ELM), which can learn from data encrypted with an additively homomorphic encryption. In the proposed outsourcing method, we consider a three-participants model consisting of data contributors, outsourced server, and data analyst. A data contributor preprocesses and encrypts data, and an outsourced server receives encrypted data and calculate hidden layer outputs using additive operations. Then, a data analyst receives the hidden outputs of ELM from the outsourced server and they are used to obtain ELM connection weights. Since the proposed outsourcing model can learn ELM over encrypted data, it is expected to mitigate a hurdle to deal with personal data on cloud services. In addition, the proposed PP-ELM allows us to learn multiple sources of personal data in a secure way, and this might lead to a better solution for a practical problem than before.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285190", "venue": "2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)", "journal": "2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2787473289", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2468323", "2259147", "14119362", "28027864", "6472948", "207233895", "6905087", "9483611", "2973271", "947660", "15037168", "125113539", "16383127"], "inbound_citations": ["210692739", "57364858", "209380328"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37541147"}

The ATP/EMTP is used to simulate fault signals. The mother wavelet daubechies4 (db4) is employed to decompose high frequency component from these signals. The first peak time in first scale capable of detecting fault of each bus is used as input pattern for the training pattern. It is shown that the proposed technique gives satisfactory results. to be \"on-line\" and can, therefore, use any communications channel. In previous research works (9), discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based on travelling wave is employed to detect the high frequency components, and to identify fault locations in the underground distribution system. The first peak time that can detect fault obtained from all buses are compared, and the fastest two first peak times obtained from comparison are used as input data for travelling wave equation. Although the travelling wave technique can provide precise results in fault location, it requires a high sampling rate and has difficulties in distinguishing between travelling waves reflected from the fault point versus those from the remote end of the line (10). The development of the algorithm for locating fault on the transmission line with the wavelet transform was initially proposed by F. H. Magnago et al (11). Artificial intelligence (AI) has been also reported in the literature for fault location (2, 12). Although artificial neural network algorithm can give precise results in fault locations, but it is partly limited by the slow training performance. In order to overcome this problem, a new algorithm has been developed. It is interesting to investigate an appropriate support vector machines algorithm if the fault locations on the transmission line can be identified using wavelet transform and support vector machines for being included in newly-developed protection systems. Therefore, this paper presents a development of a new decision algorithm used in the protective relays in order to identify fault locations along the transmission systems. The fault conditions are simulated using ATP/EMTP. The current waveforms obtained from the simulation, then, are extracted using the DWT. The validity of the proposed algorithm is tested with various fault inception angles, fault locations and faulty phases. In addition, the construction of the decision algorithm is detailed and implemented with various case studies based on Thailand electricity transmission systems.

In this very general framework, the work presented in this thesis focuses on two theoretical aspects \u2013 feature extraction and pattern classification \u2013 and a more practical one \u2013 human face class modeling. We first propose a new framework for using the autocorrelation-based features for pattern classification. In this context, we extend their use to higher orders by exploiting a property of the inner product of two autocorrelation feature vectors. As a large number of classification algorithms may be cast into a form in which data is involved only by means of inner products between vectors, this property provides a very convenient way of avoiding explicitly computing the feature vectors \u2013 an operation which is normally very costly. Using this approach, we show that, practically, there is no upper limit for the order of autocorrelation functions used \u2013 rather this limit depends on the application. By defining different topologies over which the autocorrelation feature vectors are applied, we obtain extended feature vectors, for which the inner product property still holds. We illustrate the use of autocorrelation feature vectors by first showing how one can perform Principal Component Analysis in the autocorrelation space and we apply it to the classification of unidimensional signals. Another application presented uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) for detecting human faces described in terms of extended autocorrelation feature vectors. Next, we develop a family of algorithms that generate sparse representations of the discriminant functions. This family is based on a recently proposed algorithm, the Kernel Matching Pursuit [176] (KMP), which is considerably extended and enhanced. Using as a starting point the theory of n-term greedy function approximation, we justify the introduction of different versions of KMP. Firstly, we introduce the Weak KMP which uses a learning rate-like parameter for controling the importance of the decisions taken at each iteration. We propose then another version \u2013 Stochastic KMP \u2013 designed to make the application of KMP to large datasets feasible. Finally, two approaches for building adaptive versions of KMP are presented and compared. All these algorithms are tested on various standard datasets and their performance is compared to that of SVM. On the application side we discuss various aspects of human face detection. In this context we introduce a new method for estimating the performance of the face detection and localization algorithms which is designed to make the results comparable in an objective way. At the core of the technique is the precise definition of what a good detection or localization means. Using our definition we set the performance criteria and the evaluation method. As an example, we apply this technique to a standard detector and we discuss its performance. Finally, we present an approach to human face class modeling using SVM trained in the eigenfaces space. We discuss different issues that arise in building the eigenfaces space and training the SVM and we propose a new method for building a composite classifier based on SVMs which has various advantages over using a single SVM. We compare then the results of applying two face detectors (a classical one based on SVM trained in the pixel space and one using an SVM trained in the eigenfaces space) on a large dataset using the technique described before and we show that the new proposed method is superior.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5075/epfl-thesis-3141", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1555325287", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:118498169"}

Soil texture has traditionally been determined in the laboratory using pipette and hydrometer methods that require a considerable amount of time, labor, and expense.

This paper is a part of overall research to develop a soil texture classification system using image processing. Application of image processing was motivated by simple traditional approaches such as visual inspection and the \u201chand-feel\u201d method. In this paper, the potential of soil texture classification using RGB histograms was investigated. Seven sites representing major Korean paddy soil series were selected, 4-6 core samples up to a 50-cm depth were obtained from each site, and each sample was segmented by 5-cm intervals. For each segmented soil sample, four surface images were taken using a miniaturized CCD camera, and texture fractions were determined by the pipette method. Scatter plots showed linear patterns between silt content and histogram variables such as brightness, skewness, and mode - brightness. When 5% averaged silt content was linearly regressed with mode - brightness, R 2 , RMSEC, and RMSEP were 0.96, 2.2%, and 6.3%, respectively. When soils were classified using USDA criteria, the laboratory method and the in-situ image processing method produced the same results for 48% of the samples.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3182/20101206-3-JP-3009.00005", "venue": null, "journal": "IFAC Proceedings Volumes", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1535631901,2000276615", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["129461003", "133355426", "127338125", "26528537", "110631914"], "inbound_citations": ["209516516", "12468876", "215135218", "128171417"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:82578228"}

The problem is non-trivial due to three major challenges for traditional methods: insufficient training data, high computational cost and low prediction accuracy. To tackle these challenges, we firstly propose a Regressive Convolution Neural Network (RCNN) model, but RCNN still suffers from high computation overhead. Then we utilize RCNN to extract features from data and Regressive Support Vector Machine (SVR) trained with features to predict the electricity consumption.

Most current methods usually make use of dataset augmentation to address this issue, but this requires larger number of model parameters and more training data, and results in significantly increased training time and larger chance of under-or overfitting. The main reason for these drawbacks is that that the learned model needs to capture adequate features for all the possible transformations of the input. On the other hand, we formulate features in convolutional neural networks to be transformation-invariant. We achieve that using parallel siamese architectures for the considered transformation set and applying the TI-POOLING operator on their outputs before the fully-connected layers. We show that this topology internally finds the most optimal \"canonical\" instance of the input image for training and therefore limits the redundancy in learned features.

While a large amount of literature and of well established results exist concerning the issue of generalization for many non-evolutionary Machine Learning strategies, like for instance Support Vector Machines, this issue in Genetic Programming (GP) has not received the attention it deserves and only recently, few papers dealing with the problem of generalization have appeared (see for instance [1, 2, 3]). In this paper, we have motivated and empirically shown that GP using a Pareto multi-optimization on the training set has a remarkably higher generalization ability than canonic or standard GP (besides counteracting bloat in a more efficient way and maintaining a higher diversity inside the population). Here is an informal motivation for this idea: in figure 1, we have plotted two simple hypothetical fitness functions and two simple hypothetical GP individuals with good fitness on the training set and bad generalization ability, if the sum of errors is considered as the sole evaluation criterium. Even though for points inside the training set the gray and black curves are very close (and thus fitness is good on the training set, if fitness is the sum of errors), outside the training set, they are very far from each other and they get farthest as we consider farthest points from the training set. This happens because the gray and black curves are uncorrelated and all the distances between the gray curves points and the black curves ones with the same abscissa inside the training set are different between each other. Thus, three optimization criteria have been used on the training set by our multi-optimization framework: sum of errors, statistical correlation between targets and outputs and variance of the pairwise distances between targets and outputs.

Transfer learning can be utilized to take a knowledge from what a deep neural network has learned from a particular task and apply that knowledge to a different task. Transfer learning is very useful when the size of the training samples of interest is small to train a neural network from scratch. This research focuses on the concept of transfer learning where the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) power can be utilized as a features extractor to help with classifying benign from malignant breast cancer images. In addition, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) was adapted for its flexibility in fitting the data dimension space adequately by tuning the kernel width. The hybridization between CNN and RBF-Based SVM showed robust results for both the dataset and the application task of this research. The contribution of this paper can be summarized in three major parts.

Researchers have also used multi-objective optimization (MOO) in order to generate diverse models to build ensembles of classifiers. Although MOO has been used for ensemble member generation, there is a lack on it's application for member selection, which is usually done by selecting a specific subset from the resulting models, or by using meta-algorithms, such as boosting. The proposed work comprises the application of MOO design in the whole process of ensemble generation. To do so, one multi-objective problem (MOP) is defined for the creation of a set of non-dominated solutions with Pareto-optimal support vector machines (SVM).

Such methodology is compared to other member selection methods, such as: the single best classifier, an ensemble composed of the full set of non-dominated solutions, and the selection of a specific subset from the Pareto front.

The framework is dynamic because the price is determined based on recent usage data and available resources, it is also intelligent as it takes into various economic models into consideration, it is benign because it considers two conflicting parties, service providers and consumers, into consideration at the same time, and it is customizable based on various pricing strategies proposed by service providers and usage patterns as exhibited by consumers. Linear regression is used in various game theory models to determine the optimal price. A global pricing union (GPU) framework is proposed to achieve the best practice of game theory models.

Challenging classification problems in the visual domain (such as recognizing handwriting, faces and human-body images) often require a large number of training examples, which may become available over a long training period. This motivates the development of scalable and adaptive systems which are able to continue learning at any stage and which can efficiently learn from large amounts of data, in an on-line manner. Previous approaches to on-line learning in visual classification have used a fixed parametric model, and focused on continuously improving the model parameters as more data becomes available. Here we propose a new framework which enables online learning algorithms to adjust the complexity of the learned model to the amount of the training data as more examples become available. Since in online learning the training set expands over time, it is natural to allow the learned model to become more complex during the course of learning instead of confining the model to a fixed family of a bounded complexity. Formally, we use a set of parametric classifiers y = h\u03b1\u03b8 (x) where y is the class and x the observed data. The parameter \u03b1 controls the complexity of the model family. For a fixed \u03b1, the training examples are used for the optimal setting of \u03b8. When the amount of data becomes sufficiently large, the value of \u03b1 is increased, and a more complex model family is used. For evaluation of the proposed approach, we implement an online Support Vector Machine with increasing complexity, and evaluate in a task of handwritten character recognition on the MNIST database.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CRV.2009.52", "venue": "2009 Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision", "journal": "2009 Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2136696894", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60330386", "14227081", "62730865", "2702042", "14534147", "10555270", "819006", "60069383", "7706900", "1466244", "64543020", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": ["13987980", "16602825", "16960005", "17890894"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1712909"}

Landslide Susceptibility Map (LSM) provides the policy and decision makers with some valuable information. This study aims to detect landslide locations by using Sentinel-1 data, the only freely available online Radar imagery, and to map areas prone to landslide using a novel algorithm of AB-ADTree in Cameron Highlands, Pahang, Malaysia. A total of 152 landslide locations were detected by using integration of Interferometry Synthetic Aperture RADAR (InSAR) technique, Google Earth (GE) images and extensive field survey. However, 80% of the data were employed for training the machine learning algorithms and the remaining 20% for validation purposes. Seventeen triggering and conditioning factors, namely slope, aspect, elevation, distance to road, distance to river, proximity to fault, road density, river density, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), rainfall, land cover, lithology, soil types, curvature, profile curvature, Stream Power Index (SPI) and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), were extracted from satellite imageries, digital elevation model (DEM), geological and soil maps. These factors were utilized to generate landslide susceptibility maps using Logistic Regression (LR) model, Logistic Model Tree (LMT), Random Forest (RF), Alternating Decision Tree (ADTree), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and a novel hybrid model from ADTree and AdaBoost models, namely AB-ADTree model. The validation was based on area under the ROC curve (AUC) and statistical measurements of Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

In real-world exercises, too many choices can create difficulties in selecting the most appropriate technique, especially for users lacking sufficient knowledge of forecasting. This study focuses on rule induction for forecasting method selection by understanding the nature of historical forecasting data. A novel approach for selecting a forecasting method for univariate time series based on measurable data characteristics is presented that combines elements of data mining, meta-learning, clustering, classification and statistical measurement. We conducted a large-scale empirical study of over 300 time series using four of the most popular forecasting methods.

However, there are still faults and failures which usually occur in the system. The failure in helical gearbox is more prominent in bearings rather than gears which are the main components of the system. Gearbox is susceptible to failures because of reasons like misalignment, vibration and shocks. In this paper wavelet feature extraction is used along with random forest algorithm to diagnose faults in gearbox. The vibration signals were used for extracting wavelet features. Features were selected using J48 Decision Tree and were classified using random forest algorithm. A detailed study has been done to ensure that the optimum number of features was used and the factor was iterated so that maximum classification accuracy is obtained. The results are presented along with the conclusion. Method Analysis: The classification accuracy is obtained by 3 steps namely, feature extraction, feature selection and feature classification. By obtaining the Decision Tree the most important factors are selected to obtain maximum classification accuracy at minimum number of features to reduce calculations in real time application. The number of features and depth of data is iterated to obtain the maximum classification accuracy. Findings: Through this research random forest algorithm was tested for fault diagnosis of gearbox and a better classification accuracy was obtained. These results can be further used for fault diagnosis in industries for any gearbox related problems.

The PD group was a mix of MCI, Non MCI and unclassified early stage PD patients. 63 Frequency measures and 216 Phase Lag Index measures were obtained for all patients. To overcome the problem of imbalanced data, Random Forest algorithm was applied to the data and compared with Random Forest using cost-sensitive learning as well as Random Forest with stratified sampling. Classification models were built using frequency measures, PLI measures and frequency combined with PLI measures respectively. Results Applying cost-sensitive learning or stratified sampling to Random Forest increased the predictive performance of the model, in comparison to using Random Forest alone. In the case of stratified sampling, using 63 frequency measures for classification gave a ROC curve with average AUC value of 0.68. The AUC value increased to 0.75 when using PLI measures alone, which further increased to 0.8 when combining PLI and frequency measures. Further analysis revealed many more PLI measures than frequency measures to be amongst the top features distinguishing the two groups accurately.

The proposed ensemble first exploits a sparse non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) process to represent data instances in parts and partition the data space into localities, and then coordinates the individual classifiers in each locality for final classification. In the sparse NMF, data exemplars are projected to a set of locality bases, in which the non-negative superposition of basis images reconstructs the original exemplars. This additive combination ensures that each locality captures the characteristics of data exemplars in part, thus enabling the local classifiers to hold reasonable diversity in their own regions of expertise. More importantly, the sparse NMF ensures that an exemplar is projected to only a few bases (localities) with non-zero coefficients.

Most studies on customer' response have focused on predicting whether they would respond or not for their marketing promotion as marketing managers have been eager to identify who would respond to their marketing promotion. So many studies utilizing data mining have tried to resolve the binary decision problems such as bankruptcy prediction, network intrusion detection, and fraud detection in credit card usages. The prediction of customer's response has been studied with similar methods mentioned above because the prediction of customer's response is a kind of dichotomous decision problem. In addition, a number of competitive data mining techniques such as neural networks, SVM(support vector machine), decision trees, logit, and genetic algorithms have been applied to the prediction of customer's response for marketing promotion. The marketing managers also have tried to classify their customers with quantitative measures such as recency, frequency, and monetary acquired from their transaction database. The measures mean that their customers came to purchase in recent or old days, how frequent in a period, and how much they spent once. Using segmented customers we proposed an approach that could enable to differentiate customers in the same rating among the segmented customers. Our approach employed support vector regression to forecast the purchase amount of customers for each customer rating. Our study used the sample that included 41,924 customers extracted from DMEF04 Data Set, who purchased at least once in the last two years. We classified customers from first rating to fifth rating based on the purchase amount after giving a marketing promotion. Here, we divided customers into first rating who has a large amount of purchase and fifth rating who are non-respondents for the promotion. Our proposed model forecasted the purchase amount of the customers in the same rating and the marketing managers could make a differentiated and personalized marketing program for each customer even though they were belong to the same rating. In addition, we proposed more efficient learning method by separating the learning samples. We employed two learning methods to compare the performance of proposed learning method with general learning method for SVRs. LMW (Learning Method using Whole data for purchasing customers) is a general learning method for forecasting the purchase amount of customers. And we proposed a method, LMS (Learning Method using Separated data for classification purchasing customers), that makes four different SVR models for each class of customers. To evaluate the performance of models, we calculated MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percent Error) for each model to predict the purchase amount of customers. In LMW, the overall performance was 0.670 MAPE and the best performance showed 0.327 MAPE. Generally, the performances of the proposed LMS model were analyzed as more superior compared to the performance of the LMW model. In LMS, we found that the best performance was 0.275 MAPE. The performance of LMS was higher than LMW in each class of customers. After comparing the performance of our proposed method LMS to LMW, our proposed model had more significant performance for forecasting the purchase amount of customers in each class. In addition, our approach will be useful for marketing managers when they need to customers for their promotion. Even if customers were belonging to same class, marketing managers could offer customers a differentiated and personalized marketing promotion.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "789279093", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:166496275"}

Data-driven models based on machine learning algorithms have great application prospects for hydrological response forecasting as they require less developmental time, minimal input, and are relatively simple compared to dynamic or physical models, especially for data scarce regions. In this study, we employed an ensemble of eight General Circulation Models (GCMs) and two artificial intelligence-based methods (Support Vector Regression, SVR, and Extreme Learning Machine, ELM) to establish the historical streamflow response to climate change and to forecast the future response under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 in a mountainous watershed in northwest China. We found that the artificial-intelligence-based SVR and ELM methods showed very good performances in the projection of future hydrological responses. The ensemble of GCM outputs derived very close historical hydrological hindcasts but had great uncertainty in future hydrological projections. Using the variables of GCM outputs as inputs to SVR can reduce intermediate downscaling links between variables and decrease the cumulative effect of bias in projecting future hydrological responses.

Unfortunately, synthesizing these views for learning a comprehensive description of data items is challenging. To tackle it, many approaches have been studied to explore correlations between various features by assuming that all views can be projected into a same semantic subspace. Following this idea, we propose a novel semi-supervised method, namely dual graphregularized multi-view feature learning (DGMFL), for data representation in this paper. The core idea is to generate a latent subspace among different views. Our approach utilizes dual graph regularization to capture semantic relationships among data items on both multi-view features and label information, as well as locates view-specific features for each view to reduce the effects of uncorrelated items. In this way, DGMFL could achieve more comprehensive representations hidden in multi-view datasets.

The rational of this modification is to counter the detrimental effect of the length of the text on the PMI and on the quality of the lexicon. The high computational cost due to the huge amount of textual information to be processed in addition to our modified PMI formula is tackled efficiently by relying heavily on parallelization using Map-Reduce and Mongo DB shards. Movie and product reviews are used to evaluate the generated sentiment lexicons to correctly classify review ratings. The lexicon exhibits a satisfactory performance when evaluated, in particular when considering the context change in the corpuses. In fact, surprisingly enough, sentiment lexicon generated from large News corpus exhibits a satisfactory performance when tested on annotated product and movie reviews despite that the later two have different contexts, bearing similarity to the notion of Transfer Learning [1] reported in the literature.

To address the limitation, we propose a unified eyeglass removal model called Eyeglasses Removal Generative Adversarial Network (ERGAN), which could handle different types of glasses in the wild. The proposed method does not depend on the dense annotation of eyeglasses location but benefits from the large-scale face images with weak annotations. Specifically, we study the two relevant tasks simultaneously, i.e., removing and wearing eyeglasses. Given two facial images with and without eyeglasses, the proposed model learns to swap the eye area in two faces. The generation mechanism focuses on the eye area and invades the difficulty of generating a new face.

To improve the discriminative capability and robustness of the ReID algorithm, we propose a novel end-to-end embedding adversarial learning network (EALN) that is capable of generating samples localized in the embedding space. Instead of selecting abundant hard negatives from the training set, which is extremely difficult if not impossible, with our embedding adversarial learning scheme, the automatically generated hard negative samples in the specified embedding space can greatly improve the capability of the network for discriminating similar vehicles. Moreover, the more challenging cross-view vehicle ReID problem, which requires the ReID algorithm to be robust with different query views, can also benefit from such a scheme based on the artificially generated cross-view samples. We demonstrate the promise of EALN through extensive experiments and show the effectiveness of hard negative and cross-view generation in facilitating vehicle ReID based on the comparisons with the state-of-the-art schemes.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30835224", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2019.2902112", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2919317477", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["29458263", "18863615", "662727", "52088854", "29910972", "3885908", "14143123", "2510693", "3330924", "7849657", "25311698", "14630024", "206592766", "2505895", "2843566", "1033682", "6258614", "9431917", "41191245", "10891011", "4497821", "3821235", "195667009", "9372251", "12088157", "3939996", "18871364", "52019590", "9757556", "3732882", "4773332", "51613467", "51611249", "19125570", "12803511", "1409719", "7577075", "211227", "206593710", "10627900", "1082740", "15876696", "5002792", "2057420", "1282515", "1277217", "11758569", "206770979", "9417016", "2683207", "4711865", "9757556", "980236", "206594692", "16516553", "6200260", "14124239", "2394187", "1396647", "12203312"], "inbound_citations": ["209319743", "173174872", "210165085", "209140322", "210023581", "207930172", "195822757", "199589453", "214624056", "209444354", "214623770", "212725257", "204837239", "202573035"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:73516403"}

The variation of groundwater levels at local scale and its continuous use for agriculture intensifies the demand for reliable groundwater information. However, groundwater levels are very dynamic and difficult to predict under traditional modeling approaches, and manual monitoring of wells is costly and time-consuming. Simplified but powerful machine learning models represent a practical alternative to support groundwater management decisions at the farm scale. The predictive capacity of a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector regression (SVR) trained with a radial basis function (RBF) algorithm were evaluated for an irrigation well located in a highly productive agricultural region in the southeastern USA. We used separately multiple years of daily historical time series classified by summer (withdrawal) and winter (recharge) seasons and evaluated the impacts of this division in the models\u2019 predictive capability. Results showed that SVR had a better modeling performance based on the mean squared error (MSE) and prediction trend for both seasons. In addition, our study suggests that the prediction of daily levels with input time series classified by seasons provides higher accuracy than using the entire withdrawal and recharge periods as a whole. Results also indicate that the recharge season becomes a linear problem, which substantially reduces the SVR modeling computational requirements.

Hence, there is significant interest in the development of computational methods for reliable prediction of O-Glycosylation sites from amino acid sequences. One particular challenge in training the classifiers comes from the fact that the available dataset is highly imbalanced, which makes the classification performance for the minority class becomes unsatisfactory. Traditional sampling approaches generally rely on random re-sampling from a given dataset. However, these methods cannot utilize all the information available in the training set and it increases the false positive rate. This paper proposes a new approach for predicting the O-glycosylation sites which is based on Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) and Random Forest (RF). PSO is used as evolutionary under-sampling technique for balancing the dataset, and Random Forest is used as a classifier. The results obtained from the proposed approach and other related researches, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the performance of other approaches for the experimented dataset.

When addressing this problem with synthetic modeling, the conventional idea prevalent in artificial intelligence and cognitive science, generally, is to assume hybrid systems and corresponding neural network models, where higher order cognition is realized by means of symbolic representation and lower sensory-motor processes by analog processing. However, the crucial problem with such approaches is that the symbols represented at higher order cognitive levels cannot be grounded naturally in sensory-motor reality. The former are defined in a discrete space without any metric, and the latter are defined in a continuous space with a physical metric. These, therefore, cannot directly interact with each other, regardless of the interface that is assigned between them. The proposal in the current paper is to reconstruct higher order cognition by means of continuous neurodynamic systems that can elaborate delicate interactions with the sensory-motor level while sharing the same metric space. Our neurorobotics experiments-including language-action associations and the learning of goal-directed actions-show that the compositionality necessary for higher order cognitive tasks can be acquired by means of self-organizing dynamic structures, via interactive learning between the top-down intentional process of acting on the physical world and the bottom-up recognition of perceptual reality.

This paper attempts to deal with these issues by utilizing neural networks in the context of pattern classification application. First, a multilayer perceptron neural network with the mean squared error as a cost function is implemented to calculate, for each information source, posteriori probabilities for all classes. Second, an evidence structure construction scheme is developed for transferring the estimated posteriori probabilities to a set of masses along with the corresponding focal elements, from a Bayesian decision point of view. Third, a network realization of the Dempster-Shafer evidential reasoning is designed and analyzed, and it is further extended to a DSET-based neural network, referred to as DSETNN, to manipulate the evidence structures. In order to tackle the issue of dependence between sources, DSETNN is tuned for optimal performance through a supervised learning process.

We incorporate hierarchical semantic inference with memory mechanism on the utterance modeling.

In SFP, fault prediction is based on software metrics that reflect any aspect of the software, where coupling is one of them. Software coupling is one such metric, which is a measure of the interdependency of software modules. Coupling induces complexity in the coupled module and makes it difficult to comprehend. Eventually, more coupled modules are likely to be faultier. This spurs a need to evaluate the impact of coupling exclusively, on fault proneness. Since, coupling by inheritance is harmless, as it promotes reusability, so coupling through inheritance is not considered. We evaluated seven coupling metrics on 87 different publicly available datasets. After pre-processing, selected datasets are split with all possible coupling metrics. Resulting 474 split datasets are used for the experiments. These datasets have only coupling metrics and nominal-binary class labels. Model building and validation are done for Support Vector Machine. Results of entropy-loss shows that coupling metrics are good predictors of faults in software. Furthermore, {Coupling Between Objects, Design Complexity, Fan-in} outperform the rest of the 30 feature set. Finally, coupling metrics are ranked by keeping in view their position achieved and the number of accompanying metrics. This declares Efferent Coupling as the best coupling metric with respect to the other six coupling metrics in 474 datasets.

Medical images such as Mammogram, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and microscopic images are the common method for cancer diagnosis. Recently, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been used to help physicians in cancer diagnosis so that the diagnosis accuracy can be improved. CAD can help in decreasing missed cancer lesions due to physician fatigue, reducing the burden of workload and data overloading, and decreasing variability of inter- and intra-readers of images. In this research, a framework of CAD systems for cancer diagnosis based on medical images has been proposed. The proposed work helps physicians in detection of suspicion regions using different medical images modalities and in classifying the detected suspicious regions as normal or abnormal with the highest possible accuracy. The proposed framework of CAD system consists of four stages which are: preprocessing, segmentation of regions of interest, feature extraction and selection, and finally classification. In this research, the framework has been applied on blood smear images to diagnose the cases as normal or abnormal for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cases. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has been used to select the subsets of features from the features extracted from segmented cell parts which can maximize the classification performance as possible. Different classifiers which are Decision Tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been applied.

Social networks are platforms that ease communication between users by means of different interactions. Unfortunately, social networks have also become places for hate speech proliferation. Hate Speech has become a popular topic in recent years. This is reflected not only by the increased media coverage of this problem but also by the growing political attention it is receiving. Given the constant progression of this phenomenon, institutions, international minorities associations, researchers and social networks are trying to react as quickly as possible. Because of the massive scale of the social networks, methods that automatically detect hate speech are required. Natural Language Processing (NLP) focusing specifically on this phenomenon is required since basic word filters do not provide a sufficient remedy: a hate speech utterance might be influenced by aspects such us the domain, context, co-occurrence media objects (images, video, audio), etc. This thesis is the result of a project whose main aim has been to obtain a hate speech detector with a multilingual perspective, in order to remove all shape of hate speech that can occur in social networks, independently the origin language. During the development phase, there have been used supervised machine learning tools, NLP techniques, and Python as programming language. The proposed system is evaluated against two study cases, a participation in a internationally recognized competition, such as SemEval and facing the system against a Transfer Learning challenge across languages and hate speech traits.

This is the reason why we investigate the implementation of Support Vector Machines to perform the task. A family of multi-class SVMs is introduced.

The proposed hybrid evolutionary segmentation algorithm which is the combination of WFF(weighted firefly) and K-means algorithm called WFF-K-means and modified cuckoo search (MCS) and K-means algorithm called MCS-K-means, which can find better cluster partition in brain tumor datasets and also overcome local optima problems in K-means clustering algorithm.

Connectionist systems, such as artificial neural networks, can be implemented to considerable advantage for the solution of optimization problems such as these and in this paper their use is explored.

However, complicated etiologies such as gene-gene interactions are ignored by the univariate analysis usually applied in these studies. Random Forests (RF) are a popular data-mining technique that can accommodate a large number of predictor variables and allow for complex models with interactions. RF analysis produces measures of variable importance that can be used to rank the predictor variables. Thus, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis using RFs is gaining popularity as a potential filter approach that considers interactions in high-dimensional data. However, the impact of data dimensionality on the power of RF to identify interactions has not been thoroughly explored. We investigate the ability of rankings from variable importance measures to detect gene-gene interaction effects and their potential effectiveness as filters compared to p-values from univariate logistic regression, particularly as the data becomes increasingly high-dimensional.ResultsRF effectively identifies interactions in low dimensional data. As the total number of predictor variables increases, probability of detection declines more rapidly for interacting SNPs than for non-interacting SNPs, indicating that in high-dimensional data the RF variable importance measures are capturing marginal effects rather than capturing the effects of interactions.ConclusionsWhile RF remains a promising data-mining technique that extends univariate methods to condition on multiple variables simultaneously, RF variable importance measures fail to detect interaction effects in high-dimensional data in the absence of a strong marginal component, and therefore may not be useful as a filter technique that allows for interaction effects in genome-wide data.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3463421", "pubmed_id": "22793366", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-13-164", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2087200541", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["15032294", "205218517", "7529644", "12180085", "276923", "1440638", "5922358", "16162039", "15503502", "46441849", "52874011", "21029222", "18401995", "13498219", "15245447", "8397120", "2977201", "207738357", "60993494", "8529157", "12206069", "55311", "1290347", "15970251", "6335612", "1568181", "14463568", "7436645", "17769642", "13415760"], "inbound_citations": ["13226148", "90137205", "54560040", "8930181", "128345633", "105122", "17511685", "215396313", "25835998", "214326978", "20473112", "14544352", "11316340", "7583918", "214942893", "18637993", "215143708", "215624449", "53208154", "433384", "15850826", "215529601", "7307687", "36458165", "16262834", "18729171", "6942279", "2024683", "6182698", "29171024", "91077472", "8762837", "13426968", "16107744", "46484440", "34752799", "14335158", "6150551", "215628171", "49321106", "9413894", "52161488", "71146979", "6585389", "215179659", "215584756", "54018471", "52290226"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2130307"}

In this paper, we investigate another technique on spectral feature selection, which is unsupervised band selection (BS). We find out that using selected bands as spectral features can improve classification performance because they contain more critical characteristics for classification; in particular, using the selected bands, combined with the MPs extracted from PCs, can yield the highest accuracy, due to the fact that major PCs contain less noise for extracting more reliable MPs. The overall unsupervised nature of feature selection provides the flexibility of implementation.

To understand the biology of these organisms, it is necessary to be able to predict the subcellular localisation of their proteins but this is not straightforward, particularly in photosynthetic heterokonts which possess a complex chloroplast, acquired as the result of a secondary endosymbiosis. This is because the bipartite target peptides that deliver proteins to these chloroplasts can be easily confused with the signal peptides of secreted proteins, causing currently available algorithms to make erroneous predictions. HECTAR, a subcellular targeting prediction method which takes into account the specific properties of heterokont proteins, has been developed to address this problem.ResultsHECTAR is a statistical prediction method designed to assign proteins to five different categories of subcellular targeting: Signal peptides, type II signal anchors, chloroplast transit peptides, mitochondrion transit peptides and proteins which do not possess any N-terminal target peptide. The recognition rate of HECTAR is 96.3%, with Matthews correlation coefficients ranging from 0.67 to 0.95. The method is based on a hierarchical architecture which implements the divide and conquer approach to identify the different possible target peptides one at a time. At each node of the hierarchy, the most relevant outputs of various existing subcellular prediction methods are combined by a Support Vector Machine.ConclusionThe HECTAR method is able to predict the subcellular localisation of heterokont proteins with high accuracy. It also efficiently predicts the subcellular localisation of proteins from cryptophytes, a group that is phylogenetically close to the heterokonts. A variant of HECTAR, called HECTARSEC, can be used to identify signal peptide and type II signal anchor sequences in proteins from any eukaryotic organism.

The algorithm was validated on 131 dual-chamber ICD shock episodes from 127 patients adjudicated by seven electrophysiologists (EPs). Episodes were classified by panel consensus as ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) or non-VT/VF, with the resulting classifications used as the reference. Subsequently, each episode electrogram (EGM) data was randomly assigned to three EPs without the atrial lead information, and to three EPs with the atrial lead information.

The odds of accurate adjudication, after adjusting for covariates, did not significantly differ between the algorithm and EP consensus (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 0.97\u20131.06). ::: ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: ::: This algorithm performs at a level comparable to an EP panel in the adjudication of arrhythmia episodes treated by both dual- and single-chamber ICDs.

Therefore, a variety of machine learning methods have been studied for graph data analysis. Although many of those learning methods depend on the measurement of differences between input graphs, defining an appropriate distance metric for a graph remains a controversial issue. Hence, we propose a supervised distance metric learning method for the graph classification problem. Our method, named interpretable graph metric learning (IGML), learns discriminative metrics in a subgraph-based feature space, which has a strong graph representation capability. By introducing a sparsity-inducing penalty on a weight of each subgraph, IGML can identify a small number of important subgraphs that can provide insight about the given classification task. Since our formulation has a large number of optimization variables, an efficient algorithm is also proposed by using pruning techniques based on safe screening and working set selection methods. An important property of IGML is that the optimality of the solution is guaranteed because the problem is formulated as a convex problem and our pruning strategies only discard unnecessary subgraphs. Further, we show that IGML is also applicable to other structured data such as item-set and sequence data, and that it can incorporate vertex-label similarity by using a transportation-based subgraph feature. We empirically evaluate the computational efficiency and classification performance on several benchmark datasets and show some illustrative examples demonstrating that IGML identifies important subgraphs from a given graph dataset.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2002.00727", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3003216575", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3827699", "2706742", "15483870", "14223048", "1550330", "961425", "1357916", "15740351", "16262476", "2261947", "1690180", "3116168", "15413966", "11336685", "10856944", "16098400", "14492800", "951389", "13675759", "15129710", "1199444", "11276629", "8479149", "8790929", "32985023", "47001915", "9725578", "11894600", "1192563", "51704583", "65142907", "3359226", "9875583", "9148490", "15045931", "18992012", "1430801", "18935600", "15486265", "206782042", "1439631", "17745373", "7646367", "3523290", "13044495", "1901669", "17557614", "17648673", "2427807", "5830813", "59523642", "46819432", "1081340", "47325215", "14843483", "10118968", "207227372", "50771004", "196194297", "50771004", "4770492", "8587632", "2976827", "52180411"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211011273"}

Facial expressions are a powerful tool that communicates a person's emotional state and subsequently his/her intentions. Compared to 2D face images, 3D face images offer more granular cues that are not available in the 2D images. However, one major setback of 3D faces is that they impose a higher dimensionality than 2D faces. In this paper, we attempt to address this problem by proposing a fully automatic 3D facial expression recognition model that tackles the high dimensionality problem in a twofold solution. First, we transform the 3D faces into the 2D plane using conformal mapping. Second, we propose a Differential Evolution (DE) based optimization algorithm to select the optimal facial feature set and the classifier parameters simultaneously. The optimal features are selected from a pool of Speed Up Robust Features (SURF) descriptors of all the prospective facial points. The proposed model yielded an average recognition accuracy of 79% using the Bosphorus database and 79.36% using the BU-3DFE database. In addition, we exploit the facial muscular movements to enhance the probability estimation (PE) of Support Vector Machine (SVM).

In CCG supertagging the major challenging problem is due to the large number of lexical categories. To address this, machine learning and deep learning methods have been used and achieved promising results. However, these models whether use many hand-crafted features case of machine learning methods or use sentence level representation processing a sequence without any correlations between labels in neighborhoods which have great influences on predicting the current label case of deep learning models. More recently, there is a marriage of machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we use the combination of Conditional Random Field and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory models. So first the model learns sentence representation where we can gain from both past and future input features thanks to Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks architecture. Afterward, the model uses sentence level tag information thanks to Conditional Random Field model. By combining Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Conditional Random Field (BLSTM-CRF) models, we evaluate our model on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, and in both cases achieve (or close to) state-of-the-art results on CCG supertagging task.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2017.12.050", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2776461464", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["51894127", "52896703"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:41378510"}

It can be regarded as a visual retrieval task, namely given a query person image, ranking all gallery images according to their similarities to the query. Conventionally, this similarity function is learnt by forcing intra-distances to be small while inter-distances to be large, which are referred to as individual similarity constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn the similarity function by taking into account of both individual similarity constraints and contextual similarity constraints. The context of a query is defined as its k-nearest neighbors in the gallery. We argue that if two images are from the same person, apart from the visual likeness between them, denoted as the individual similarity, they should also possess similar k-nearest neighbors in the gallery, denoted as the contextual similarity. Motivated by this assumption, we propose a new Contextual Similarity Regularized Metric Learning (CSRML) method for person re-identification. The contextual similarity regularization term forces two images of the same person to share similar context. Both individual and contextual similarity constraints are encoded by a large margin logistic loss function and the final problem is solved by the stochastic gradient descent algorithm.

A hypothetical model is presented in which both conditions are explained. The basic organization of the oculomotor system is most likely monocular and synchronous eye movements may have developed by neuronal coupling of the symmetrical oculomotor structures. The vertical dissociation of both eye movement disorders is explained by insufficiently developed neuronal coupling between the superior colliculi.

Traditional state-of-the-art learning methods, however, require a large amount of training data, and their online learning capabilities are usually limited. Therefore, we propose a modality-specific selection of convolutional neural networks (CNN), pre-trained or fine-tuned, in combination with a classifier that is designed particularly for online learning from data streams, namely the Mondrian Forest (MF). We show that this combination of trained features obtained from a CNN can be improved further if a feature selection algorithm is applied. In our experiments, we use the resulting features both with a MF and a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Although, in fact, 90% of compounds that give a positive Ames test cause cancer in laboratory animals, a good proportion of compounds that give a negative Ames test are also carcinogens; that is, there is no good correlation between carcinogenicity and negative Ames test results. As an alternative to these two approaches, we have tried applying toxicogenomics to predict the carcinogenicity of a compound from the gene expression profile induced in vivo. To establish our model, male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered test compounds (12 hepatocarcinogens and 26 non-hepatocarcinogens) for 28 days. Analysis of liver gene expression data by Support Vector Machines (SVM) dividing compounds into 'for training' and 'for test' (20 cases assigned randomly) allowed a set of marker genes to be tested for prediction of hepatocarcinogenicity. The developed prediction model was then validated with reference to the concordance rate with training data and test data, and a good performance was obtained.

In this paper, reinforcement learning (RL) method was utilized to find optimal series of actions to localize the goal region. The visual data, a set of images, is high dimensional unstructured data and needs to be represented efficiently to get a robust detector. Different deep Reinforcement models have already been used to localize a goal but most of them take long time to learn the model. This long learning time results from the weights fine tuning stage that is applied iteratively to find an accurate model. Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (H-ELM) was used as a fast deep model that doesn't fine tune the weights. In other words, hidden weights are generated randomly and output weights are calculated analytically. H-ELM algorithm was used in this work to find good features for effective representation. This paper proposes a combination of Hierarchical Extreme learning machine and Reinforcement learning to find an optimal policy directly from visual input.

Moreover, soil heavy metal pollution was assessed using support vector machines(SVM). By comparing to Hakanson index and Nemerow pollution index, we discussed the applicability of support vector machines in soil heavy metal pollution evaluation. Results showed that:(1) The variation coefficient of Hg and Pb were 0.648 and 0.409 respectively. Maximum variation coefficients of Hg and Pb were 19.5 and 4.94 times of the minimum. Contents of Hg and Pb were highly heterogeneous in spatial distribution in Taiyuan. Except Ni element, average contents of each element were higher than their corresponding background values in Taiyuan, but are under the secondary standard value.(2) The evaluation results of Nemerow comprehensive pollution index, Hakanson potential ecological risk index, and SVM methods have no great difference.

The evaluation results of Hakanson potential ecological risk index and SVM was 65% identical.(3) Further analysis of samples with different evaluation results showed that the evaluation results of SVM were more accurate. Comparing to Nemerow comprehensive pollution index and Hakanson potential ecological risk index, SVM could reduce the impact of man's subjective judgment to the evaluation result.

Prior work has attempted to mitigate these problems by using sensor-based machine learning approaches to statistically model energy consumption, applying the techniques primarily to commercial building data, which makes use of hourly consumption data. It is unclear, however, whether these techniques can translate to residential buildings, since the energy usage patterns may vary significantly. Until now, most residential modeling research only had access to monthly electrical consumption data. In this article, we report on the evaluation of seven different machine learning algorithms applied to a new residential data set that contains sensor measurements collected every 15 min, with the objective of determining which techniques are most successful for predicting next hour residential building consumption. We first validate each learner's correctness on the ASHRAE Great Energy Prediction Shootout, confirming existing conclusions that Neural Network-based methods perform best on commercial buildings.

The purpose of this research was to predict internal browning defect quantitatively and qualitatively in apple, by a non-destructive equipment from spectra collected before the disorder develops. In order to obtain a broad expression of the disorder in severity and incidence, fruit treated and non-treated with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) were studied under three temperature regimes: T1) pre-cooled with forced air at \u22121 \u00b0C for 24 h and subsequently stored for 149 d at 0 \u00b0C; T2) placed directly at 0 \u00b0C and stored for 150 d; and T3) stored for 90 d at 5 \u00b0C then for 60 d at 0 \u00b0C. Every fruit was subjected to semi-transmittance spectral analysis between 100\u20131,100 nm at 0, 60, 90, 120 and 150 d of storage and matched with the presence and severity of internal browning. The disorder was quantified using image analysis in one half of cut fruit at the end of the 150 d plus 7 d at 20 \u00b0C (157 d) after verification that the damage was not evident in fruit stored before 120 d. Quantitative Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR) model satisfactorily predicted the percentage of internal browning area per fruit shown after 157 d, as early as 90 d of storage with R2 \u223c0.70, and a root mean square error for calibration (RMSEC) and prediction (RMSEP) datasets of \u223c18% and \u223c15% respectively. On the other hand, qualitative Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) model was able to predict the damaged fruit at the onset of storage (0 d) and to reach an accuracy values \u223c87% in calibration and test datasets, and 12% of misclassified fruit at 90 d. Quantitative and qualitative neural network models were also evaluated, reaching similar correlation coefficients, in cross validation or accuracy rate as multivariable models did, offering a novel way for modelling biological processes.

Usually, recognizing a child with ASD needs the diagnosis by professional doctors. However, it is not only expensive and time-consuming, but also the results are influenced by subjective factors, such as the experience of a doctor. Recently, some methods which identify ASD based on biomarkers have been developed, but there are rarely works specific to raw video data. This paper is the first attempt to help diagnose the children with ASD in raw video data using a deep learning technique. Firstly, in order to investigate different gaze patterns between ASD children and typically developing (TD) children, we track the eye movement in each video by the tracking-learning-detection method. Secondly, we divide these tracking trajectories into two components: (i) the length; and (ii) the angle. Afterwards, we calculate an accumulative histogram for each component. Finally, we adopt three-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for classification. Experimental results on our extended dataset (Ext-Dataset) containing 272 videos captured from 136 ASD children and 136 TD children show the LSTM network outperforms the traditional machine learning methods, e.g., Support Vector Machine, with the improvement of accuracy by 6.2% (from 86.4% to 92.6%).

Many complications were faced because of the numerous characteristics of big data; some of them include complexity, value, variability, variety, velocity, and volume. The objective of this paper is to implement classification techniques using the map reduce framework using fuzzy and crisp methods, also to arrange for a study that can compare and contrast the outcomes of the suggested systems against the methods appraised in the documented works. For this research the applied method for the fuzzy technique is the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor, and for the non-fuzzy techniques both the support vector machine and the k-nearest neighbor are used. The use of the map reduce paradigm is applied to be able to process big data. We also implemented an integrated system using the Support Vector Machine with the fuzzy soft label and Gaussian fuzzy membership. Results show that fuzzy k-nearest neighbor classifier gives higher accuracy but it takes a lot of time in classification compared to the other techniques.

Due to the way that FBM considers point correspondences based on the similarity of feature descriptors, a considerable number of mismatches (outliers) can be anticipated, especially with increasing angles of convergence between images. For the critical component of initial Relative Orientation, it is essential that outliers are detected and largely removed from the matched point data.

Even though many research and works have been done in the Named Entity Recognition, there is still room available for improvement. This paper proposed to increase the accuracy of entities detected by implementing anaphora resolution during the preprocessing phase and a hybrid approach to classify the detected tokens during the classification phase. The hybrid approach is combined the Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifier with a gazetteer and pattern rules to perform classification. The result has shown that the application of anaphora and gazetteer has increased 46% accuracy of the detected entities for the person class.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-22868-2_60", "venue": "Intelligent Computing", "journal": "Intelligent Computing", "mag_id": "2959570648", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199019632"}

While a plethora of downscaling models have been applied successfully to mid\u2010latitude regions, a few studies are available on tropical regions where the atmosphere is known to have more complex behavior. In this paper, a support vector machine (SVM) approach is proposed for statistical downscaling to interpret climate change signals provided by GCMs over tropical regions of India. Climate variables affecting spatio\u2010temporal variation of precipitation at each meteorological sub\u2010division of India are identified. Following this, cluster analysis is applied on climate data to identify the wet and dry seasons in each year. The data pertaining to climate variables and precipitation of each meteorological sub\u2010division is then used to develop SVM based downscaling model for each season. Subsequently, the SVM based downscaling model is applied to future climate predictions from the second generation Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM2) to assess the impact of climate change on hydrological inputs to the meteorological sub\u2010divisions.

Attacking ML, the brain of driverless cars, can cause catastrophes. This paper proposes a novel approach to attack CAV by fooling its ML model. Using adversarial examples in CAVs, the work demonstrates how adversarial machine learning can generate attacks hardly detectable by current ML classifiers for CAV misbehavior detection. First, adversarial datasets are generated by a traditional attack engine, which CAV misbehavior detection ML models can easily detect. Building attack ML model takes two phases: training and testing. Using supervised learning, Phase I trains the model on the time-series data, converted from the adversarial datasets. Phase II tests the model, which leads, for the next round of model improvement. The initial round deploys K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, respectively. The next round, guided by deep learning (DL) models, uses Logistic Regression (LG) of neural network and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) of recurrent neural network. The results, in precision-recall (PR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, validate the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial ML models. This work reveals the vulnerability in ML.

Annual maps of ISA proportion were generated and showed an average increase of 30.65 km2/year over 13 years. For comparison, a series of RF per-pixel classifications were also developed from the same reference data using a Boolean class constructed from different thresholds of ISA proportion. Results from per-pixel models varied when such thresholds change, suggesting difficulty of estimation of actual ISAs. This research demonstrated the advantages of spatio-temporal sub-pixel analysis for annual ISAs mapping and addresses the problem associated with definitions of thresholds in per-pixel approaches.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs8020143", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2285824784", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["155000050", "154893399", "84066457", "140170806", "140576542", "55088870", "13334541", "14181655", "129830932", "55031054", "59468758", "21081331", "14785487", "229028", "129925664", "128963904", "131686367", "130189569", "122054623", "9392006", "16410519", "122928956", "129759960", "122003194", "73584534", "131726029", "129110765", "1912153", "62739295", "131528125", "129022625", "121992022", "17179945", "42418443", "53135850", "154513595", "128173714", "131384917", "131108162", "11451672", "7290098", "55850723", "129649701", "89141", "3093707", "39361255", "123476171", "54681072", "140621833", "46409796", "53972834", "14498938", "44835084", "15880372", "62802501", "129308726", "124344703", "160018749"], "inbound_citations": ["202729909", "59234786", "54478417", "4876967", "158494106", "30803915", "133969951", "133400126", "125889592"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5754770"}

There are much diverse characteristics for component trees in TC trained on data of noise, huge categories and features. Consequently, given numerous component trees from the original Random Forests, we propose a novel method, Diversity Random Forests, which diversely and adaptively select and combine tree classifiers with diversity learning and sample weighting.

First, by designing a matrix for the data distribution creatively, we formulate a unified optimization model for learning and selecting diverse trees, where tree weights are learned through a convex quadratic programming problem with given sample weights.

Considering the expensive training cost of evolving routing policies for UCARP, a promising strategy is to learn and reuse knowledge from a previous problem solving process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of solving a new related problem, i.e. transfer learning. Since none of the existing GP transfer methods have been used as a hyper-heuristic in solving UCARP, we conduct a comprehensive study to investigate the behaviour of the existing GP transfer methods for evolving routing policy in UCARP, and identify the potentials of existing methods. The results suggest that the existing methods applying subtree transfer cannot scale well to environment changes and cannot be adapted for this purpose. However, applying GP transfer methods is a good option for creating a better initial populations on target domain and though this effect does not last, we can obtain comparable results in the target domain in a much shorter time.

In this paper, a new technique for prostate tissue characterization is developed. The proposed system is composed of four stages. The first stage is automatically identifying Regions Of Interest (ROIs). This is achieved using the Gabor multiresolution analysis method, where preliminary regions are identified using the frequency response of the pixels, pixels that have the same response to the same filter are assigned to the same cluster. Next, the radiologist knowledge is integrated to the system to select the most suspicious ROIs among the prelimianry identified regions. The second stage is constructing the spectral features from the identified ROIs. The proposed technique is based on a novel spectral feature set for the TRUS images using the Total Least Square Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (TLS-ESPRIT).

It is a challenging issue against inconsistent illumination, partial occlusion, changing background and shifting viewpoint, because considerable variations are exhibited by diversified real world patterns. The virtue of feature fusion lies in its reliability and capability for object recognition in terms of actual redundancy and complementary information. In this paper, we have developed an efficient hybrid approach using scale invariant features and machine learning techniques for object recognition. We extract the scale invariant features, namely color, shape and texture of the objects, separately with tile aid of suitable feature extraction techniques. Then, we integrate the color, shape and texture features of tile objects at the feature level, so as to improve the recognition performance. The fused feature set serves as a pattern for the forthcoming processes involved in the developed approach. Subsequently, we hybridize the process of object recognition by combining the pattern recognition algorithms like Support Vector Machine, Discriminant Canonical Correlation, and Locality Preserving Projections. Obviously, with three different pattern recognition algorithms employed, we are likely to get three distinct or identical results enumbered with false positives. So in order to reduce the number of false positives, we devise a decision module based on Neural Networks that takes in the match percentage from the chosen pattern recognition algorithms, and then decides the recognition result based on those match values. Our approach is evaluated on the Amsterdam Library of Object Images collection, a large collection of object images containing 1000 objects recorded under various imaging circumstances. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for combining color, shape and texture features.

In our method, the margin of sample is first defined with respect to the nearest hits (nearest neighbors from the same class) and the nearest misses (nearest neighbors from the different classes), and then the simplex-preserving linear transformation is trained by maximizing the margin while minimizing the distance between each sample and its nearest hits.

In highly modified anthromes, the spatial distribution of natural vegetation types is often unknown or coarsely represented challenging comparative analyses seeking to assess changes in biodiversity and potential downstream effects on ecosystem processes and functions. In this context, the objectives of this study were to construct a multi-resolution representation of potential natural vegetation at four hierarchical classification levels of increasing floristic and physiognomic detail for the state of Minnesota, USA. Using a collection of natural/near-natural vegetation releves, a series of Random Forest classification models were used to project the potential distribution of natural vegetation types based on their association with a variety of environmental variables. Model performance varied within and between classification levels with overall accuracy ranging between 64\u201399% (kappa 0.44\u20130.99). Model performance tended to decrease and become more variable with increasing floristic complexity at finer classification levels. Classwise performance metrics including precision and sensitivity were also reported. A method for exploring potential class confusion resulting from niche overlap using Random Forest proximities and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling is demonstrated. Collectively, the results presented here provide an analytically supported baseline representation of potential natural vegetation for the state of Minnesota, USA.

Nowadays, Random Forest (RF) algorithm has been successfully applied for reducing high dimensional and multi-source data in many scientific realms. Our aim was to explore the state of the art of the application of RF on single and multi-modal neuroimaging data for the prediction of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Methods: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted on this field of study. In particular, we constructed an advanced query using boolean operators as follows: (\"random forest\" OR \"random forests\") AND neuroimaging AND (\"alzheimer's disease\" OR alzheimer's OR alzheimer) AND (prediction OR classification). The query was then searched in four well-known scientific databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science. Results: Twelve articles \u2013 published between the 2007 and 2017 - have been included in this systematic review after a quantitative and qualitative selection. The lesson learnt from these works suggest that when RF was applied on multi-modal data for prediction of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) conversion from the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), it produces one of the best accuracies to date. Moreover, the RF has important advantages in terms of robustness to overfitting, ability to handle highly non-linear data, stability in the presence of outliers and opportunity for efficient parallel processing mainly when applied on multi-modality neuroimaging data, such as MRI morphometric, diffusion tensor imaging and PET images. Conclusions: We discussed the strengths of RF, considering also possible limitations and by encouraging further studies on the comparisons of this algorithm with other commonly used classification approaches, particularly in the early prediction of the progression from MCI to AD.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5635046", "pubmed_id": "29056906", "doi": "10.3389/fnagi.2017.00329", "venue": "Front.

Given a corrupted image with missing values, we use back-propagation on this loss to map the corrupted image to a smaller latent space. The mapped vector is then passed through the generative model to predict the missing content. The proposed framework is evaluated on the CelebA and SVHN datasets for two challenging inpainting tasks with random 80% corruption and large blocky corruption.

However, in this paper, we show how this capability can lead to an inherent \"absent levels\" problem for decision tree based methods that has never been thoroughly discussed, and whose consequences have never been carefully explored. This problem occurs whenever there is an indeterminacy over how to handle an observation that has reached a categorical split which was determined when the observation in question's level was absent during training. Although these incidents may appear to be innocuous, by using Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler's random forests FORTRAN code and the randomForest R package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002) as motivating case studies, we examine how overlooking the absent levels problem can systematically bias a model. Furthermore, by using three real data examples, we illustrate how absent levels can dramatically alter a model's performance in practice, and we empirically demonstrate how some simple heuristics can be used to help mitigate the effects of the absent levels problem until a more robust theoretical solution is found.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1706.03492", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Journal of Machine Learning Research 19(45):1-30, 2018", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2626134199,2963705386,2952126538", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12470146", "14463568", "1290347", "207738357", "17166335", "89141", "144565557", "207159665", "8758844", "120138631", "206420153", "6629692", "6074128", "2003897", "3093707", "120681576", "153160033", "28528", "28528", "5262555", "60893971", "6537941", "119899999", "2185396"], "inbound_citations": ["59943856", "128316570", "53747370", "209832416", "210976552", "214690941", "215250889"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5808271"}

It is well known that biological databases are large both in size and number, hence data processing technologies are required for the fast and effective management of the contents stored in databases like MEDLINE. A possible solution for content management is the application of natural language processing methods to help make this task easier. ::: ::: With our approach we would like to learn more about the interactions of human genes using full-sentence parsing. Given a sentence, the syntactic parser assigns to it a syntactic structure, which consists of a set of labelled links connecting pairs of words. The parser also produces a constituent representation of a sentence (showing noun phrases, verb phrases, and so on). Here we show experimentally that using the syntactic information of each abstract, the biological interactions of genes can be predicted. Hence, it is worth developing the kind of information extraction (IE) system that can retrieve information about gene interactions just by using syntactic information contained in these text. Our IE system can handle certain types of gene interactions with the help of machine learning (ML) methodologies (Hidden Markov Models, Artificial Neural Networks, Decision \"Frees, Support Vector Machines).

This increasing popularity in online banking services and payment systems has created motivation for financial attackers to steal customer`s credentials and money. Banking trojans have been a way of committing attacks on these financial institutions for more than a decade, and they have become one of the primary drivers of botnet traffic. However, the stealthy nature of financial botnets requires new techniques and novel systems for detection and analysis in order to prevent losses and to ultimately take the botnets down. TrickBot, which specifically threatens businesses in the financial sector and their customers, has been behind man-in-the-browser attacks since 2016. Its main goal is to steal online banking information from victims when they visit their banking websites. In this study, we utilize machine learning techniques to detect TrickBot malware infections and to identify TrickBot related traffic flows without having to analyze network packet payloads, the IP addresses, port numbers and protocol information. Since command and control server IPs are updated almost daily, identification of TrickBot related traffic flows without looking at specific IP addresses is significant. We adopt behavior-based classification that uses artifacts created by the malware during the dynamic analysis of TrickBot malware samples. We compare the performance results of four different state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, Sequential Minimal Optimization, Multilayer Perceptron, and Logistic Model to identify TrickBot related flows and detect a TrickBot infection. Then, we optimize the proposed classifier via exploring the best hyperparameter and feature set selection.

METHOD: Forty subjects with varying degrees of suicidal ideation and behavior severity (from not present to extremely severe) were recruited from inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings. Each patient was interviewed using all three scales (InterSePT Scale for Suicidal Thinking-Plus, the Sheehan-Suicidality Tracking Scale, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale) on the same day. The scales were administered in a random sequence by three independent raters who were blind to the ratings on the other scales. RESULTS: The Sheehan-Suicidality Tracking Scale and the InterSePT Scale for Suicidal Thinking-Plus show acceptable agreement with the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale in detecting the presence or absence of the 2012 Food and Drug Administration-Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment categories 1, 5, 6, 10, and 11 (passive ideation; active ideation with method, intent, and plan; completed suicide; preparatory actions; and self-injurious behavior) but not of categories 2, 3, and 4 (3 other active suicidal ideation combination categories) or to 8 and 9 (aborted and interrupted attempt).

CONCLUSION: The results of this exploratory study invite discussion and debate about the validity of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale and its ability to accurately assess key active suicidal ideation categories, since it disagrees so much with the other two standardized scales that agree so closely with each other.

Furthermore, we obtained similar or better generalization accuracy with IGTree when trained on two complex linguistic tasks, viz. letter\u2013phoneme transliteration and part-of-speech-tagging, when compared to alternative lazy learning and decision tree approaches (viz., IB1, information-gain-weighted IB1, and C4.5). A third experiment, with the task of word hyphenation, demonstrates that when the mutual differences in information gain of features is too small, IGTree as well as information-gain-weighted IB1 perform worse than IB1.
