Recently, conditional random field (CRF) is drawn renewed interest, and is exploited in this field. However, when utilizing a CRF with unary and pairwise potentials having essential parameters, most existing methods only employ manually designed parameters, or learn parameters partly for the unary potentials. Observing that the saliency estimation is a continuous labeling issue, this paper proposes a novel data-driven scheme based on a special CRF framework, the so-called continuous CRF (C-CRF), where parameters for both unary and pairwise potentials are jointly learned. The proposed C-CRF learning provides an optimal way to integrate various unary saliency features with pairwise cues to discover salient objects. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first to completely learn a C-CRF for saliency detection. In addition, we propose a novel formulation of pairwise potentials that enables learning weights for different spatial ranges on a superpixel graph. The proposed C-CRF learning-based saliency model is tested on 6 benchmark datasets and compared with 11 existing methods. Our results and comparisons have provided further support to the proposed method in terms of precision-recall and F-measure. Furthermore, incorporating existing saliency models with pairwise cues through the C-CRF are shown to provide marked boosting performance over individual models.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TMM.2017.2679898", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Multimedia", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Multimedia", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2592997798", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["353246", "45203429", "3108956", "15611611", "18236666", "641747", "1334960", "2329405", "616155", "798346", "2068477", "9078758", "38223126", "18410012", "11766543", "1744852", "53245988", "1335365", "19607585", "32995770", "13751591", "14833979", "10024504", "6136598", "8233418", "2183998", "13153", "12493767", "242941", "5574079", "854969", "277918", "51862717", "14328811", "1223851", "16445820", "3095508", "9329209", "11823889", "883053", "16145705", "15012342", "1806278", "12495838", "5983183", "2203086", "12393310", "9146763", "12133116", "1677606", "6084399", "14455617", "10702897", "12832143", "15274272", "17561765", "45117773", "10482251", "6880311"], "inbound_citations": ["208193128", "54472424", "56597747", "67872040", "201880327", "68018780", "204819662", "70298336", "209500657", "46985707", "207894077", "69220707", "59526556"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30058718"}

This paper presents an active robot learning approach to facilitate the robots to develop the beliefs by actively collecting/discovering evidence they need. The emphasis is on active learning. Hence social cues and award functions are not necessary.

This paper investigates how churn can be predicted for an individual customer in an app-delivered international calling service (Rebtel). It also investigates which the underlying behavioral drivers of churn are and how these findings can be used to efficiently prolong the lifetime for customers using Rebtel\u2019s subscription services when calling to India. The method applied to identify churn is the machine learning algorithm Random Forest. It is found that the Random Forest algorithm is well suited for classifying which customers that are about to churn by identifying complex customer behavior patterns indicating that a certain customer is about to leave the service. When investigating individual customer features to isolate drivers of churn, the method of using the Random Forest algorithm is not the best suited approach and contributes with limited findings. The recommendations to Rebtel is that a churn prediction model implementing the Random Forest algorithm should be used to segment which users, among users calling to India, that should be incentivized to stay as customers in order to decrease churn.

Two of the typical tasks are makeup-invariant face verification and makeup transfer.

In this paper, we propose a disentangled feature learning strategy to fulfil both tasks in a single generative network. Overall, a makeup portrait can be decomposed into three components: makeup, identity and geometry (including expression, pose etc.). We assume that the extracted image representation can be decomposed into a makeup code that captures the makeup style and an identity code to preserve the source identity. As for other variation factors, we consider them as native structures from the source image that should be reserved. Thus a dense correspondence field is integrated in the network to preserve the geometry on a face. To encourage delightful visual results after makeup transfer, we propose a cosmetic loss to learn makeup styles in a delicate way. Finally, a new Cross-Makeup Face (CMF) benchmark dataset (https://github.com/ly-joy/Cross-Makeup-Face) with in-the-wild makeup portraits is built up to push the frontiers of related research.

Here, we developed the first method to distinguish EVlncRNAs from HTlncRNAs and mRNAs by using Support Vector Machines and found that EVlncRNAs can be well separated from HTlncRNAs and mRNAs with 0.6 for Matthews correlation coefficient, 64% for sensitivity, and 81% for precision for the independent human test set. The most discriminative features are related to sequence conservations at RNA (for separating from HTlncRNAs) and protein (for separating from mRNA) levels. The method is found to be robust as the human-RNA-trained model is applicable to independent mouse RNAs with similar accuracy and to a lesser extent to plant RNAs. The method can recover newly discovered EVlncRNAs with high sensitivity. Its application to randomly selected 2000 human HTlncRNAs indicates that a large number of functional lncRNAs are waiting to be validated. The method is expected to speed up and reduce the cost of the discovery by prioritizing potentially functional lncRNAs prior to experimental validation.

Preliminary data sets of eight kinds of samples are acquired by a home-built instrument using energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXRD) technology in a short detection time. Small sample size, poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high dimension of data make drugs identification a challenging problem. In this paper, the potential effective method solves the problem well. The spectral signal with poor SNR is obtained and processed with wavelet for feature extraction and then the wavelet coefficients are used as the inputs of SVMs. A multi-classifier of SVMs based on binary tree architecture (SVMs-BAT) is trained. The method of SVMs-BAT combined with wavelet-based feature extraction (WSVMs-BAT) is firstly compared with two methods: one is single SVMs-BAT which uses original data as inputs without preprocessing, the other is SVMs-BAT combined with feature extraction based on principal component analysis (PCA-SVMs-BAT). The high identification accuracy of WSVMs-BAT indicates that the method of feature extraction using wavelet can effectively represent the original data better. Then the recognition result of the proposed method is also compared with artificial neural network (ANN) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) methods. Our findings show that the proposed method combined with EDXRD technology provides a good access to achieve the aim of automatic identification of illicit drugs.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2012.06.016", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "mag_id": "2018757355", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16129711", "46360848", "56436695"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109224687"}

In the disease-vaccine interaction several aspects need to be taken into account to improve and understand the vaccine and for that reason different types of data need to be analyzed. Current assays technology allows analyzing several proteins simultaneously with a small blood volume. The combination of the medium throughput dataset of some assays and the small sample size of some malaria studies may hinder the use of classical statistical methods. In the context of low number of observations and medium or high number of variables the support vector machines (SVM) models are a powerful tool to analyze sparse data, i.e., data in which the number of predictors is larger or approximately equal to the number of observations, especially when handling binary outcomes. However, biomedical research often involves analysis of time-to-event outcomes. Several work has been done in the literature to deal with censored data into the SVM framework. Most of these methods are based on a support vector regression (SVR) approach and results found in the literature suggest no significant differences with Cox proportional hazards model and kernel Cox regression. Another perspective of dealing with SVM for survival analysis is a SVM for binary classification, however, almost no work has been done into this approach: only SVM learning using privileged information and SVM with uncertain classes have been described. This PhD thesis aims to propose alternative methods and extensions to the ones existing in the binary classification framework, specifically, proposing a conditional survival approach for weighting censored observations, a semi-supervised SVM with local invariances perspective and evaluating a weighted SVM model. Another important aspect in biomedical research is to identify the relevance of the variables in a model, i.e., which variables are important related to the response variable. In the SVM framework most of the work done is related to linear kernels, however, the main advantage of SVM is using non-linear kernels. This PhD thesis aims to propose three approaches based on the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm to rank variables based on non-linear SVM and SVM for survival analysis. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are focused on interpretation and visualization of each one the RFE iterations, allowing to identify relevant variables associated with the response variable and among predictor variables. After evaluating all proposed methods a real data, applying these methods, has been analyzed. The Mal067 data, aims to identify immune responses correlated with protection from malaria that were elicited by the malaria RTS,S vaccine and by natural immunity.

Therefore, this paper proposes an image text deblurring method based on a generative adversarial network. The model of the algorithm consists of two generative adversarial networks, combined with Wasserstein distance, using a combination of adversarial loss and perceptual loss on unpaired datasets to train the network model to restore the captured blurred images into clear and natural image. Compared with the traditional method, the advantage of this method is that the loss function between the input and output images can be calculated indirectly through the positive and negative generative adversarial networks. The Wasserstein distance can achieve a more stable training process and a more realistic generation effect. The constraints of adversarial loss and perceptual loss make the model capable of training on unpaired datasets. The experimental results on the GOPRO test dataset and the self-built unpaired dataset showed that the two indicators, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM), increased by 13.3% and 3%, respectively.

License Plate Identification Using Zoning Feature with Support Vector Machine Classification. Supervised by MUSHTHOFA. Vehicle identification detection is one of the significant problems with the increasing number of vehicles. Therefore, a computer-based method is needed that can identify the vehicle based on license plate numbers quickly and accurately. Previous research have applied the image centroid and zone (ICZ) feature extraction method to identify vehicle license plates. In this research, ICZ and support vector machine (SVM) will be used for license plate identification. SVM which is used is the multi class SVM one against all using linear kernel, the polynomial, and RBF. The testing is performanced twice, on each character and on the overall plate (with or without fault tolerance). From the three kernels, the kernel which produces the best accuracy is the polynomial kernel with a value of C equals to 0.125 and d equals to 2 with on accuracy of 95.44%, while the accuracy produced at plate testing without fault tolerance is 81.54% and testing with fault tolerance equal to 1 is 90.77%.

The classification performed using such data is called imbalanced data classification. As a consequence, the learning model bias towards the majority class and fails the classification of the minority class. Data sampling and ensemble methods are common ways to compensate for this issue. Random forest (RF), an ensemble of multiple decision trees, is very famous in both of the classification and regression problems because of its robust and accurate predictions.

Recent work has seen the development of neurofuzzy model construction algorithms which identify neurofuzzy models from available empirical data and expert knowledge. By matching the models structure to the underlying process represented by the data, parsimonious models are produced. Consequent parsimonious models do generalise better but due to the structural symmetry required in these models enforced by the need for model transparency, and the often sparse distribution of real data these models are still prone to poor generalisation. This report reviews and develops regularisation techniques that can be applied to identified neurofuzzy models to aid their ability to generalise. Essentially regularisation places a prior probability distribution on the weight values which consequently constrains the model output. One of the major overheads encountered when performing regularisation is deciding how much regularisation to perform. In this report great attention is given to this problem and techniques such as cross-validation and Bayesian methods are considered. The results of this work favour the Bayesian method, producing models that generalise well for both noisy and sparse training sets. Regularisation produces models that appear to perform sensibly throughout their input space. To give extra information about whether, given an input, the output is inferred from the data or the regulariser, error bars are derived for these models. The described methods are applied to conventional lattice based neurofuzzy models, and also the more parsimonious additive and multiplicative models, giving rise to local regularisation.", "year": 1996, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "143989724", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116367839"}

For instance: caspases, a class of proteases involved in programmed cell death-apoptosis, cleave a large set of various types of proteins. Simultaneously, kinases restrict caspase activity by phosphorylating their protein substrates in the vicinity of cleavage site. In addition, the caspase cleavage pattern in target proteins may be modified as a result of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding gene. This may either create a novel cleavage site, or increase/decrease the cleavage efficiency of a substrate. Such point mutations are often associated with the onset of disease. In this study, we predicted how phosphorylation and SNPs affect known human caspase proteolytic events collected in the CASBAH and Degrabase databases by applying Random Forest caspases' substrates prediction method, as implemented in the CaspDB, and the molecular dynamics free energy simulations approach. Our analysis confirms several experimental observations. Phosphorylation could have both positive or negative regulatory effects depending on its position with respect to the caspase cleavage site. For instance, we demonstrate that phosphorylation at P1' is the most detrimental for proteolytic efficiency of caspases. Phosphorylation at the P2 and P2' positions also negatively affect the cleavage events. In addition, we uncovered SNPs in 11 caspase substrates capable of completely abolishing the cleavage site due to polymorphism at the P1 position. The findings presented here may be useful for determining the link between aberrant proteolysis and disease.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29453691", "doi": "10.1007/s10495-018-1442-2", "venue": "Apoptosis", "journal": "Apoptosis", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2791225849", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["25236351", "5345060", "1502863", "35921746", "1308217", "35664141", "9678069", "207706465", "1849224", "24474228", "205383744", "6196465", "12139437", "22259349", "1842123", "33858457", "4469466", "18212930", "11801091", "46191693", "54468358", "17571298", "14076525", "25171073", "5814462", "13861754", "46517282", "10531919", "24775963", "33167470", "94224940", "18672004", "11197844", "27731372", "14190438", "40847697", "10611523", "31518063", "22251683", "13905670", "23994968", "42761736"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3377442"}

Rather, the agent causing the change must also be determined. Here, we describe and test a method of change agent attribution built on four tenets: agents operate on patches rather than pixels; temporal context can provide insight into the agent of change; human interpretation is critical because agent labels are inherently human-defined; and statistical modeling must be flexible and non-parametric. In the Puget Sound, USA, we used LandTrendr Landsat time-series-based algorithms to identify abrupt disturbances, and then applied spatial rules to aggregate these to patches. We then derived a suite of spectral, patch-shape, and landscape position variables for each patch. These were then linked to patch-level training labels determined by interpreters at 1198 training patches, and modeled statistically using the Random Forest machine-learning algorithm. Labeled agents of change included urbanization, forest management, and natural change (largely fire), as well as labels associated with spectral change that was non-informative (false change). The success of the method was evaluated using both out-of-bag (OOB) error and a small, fully-independent validation interpretation dataset. Overall OOB accuracy was above 80%, but most successful in the numerically well-represented forest management class. Validation with the independent data was generally lower than that estimated with the OOB approach, but comparable when either first or second voting scores were used for prediction. Spatial and temporal patterns within the study area followed expectations well, with most urbanization occurring in the lower elevation regions around Seattle\u2013Tacoma, most forest management occurring in mid-slope managed forests, and most natural disturbance occurring in protected areas. Temporal patterns of change agent aggregated to the watershed level suggest substantial year-over-year variability that could be used to examine year-over-year variability in fish species populations.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2015.05.005", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "773459379", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["14309959", "53003957", "89141", "55971250", "129996510", "54961095", "84559952", "54187893", "131551621", "52083847", "89836418", "154553846", "41240209", "128830655", "19361987", "55189603", "42161497", "129300989", "205013370", "1171161", "29228720", "17256079", "21695836", "27483081", "14274505", "154287427", "129570212", "129614801", "18865408", "8610995", "87466255"], "inbound_citations": ["104293486", "208224571", "51685894", "146033817", "133861551", "60442891", "214249040", "126351988", "53596518", "134722096", "15079851", "43216123", "49574740", "133999569", "19715729", "19765611", "55851624", "34994143", "210847894", "158598271", "51965636", "4814375", "42643882", "1011231", "214042746", "27908073"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:73544906"}

Hence, the objectives of this research are new algorithms development significantly for iris segmentation specifically the proposed Fusion of Profile and Mask Technique (FPM) specifically in getting the actual center of the pupil with high level of accuracy prior to iris localization task, followed by a particular enhancement in iris normalization that is the application of quarter size of an iris image (instead of processing a whole or half size of an iris image) and for better precision and faster recognition with the robust Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classifier. Further aim of this research is the integration of cancelable biometrics feature in the proposed iris recognition technique via non-invertible transformation which determines the feature transformation-based template protection techniques security. Therefore, it is significant to formulate the non-invertibility measure to circumvent the possibility of adversary having the capability in guessing the original biometric providing that the transformed template is obtained. At any process of recognition stage, the biometric data is protected and also whenever there is a compromise to any information in the database it will be on the cancelable biometric template merely without affecting the original biometric information. In order to evaluate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, CASIA-A (version 3.1) and Bath-A iris databases have been selected for performance testing. Briefly, the processes of the iris recognition system proposed in this research work are locating the pupil first via the novel technique that is the Fusion of Profile and Mask (FPM) Technique focusing on getting the actual center of the pupil then followed by localizing the actual iris region with the circular Hough transform. Next, select smaller yet optimal and effective normalized iris image size by applying different normalization factors. Instead of processing a whole or half size of an iris image, the 480 code size which is equivalent to the quarter size of an iris is selected due to its outstandingly accurate results and less computational complexity. The subsequent step is using the DAUB3 wavelet transform for feature extraction along with the application of an additional step for biometric template security that is the Non-invertible transform (cancelable biometrics method) and finally utilizing the Support Vector Machine (Non-linear Quadratic kernel) for matching/classification. The experimental results showed that the recognition rate achieved are of 99.9% on Bath-A data set, with a maximum decision criterion of 0.97.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2954044762", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198317034"}

Second, we treat the flow field in each block-clip as 2d distribution of samples and mixtures of Gaussian is used to parameterize it keeping generality of flow field intact. K-means algorithm is employed to initialize the mixture model and is followed by Expectation Maximization for optimization. These mixtures of Gaussian result in the distinct flow patterns precisely a sequence of dynamic patterns for each block-clip.

The DE, ABC and GSA are combined with the SVR for determining the optimal value of its user defined parameters. The optimization implementation by the DE, ABC and GSA significantly improves the generalization ability of the SVR.

The prediction models were applied to the available data given in the literature, and their performance was assessed based on statistical criteria. The results clearly show the superiority of DE when integrated with SVR for optimizing values of its parameters.

The dysfunction of GA proteins can result in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, accurate identification of protein subGolgi localizations may assist in drug development and understanding the mechanisms of the GA involved in various cellular processes. In this paper, a new computational method is proposed for identifying cis-Golgi proteins from trans-Golgi proteins. Based on the concept of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), a novel feature extraction technique is developed to extract evolutionary information from protein sequences. To deal with the imbalanced benchmark dataset, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is adopted. A feature selection method called Random Forest-Recursive Feature Elimination (RF-RFE) is employed to search the optimal features from the CSP based features and g-gap dipeptide composition. Based on the optimal features, a Random Forest (RF) module is used to distinguish cis-Golgi proteins from trans-Golgi proteins. Through the jackknife cross-validation, the proposed method achieves a promising performance with a sensitivity of 0.889, a specificity of 0.880, an accuracy of 0.885, and a Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.765, which remarkably outperforms previous methods. Moreover, when tested on a common independent dataset, our method also achieves a significantly improved performance. These results highlight the promising performance of the proposed method to identify Golgi-resident protein types.

In view of this, we mainly discuss the adaptive timeout strategy of UDP flows in this paper. Firstly, due to the significant differences in flow characteristics between the TCP flows and UDP flows, we expound and prove that the existing adaptive timeout strategies are not appropriate for UDP flows. Secondly, we present our adaptive strategy using Support Vector Machine techniques. We build six classifiers to accurately predict its corresponding maximum packet inter-arrival time and adapt its timeout value within the flow duration. Limited to its accurate rating, we present another concept of adjust accuracy rating which can probability-guaranteed(90%,95%,98%) to avoid long flow to be cut into short flows.

In recent years, machine learning methods have been used to automate processes and provide decision support. All of this, based on analyzing large amounts of data generated in a continuous manner.

However, achieving robust and accurate detection is difficult due to SAR sensor limitations and the complex marine environment. To address this problem, the large-scale spatial contextual information in SAR imagery has to be utilized to increase the class separability between the dark spot and the background. A stochastic fully connected continuous conditional random field (SFCCRF) approach to model SAR imagery and perform soft-label inference has been designed and built, leading to an efficient detection algorithm. Instead of treating all pixels in the imagery as being connected, SFCCRF determines the connectivity of two pixels in a stochastic manner based on their proximity in both feature space and image space. Since SFCCRF provides an efficient and effective way for modeling the large-scale spatial correlation effect, the resulting soft labels can resist the influence of speckle noise and highlight the difference between dark spot and the background. Dark-spot detection is achieved by binarizing the soft labels estimated by SFCCRF. The proposed algorithm is tested on both simulated and real SAR imageries.

In this work, the capability of Near Infrared spectroscopy and chemometric treatment to accurately monitor mAb glycosylation during CHO cells cultures using in situ probes is shown for the first time.

An open problem is then to develop methods capable of producing the most compact environment model sufficient for accurate and efficient natural language understanding. We propose a model that leverages environment-related information encoded within instructions to identify the subset of observations and perceptual classifiers necessary to perceive a succinct, instruction-specific environment representation. The framework uses three probabilistic graphical models trained from a corpus of annotated instructions to infer salient scene semantics, perceptual classifiers, and grounded symbols.

The classification uses depth images collected from a Time of Flight camera embedded in the crutches employed for the assisted gait. The machine learning algorithm foresees an initial phase of data collection and processing, identifying the 3D points belonging to the foot and those belonging to the floor. From these, a feature set is computed analyzing the values of percentiles of distances of the foot from the floor, and passed to a modified version of Random Forest classifier, called Sigma-z Random Forest. The classifier considers the uncertainties associated to each feature set and provides both the classification of the gait phase (stance or swing) and an associated confidence value. In this work, we propose the use of the confidence value to improve the reliability of the gait phase classification, by applying an optimized threshold to the confidence value obtained for each new frame.

Thus, accurately predicting HSTs is essential in evaluating the life expectancy of power transformers and in preventing thermal failure. Previously, support vector machine (SVM) has been successfully employed to solve the regression problem of nonlinearity and small sample size. In the present study, given that the HSTs of transformers have a complex non-linear relationship with load information and environmental information, support vector regression (SVR) has been adopted to establish a model for the prediction of HSTs in power transformers. Among which, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) having passive congregation algorithm is utilized to determine the parameters of SVR. The PSO-SVR model has been applied to predict HSTs of a power transformer. Several experimental tests have been carried out involving a large power transformer in Sichuan Province, China, to verify the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed PSO-SVR model. In addition, PSO-SVR modeling results are compared with that of standard SVR and artificial neural network (ANN) by applying identical training and test samples. In conclusion, the PSO-SVR model has better prediction accuracy and generalization ability than both the standard SVR model and the ANN in the HST prediction of power transformers. Streszczenie.

In this discovery and validation study, we evaluated the suitability of a mathematical model of apoptosis execution (APOPTO-CELL) as a stand-alone signature and as a constituent of further refined prognostic stratification tools.Experimental Design: Apoptosis competency of primary tumor samples from patients with stage III colorectal cancer (n = 120) was calculated by APOPTO-CELL from measured protein concentrations of Procaspase-3, Procaspase-9, SMAC, and XIAP. An enriched APOPTO-CELL signature (APOPTO-CELL-PC3) was synthesized to capture apoptosome-independent effects of Caspase-3. Furthermore, a machine learning Random Forest approach was applied to APOPTO-CELL-PC3 and available molecular and clinicopathologic data to identify a further enhanced signature. Association of the signature with prognosis was evaluated in an independent colon adenocarcinoma cohort (TCGA COAD, n = 136).Results: We identified 3 prognostic biomarkers (P = 0.04, P = 0.006, and P = 0.0004 for APOPTO-CELL, APOPTO-CELL-PC3, and Random Forest signatures, respectively) with increasing stratification accuracy for patients with stage III colorectal cancer.The APOPTO-CELL-PC3 signature ranked highest among all features. The prognostic value of the signatures was independently validated in stage III TCGA COAD patients (P = 0.01, P = 0.04, and P = 0.02 for APOPTO-CELL, APOPTO-CELL-PC3, and Random Forest signatures, respectively). The signatures provided further stratification for patients with CMS1-3 molecular subtype.Conclusions: The integration of a systems-biology-based biomarker for apoptosis competency with machine learning approaches is an appealing and innovative strategy toward refined patient stratification. The prognostic value of apoptosis competency is independent of other available clinicopathologic and molecular factors, with tangible potential of being introduced in the clinical management of patients with stage III colorectal cancer.

The key idea in compressed sensing for multilabel classification is to first project the label vector to a lower dimensional space using a random transformation and then learn regression functions over these projections. Our approach considers both of these components in a single probabilistic model, thereby jointly optimizing over compression as well as learning tasks. We then derive an efficient variational inference scheme that provides joint posterior distribution over all the unobserved labels. The two key benefits of the model are that a) it can naturally handle datasets that have missing labels and b) it can also measure uncertainty in prediction. The uncertainty estimate provided by the model allows for active learning paradigms where an oracle provides information about labels that promise to be maximally informative for the prediction task. Our experiments show significant boost over prior methods in terms of prediction performance over benchmark datasets, both in the fully labeled and the missing labels case. Finally, we also highlight various useful active learning scenarios that are enabled by the probabilistic model.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "NIPS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2145908112", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2555940", "11608263", "17671150", "9404152", "201720", "13391792", "123799335", "8006871", "9001615", "206797074", "11419546", "15819455", "323241", "1979173", "7587705", "59860283", "7596571"], "inbound_citations": ["25775556", "10196823", "15891191", "43933748", "53563138", "14577248", "11074892", "6366436", "96431924", "53095614", "3384324", "28348554", "20482876", "8858581", "7012164", "10241437", "28816964", "40740837", "5539628", "16673477", "5867749", "9035216", "174801150", "88483067", "4799413", "27042868", "6348016", "198190185", "208070826", "67856781", "36360183", "1432757", "159041797", "14232340", "17038278", "3800248", "7697669", "2403024", "19240886", "1009397", "57373791", "14802757", "9628024", "387208", "21160618", "650968", "211211451", "17091678", "14362311", "52938171", "4554166", "174800205", "203605882", "3810628", "2523568", "24357554", "16314158", "12890577", "119308609", "12418822", "14698999", "210920210", "11730751", "21684170"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2013706"}

Performing the grading automatically by means of digital techniques is defined as the automatic tumor classification task. In an attempt to solve this, a digital database containing images of tissue is collected and labeled by an expert. Ficsor et al. [8] propose a method based on explicit information (explicit method) to determine parameters for automatic classification of three types of colitis (i.e. chronic inflammation of the colon). Explicit information is the information which can be explicitly described, e.g. color, size and shape. Although their research does not address the automatic tumor classification task, it is very relevant for comparison to our research since it automatically attempts to characterize and classify tissue. This thesis proposes and researches a method based on implicit information (implicit method): information that is implicitly available and not directly interpretable in terms of shapes or contours. Implicit methods are different from explicit methods because they rely on statistical measures of images, not necessarily confined to objects or contours. The problem statement of this thesis is defined as follows: Problem statement: How well does the Gabor transform (GT) method perform the automatic tumor classification task? The GT method comprises four stages. In the first stage the data is preprocessed, followed by the second stage where a log-Gabor transform is applied. In the third stage a statistical descriptor is applied (magnitude) and two types of features are extracted: the first type of feature is the maximum magnitude per scale, the second type of feature is the biased sum of histogram values per scale. These two features are dimensionally reduced by either Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Sammon Mapping (Sammon) or t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). In the fourth stage the features are presented for classification in four ways; besides dimensionally reduced by the three aforementioned techniques, it is presented as an unreduced feature vector. The data becomes classified by either Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) or k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). SVM is applied with one of two different scaling factors 1 and 13 (SVM-1 and SVM-13). Therefore, this thesis also adresses the following research questions: \u2022 Research Question 1: Which type of implicit feature performs best in the automatic tumor classification task? \u2022 Research Question 2: Which dimensionality reduction technique performs best in the automatic tumor classification task? \u2022 Research Question 3: Which classifier performs best in the automatic tumor classification task? By applying crossvalidation and confusion tables, the GT method was evaluated by its classification accuracy and false positive rate. Furthermore it is compared to the explicit method of Ficsor et al. We concluded that a combination of the maximum magnitude per scale, that is dimensionally reduced by t-SNE and classified by SVM-13 achieves the highest classification accuracy (87.5%), but still has a non-zero false positive rate (8.8%). For the automatic tumor classification task: \u2022 The best performing feature is the maximum magnitude per scale. \u2022 The best performing dimensionality reduction technique for the maximum magnitude per scale is t-SNE, and for the biased sum of histogram values per scale this is Sammon mapping, although dimensional reduction is not always necessary for this type of feature. \u2022 The best performing classifier for the maximum magnitude per scale is dependant on the data representation: if the dimensionally unreduced feature is applied, SVM-13 performs best. If PCA or t-SNE is applied, SVM-1 performs best. If Sammon mapping is applied, kNN performs best. For the biased sum of histogram values per scale, SVM-1 performs best one of three dimensionality reduction techniques is applied and LDA performs best when this type of feature is dimensionally unreduced. We conclude that the GT method performs the automatic tumor classification task very good compared to the explicit method by Ficsor et al.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2557196706", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55825807"}

Experimental results over two real HSIs demonstrate that the proposed 2D-1D-HSRGAN clearly outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICIP.2019.8803200", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)", "journal": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2970287479", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18874645", "7037846", "9433631", "6145845", "211227", "52154773", "11898365", "1033682", "6540453", "16489696", "49559335", "13740328", "6628106", "44533651"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202778547"}

These tools can block malicious links, however they cannot protect the user in real-time as early as possible. Thus, industries and researchers have applied different approaches to make spam free social network platform. Some of them are only based on user-based features while others are based on tweet based features only.

To solve this issue, we propose a framework which takes the user and tweet based features along with the tweet text feature to classify the tweets.

The long papers can be found in Volume 5194 of Springer\u2019s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series.

While the last MLJ special issue on ILP emphasized approaches combining relational representations with probabilistic modeling and inference, the current issue reflects recent advances in the logical and graphical foundations of relational learning as well as novel applications of ILP in theory revision and natural language processing. A number of first-order logic frameworks have been proposed by the ILP community and used for concept learning. The most popular ones are known as learning from interpretations, learning from entailment, and learning from satisfiability. In the article \u201cBrave Induction: a Logical Framework for Learning from Incomplete Information\u201d, Chiaki Sakama and Katsumi Inoue show that none of these frameworks is directly suited to elegantly deal with a certain type of incompleteness in training data. Inspired by brave inference known in nonmonotonic logics, the authors propose a novel logical setting termed brave induction for learning first-order clauses. They rely on minimal-model semantics instead of using the classical entailment relation to define when an example is covered by a hypothesized clause and background knowledge.

Manual segmentation requires skilled experts, being a laborious and time-consuming task; therefore, reliable and robust automatic segmentation methods are necessary. New method We propose a segmentation framework based on a Conditional Random Field for brain tissue segmentation, with a Random Forest encoding the likelihood function. The features include intensities, gradients, probability maps, and locations. Additionally, skull stripping is critical for achieving an accurate segmentation; thus, after extracting the brain we propose to refine its boundary during segmentation. Results The proposed framework was evaluated on the MR Brain Image Segmentation Challenge and the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository databases. The segmentations of brain tissues obtained with the proposed algorithm were competitive both in normal and diseased subjects. The skull stripping refinement significantly improved the results, when comparing against no refinement. Comparison with existing methods In the MR Brain Image Segmentation Challenge database, the results were competitive when comparing with top methods. In the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository database, the proposed approach outperformed other well-established algorithms.

This work for the first time compares multiple Data-Driven Models (DDMs) to achieve such rapid temperature predictions. DDM typically employs statistical or machine learning-based tools, in combination with physics-based modeling and/or experimental data to predict system behavior. In general, DDM approaches are well-suited to systems that have multiple operational states based on interactions between the many electrical, mechanical and control parameters typical of data centers. This study compares the performance of three different DDM methods, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in predicting both steady-state and transient rack inlet air temperature distributions in data centers. Additionally, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) was considered for transient modeling. The data used for training and analysis were obtained by performing 300 offline numerical simulations with a room-level, experimentally validated computational fluid dynamics/heat transfer (CFD/HT) model. The performance of the four data-driven models was evaluated based on the absolute mean error for interpolation and extrapolation, and the adaptability of the models to changes in physical domain (data center room) configuration. Additionally, the impact of the size of the training data set on prediction accuracy is also compared for the four models. For the steady-state case study, the predictions for ANN, SVR and GPR models are in good agreement with CFD/HT simulations, with the GPR model having the smallest overall average prediction error of 0.6 \u00b0C in rack inlet air temperature, corresponding to a relative error of 2.7% with respect to rack inlet temperature measured in \u00b0C. It was found that for all the frameworks the prediction error increases when the size of training data set was less than 300 samples. The GPR model had the best accuracy for smaller training data sets compared with the other models, with an average prediction error for rack inlet temperatures", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.02.041", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer", "mag_id": "2918077105", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203485803"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126987167"}

First, it is one of the most commonly found childhood disorders and second, the root cause of the problem is still unknown. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data has become a popular tool for the analysis of ADHD, which is the focus of our current research. In this paper we propose a novel framework for the automatic classification of the ADHD subjects using their resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data of the brain. We construct brain functional connectivity networks for all the subjects. The nodes of the network are constructed with clusters of highly active voxels and edges between any pair of nodes represent the correlations between their average fMRI time series. The activity level of the voxels are measured based on the average power of their corresponding fMRI time-series. For each node of the networks, a local descriptor comprising of a set of attributes of the node is computed. Next, the Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) technique is used to project all the subjects from the unknown graph-space to a low dimensional space based on their inter-graph distance measures. Finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used on the low dimensional projected space for automatic classification of the ADHD subjects. Exhaustive experimental validation of the proposed method is performed using the data set released for the ADHD-200 competition. Our method shows promise as we achieve impressive classification accuracies on the training (70.49%) and test data sets (73.55%).

Based on the distribution of incident clearance time, two groups are categorized for prediction with a 15-min threshold. A comparative study confirms that the GBDT method is significantly superior to other algorithms for incidents with both short and long clearance times.

However, the construction of an efficient deep neural network mostly relies on a large number of labeled samples being available. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified deep network, combined with active transfer learning (TL) that can be well-trained for HSIs classification using only minimally labeled training data. More specifically, deep joint spectral\u2013spatial feature is first extracted through hierarchical stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) networks. Active TL is then exploited to transfer the pretrained SSAE network and the limited training samples from the source domain to the target domain, where the SSAE network is subsequently fine-tuned using the limited labeled samples selected from both source and target domains by the corresponding active learning (AL) strategies. The advantages of our proposed method are threefold: 1) the network can be effectively trained using only limited labeled samples with the help of novel AL strategies; 2) the network is flexible and scalable enough to function across various transfer situations, including cross data set and intraimage; and 3) the learned deep joint spectral\u2013spatial feature representation is more generic and robust than many joint spectral\u2013spatial feature representations.

The strongest connectionist claim is that psychological properties simply emerge from interactions among the units of a network; meaningful features are distributed in these units, which therefore are not representions of anything. The problem is then: how such a system can describe a psychological system and be relevant to explain it ? It is suggested that the psychological relevance of connectionist descriptions should not be rejected on the grounds that they are limited to a hardware-like or implementational level. Connectionist descriptions would be best considered as different scientific \"objects\", constructed from the same prescientific \"facts\". As different objects they need not be at different levels of generality or abstraction and the translation of one representation into another is unnecessary. As to the explanatory power of connectionist models, it is claimed that it cannot come from the interaction among units, if this interaction is invoked at the same time to give the model a psychological nature. Neither can the explanatory power come from the fact that connectionist models produce phenomena similar to human psychological processes, since this similarity should refer explicitly to features that have already been accepted independently as psychological. The claim that connectionist analysis is psychologically relevant at a subsymbolic level is eventually considered. There is a possible confusion in this claim: sub-symbolic models may be non-symbolic as to their object but they must be symbolic as models. A non-symbolic model simply would not be a model, since - by definition - it must represent something. Sub-symbolic models, however, may be non-symbolic in the sense that there are no symbols in the modelled reality. In this regard, connectionist systems seem to help in overcoming the idea - encouraged by current AI and Cognitive Science - that any psychological process should be considered as made out of symbols.", "year": 1990, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "42920530", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["7745106", "29092734", "56499839", "144360543", "197660420"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15565673"}

Therefore it is necessary to reduce the dimensionality through ways like feature selection. Currently, there are two kinds of feature selection methods: filter methods and wrapper methods. The former kind requires no feedback from classifiers and estimates the classification performance indirectly. The latter kind evaluates the \"goodness\" of selected feature subset directly based on the classification accuracy. Many experimental results have proved that the wrapper methods can yield better performance, although they have the disadvantage of high computational cost. In this paper, we present a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based wrapper method for classification of hyper spectral data using Support Vector Machine (SVM), a state-of-art classifier that has found to be success in a variety of areas. The genetic algorithm (GA), which seeks to solve optimization problems using the methods of evolution, specifically survival of the fittest, was used to optimize both the feature subset, i.e. band subset, of hyper spectral data and SVM kernel parameters simultaneously. A special strategy was adopted to reduce computation cost caused by the high-dimensional feature vectors of hyper spectral data when the feature subset part of chromosome was designed. The GA-SVM method was realized using the ENVI/IDL language, and was then tested by applying a HYPERION hyper spectral image. Comparison of the optimized results and the un-optimized results showed that the GA-SVM method could significantly reduce the computation cost while improving the classification accuracy. The number of bands used for classification was reduced from 198 to 13, while the classification accuracy increased from 88.81% to 92.51%. The optimized values of the two SVM kernel parameters were 95.0297 and 0.2021, respectively, which were different from the default values as used in the ENVI software. In conclusion, the proposed wrapper feature selection method GA-SVM can optimize feature subsets and SVM kernel parameters at the same time, therefore can be applied in feature selection of the hyper spectral data.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Geographical Research", "mag_id": "2371610592", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63457497"}

This natural process leads to a marked decrease in forest productivity overtime. Topography both at the surface of the forest floor (i.e., above ground) and the subsurface (i.e., top of mineral soil which is underground) is known to play a critical role in the paludification process. Until recently, the availability of more accurate topographic information regarding the surface and subsurface was a limiting factor for land management and modeling of spatial organic layer thickness (OLT) variability, a proxy for paludification. However so far, no research has assessed which of these two topographic variables has the greatest influence on paludification. This study aims to assess which topographic variable (surface or subsurface) better explains paludification, using high-resolution remote sensing technology (i.e., Light Detection and Ranging: LiDAR and Ground Penetrating Radar: GPR). To this end, field soil measurements were made in over 1614 sites distributed throughout the reference Valrennes Experimental site in Canadian northern coniferous forests. Then, a machine learning model (i.e., Random Forest, RF) was implemented to rank a set of selected predictor topographic variables (i.e., slope, aspect, mean curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, and topographic wetness index) using the Mean Decrease Gini (MDG) index as an indicator of importance. Results showed that overall 83% of the overall variance was explained by the RF selected model, while the derived subsurface topography predictors had the lowest MDGs for predicting paludification. On the other hand, the surface slope predictor had the highest MDGs and better explained paludification. This finding would be particularly useful for implanting sustainable management strategies based on the surface variables of paludified northern boreal forests. This study has also highlighted the potential of LiDAR data to provide surface topographic spatial detail information for planning and optimizing forest management activities in paludified boreal forests. This is even of great importance when we know that LiDAR variables are easier to obtain compared to GPR derived variables (subsurface topographic variables).", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/su12020577", "venue": null, "journal": "Sustainability", "mag_id": "2999172600", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214434910"}

An important part of the European Union's (EU) response to this problem is the Habitats Directive, the main aim of which is to protect biodiversity through the conservation and protection of natural habitats. Consequently, accurate mapping of specific habitats is of high importance in order to monitor ecosystem changes. Within this context, remote sensing has enormous potential as a source of land cover information which has been used widely for land cover mapping. In many instances this land cover mapping is only concerned with one particular habitat. However, in standard classification analysis, training data for all of the land cover classes contained in the area is typically required which means a wasteful use of resources. This thesis aims to address these issues by investigating advanced classification methods that focus on the accurate mapping of one specific protected habitat. The data used for this purpose is a Landsat ETM+ image of East Anglia, UK, acquired in June 2000 and ground truth data in the form of aerial photography. The habitat of interest chosen for this investigation is fens, a habitat protected by the EU Habitats Directive, whose diverse and dynamic nature is a particular challenge for its mapping and monitoring. A second protected habitat, saltmarshes, will be used for comparison purposes in order to determine any bias within the results. ::: The methods considered to map the selected habitat consist of binary classifiers and one class classifiers. The binary classifiers chosen were Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) which are two new methods very recently applied to land cover classification and remote sensing research. They are still very much the focus of current research for multiclass classification. In this thesis they are used in its binary form to classify the class of interest against. all the other classes. Both classifiers perform very well when compared with a classic parametric Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). Narrowing down the idea of classifying just one habitat of interest, one-class classifiers are put to the test. They have been explored in pattern recognition research but not yet within remote sensing image classification and land cover mapping. Specifically, the Support Vector Data Description (SYDD) classifier is considered particularly suitable for land cover classification as it is based upon the basis of SVMs which have already been applied in this area with success. When the results of the SYDD classification are compared against those obtained by the other classifiers these show an improvement in overall classification and a reduction in the errors of commission. Furthermore, another method is also put to the test to improve the accuracy of the classification of the class of interest. This method is the ensemble of classifiers, which in many research studies within pattern recognition has proven to improve accuracy of single classifiers. The results in this thesis also show an improvement in accuracy, although further investigation is needed. ::: In conclusion, DT, SVM and SYDD classification methods offer clear advantages over standard classification analysis when concentrating on the classification and mapping of a particular habitat. All three classifiers obtained higher accuracies than the ML classifier with the use of significantly less training data. Furthermore, in the case of one-class classification only data from the class of interest was needed. Also in both binary and one-class classification approaches the attention was focused on separating the class of interest from all the other classes and therefore training efficiency was bigger than in a standard multiclass classification where efforts are directly to achieve a high overall accuracy. All three methods were found to be highly suitable for classifying and mapping a specific habitat and its application should be considered in future work involving the accurate mapping of protected habitats.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "175783701", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127658447"}

To address that problem, we propose two approaches to transferring robot perception module, which are based on domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), respectively. The former approach tries to extract domain-invariant features by a shared feature extractor and use the domain-invariant features to train a transferrable target localization model (TLM). Meanwhile, the latter approach attempts to learn a transformation from the source domain to the target domain and use the transformation to generate realistic synthetic samples. Then, the synthetic samples are exploited as training data for the TLM.

Daily H, maximum and minimum air temperatures (Tmax and Tmin), transformed precipitation (Pt, 1 for rainfall > 0 and 0 for rainfall = 0) and extra-terrestrial solar radiation (H0) during 1966\u20132000 and 2001\u20132015 from three radiation stations in humid subtropical China were used to train and test the models, respectively. Two combinations of input parameters, i.e. (i) only Tmax, Tmin and Ra, and (ii) complete data were considered for simulations. The proposed machine learning models were also compared with four well-known empirical models to evaluate their performances. The results suggest that the SVM and XGBoost models outperformed the selected empirical models. The performance of the machine learning models was improved by 5.9\u201312.2% for training phase and by 8.0\u201311.5% for testing phase in terms of RMSE when information of precipitation was further included.

Machine-learning-based methods have been widely used for the prediction of protein-ligand binding sites.

In the last two decades, diverse quantitative models and approaches have been developed and refined to address the impact of volatile markets on business. Whereas existing approaches have intensively utilized structured data such as historical price series, little attention has been paid to unstructured (textual) data, which could be a large source of information in this context. Previous empirical research has shown that certain news stories, such as corporate disclosures, can cause abnormal price behavior subsequent to their publication. On the basis of a data set comprising such news stories as well as intraday stock prices, this paper explores the risk implications of information being newly available to market participants. After showing that such events can significantly drive stock price volatilities, this research aims at identifying among the textual data provided those disclosures that have resulted in most supranormal risk exposures. To this end, four different learners - Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbour, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine - have been applied in order to detect patterns in the textual data that could explain increased risk exposure. Two evaluations are presented in order to assess the learning capabilities of the approach in the context of risk management. First, ''classic'' data mining evaluation metrics are applied and, second, a newly developed simulation-based evaluation method is presented. Evaluation results provide strong evidence that unstructured (textual) data represents a valuable source of information also for financial risk management - a domain in which, in the past, little attention has been paid to unstructured data.

Methods to increase sensitivity in identifying genetic redundancy can improve the efficiency of reverse genetics and lend insights into the evolutionary outcomes of gene duplication.

In withholding analysis, one of the methods used here, Support Vector Machines, was two-fold more precise than single attribute classifiers, reaching a level where the majority of redundant calls were correctly labeled. Using this higher confidence in identifying redundancy, machine learning predicts that about half of all genes in Arabidopsis showed the signature of predicted redundancy with at least one but typically less than three other family members. Interestingly, a large proportion of predicted redundant gene pairs were relatively old duplications (e.g., Ks > 1), suggesting that redundancy is stable over long evolutionary periods. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Machine learning predicts that most genes will have a functionally redundant paralog but will exhibit redundancy with relatively few genes within a family.

Next, a two-stage detection algorithm is proposed where SVM is further exploited in the first stage. The performance of the proposed data detection method is very close to that of Maximum-Likelihood (ML) data detection when the channel is perfectly known.

However, mammography assessment is challenging even for well-trained radiologists, leading to a pressing need for Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems. In this work, a novel technique for the detection and classification of breast Micro-Calcifications (MCs), which are diagnostically significant but difficult to detect findings, is presented. The proposed method is based on the subtraction of temporally sequential mammogram pairs, after pre-processing and image registration, followed by machine-learning. The classification was performed using several features extracted from the subtracted mammograms and selected during training to optimize the accuracy of the results. Six classifiers were tested in a leave-one-patient-out, 4, 5 and 10 fold cross-validation process. This technique was evaluated on a unique dataset, consisting of temporal sequences of mammograms from 80 patients taken between 1 to 6 years apart. The resulting 320 mammograms were reviewed by 2 radiologists who precisely marked each MC location. The accuracy of classifying MCs as benign or suspicious improved from 91.42% without temporal subtraction and an Ensemble of Decision Trees (EDT), to 99.55% with the use of sequential mammograms and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with leave-one-patient-out validation. The improvement was statistically significant (p-value < 0.005).

It consists of three self-organizing feature maps (a semantic layer, a phonological layer and a phonemic layer) that are connected via associative links trained by Hebbian learning. We use this model to simulate the early stages of lexical acquisition in children. The simulating results indicate a number of important effects in determining the timing and function of children\u2019s word production, such as word frequency and word length effects. In addition, results from lesioned models indicate developmental plasticity in the network\u2019s recovery from damage. Plasticity occurs at early stages, and changes with time in a non-monotonic and nonlinear fashion. These simulated patterns are due to the nonlinear dynamic properties of the network and match up with data from empirical studies of children. Introduction While many previous models of language acquisition have used back-propagation as the standard algorithm, in our work we have explored self-organizing neural network as a cognitively and neurally plausible model of language acquisition (Li, 2003; Li, Farkas, & MacWhinney, 2004). In this paper we present DevLex-II, an extension of the DevLex model as discussed in Li et al. (2004). The DevLex model has been applied to account for phenomena in early lexical development, including category formation, lexical confusion, and age of acquisition. The extended DevLex-II has been applied to simulate \u2018vocabulary spurt\u2019, a sudden and rapid increase in children\u2019s early productive vocabulary around 18 months of age (Li, Zhao, & MacWhinney, 2005). We have been able to model the emergence of vocabulary spurt as a function of a number of parameters, including verbal short-term memory and associative capacity. In this paper, we follow up on the initial findings to further examine patterns of early word production, in three respects: (a) word-frequency and word-length effects, (b) children\u2019s early pronunciation errors, and (c) the recovery from brain injury for early word learning. First, word frequency and word length are two important variables that have been extensively studied in psycholinguistic research. Empirical studies show that token frequency and length of words determine the latency of a variety of tasks such as naming and lexical decision in adult language (Jescheniak and Levelt, 1994). Recent research indicates that these lexical properties may also affect lexical development in early child language: in particular, the age of acquisition of words may be correlated with the frequency of words in parental input (Storkel, 2004). In this study, we attempt to identify through modeling how frequency and length of words affect the time course of lexical acquisition. Second, in the course of modeling early word production, we compare the performance of the model with empirical data in terms of word pronunciation. It is well known that, compared with the adult lexical forms, children\u2019s early speech involves omission, substitution, addition or reduplication of certain sounds or syllables. These patterns often show great individual variations and reflect children\u2019s lack of full mastery of articulatory programs at early stages of learning (Menn & Stoel-Gammon, 1993). Study of these errors at different ages can provide us with insights into the development of children\u2019s phonological abilities. One goal of the current study is to see if our model displays error patterns similar to those observed with children and to identify cognitive mechanisms underlying the errors. Third, significant progresses have been made in the understanding of language development and its neurological underpinnings through research with children who suffer from brain injuries that are different in size, location, onset age, and so on (Bates 1999; Bates & Roe, 2001; Vargha- Khadem, Isaacs, & Muter 1994). Researchers have also attempted to simulate developmental language disorders using connectionist nets (Marchman 1993; Thomas & Karmiloff-Smith, 2002). Empirical studies show that, children with early brain injury can go on to acquire linguistic abilities within normal range, whereas similar lesions in adults produce dramatic patterns of aphasia (Bates & Roe, 2001). These data provide evidence supporting a general view that great plasticity is an early privilege (Thomas, 2003). However, how plasticity changes with time is a complex problem and is still unclear. Bates and colleagues have argued that the shape of the function is not monotonic (Bates, 1999; Bates & Roe, 2001). In this study, we hope to shed some light on the issue by observing network performance and its ability to recover under various lesion conditions.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2765561453", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149385138"}

However, due to the complex interplay between environmental estimates and co-evolutionary processes, the power of this relationship is still debatable. Various attempts to create statistical models have not been conclusive, because multilevel interactions between Cuckoo density, environmental conditions, and host species richness measurements have not been addressed so far. Therefore, we extended the concept of the Cuckoo as an independent bird biodiversity surrogate, and instead of simply using its occurrence, we incorporated an index of its density as an additional predictor in the modelling procedure of avian biodiversity. We applied six different indices of biodiversity as bird species richness measures, i.e. the number of bird individuals, the number of host species richness, functional richness, functional evenness, functional divergence, and evolutionary distinctiveness. We generated two sets of Species Distribution Models (SDM) for each group of biodiversity measures. One set included Cuckoo density as an additional predictor, while the other did not. Having evaluated these models in the Random Forest approach, it turned out that Cuckoo density improved model performance in each case. Species density was positively associated with taxonomic diversity (total species richness and host species richness), functional richness and evolutionary distinctiveness, and at the same time it was negatively correlated with functional evenness and functional divergence of bird communities. Thus, we suggest that through co-evolution of relationships, the Cuckoo prefers habitats attractive to numerous bird species, especially phylogenetically unique host. From the applied ecology perspective, Cuckoo density can be considered as a quantitative measure of functional interaction processes in the SDM approach, leading to the identification of avian diversity surrogates.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.01.009", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Indicators", "mag_id": "2789453374", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:90443222"}

Considering this, the objective of this paper was to investigate the performance of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data for discriminating different successional forest stages of a patch located in a subtropical portion of the Atlantic Rain Forest in Southern Brazil with the aid of two machine learning algorithms and relying on the use of spectral reflectance data selected over two seasons and attributes thereof derived. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used as classifiers with different subsets of predictor variables (multitemporal spectral reflectance, textural metrics and vegetation indices). All the experiments reached satisfactory results, with Kappa indices varying between 0.9, with Landsat-8 spectral reflectance alone and the SVM algorithm, and 0.98, with Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance alone also associated with the SVM algorithm. The Landsat-8 data had a significant increase in accuracy with the inclusion of other predictor variables in the classification process besides the pure spectral reflectance bands. The classification methods SVM and RF had similar performances in general. As to the RF method, the texture mean of the red-edge and SWIR bands were considered the most important ranked attributes for the classification of Sentinel-2 data, while attributes resulting from multitemporal bands, textural metrics of SWIR bands and vegetation indices were the most important ones in the Landsat-8 data classification.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs9080838", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2747398809", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["53616993", "51987286", "4414279", "129810061", "85696452", "34592589", "128894589", "128972488", "38296363", "84470806", "129931155", "128499269", "109926873", "129494315", "15885432", "21605657", "59939079", "9985555", "36355890", "14327012", "129258567", "89141", "37213770", "128810717", "12857002", "126372879", "37130821", "3553371", "132049849", "85052692", "7885346", "21270343", "206786900", "122562205", "56229664", "19025603", "96258129", "26829207", "128798491", "133358670", "128619277", "124075190", "252810", "36853263", "129434024", "215212331", "36843072", "15994225", "1418785", "15943670", "6345759", "123476171", "52874011", "62527324", "194951", "60324681", "60985554", "129770567", "14733890", "53334941", "128910776", "140609558", "10259143", "52088253", "129854746", "129133846", "16560581", "55622396", "131199038", "129910255", "119939860"], "inbound_citations": ["53228039", "169035744", "55388407", "4694449", "201328345", "209449142", "201129309", "198232831", "214910815", "109103199", "159042517", "204946959", "13988887"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27254922"}

The MRS mode level 1 product of RISAT-1 with dual polarization (HH & HV) covering a part of Varanasi district, Uttar Pradesh, India is analyzed for classifying various land features. In order to increase the amount of information in dual-polarized SAR data, a band HH + HV is introduced to make use of the original two polarizations.

For most of the class pairs the TD values are greater than 1.9 which indicates that the classes have good separability.

For instance, when an innovation was created in the 18th century in the UK, it took several months or even years for the news to reach other parts of the globe. The advent of more modern technology and the current educational structure has accelerated this growth. Today, human knowledge grows every hour, and it is more accessible than ever before. This speed of knowledge growth highlights the role of scientific manuscripts in spreading this valuable knowledge around the world. We can trust that articles published in scientific journals concentrate on the cutting edge of knowledge. Presently, most of these journals are published in the English language, but many scientists are not proficient in English. This leads to a high rejection rate for publications and the loss of good research and talent due to the use of inappropriate terms or syntactical style. Reviewing scientific articles for high-quality journals is time-consuming (some cases take up to a year). Furthermore, many inexperienced authors do not follow the scientific writing style of high-quality journals (ISI journals) and get rejected after waiting several months. Having a tool that advises authors whether their writing style is following ISI journal standards can be helpful and save time. In this research study, I proposed an automated system for detecting the similarity of an article with well-written academic writing by noticing various term forms. I chose to advance a novel classification technique to recognize the existing academic patterns. However, it was first necessary to be confident that the classification technique could handle this job. Moreover, the result of this section was essential for me as a benchmark. After ensuring that the classification technique was able to accomplish this work, Hybrid Genetic Random Forests (HGRF) was introduced as a new ensemble classifier based on a Random Forest algorithm, but altered slightly with some innovations. In order to measure performance of the proposed algorithm, evaluation was done by several independent UCI datasets and the results were compared with RF and some individual classifiers. In the final stage, it was tested by creating datasets for ISI and non-ISI papers and the result was promising.

We surmised that this impression reflects an accidental bias in the selection of monitoring sites towards those with prevailing vertical hydrological flowpaths, rather than a tight causal link between vegetation cover and erosion alone. To evaluate this conjecture, we monitored, over a 2-year period, a 3.3 ha old-growth rainforest catchment prone to frequent and widespread overland flow. We sampled stream flow at two and overland flow at three sites in a nested arrangement on a within-event basis, and monitored the spatial and temporal frequency of overland flow. Suspended-sediment concentrations were modeled with Random Forest and Quantile Regression Forest to be able to estimate the annual yields for the 2 years, which amounted to 1 t ha \ufffd 1 and 2 t ha \ufffd 1 in a year with below-average and with average precipitation, respectively. These estimates place our monitoring site near the high end of reported suspended-sediment yields and lend credence to the notion that low yields reflect primarily the dominance of vertical flowpaths and not necessarily and exclusively the kind of vegetative cover.

The spatiotemporal salient points are detected by measuring the variations in the information content of pixel neighborhoods in space and time. We implement an online background estimation algorithm in order to deal with inadequate localization of the salient points on the moving parts in the scene, and to improve the overall performance of the particle filter tracking scheme.We use a variant of the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm (LCSS) in order to compare different sets of trajectories corresponding to different actions.

As such, it is commonly believed that the tropical climate suits the life-cycle of the mosquito. Thus, studying the correlation between the climatic factors and trend of dengue cases is helpful in conceptualising a more effective pre-emptive control measure towards dengue outbreak. In this paper, we proposed to use Wavelet transformation for data pre-processing before employing a Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based Genetic Algorithm to select the most important features. After which, regression based on SVM is used to perform forecasting of the model. The analytical result drawn from this model based on dengue data in Singapore shows improvement in prediction performance of dengue cases ahead. This can help the health control agency to improve its strategic planning for disease control to combat dengue outbreak.

Recently, a transductive hypergraph learning has been investigated for classification, which can jointly explore the correlation among multiple objects, including both the labeled and unlabeled data. Although these methods have shown better performance, they are still limited due to 1) a considerable amount of testing data may not be available in practice and 2) the high computational cost to test new coming data. To handle this problem, considering the multi-modal representations of 3D objects in practice, we propose an inductive multi-hypergraph learning algorithm, which targets on learning an optimal projection for the multi-modal training data. In this method, all the training data are formulated in multi-hypergraph based on the features, and the inductive learning is conducted to learn the projection matrices and the optimal multi-hypergraph combination weights simultaneously. Different from the transductive learning on hypergraph, the high cost training process is off-line, and the testing process is very efficient for the inductive learning on hypergraph. We have conducted experiments on two 3D benchmarks, i.e., the NTU and the ModelNet40 data sets, and compared the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art methods and traditional transductive multi-hypergraph learning methods. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve effective and efficient classification performance. We also note that the proposed method is a general framework and has the potential to be applied in other applications in practice.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30072328", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2018.2862625", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2889055034", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["2045984", "16978751", "9985555", "2407217", "1009127", "3065624", "52044787", "53304422", "1008659", "7016601", "15736175", "15981452", "17635718", "17879431", "14204872", "16569745", "10578889", "735750", "123266904", "10808498", "11106394", "17445560", "395534", "206592833", "5115938", "1745976", "1040234", "20324757", "10637863"], "inbound_citations": ["67900469", "209525603", "52931969", "174820196", "208767596", "198985964", "160009568", "201620645", "215723429", "210695521", "204837724"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51905449"}

In contrast to the commonly used approaches of recovering frontal face images from profile views, the proposed method extracts the subject related part from a local feature by removing its pose related part. First, the method generates a self-similarity feature by computing the distances between local feature descriptors of different non-overlapping blocks in a face image. Secondly, it subtracts from the local feature a linear transformation of the self-similarity feature and the transformation matrix is learned through minimizing the feature distance between face images from the same person but under different poses while retaining the discriminative information across different persons. In order to evaluate our method, extensive experiments on face recognition across poses are conducted using FERET and Multi-PIE, in addition, experiments on face recognition under unconstrained situations are conducted using LFW-a. Results on these three public databases show that the proposed method is able to significantly improve the recognition performance as compared with using the original local features and outperforms or is comparable to related, state-of-the-art pose-invariant face recognition approaches.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patrec.2018.05.007", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.

Patients enroll onto experimental clinical trials based on ER, PR, and HER2 status and, as receptor status is prognostic and defines treatment regimens, central receptor confirmation is critical for interpreting results from these trials. Patients enrolling onto experimental clinical trials in the metastatic setting often have limited available archival tissue that might better be used for comprehensive molecular profiling rather than slide-intensive reconfirmation of receptor sta- tus. We developed a Random Forests-based algorithm using a training set of 158 samples with centrally con- firmed IHC status, and subsequently validated this algo- rithm on multiple test sets with known, locally determined IHC status. We observed a strong correlation between target mRNA expression and IHC assays for HER2 and ER, achieving an overall accuracy of 97 and 96 %, respectively. For determining PR status, which had the highest discordance between central and local IHC, incorporation of expression of co-regulated genes in a multivariate approach added predictive value, outper- forming the single, target gene approach by a 10 % margin in overall accuracy.

However, identification of the true degree of stress in its initial stage can reduce the risk of life threatening diseases. In this paper, we proposed a multilevel stress detection system using ultra-short term recordings of a low cost wearable sensor. We designed an experimental paradigm based on Mental Arithmetic Tasks (MAT) to properly stimulate different levels of stress. During the experiment, Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals were recorded along with subjective feedback for validation of stress induction. The beat-to-beat interval series, estimated from sixty seconds long segments of PPG signals, were used to extract different features based on their reliability. In order to capture the temporal information in the ultra-short term segments of PPG, we introduced a new set of features which have the potential to quantify the temporal information at point-to-point level in the Poincare plot. We also used a Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS) algorithm to mitigate the issues of irrelevancy and redundancy among features. We investigated two classifiers based on quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results of the proposed method produced 94.33% accuracy with SVM for five-level identification of mental stress. Moreover, we validated the generalizability of the system by evaluating its performance on a dataset recorded with a different stressor (Stroop). In conclusion, we found that the proposed multilevel stress detection system in conjunction with new parameters of the Poincare plot has the potential to detect five different mental stress states using ultra-short term recordings of a low-cost PPG sensor.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bspc.2019.101736", "venue": "Biomed.

We propose a low-cost unsupervised learning model for 3D objects reconstruction from hand-drawn sketches. Recent advancements in deep learning opened new opportunities to learn high-quality 3D objects from 2D sketches via supervised networks. However, the limited availability of labeled 2D hand-drawn sketches data (i.e. sketches and its corresponding 3D ground truth models) hinders the training process of supervised methods. In this paper, driven by a novel design of combination of retrieval and reconstruction process, we developed a learning paradigm to reconstruct 3D objects from hand-drawn sketches, without the use of well-labeled hand-drawn sketch data during the entire training process. Specifically, the paradigm begins with the training of an adaption network via autoencoder with adversarial loss, embedding the unpaired 2D rendered image domain with the hand-drawn sketch domain to a shared latent vector space. Then from the embedding latent space, for each testing sketch image, we retrieve a few (e.g. five) nearest neighbors from the training 3D data set as prior knowledge for a 3D Generative Adversarial Network. Our experiments verify our network's robust and superior performance in handling 3D volumetric object generation from single hand-drawn sketch without requiring any 3D ground truth labels.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3240508.3240699", "venue": "MM '18", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2897035133", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14176939", "9957731", "2554264", "6325059", "9752191", "163886", "35180139", "6598262", "6020566", "53222540", "5808102", "27009824", "2089020", "32907421", "1360152", "459456", "33350475", "14407363", "14620252", "11758569", "727544", "1545570", "2782113", "2407217", "3151350", "3248075", "206592833", "14083350", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["195750861", "211539299", "210064534"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53038819"}

IDS datasets show limitations in their evaluation of mobile networks since these datasets cover only wired networks. We recommend a new IDS dataset that reflects the characteristics of MANET. The main contribution turns around the integration of an IDS capable of detecting the majority of security attacks occurring in MANETs. We propose a novel approach in collecting the necessary data in order to build the behavioral Database called NetBigData, which contains normal behavior and attacks scenarios. As a matter of fact, we picked up the most common attack in mobile networks, which is Denial of Service (DoS).

Release decisions are characterized by high complexity and have a high impact on project success. Under such conditions, using the experience from past releases could help product managers to take more informed decisions. Goal and research objectives: To make decisions about when to make a release more operational, we formulated release readiness (RR) as a binary classification problem. The goal of our research presented in this paper is twofold: (i) to propose a machine learning approach called RC* (Release readiness Classification applying predictive techniques) with two approaches for defining the training set called incremental and sliding window, and (ii) to empirically evaluate the applicability of RC* for varying project characteristics. Methodology: In the form of explorative case study research, we applied the RC* method to four OSS projects under the Apache Software Foundation. We retrospectively covered a period of 82 months, 90 releases and 3722 issues. We use Random Forest as the classification technique along with eight independent variables to classify release readiness in individual weeks. Predictive performance was measured in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy. Results: The incremental and sliding window approaches respectively achieve an overall 76% and 79% accuracy in classifying RR for four analyzed projects. Incremental approach outperforms sliding window approach in terms of stability of the predictive performance. Predictive performance for both approaches are significantly influenced by three project characteristics i) release duration, ii) number of issues in a release, iii) size of the initial training dataset. Conclusion: As our initial observation we identified, incremental approach achieves higher accuracy when releases have long duration, low number of issues and classifiers are trained with large training set. On the other hand, sliding window approach achieves higher accuracy when releases have short duration and classifiers are trained with small training set.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2961111.2962629", "venue": "ESEM '16", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2523161465", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60804076", "9675583", "17113255", "61038427", "43350122", "14645982", "27214914", "12275190", "1120481"], "inbound_citations": ["1229443", "213176830", "56145949", "53084933"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3065576"}

We identified 480 kek notes of each species and quantitatively characterized them with five standardized acoustic parameters. Overall, nonparametric classification methods outperformed parametric classification methods for species differentiation (nonparametric tools were between 57% and 81% accurate, parametric tools were between 57% and 60% accurate). Of the nine classification methods, Random Forest was the most accurate and precise, resulting in 81.1% correct classification of kek notes to species.

It naturally arises in many data analysis, machine learning, and information retrieval applications to model dependent structures between a pair of data matrices. For computational convenience, existing approaches usually formulate the multiview representation learning as convex optimization problems, where global optima can be obtained by certain algorithms in polynomial time. However, many evidences have corroborated that heuristic nonconvex approaches also have good empirical computational performance and convergence to the global optima, although there is a lack of theoretical justification.

In this paper, we present a web-based management system for network-based intrusion detection and prevention. Users can get access from any mobile devices to see current network status, if there is an incident of network attack in the network environment. Our intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) can be applied with different well-known detection algorithms which are C4.5 Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ripple Rule, Bayesian Network, Back-Propagation Neural Network. These algorithms can give very high detection accuracy for known attacks, where the attack type was previously trained/ learnt by the system. However, when new or unfamiliar/unknown attacks are encountered, the algorithms do not perform well. So, we develop a new detection technique based on Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (Fuzzy GA) to handle the problem. Our IDPS can work in real-time, where detection results will be reported within 2---3 s. The IDPS will automatically protect the network by dropping the malicious network packets or block the network ports that are abused by the attackers. In addition, the proposed IDPS can detect network attacks at different locations inside the network by using several client machines to capture data packets and then send information to the server in order to classify types of network attacks. The proposed IDPS also allows system administrator to update existing detection rule sets or learn new training datasets with a friendly graphic user interface.

We show that, in the case of sparse data representation, the generalization capacity of an SVM trained by using polynomial or Gaussian kernel functions is equal to the one of a linear SVM. This is equivalent to saying that the capacity of separating points of functions belonging to hypothesis spaces induced by polynomial or Gaussian kernel functions reduces to the capacity of a separating hyperplane in the input space. We show that sparse data representations reduce the generalization error as long as the representation is not too sparse, as in the case of very large dictionaries. Dense data representations, on the contrary, reduce the generalization error also in the case of very large dictionaries. We use two different schemes for representing data in overcomplete Haar and Gabor dictionaries, and measure SVM generalization error on bench mark data set.

This paper investigates the abilities of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to predict daily suspended sediment load (SSL) in Doiraj River, located in the west part of Iran. An 11-year data (1994???2004) was applied for predicting SSL. Streamflow and rainfall were used as the model inputs and SSL as the model output. The best input of SVM and ANN models was identified using combination of Gamma Test and Genetic Algorithm (GT???GA). Its results accuracy was compared with the results of conventional correlation coefficient analysis between input and output variables and the best combination was identified. Also, the present study explores Gamma Test to identify the length of the training dataset. Finally, in order to predict SSL, we used the nu-SVR (using the four kernels including linear, polynomial, sigmoid and Radial Basis Function (RBF)) and ANN models (based on BFGS algorithm and Conjugate algorithm). The reliability of SVM and ANN models were evaluated based on performance criteria such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Efficiency Index (EI) and correlation coefficient ( R 2 ). The obtained results show that ANN models and nu-SVR model using Gamma Test for input selection has better performance than regression combination. Also, the performance BFGS-ANN model were better than other models with RMSE value and R 2 equal to 0.34 (ton) and 0.99, respectively. The nu-SVR model with RBF kernel has more capability in prediction of SSL than the other kernels (RMSE = 0.96 (ton) and R 2 = 0.98). In addition, the results show M-test can be used as a new method to determine the number of required data for network training for creating a smooth model by nu-SVR and ANN models.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.11.048", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "2003623399", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10399767", "116176900", "17696888", "8795757", "133234827", "135005567", "3034606", "54045138", "56064268", "158743543", "20677593", "38282967", "126114393", "156701222", "211103097", "154045375", "204882508", "55433570", "113024563", "110182452", "135303811", "125394440", "135165473", "59552976", "17542164", "209479121", "134441500", "115061716", "111121719", "55839331", "212714438", "210876074", "154543361", "117416575", "133792181", "145928226", "37311109", "209005568", "53212526", "207794990", "5556453", "17629985", "131233749", "55131028", "132116491", "208191041", "204854524", "102895351", "198941480", "110213119", "32782962", "202717089", "133874245", "131881464"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129275307"}

Its population status was cause for immediate concern. In order to understand the factors imperiling the species, and provide guidelines for its conservation, we investigated both the species\u2019 distribution and the distribution of areas of suitable habitat using a multiscale approach encompassing species distribution modeling, fieldwork surveys and occupancy models. Of six species distribution models methods used (Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Classification Tree Analysis, Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forest), Random Forest showed the best fit and was utilized to guide field validation. After surveying 59 sites, our results indicated that Formicivora paludicola occurred in only 13 sites, having narrow habitat specificity, and restricted habitat availability. Additionally, historic maps, distribution models and satellite imagery showed that human occupation has resulted in a loss of more than 346 km2 of suitable habitat for this species since the early twentieth century, so that it now only occupies a severely fragmented area (area of occupancy) of 1.42 km2, and it should be considered Critically Endangered according to IUCN criteria. Furthermore, averaged occupancy models showed that marshes with lower cattail (Typha dominguensis) densities have higher probabilities of being occupied. Thus, these areas should be prioritized in future conservation efforts to protect the species, and to restore a portion of Atlantic Forest wetlands, in times of unprecedented regional water supply problems.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4370614", "pubmed_id": "25798608", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0121315", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1983023582", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["91093432", "83608287", "131483519", "84119510", "126738931", "29375694", "129298946", "11806257", "53629746", "6146125", "55704485", "2370659", "53555598", "85805549", "128601280", "130016213", "86284037", "125027286", "142862739", "33779230", "89141", "7192535", "206931371", "38165757", "22763209", "84787996", "16919681", "53609562", "84645867", "82954532", "54735661", "144565557", "10346723", "86383099", "82160124", "16397010", "126671373", "85811619", "53140354", "122830292", "121861644", "26578724", "54751820", "8667013", "86396735", "11652370", "31760434", "129394026", "59134390", "84277854", "45422674", "56438040", "83926905", "87677669", "84562341", "44248777", "84030547"], "inbound_citations": ["29521990", "4640764", "215211381"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5043704"}

This is because large, annotated medical datasets are not only difficult and costly to generate, but also quickly become obsolete due to rapid advances in imaging technology. Image-to-image conditional generative adversarial networks (C-GAN) provide a potential solution for data augmentation. However, annotations used as inputs to C-GAN are typically based only on shape information, which can result in undesirable intensity distributions in the resulting artificially-created images. In this paper, we introduce an active cell appearance model (ACAM) that can measure statistical distributions of shape and intensity and use this ACAM model to guide C-GAN to generate more realistic images, which we call A-GAN. A-GAN provides an effective means for conveying anisotropic intensity information to C-GAN. A-GAN incorporates a statistical model (ACAM) to determine how transformations are applied for data augmentation. Traditional approaches for data augmentation that are based on arbitrary transformations might lead to unrealistic shape variations in an augmented dataset that are not representative of real data. A-GAN is designed to ameliorate this. To validate the effectiveness of using A-GAN for data augmentation, we assessed its performance on cell analysis in adaptive optics retinal imaging, which is a rapidly-changing medical imaging modality. Compared to C-GAN, A-GAN achieved stability in fewer iterations. The cell detection and segmentation accuracy when assisted by A-GAN augmentation was higher than that achieved with C-GAN. These findings demonstrate the potential for A-GAN to substantially improve existing data augmentation methods in medical image analysis.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6834374", "pubmed_id": "31696163", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-32239-7_23", "venue": "Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

The HySOM model, proposed in literature, uses function-level source code metrics to predict fault-prone functions in software systems, without using any fault data. In this paper, we adapt the HySOM approach for object-oriented software systems to predict fault-prone code at class-level granularity using object-oriented source code metrics. This adaptation makes it easier to prioritize the efforts of the testing team as unit tests are often written for classes in object-oriented software systems, and not for methods. Our adaptation also generalizes one main element of the HySOM model, which is the calculation of the source code metrics threshold values. We conducted an empirical study using 12 public datasets. Results show that the adaptation of the HySOM model for class-level fault-proneness prediction improves the consistency and the performance of the model.

These techniques learn a language model or a set of rules from a set of hand-tagged training documents and then apply the model or rules to new texts. Models learned in this manner are effective on documents similar to the set of training documents, but extract quite poorly when applied to documents with a different genre or style which is usually found on web. As a result, this approach has difficulty scaling to the Web due to the diversity of text styles and genres on the Web and the prohibitive cost of creating an equally diverse set of hand tagged documents. In this paper we propose an adaptive IE system which uses Ontology Based Information Extraction techniques that extracts all relations by learning a set of lexico-syntactic patterns unlike WebNLP. It permits greater machine interpretability of content than that supported by XML, RDF and RDF Schema (RDF-S), by providing additional vocabulary along with a formal semantics. So, ontologies represent an ideal knowledge background in which to base text understanding and enable the extraction of relevant information.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2183332064", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2070964", "11708947", "432493", "207628158", "59687", "5739066", "5995937", "7162988", "40622465", "16225547"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61819216"}

In this work we investigate different texture descriptors extracted from colour medical images. We compare and combine these features in order to identify the features set able to properly classify medical images presenting different classification problems. The tested feature sets are based on a generalization of some existent grey scale approaches for feature extraction to colour images. The generalization has been applied to the calculation of Grey-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix, Grey-Level Difference Matrix and Grey-Level Run-Length Matrix. Furthermore, we calculate Grey-Level Run-Length Matrix starting from the Grey-Level Difference Matrix. The resulting feature sets performances have been compared using the Support Vector Machine model. To validate our method we have used three different databases, HistologyDS, Pap-smear and Lymphoma, that present different medical problems and so they represent different classification problems. The obtained experimental results have showed that the features extracted from the generalized Grey-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix perform better than the other set of features, demonstrating also that a combination of features selected from all the feature subsets leads always to better performances.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-20904-3_1", "venue": "ICVS", "journal": null, "mag_id": "764133763", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201067355"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12342883"}

Techniques from the statistical literature to estimate the tuning constant that appears in the SVM and PSVM framework are discussed. Better shrinkage strategies that incorporate more than one tuning constant are suggested. For nonlinear kernels, the minimization problem posed in the PSVM framework is equivalent to finding the posterior mode of a Bayesian model defined through a Gaussian process on the predictor space. Apart from providing new insights, these interpretations help us attach an estimate of uncertainty to our predictions and enable us to build richer classes of models.

In modern days, schedule-based airline maintenance does not consider prediction of faults in advance, which may result in undue maintenance situations where components are still kept in service even though they might have exceeded their defined limit of failure. Therefore, accurate degradation assessment and RUL prediction makes sense on dual fronts of guiding sensible decision-making regarding aviation safety and rational maintenance.

The conceptual similarity among trademarks arises when more than one trademark evokes the same or similar content. To retrieve this semantic content, there is need of semantic retrieval system of trademarks. Thus, this paper represents an enhancement in semantic retrieval system to find similarity between trademarks using thesaurus of Microsoft word application and feature extraction technique i.e., Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and classification is performed using machine learning algorithms i.e., Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM). This system is validated using real 75 infringement cases of trademarks those are conceptual based. The performance is measured using accuracy, precision and recall.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.17485/ijst/2016/v9i35/100363", "venue": null, "journal": "Indian journal of science and technology", "mag_id": "2523890449", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63492274"}

Deep ::: learning has demonstrated cutting-edge performances in computer vision, particularly in ::: object recognition and classi cation.

In recent years, there have been attempts to design machine learning techniques to increase the success of existing automated malware detection and analysis. In this paper, we build a modified Two-hidden-layered Extreme Learning Machine (TELM), which uses the dependency of malware sequence elements in addition to having the advantage of avoiding backpropagation when training neural networks. We achieve this goal by using partially connected networks between the input and the first hidden layer. These are then aggregated with a fully connected network in the second layer. Finally, we utilize an ensemble to improve the accuracy and robustness of the system for malware threat hunting. The proposed method speeds up the training and detection steps of malware hunting, in comparison to stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, this is achieved by avoiding the backpropagation method and using a more simple architecture. Hence, the complexity of our final method is reduced, which leads to better accuracy, higher Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC), in comparison to a standard LSTM with reduced detection time. Our proposed method is especially useful for malware threat hunting in safety-critical systems, such as electronic health or Internet of Battlefield / Military of Things, since the enormous size of the training data makes it impractical to use complex models (e.g., deep neural networks). In addition in safety-critical systems, both training and detection speeds, as well as the detection rate, are equally important. Our research results in a powerful network that can be used for all platforms with a range of malware analysis. The proposed approach is tested on Windows, Ransomware, Internet of Things (IoT) and a mix of different malware samples datasets.

Virtual screening methods act as knowledge-based filters to discover the coveted novel lead molecules possessing desired pharmacological properties.

It has to its credit inherent advantages such as support for noisy data mainly coming from varied high-throughput biological assays, high sensitivity, specificity, prediction accuracy and reduction in false positives. SVM-based classification methods can efficiently discriminate inhibitors from non-inhibitors, actives from inactives, toxic from non-toxic and promiscuous from non-promiscuous molecules. As the principles of drug design are also applicable for agrochemicals, SVM methods are being applied for virtual screening for pesticides too. The current review discusses the basic kernels and models used for binary discrimination and also features used for developing SVM-based scoring functions, which will enhance our understanding of molecular interactions. SVM modeling has also been compared by many researchers with other statistical methods such as Artificial Neural Networks, k-nearest neighbour (kNN), decision trees, partial least squares, etc. Such studies have also been discussed in this review.

Previously, methods for estimating the performance of noisy speech recognition based on spectral distortion measures have been proposed. Although they give an estimate of recognition performance without actually performing speech recognition, the methods cannot be applied to spontaneous speech because they require the reference speech to obtain the distortion values. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method for estimating the recognition performance of spontaneous speech with various speaking styles. The main feature is to use non-reference acoustic features that do not require the reference speech.

In this paper, we propose unsupervised and supervised algorithms for extracting structured data from unstructured ads in the form of (key, value) pairs where the keys naturally represent topicspecific features in the ads. The unsupervised algorithm is centered around building an affinity graph, using the words from a topic-specific corpus of such ads where the edge weights represent affinities between words; the (key, value) extraction algorithm identifies specific groups of words in the affinity graph corresponding to different classes of key attributes. The supervised algorithm uses a Conditional Random Field based training algorithm to identify specific structured (key, value) pairs based on pre-defined topic-specific structural data representations of ads. Based on a corpus of car and apartment ad-postings from Craigslist, the unsupervised algorithm reported an accuracy of 67.74% and 68.74% for car and apartment ads respectively.

The state-of-the-art research proposes semi-automated detection methods for tracking of construction workers and equipment. Considering the number of active equipment and workers on jobsites and their frequency of appearance in a camera's field of view, application of semi-automated techniques can be time-consuming. To address this limitation, a new algorithm based on Histograms of Oriented Gradients and Colors (HOG + C) is proposed. Our proposed detector uses a single sliding window at multiple scales to identify the potential candidates for the location of equipment and workers in 2D. Each detection window is first divided into small spatial regions and then the gradient orientations and hue\u2013saturation colors are locally histogrammed and concatenated to form the HOG + C descriptors. Tiling the sliding detection window with a dense and overlapping grid of formed descriptors and using a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for each resource enables automated 2D detection of workers and equipment. A new comprehensive benchmark dataset containing over 8000 annotated video frames including equipment and workers from different construction projects is introduced. This dataset contains a large range of pose, scale, background, illumination, and occlusion variation. Our preliminary results on detection of standing workers, excavators and dump trucks with an average accuracy of 98.83%, 82.10%, and 84.88% respectively indicate the applicability of the proposed method for automated activity analysis of workers and equipment from single video cameras.

Since multi-locus genomic data are becoming increasingly available, there has been considerable interests in the use of DNA sequence data to delimit species. In this paper, we show that machine learning can be used for species delimitation. There exists no species delimitation methods that are based on machine learning. Our method treats the species delimitation problem as a classification problem. It is a problem of identifying the category of a new observation on the basis of training data. Extensive simulation is first conducted over a broad range of evolutionary parameters for training purpose. Each pair of known populations are combined to form training samples with a label of \u201csame species\u201d or \u201cdifferent species\u201d. We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to train a classifier using a set of summary statistics computed from training samples as features. The trained classifier can classify a test sample to two outcomes: \u201csame species\u201d or \u201cdifferent species\u201d. Given multi-locus genomic data of multiple related organisms or populations, our method (called CLADES) performs species delimitation by first classifying pairs of populations. CLADES then delimits species by maximizing the likelihood of species assignment for multiple populations. CLADES is evaluated through extensive simulation and also tested on real genetic data. We show that CLADES is both accurate and efficient for species delimitation when compared with existing methods. CLADES can be useful especially when existing methods have difficulty in delimitation, e.g. with short species divergence time and gene flow.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/282608", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2790501846", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["3987355", "798966", "22354668", "82739045", "84974974", "82101362", "3159929", "10301651", "205326921", "196679638", "196674489", "35698976", "81017783", "29334259", "4397058", "53677700", "1187526", "1959339", "1195433", "4378331", "38766115", "84222496", "86887788", "2078799", "2490262", "1236469"], "inbound_citations": ["209379331", "73457480"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196635541"}

In this paper we present Interval Based Hierarchical Support Vector Machine (IBH-SVM) for identifying optimal power aware combinations of microarchitectural parameters from this exponentially large design space. The advantage of this formulation is twofold in that it accurately and efficiently finds power aware configurations while considerably decreasing the number of software benchmark simulations needed to select the most appropriate configurations. The reduction in power is not only in terms of the savings on future applications run on these processors, but also on the testing time required during the design phase since suboptimal configurations are ignored early on.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICEAC.2010.5702317", "venue": "2010 International Conference on Energy Aware Computing", "journal": "2010 International Conference on Energy Aware Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2910071884,2537941399,2909397870", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16671173", "1498322", "7977951", "12665452", "1119864", "10692830", "28637672", "5543127"], "inbound_citations": ["14482101"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14097187"}

In the computer aided diagnosis system, we first reduce the noise in the mammograms using an effective noise removal technique. After the noise removal, the mass in the region of interest must be segmented and this segmentation is done using a deformable model. After the mass segmentation, a number of features are extracted from it. These features include: features of the mass shape and border, tissue properties, and the fractal dimension. After extracting a large number of features, a proper subset must be chosen from among them. In this study, we make use of a new method on the basis of a genetic algorithm for selection of a proper set of features. After determining the proper features, a classifier is trained. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: To classify the samples, a new architecture for combination of the classifiers is proposed. In this architecture, easy and difficult samples are identified and trained using different classifiers. Finally, the proposed mass diagnosis system was also tested on mini-Mammographic Image Analysis Society and digital database for screening mammography databases. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The obtained results indicate that the proposed system can compete with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29141776", "doi": "10.1016/j.clbc.2017.05.009", "venue": null, "journal": "Clinical Breast Cancer", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2617546152", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["5904237", "482019", "205706783", "36615468", "123161945", "5905078", "206786900", "24905507", "16634018", "22853731", "1956277", "5870746", "25255951", "34919279", "11572102", "18331486", "1475121", "8507621", "2255366", "109945663", "11347356", "8312711", "6458247", "11509081", "2429832", "12182983", "5670140", "694268"], "inbound_citations": ["53278497"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:40126755"}

For this task, an original ear model is used to calculate indicative features according to the phonetic and phonological matrix of standard Arabic we have established in earlier studies. The second method deals with a set of a simplified version of sub-neural-networks (SNN). A binary sub-task is assigned to these networks with the objective to recognize features as subtle as emphasis, gemination and semantically pertinent lengthening of vowels. This is proposed to be done at two different levels: at the gross level, by identifying the macro-classes, at the finer level, by detecting pertinent temporal distortion and emphasis. Serial and parallel architectures of SNN are investigated. A comparison between the two identification strategies is carried out using stimuli uttered by Algerian native speakers.

In general, stress is an important factor that can influence the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Heart-rate variability (HRV) is known to be related to ANS activity, so we used an HRV derived from the PPG peak interval. In addition, the peak characteristics of the skin conductance (SC) from EDA and SKT variation can also reflect ANS activity; we utilized them as well. Then, we applied a kernel-based extreme-learning machine (K-ELM) to correctly classify the stress levels induced by the VR task to reflect five different levels of stress situations: baseline, mild stress, moderate stress, severe stress, and recovery. Twelve healthy subjects voluntarily participated in the study. Three physiological signals were measured in stress environment generated by VR device. As a result, the average classification accuracy was over 95% using K-ELM and the integrated feature (IT = HRV + SC + SKT).

The usual solution consists in adapting the ML models to comply with the memory and real-time (RT) requirements for inference.

This paper proposes a novel Kernel-based Maximum A Posteriori (KMAP) classification method, which makes a Gaussian distribution assumption instead of a linear separable assumption in the feature space. Robust methods are further proposed to estimate the probability densities, and the kernel trick is utilized to calculate our model. The model is theoretically and empirically important in the sense that: (1) it presents a more generalized classification model than other kernel-based algorithms, e.g., Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA); (2) it can output probability or confidence for classification, therefore providing potential for reasoning under uncertainty; and (3) multi-way classification is as straightforward as binary classification in this model, because only probability calculation is involved and no one-against-one or one-against-others voting is needed.

In this work we present a novel SVM-based multi-class classification approach based on the center of the configuration, a point which is equidistant to all classes. The center of the configuration is obtained from the dual formulation by minimizing the distances between the reduced convex hulls using the l1-norm, while the decision functions are subsequently constructed from this point. This work also extends the ideas of Zhou et al. (2002) [37] to multi-class classification.

Yet, driven by the rapid development of information technology and machine intelligence, the velocity of today's information leads to high market efficiency. Sound financial theories demonstrate that in an efficient marketplace all information available today, including expectations on future events, are represented in today prices whereas future price trend is driven by the uncertainty. This jeopardizes the efforts put in designing prediction models. To deal with the unpredictability of financial systems, today's portfolio management is largely based on the Markowitz framework which puts more emphasis in the analysis of the market uncertainty and less in the price prediction. The limitation of the Markowitz framework stands in taking very strong ideal assumptions about future returns probability distribution. ::: To address this situation we propose PAGAN, a pioneering methodology based on deep generative models. The goal is modeling the market uncertainty that ultimately is the main factor driving future trends. The generative model learns the joint probability distribution of price trends for a set of financial assets to match the probability distribution of the real market. Once the model is trained, a portfolio is optimized by deciding the best diversification to minimize the risk and maximize the expected returns observed over the execution of several simulations. Applying the model for analyzing possible futures, is as simple as executing a Monte Carlo simulation, a technique very familiar to finance experts.

To avoid accidents, drivers must adapt their driving style according to the road status. This adaptation mechanism depends on the driver ability to detect the pavement conditions. Unfortunately, this is often a difficult task. A system capable of notifying the driver about changes on the road surface due to weather aspects, could improve this adaptation mechanism, thus reducing accident risk. An electronic system capable of estimating the road surface status between dry and wet status is presented. The system is mainly based on the analysis of the tyre/road noise generated during driving. The sound emission pattern of the tyre/road interaction changes depending on whether the pavement is dry or wet. Thus discriminating the tyre/road noise acoustic footprint, it is possible to estimate the road status. Proposed system captures and digitizes tyre/road noise. Rolling noise is pre-processed extracting its spectral components to construct the feature vectors. Feature vectors are processed by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier. Then the classifier outputs the road surface status estimation. The first implementation of the system, using Matlab along with pre-recorded tyre/road noise, shows high success rates (around 91%).

Such data pose severe computational barriers for SVM and other kernel methods, especially if all pairwise data point similarities are requested.

A possible solution is clustering as preprocessing and classification on the more informative resulting data like cluster centers. Clustering variants which avoid the computation of all pairwise similarities robustly filter useful information from the large imbalanced credit client data set, especially when used in conjunction with a symbolic cluster representation.

Concurrently, the development of Web 2.0 technologies and applications has provided new opportunities and challenges for web-based information system and user interactions: novel features of social interactions as well as new usability and visualization model are having an impact on how people search, navigate and rank digital objects (being multimedia content like music or movies or - as in the case of Autonomous Digital Libraries - digital publications): as an example a simple quick glance at a user-based ``cloud of tags'' for a given Journal may now provide us a lot of information about its content and/or the way that the specific Journal is perceived by the people reading it. ::: ::: In this thesis we have tackled two open research dimension in state-of-the-art Autonomous Digital Libraries, namely: ::: ::: 1. Automated key-phrases/tags extraction from digital scientific contributions (papers): the ever increasing dimensionality of modern ADLs does not permit realistic manual documents processing and needs efficient and high quality methods for automatic or semi-automatic key-phrases extractions. ::: ::: 2. Exploration of current metrics and proposal of novel metrics for ranking of digital objects in order to improve the navigation within a large number of objects present in modern ADL. ::: ::: Moreover, we have implemented a prototype for a Digital Library interface capable to integrate the tools developed on the base of the results obtained in the above research directions. The prototype supports the user: (1) in the search of documents related to a topic - using the novel semi-automatic key-phrases extractions techniques proposed in this work; and (2) in the navigation and identification of ``relevant'' documents for a given topic based on a number of user-selectable relevance metrics. ::: ::: The first challenge we met in our work has been the lack of large, high quality and publicly available document datasets containing both the full text and human (experts) assigned key-phrases to be used for analytical assessment. Thus we constructed one from available public content sources and curated metadata repositories. Our dataset (named in the following as Trento Computer Science (TCS) dataset) consists in a subset of 2000 scientific papers published within 2003 and 2006 in Computer Science domain in the ACM Digital Library. The TCS dataset consists of the full text of papers, curated metadata (authors, title, affiliations, references etc.) and human (both authors and curators) assigned key-phrases. The original paper type (typically PDF, PS or LaTeX) has been processed and transformed into a textual format with the support of commercial pdf-to-text transformations tool and refined with the support of maximum entropy machine learning in order to improve the final quality of the full-texts. ::: ::: For the semi-supervised key-phrases/tags extraction task we have compared several Machine Learning techniques - namely, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines a novel Fast Local Kernel SVM and the Naive Bayes learning-based system KEA on the same TCS dataset. In particular, we have performed a number of experiments and explored in details the effect of including in the chosen feature sets linguistic and domain specific knowledge. In our experiments, Random Forest has been identified as the most precise method outperforming KEA (used as baseline for key-phrases extraction) by 36\\% when using a novel feature sets including linguistic and domain specific knowledge. Moreover, compared with the other Machine Learning techniques, Random Forest is the best trade-off between accuracy and computational speed. ::: ::: The second task taken on by this thesis - navigation and ranking - relates to the large dimensionality of current ADL. In fact, in the presence of a huge quantity of documents connected to a specific topic, it is hard to navigate and find ``interesting'' contributions. The challenge here is to be able to identify the most important set of papers in a specific topic or for a particular author. A number of used metrics are available for this task, namely citation count for papers and Hirsch-index for authors. We have applied them as well as novel metrics based on the PageRank metric, named PaperRank, Focused PaperRank and PaperRank h-index, that captures - where data is available - more information present in complete citation graphs. As part of our analysis, we have developed methods and tools for qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing metrics that evaluate content and people. We have used them to explore the differences between various metrics as well as to understand in more details what do they measure. We also believe, that these methods and tools could successfully be used to compare rankings in different domains (search engine, review processes, etc.). ::: We have carried out an extensive investigation of the various ranking metrics on the dataset of over 266,000 scientific papers, and related citation graphs. We discovered that the difference in ranking results is indeed very significant for the different metrics and investigated in details the reasons of this difference. ::: ::: Although initially this research has started as an independent line of research, it has found a significant number of important interactions with the European FET-Open project LiquidPub.

For estimating the sparse signal, without the need of estimating the sparse noise, we construct a robust Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). In the RVM, sparse noise and ever present dense noise are treated through a combined noise model. The precision of combined noise is modeled by a diagonal matrix. We show that the new RVM update equations correspond to a non-symmetric sparsity inducing cost function. Further, the combined modeling is found to be computationally more efficient.

With the proliferation of data, it becomes unmanageable to process the growing stream of information. So this paper focuses on (1) different Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to make tweets suitable for applying ML algorithms, (2) Different word-embeddings to create a more domain specific semantic space and address dimension reduction for efficiently analyzing tweets, (3) comparative analysis of different state-of-the-art ML algorithms (classifiers) which can be applied to categorize crisis-related tweets with a higher accuracy. The experiments have been done on six different crisis related datasets, each approximately consisting of 10,000 tweets.

However their computational time in the object recognition phase is often large due to the number of classifications per scene and to the feature vector size, especially when the feature space is formed from raw image data. Several methods are reported in the literature to make the classification faster, as selecting only the most significant support vectors or reducing the feature vector length by image transforms (Wavelets, PCA) prior to SVM training and classification. The method we propose is different in principle. Instead of applying the transform prior to training and thus changing the representation space, we only perform a unitary orthogonal real transform in the classification phase on the resulting support vectors and on the pattern to be classified. As the inverse matrices of these transforms are exactly the transposed of the transform matrices, we mathematically prove that the dot product of any two vectors has the same expression in the original and the transformed space. This, combined with the energy compaction property of a suitable transform, leads to a faster computation of the dot products, if the transform has a fast implementation algorithm. We use the discrete cosine transform (DCT) due to its good energy compaction on digital images.

However, the accuracy and generality of the previously introduced biomarkers are not acceptable for reliable usage in independent datasets. This inadequacy is attributed to ignoring gene interactions by simple feature selection methods, due to their computational burden. In this study, an integrated approach with low computational cost was proposed for identifying a more predictive gene signature, for prediction of breast cancer recurrence. First, a small set of genes was primarily selected as signature by an appropriate filter feature selection (FFS) method. Then, a binary sub-class of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was used to expand the primary set by adding adjacent proteins of each gene signature from the PPI-network. Subsequently, the support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination (SVMRFE) method was applied to the expression level of all the genes in the expanded set. Finally, the genes with the highest score by SVMRFE were selected as the new biomarkers. Accuracy of the final selected biomarkers was evaluated to classify four datasets on breast cancer patients, including 800 cases, into two cohorts of poor and good prognosis.

Pretransplant donor biopsy materials are evaluated by the pathologists, and degree of steatosis, especially large droplet steatosis (LDS) which is described as lipid droplets with a diameter of at least 15 micron, is estimated under light microscope. But when doing so, there can be great intra- and inter-observer variability. In order to overcome this problem several automated systems and image analysis methods are used. Aims The most challenging issue for automated steatosis image analysis is to distinguish real oil droplets from sinusoidal regions. Although some morphometric features are employed to make this discrimination, whole feature space could not be represented for a fatty liver cell. In this study we have contributed a new approach, which tries to solve this discrimination issue with an artificial learning system. Methods Ten consecutive hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained, formalin fixed paraffin embedded donor liver biopsies, reported by 2 pathologist, were evaluated by a third pathologist and steatosis percentage was given as total and LDS by using the percentage of area occupied by lipid droplets to total biopsy area. Automated image analysis was performed on about 200 photographs taken to represent the whole biopsy at X20 magnification by Zeiss Axio Scope.A1 microscope using Kameram\u2122 software and established as percentage of LDS to total biopsy area. Segmented positive (oil) and negative (non- oil) components are labeled by an expert pathologist and after some preprocesses they are fed to an Artificial Neural Network for training. We have used about 1000 droplets for training and 1500 droplets for performance evaluation. The proposed scheme is utilized to calculate liver fat ratio on digital images and the results are compared with expert\u2019s opinions. Results There was great variation among pathologists and when compared to the automated analysis and pathologists were prone to overestimate the steatosis (Table 1). As this overestimation can lead to nonuse of the donor liver, the accurate assessment of the steatosis is critical. Since the biopsy is the gold standard for the assessment of steatosis, methodology of this examination should be as objective as possible. Our results show that automated assessment of liver steatosis is very useful in order not to loose donor livers, by overestimation.

Previous research points to their inability to adapt to the peculiarities of projects and their high rate of false positives as the main obstacles of their adoption. ::: ::: We propose empirically-grounded analysis to improve the adaptability and efficiency of bug detection and prediction tools.

We analyze the null dereferencing problem and find that its root cause lies in methods that return null. We propose an empirical solution to this problem that depends on the wisdom of the crowd.

On the other hand, online training is easily affected by noise.

The Offline model acts as a bias for the Online model to select new data to learn from. The Online model retains its knowledge and adapts to the changing ground truth.

These models are trained to recognize 12 most common poly(A) motifs in human DNA. Our predictors are available as a free web-based tool accessible at http://cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/dps. Compared with other reported predictors, our models achieve higher sensitivity and specificity and furthermore provide a consistent level of accuracy for 12 poly(A) motif variants. ::: ::: Contact: vladimir.bajic@kaust.edu.sa ::: ::: Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3244764", "pubmed_id": "22088842", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btr602", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "mag_id": "2099305989", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53303493"}

This paper proposes a relatively simpler and faster method that involves only signal processing procedures. The prediction of the EQ occurrence estimation using a combination of singular value decomposition (SVD)-based technique for feature extraction and support vector machine (SVM) classifier is presented in this paper. Using the proposed method, the Earth\u2019s electric field signal is transformed into a new domain using SVD-based approach. In this approach, the time domain signal is projected on the left eigenvectors of impulse response matrix of the linear prediction coefficient (LPC) filter. Several features have been extracted from the transformed signal. These features are used as input for the SVM classifier in order to predict the location of the forthcoming EQ. Once the location is determined, a similar approach is used to estimate its magnitude. Finally, the time estimation of the forthcoming EQ is estimated based on the statistical observation. The occurred EQs during 2008 in Greece are used to train the classifiers, whereas those occurred from 2003 to 2010 in the same region are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. In predicting the location of the future EQs, the proposed system could achieve 77% accuracy. As for the magnitude prediction, the proposed system provides an accuracy of 66.67%. Moreover, the predicted time for the EQ with magnitude greater than $\\bf {Ms} = 5$ is 2 days ahead, whereas for magnitude greater than $\\bf {Ms} = 6$ is up to 7 days ahead.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2321972", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2044934736", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["53021195", "40706523", "36847930", "55435239", "39468270", "54808112", "11209762", "129232970", "128860852", "127344265", "55143707", "14285463", "31187014", "129652176", "15809555", "6996160", "38737123", "10983359", "13391792"], "inbound_citations": ["54621738", "140219376", "49652926", "208207431", "4711359"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38808286"}

In a practical context where the task is applied to predict students early in their learning path, two issues have to be addressed. The first issue is the completeness of data in both model construction and prediction of new data, while the latter refers to the number of labeled data in model construction. Nonetheless, a few works considered this practical context thoroughly. In order to manage these issues, we propose a self-training algorithm using $k$ -means and random forest models, named $k$ -meansTriForest. Our algorithm is regarded as a solution to the program-level student classification task in the aforementioned practical context. $k$ -means helps us form a cluster-based incomplete data imputation method. Random forests play an important role of base classifiers of an ensemble in our algorithm. Besides, the Tri-training styled unlabeled instance selection is defined so that our algorithm can remove the burden of probability threshold settings from its users. Moreover, in our algorithm, the diversity of the base classifiers can be preserved when the unlabeled data set can be exploited and the labeled data set can be enhanced over time. As a result, our algorithm outperforms the previous ones in the related works on three real educational data sets, in order to classify students into the groups with different final study status at three different points in time.

In this work, we establish a unified theory for a general class of nonconvex penalized SVMs. We first prove that in ultra-high dimensions, there exists one local minimizer to the objective function of nonconvex penalized SVMs possessing the desired oracle property. We further address the problem of nonunique local minimizers by showing that the local linear approximation algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the oracle estimator even in the ultra-high dimensional setting if an appropriate initial estimator is available.

The sample was split into training (n=106) and test sets (n=10), the latter of which contained one SICH-to-be subject every time, repeated with different combinations 1760 times. Raw CT-scans were spatially normalised and input into a Support Vector Machine (SVM), adjusted for clinical severity. Performance of the SVM was compared with validated prognostication tools (SEDAN and HAT scores), by assessing area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), and success on 1/10 forced-choice tests. Results AUC of the SVM (0.72) compared favourably with that of SEDAN and HAT scores (0.63\u20130.71). The SVM also identified 9/16 SICHs on forced-choice tests, as opposed to 1/4 using prognostic scores.

In this work, we present a method to photometrically classify type Ia supernovae based on machine learning with redshifts that are derived from the SN light-curves. This method is implemented on real data from the SNLS deferred pipeline, a purely photometric pipeline that identifies SNe Ia at high-redshifts ($0.2<z<1.1$). Our method consists of two stages: feature extraction (obtaining the SN redshift from photometry and estimating light-curve shape parameters) and machine learning classification. We study the performance of different algorithms such as Random Forest and Boosted Decision Trees. We evaluate the performance using SN simulations and real data from the first 3 years of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), which contains large spectroscopically and photometrically classified type Ia samples. Using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric, where perfect classification is given by 1, we find that our best-performing classifier (Extreme Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) has an AUC of $0.98$. We show that it is possible to obtain a large photometrically selected type Ia SN sample with an estimated contamination of less than $5\\%$. When applied to data from the first three years of SNLS, we obtain 529 events. We investigate the differences between classifying simulated SNe, and real SN survey data.

In contrast to past approaches using imaging modalities that tend to be either expensive or intrusive, we consider single-pixel thermopile sensors for people counting. These sensors may already be deployed as part of a smart lighting system to provide temperature data for HVAC controls. Firstly, a statistical sensor model for thermopile temperature measurements is proposed. The proposed people counting method enhances the CUSUM RLS algorithm to estimate temperature change caused by people entering or leaving. We estimate mean temperature changes upon detection of an occupancy event, and then estimate the people count using a maximum likelihood on the estimated temperature change. Finally, PIR vacancy data is merged with the people count estimation to increase accuracy. We obtain an average counting error of 0.11 and 0.19 for 90% of the instants respectively when considering 15 minute windows for simulated and experimental datasets. A second aspect of the thesis considers the problem of commissioning plan detection. We leverage the two-sided CUSUM signals to address this problem. The two-sided CUSUM scores for a pair of sensors are used to calculate similarity measures; these features are used in a Random Forest Classifier to detect commissioning changes of the sensor pair. Using simulated data with the thermopile signal model, we show that the proposed method achieves a true positive rate (determining the correct layout) of 90.2% and false positive rate of 1.3%.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "3006725853", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214232390"}

The alternative of ignoring plausibly relevant features is certainly no better, and the resulting trade-off substantially limits the application of matching methods to \"wide\" datasets. Instead, Li and Fu (2017) recasts the problem of matching in a metric learning framework that maps features to a low-dimensional space that facilitates \"closer matches\" while still capturing important aspects of unit-level heterogeneity. However, that method lacks key theoretical guarantees and can produce inconsistent estimates in cases of heterogeneous treatment effects.

In this study, we computationally analyzed the whole proteome data of six model species to overview the protein diversity in the three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota), especially focusing on the above two protein families. To compare the protein distribution among the six model species, we calculated various protein profiles: hydropathy, molecular weight, amino acid composition and periodicity for each protein. We found a domain-specific distribution of the proteome based on 2D correlation analysis of hydropathy and molecular weight. Further, the merged protein distribution of Archaea and other domains revealed many membrane proteins localized in Bacteria-specific regions with a high ratio of hydropathy and many DNA/RNA-binding proteins localized in Eukaryotaspecific regions with a low ratio of hydropathy. Since about half of the proteins encoded in the genome are still functionally unknown, we further conducted Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based functional prediction using amino acid composition (CO score) and periodicity (PD score) as feature vectors to predict the overall number of DNA/RNA-binding proteins and membrane proteins in the proteome.

Our results on a UCI EEG dataset show that using both Channel-wise and Image-wise autoencoders achieve good performance for a classification problem with state of art accuracy in both within-subject and cross-subject tests. A further experiment using shared weights shows that the shared weights technique only slightly influenced learning but it reduced training time significantly.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-04239-4_50", "venue": "ICONIP", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2901383445", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203605251", "203605640", "203605640"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54446523"}

Both steps use normal data only; thus our anomaly detection falls into the semi-supervised anomaly detection category, which is advantageous for industrial asset condition monitoring where abnormal or faulty data is rare. Using the data collected from a real-world gas turbine combustion system, we demonstrate that our proposed approach achieved a good detection performance (AUC) of 0.9706 \u00b1 0.0029. Furthermore, we compare the detection performance of the proposed approach against that of other different designs, including different features (i.e., the deep learned, handcrafted and PCA features) and different detection models (i.e., one-class ELM, one-class SVM, isolation forest, and Gaussian mixture model).

However, the predictive power of these variables is not validated in large multicenter settings. ::: DESIGN/METHODS: This analysis was carried out with complete 6 month clinical and imaging data from 914 RRMS subjects enrolled in the CombiRx trial, a multi-center, phase-III investigation of combination therapy. We evaluated 35 variables independent of treatment arm assignment to predict confirmed disability progression (CDP). CDP was defined as a 1.0 increase in EDSS from baseline when baseline \u2264 5.0, or 0.5 increase when baseline \u8805 5.5 sustained for at least 6 months. Three models were developed: 1) using baseline clinical and demographic data, 2) model 1 plus baseline MRI metrics, and 3) model 1 plus EDSS and MRI changes within the first 6 months on study. First, Support Vector Machine-based feature selection process was used to rank the variables. Second, based on the selected predictors, a non-linear approach using machine learning classifiers was applied, validated by a 10 fold cross-validation method. ::: RESULTS: Clinical data at baseline accurately predicted CDP progression in 73% of patients. Adding baseline MRI measures did not appreciably improve classification accuracy. However, adding the first 6 months on-treatment clinical and MRI changes improved the predictive power to 85%. Model 3 mainly retained the variables: baseline EDSS, and 6 month change in EDSS scores, MRI lesion volumes, normalized CSF values, and GM volumes. ::: CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the usefulness of machine learning classifiers to predict CDP in a rather homogenous and early cohort of RRMS patients. Our results suggest that early on-treatment MRI changes are important for predicting clinical outcomes. ::: Study Supported by: NINDS (UO1NS045719, R21NS41986) with study agents kindly provided by Biogen Idec and Teva Pharmaceutical.

In this paper we introduce a novel generative model to craft systematic poisoning attacks against machine learning classifiers generating adversarial training examples, i.e. samples that look like genuine data points but that degrade the classifier's accuracy when used for training.

We curate tasks into specific training, validation, and test splits to ensure that each task tests biologically relevant generalization that transfers to real-life scenarios. We bench-mark a range of approaches to semi-supervised protein representation learning, which span recent work as well as canonical sequence learning techniques. We find that self-supervised pretraining is helpful for almost all models on all tasks, more than doubling performance in some cases. Despite this increase, in several cases features learned by self-supervised pretraining still lag behind features extracted by state-of-the-art non-neural techniques. This gap in performance suggests a huge opportunity for innovative architecture design and improved modeling paradigms that better capture the signal in biological sequences.

However, capturing HDR microscopic video is much more challenging. In this dissertation, an HDR microscopic video system based on GPU accelerated computing is presented. By combining CPU and GPU computing, it is possible to build a stable HDR video system using a single off-the-shelf camera. The computing efficiency analysis shows that capturing multiple frames of different exposure intervals, aligning consecutive neighbouring frames, constructing HDR radiance map and tone mapping the radiance map for display, can all be realised by using GPU computing to accelerate the processing speed. The experimental results were presented to show the effectiveness of the system and how HDR video can reveal much more detail than conventional videos. ::: The idea of employing HDR imaging technology in 3D surface construction has been proposed as a solution to the Shape From Focus limitation. Shape From Focus (SFF) is the most effective technique for recovering 3D object shape in optical microscopic scenes. Although numerous methods have recently been proposed, less attention has been paid to the quality of source images, which directly affects the accuracy of 3D shape recovery. One of the critical factors impacting source image quality is the high dynamic range issue, which is caused by the gap between the high dynamic ranges of the real world scenes and the low dynamic range images that the cameras capture. To overcome this issue, a novel microscopic 3D shape recovery system based on high dynamic range (HDR) imaging technique is proposed. By combining SFF and HDR, it is possible to build a robust 3D system using a single off-the-shelf camera and a traditional optical microscope. Experiments on constructing 3D shapes of difficult-to-image materials have been conducted, in terms of metal and shining plastic surfaces where conventional imaging techniques will have difficulty capturing detail, and will thus result in poor 3D reconstruction. The experimental results show the proposed HDR-based SFF 3D method yields more accurate and robust results than traditional non-HDR techniques for a variety materials. ::: After the analysis of HDR and Shape From Focus techniques, another project about microscopy was presented, which is tuberculosis bacteria detection. Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease in low- and middle-income countries. There are many tools behind physical examinations for TB detection, but the most effective method is visual examination using microscopes, in terms of fluorescent microscopy and bright field microscopy. However, the former method is on average 10% more sensitive than the latter. This project not only aims to detect tuberculosis automatically to help technicians, but also aims at the construction of a subsequent autofocus system based on the detection of tuberculosis. The focus analysis, which is the initial step of shape from the focus technique, acted on the region of tuberculosis exists, regardless of the other areas. In this case, a new TB detection method based on Random Forest using fluorescent microscopic images was presented. Experiments on three types of classifiers, in terms of Random Forest (RF), linear SVM (LinSVM), Cross-Validation SVM (CVSVM), were conducted. The experimental results indicate that the RF-based learning method for TB bacteria classification using fluorescent images achieved higher performance than the other two machine learning methods.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2765185785", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116303624"}

Broadly, the Figure of Merit measures the within-cluster variance of features of the data that were not available to the clustering algorithm. Using this metric, Yeung et al. found no clustering algorithms that reliably outperformed k-means on a suite of real world datasets (Yeung et al. 2001). This paper presents a novel clustering algorithm, intra-feature random forest clustering (IRFC), that does outperform k-means on a variety of real world datasets per this metric.

Departments of Transportation (DOTs) continually collect traffic count using both permanent count stations (i.e., Automatic Traffic Recorders or ATRs) and temporary short-term count stations. In South Carolina, 87% of the ATRs are located on interstates and arterial highways. For most secondary highways (i.e., collectors and local roads), AADT is estimated based on short-term counts. This paper develops AADT estimation models for different roadway functional classes with two machine learning techniques: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The models aim to predict AADT from short-term counts. The results are first compared against each other to identify the best model. Then, the results of the best model are compared against a regression method and factor-based method. The comparison reveals the superiority of SVR for AADT estimation for different roadway functional classes over all other methods. Among all developed models for different functional roadway classes, the SVR-based model shows a minimum root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.22 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 11.3% for the interstate/expressway functional class. This model also shows a higher R-squared value compared to the traditional factor-based model and regression model. SVR models are validated for each roadway functional class using the 2016 ATR data and selected short-term count data collected by the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT).

HRCT can provide accurate information for the detection of various obstructive lung diseases, including centrilobular emphysema, panlobular emphysema and bronchiolitis obliterans. Features on HRCT images can be subtle, however, particularly in the early stages of disease, and image-based diagnosis is subject to inter-observer variation. To automate the diagnosis and improve the accuracy, we compared three types of automated classification systems, naA\u00afve Bayesian classifier, ANN (Artificial Neural Net) and SVM (Support Vector Machine), based on their ability to differentiate among normal lung and three types of obstructive lung diseases. To assess the performance and cross-validation of these three classifiers, 5 folding methods with 5 randomly chosen groups were used. For a more robust result, each validation was repeated 100 times. SVM showed the best performance, with 86.5% overall sensitivity, significantly different from the other classifiers (one way ANOVA, p<0.01). We address the characteristics of each classifier affecting performance and the issue of which classifier is the most suitable for clinical applications, and propose an appropriate method to choose the best classifier and determine its optimal parameters for optimal disease discrimination.

The recognition algorithms based on deep learning usually rely on large-scale labeled training datasets, the recognition performance of these algorithms will be low when the labeled neonatal pain expression image dataset is small. To overcome these drawbacks, we present a neonatal pain expression recognition approach based on pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model with transfer learning. In this work, the introduction of transfer learning technology avoids the occurrence of over-fitting and accelerate the training procedure. Firstly, some typical DCNNs which have been trained on the ImageNet dataset, such as AlexNet, VGG-16, Inception- V3,ResNet-50 and Xception, are selected as the basic models to extract the general features of images. Then, in order to enhance the generalization ability of the DCNNs, the pre-trained DCNNs are fine-tuned by using the neonatal pain expression image dataset, and so that the feature transfer from the general image to the neonatal expression image is realized. Finally, we use different transfer learning methods to test the fine-tuned DCNN models. The experiment results show that the fine-tuned VGG-16 model achieved the best recognition accuracy (78.3 %) on the small neonatal pain expression image dataset, which indicates that the fine-tuning method can effectively obtain a DCNN model with good performance, and the transfer learning is an effective method for training DCNN when the available labeled training dataset is small.

With this new setup, a geometrical character based approach is introduced for the negative obstacle detection. Two cues, the width and the back of the negative obstacle are taken into consideration in this paper. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed to classify negative obstacles from the background.

Genomic alterations, resulting in specific RNA-expression patterns, accumulate during CRC pathogenesis, including the premalignant adenoma stage. Aim This study aimed to investigate whether differentiation of colorectal neoplasia into CMS classes can already be recognized at the adenoma stage, and whether specific CMS classes could be associated with DNA copy number aberrations that mark adenomas at high-risk of progressing to CRC. Materials and Methods RNA-sequencing was performed on 62 advanced adenomas and 59 CRCs. DNA copy number analysis in adenomas was performed by low-coverage DNA-sequencing (n=30) or array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization (n=32). Microsatellite instability (MSI) status was determined by PCR methods. Adenomas and CRCs were classified into CMS subtypes together with CRCs (n=556) from The Cancer Genome Atlas, using the Random Forest CMS classifier. Results The majority of the adenomas were classified as CMS3 (n=45; 72%), the 9metabolic subtype9, recognized as least common among CRCs. No adenomas were classified as the 9mesenchymal9 CMS4 subtype. One adenoma was classified as the 9MSI immune9 CMS1 (2%), and 8 adenomas as the 9canonical9 CMS2 (13%) type. The remaining 8 (13%) could not be classified. The CMS3 class was enriched with adenomas at low-risk of progression. Conclusion Most adenomas were successfully classified. The lack of CMS4 adenomas is consistent with the fact that adenomas lack invasion-associated stroma. Adenomas showing cancer-associated chromosomal instability (CIN) or MSI (24%) were mostly classified as CMS2 and CMS1, respectively. The CMS3 subtype appeared to be the predominant adenoma signature.

Existing adaptive graph learning methods are based on either original data or linearly projected data and thus rely on the assumption that either representation is a good indicator of the underlying data structure. However, this assumption is sometimes not met in high dimensional data. Studies have shown that high-dimensional data in many problems tend to lie on an embedded nonlinear manifold structure. Motivated by this observation, in this paper, we develop dual data representations, i.e., original data and a nonlinear embedding of the data obtained via an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)-based neural network, and propose to use them as the more reliable basis for graph learning. The resulting algorithm based on ELM and Constrained Laplacian Rank (ELM-CLR) further improves the clustering capability and robustness, while retaining the advantages of adaptive graph learning, such as not requiring any post-processing to extract cluster indicators.

Multiple Facebook posts prompted users to sign a fake petition in defence of the Uruguayan player, who was banned for biting an opponent. 2 OSM activity rises manifold during events like sports, natural calamities etc. [4], thus making Facebook an even more lucrative breeding ground for spammers. The aforementioned spam activity indicates that existing approaches being used by Facebook [3] do not suffice in countering spam, especially during events, when their spread is maximum.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is chosen as the expert selection strategy along with the Bayesian combination method to merge the outputs of the selected classifiers as well as evaluate the fitness of the selected candidates. The proposed system performs in two steps. The first step is focuses on creating various numbers of baseline classifiers for NER with different features sets using the Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).

Two comprehensive corpora from BioCreative events, namely ChemDNER and CEMP, are used for the experiments conducted. Results show that the ensemble of classifiers selected by means of the proposed approach perform better than the single best classifier as well as ensembles formed using other popular selection/combination strategies for both corpora.

Unfortunately, the performance of existing sparse metric learning approaches is usually limited because the authors assumed certain problem relaxations or they target the SML objective indirectly. In this paper, we propose a Generalized Sparse Metric Learning method (GSML). This novel framework offers a unified view for understanding many of the popular sparse metric learning algorithms including the Sparse Metric Learning framework proposed, the Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN), and the D-ranking Vector Machine (D-ranking VM). Moreover, GSML also establishes a close relationship with the Pairwise Support Vector Machine.

Unlike previous methods of predicting collar dimensions around a bridge pier, the proposed approach concerns the selection of different collar dimension sizes around a bridge scour in terms of the flume\u05f3s upstream ( L uc / D ), downstream ( L dc / D ) and width ( L w / D ) of the flume. The projected determination method involves utilizing Expert Multi Agent System (E-MAS) based Support Vector Regression (SVR) agents with respect to cooperative-based expert SVR (Co-ESVR). The SVR agents (i.e. SVR Luc , SVR Ldc and SVR Lw ) are set around a rectangular collar to predict the collar dimensions around a bridge pier. In the first layer, the Expert System (ES) is adopted to gather suitable data and send it to the next layer. The multi agent-based SVR adjusts its parameters to find the optimal cost prediction function in the collar dimensions around the bridge pier to reduce the collar around the bridge scour. The weighted sharing strategy was utilized to select the cost optimization function through the root mean square error (RMSE). The efficiency of the proposed optimization method (Co-ESVR) was explored by comparing its outcomes with experimental results. Numerical results indicate that the Co-ESVR achieves better accuracy in reducing the percentage of scour depth ( r e ) with a smaller network size, compared to the non-cooperative approaches.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2014.03.024", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2027875119", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11685365", "128493853", "140151858", "109512001", "129661576", "130225218", "110915663", "109180922", "129851209", "108201011", "140611025", "110336213", "132365306", "127383598", "121804905", "108726549", "120865626", "108871820", "207637928", "39563693", "121160997", "207588936", "4791737", "40799678", "9097877", "119626756", "206787478", "14727192", "207579947", "33827786", "3036436", "130003173", "11828185", "129109825", "15480929", "7991478", "60746648", "18683182", "110674171", "10610820", "39586285", "39157230", "207654576", "7626668", "44750454", "6441960", "128402690", "16389135"], "inbound_citations": ["3583932", "7640528", "109930280", "54781521", "123566262", "18750144"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10642045"}

Pan-Tompkins algorithm and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) methods were used for extracting critical points such as QRS complex, PR, ST and QT of ECG signal. Afterwards, Traditional Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was implemented to the ECG signal. Finally, Genetic Algorithm on software Genetic Algorithm Wavelet Kernel Extreme Learning Machine was improved for the determination of the coefficients, which were used in the Wavelet Kernel Extreme Learning Machine algorithm, in which wavelet function was accomplished. In this scope, it was observed that best classification performance values were reached to Acc 95%, Se 100% and Spe 80% with the implementation developed with the Genetic algorithm.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.11.065", "venue": null, "journal": "Optik", "mag_id": "2901544499", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201722947", "208205967", "195354227", "209071987", "71145491"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126160658"}

Our proposed VariGANs model generates the target image in a coarse-to-fine manner instead of a single pass which suffers from severe artifacts. It first performs variational inference to model global appearance of the object (e.g., shape and color) and produce a coarse image with a different view. Conditioned on the generated low resolution images, it then proceeds to perform adversarial learning to fill details and generate images of consistent details with the input.

In fact, it has been proved that choosing the number of hidden nodes equal to the number of training samples yields a perfect training classification with probability 1 (w.r.t. the random parameter initialization). In this article we argue that in spite of this, in some cases it may be beneficial to choose a much larger number of hidden nodes, depending on certain properties of the data.

There are two major ILP approaches: top-down and bottom-up. The former searches the hypothesis space from general to specific while the latter the other way round. Integrating both approaches has been demonstrated to be more effective. Integrated ILP systems were previously developed for two tasks: learning semantic parsers (CHILLIN), and mining relational data (PROGOL). Two new integrated ILP systems for these tasks that overcome limitations of existing methods will be presented. ::: COCKTAIL is a new ILP algorithm for inducing semantic parsers. For this task, two features of a parse state, functional structure and context, provide important information for disambiguation. A bottom-up approach is more suitable for learning the former, while top-down is better for the latter. By allowing both approaches to induce program clauses and choosing the best combination of their results, COCKTAIL learns more effective parsers. Experimental results on learning natural-language interfaces for two databases demonstrate that it learns more accurate parsers than CHILLIN, the previous best method for this task. ::: BETH is a new integrated ILP algorithm for relational data mining. The Inverse Entailment approach to ILP, implemented in the P ROGOL and ALEPH systems, starts with the construction of a bottom clause, the most specific hypothesis covering a seed example. When mining relational data with a large number of background facts, the bottom clause becomes intractably large, making learning very inefficient. A top-down approach heuristically guides the construction of clauses without building a bottom clause; however, it wastes time exploring clauses that cover no positive examples. By using a top-down approach to heuristically guide the construction of generalizations of a bottom clause, BETH combines the strength of both approaches. Learning patterns for detecting potential terrorist activity is a current challenge problem for relational data mining. Experimental results on artificial data for this task with over half a million facts show that BETH is significantly more efficient at discovering such patterns than ALEPH and M-F OIL, two leading ILP systems.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2108351235", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33611313"}

However, Cluster based Communication adds extra overhead and burden on the Cluster Head (CH) in dense network scenarios which eventually introduces delay and hinders network performance. To reduce the overburdening of single CH, a multi cluster head scheme is proposed in which multiple nodes in a cluster can act as CH to share the load of single CH. For a selection of stable CH, Hybrid Fuzzy Multi-criteria Decision making approach (HF-MCDM) is proposed in which Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and TOPSIS methods are clubbed together for optimal decision making. Further because of association of Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) with life-critical applications, there is a dire need for a security framework to detect various malevolent attacks. Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) like Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the approaches for curbing such attacks. These intrusion detection based mechanism can be combined with various existing optimization techniques to improve their performance, and Dolphin Swarm Algorithm is one such approach. Dolphins have many significant biological features like echolocation, exchange of information, coordination, and division of labor. These biological features combined with swarm intelligence can be utilized for optimizing the detection and accuracy of SVM based IDS.

This thesis demonstrates a methodology for identifying material spectra using the assumption that each unique material class forms a lower-dimensional manifold (surface) in the higher-dimensional spectral radiance space and that all image spectra reside on, or near, these theoretic manifolds. Using a physical model, a manifold characteristic of the target material exposed to varying illumination and atmospheric conditions is formed. A graph-based model is then applied to the radiance data to capture the intricate structure of each material manifold, followed by the application of the commute time distance (CTD) transformation to separate the target manifold from the background. Detection algorithms are then applied in the CTD subspace. This nonlinear transformation is based on a random walk on a graph and is derived from an eigendecomposition of the pseudoinverse of the graph Laplacian matrix. This work provides a geometric interpretation of the CTD transformation, its algebraic properties, the atmospheric and illumination parameters varied in the physics-based model, and the influence the target manifold samples have on the orientation of the coordinate axes in the transformed space.

Data loss prevention is an embedded process used to protect against disclosure of sensitive data to external uncontrolled environments. A typical Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system uses custom policies to identify and prevent accidental and malicious data leakage producing large number of security alerts including significant volume of false positives. Consequently, identifying legitimate data loss can be very challenging as each incident comprises of different characteristics often requiring extensive intervention by a domain expert to review alerts individually. This limits the ability to detect data loss alerts in real-time making organisations vulnerable to financial and reputational damages. The aim of this research is to strengthen data loss detection capabilities of a DLP system by implementing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of legitimate data loss. We conducted extensive experimentation using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms with historical email incident data collected by a globally established telecommunication enterprise. The final model produced with Random Forest algorithm was identified as the most effective as it was successfully able to predict approximately 95% data loss incidents accurately with an average true positive value of 90%. Furthermore, the proposed solution successfully enables identification of legitimate data loss in email DLP whilst facilitating prioritisation of real data loss through human-understandable explanation of the decision thereby improving the efficiency of the process.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.future.2019.11.004", "venue": null, "journal": "Future Generation Computer Systems", "mag_id": "2984293322", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209076942"}

By virtue of the proposed ELMs, parsimonious structure and excellent generalization of multiinput-multioutput single hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) are obtained. The proposed ELMs are developed by innovative decomposition of the recursive orthogonal least squares procedure into sequential partial orthogonalization (SPO). The salient features of the proposed approaches are as follows: 1) Initial hidden nodes are randomly generated by the ELM methodology and recursively orthogonalized into an upper triangular matrix with dramatic reduction in matrix size; 2) the constructive SPO in the CP-ELM focuses on the partial matrix with the subcolumn of the selected regressor including nonzeros as the first column while the destructive SPO in the DP-ELM operates on the partial matrix including elements determined by the removed regressor; 3) termination criteria for CP- and DP-ELM are simplified by the additional residual error reduction method; and 4) the output weights of the SLFN need not be solved in the model selection procedure and is derived from the final upper triangular equation by backward substitution. Both single- and multi-output real-world regression data sets are used to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the CP- and DP-ELM in terms of parsimonious architecture and generalization accuracy.

In 1-6 % of newborns on the NICU (sub clinical) seizures occur and even more frequent in prematures and lowbirth weight children [1]. Failure of detection and subsequent lack of treatment can result in brain damage. Automatic EEG analysis could enhance the application of NICU brain monitoring. Recently, a new seizure detection method was introduced using Support Vector Machines (SVM) [2]. Major aim of our project is to further optimize classification accuracy by introducing two pre-processing procedures. First, a Kalman filter (KF) was used to filter feature time series in order to reduce short false detections. Second, baseline feature correction was used to reduce inter patient differences. Data from 33 both term and pre-term newborns aged between 0 and 6 months consisted of 48 single channel routine EEG recordings (average duration of 26 minutes) in which convulsions were annotated by visual inspection. A total of 123 features for neonatal seizure detection [3-6] are computed for 10s EEG epochs. Each epoch is represented by a feature vector that can either be used to classify the epoch or for training. Feature correction is performed using either all non-seizure data for training or a 3 minute baseline for testing. KF is performed on both training and testing data as well as on the classifier output as introduced in [7].The SVM system without any of the proposed pre-processing steps achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.78 with a sensitivity and specificity of 70.6% at the equal error rate (ERR) point. Each of the proposed preprocessing steps resulted in a performance increase. The best classification performance is achieved on baseline corrected features with a Kalman smoother used for training data pre-processing and a KF used to filter the classifier output. This best classification model achieves an AUC of 0.90 with a sensitivity and specificity of 80.7% at the ERR point.

In this paper a fully automatic human-centric system for video summarization is proposed. In most of the surveillance applications, human motion is of great interest. In proposed system the moving parts in the video are detected using background subtraction, and blobs are extracted from the binary image. Human detection is done through Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Then, motion of humans is tracked through consecutive frames using Kalman filter, and trajectory of each person is extracted. The analysis of trajectory leads to a meaningful summary which covers only important parts of video. One can also mark region of interest to be included in the summary.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited patients with primary glioblastoma undergoing image-guided biopsies and preoperative imaging, including contrast-enhanced MR imaging, dynamic susceptibility contrast MR imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging. We calculated relative cerebral blood volume from DSC-MR imaging and mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy from DTI. Following image coregistration, we assessed tumor cell density for each biopsy and identified corresponding localized MR imaging measurements. We then explored a range of univariate and multivariate predictive models of tumor cell density based on MR imaging measurements in a generalized one-model-fits-all approach. We then implemented both univariate and multivariate individualized transfer learning predictive models, which harness the available population-level data but allow individual variability in their predictions. Finally, we compared Pearson correlation coefficients and mean absolute error between the individualized transfer learning and generalized one-model-fits-all models.

Traditional supervised classification approaches perform well in predicting the sentiment polarity for a given domain, but the performance decreases drastically when a classifier trained on a specific domain is directly applied to predict the sentiment polarity of another domain because the words used in the trained domain may not appear in the test domain. Moreover, the same word may indicate different sentiment polarities in different domains. In this paper, to bridge the gap between different domains, we create a Sentiment Related Index (SRI) to measure the association between different lexical elements in a specific domain with the help of domain-independent features as a bridge. Then we propose a novel cross-domain sentiment classification algorithm based on SRI, which is termed SentiRelated , to analyze the sentiment polarity for short texts. SentiRelated utilizes SRI to expand feature vectors based on unlabeled data from the target domain. In this way, some important sentiment indicators for the target domain are appended to feature vectors. At last, we validate our SentiRelated algorithm on two typical datasets.

Machine learning techniques have many advantages including lack of parametric assumptions, and high power and flexibility. ::: ::: Results: We have applied three machine learning approaches: Random Forest Regression (RFR), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to the prediction of warfarin maintenance dose in a cohort of African Americans. We have developed a multi-step approach that selects SNPs, builds prediction models with different subsets of selected SNPs along with known associated genetic and environmental variables and tests the discovered models in a cross-validation framework. Preliminary results indicate that our modeling approach gives much higher accuracy than previous models for warfarin dose prediction. A model size of 200 SNPs (in addition to the known genetic and environmental variables) gives the best accuracy. The R2 between the predicted and actual square root of warfarin dose in this model was on average 66.4% for RFR, 57.8% for SVR and 56.9% for BRT. Thus RFR had the best accuracy, but all three techniques achieved better performance than the current published R2 of 43% in a sample of mixed ethnicity, and 27% in an African American sample. In summary, machine learning approaches for high-dimensional pharmacogenetic prediction, and for prediction of clinical continuous traits of interest, hold great promise and warrant further research. ::: ::: Contact: [email protected] ::: ::: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3087957", "pubmed_id": "21450715", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btr159", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2046912033,2604103746", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["789692", "89141", "939327", "5543127", "15425562", "206787478", "9417065", "205120536", "12172686", "24875899", "2495124", "26570060", "27256111", "43232880", "20211060", "12206069", "10253140", "11652139", "15480929", "18914582", "8529157", "23369575", "2273370", "28637672", "498748", "2266336", "14105615"], "inbound_citations": ["215724913", "207017509", "59945172", "212737237", "215051995", "7837337", "58598697", "5853793", "11895401", "6348957", "22676471", "2181092", "44100185", "195886349", "215143708", "14609141", "210840231", "53771225", "214929913", "9858596", "215198249", "54869266", "7558124", "49321106", "214983830", "22243290", "215428554", "1884398", "12454277", "209521090", "13539424"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2721063"}

Generally in dynamic environments, data are presented as streams that may evolve over time and this is known by concept drift.

Accordingly, various diversity techniques can be used like block-based data, weighting-data or filtering-data. Each of these diversity techniques is efficient to handle certain characteristics of drift. However, when the drift is complex, they fail to efficiently handle it. Complex drifts may present a mixture of several characteristics (speed, severity, influence zones in the feature space, etc.) which may vary over time. In this case, drift handling is more complicated and requires new detection and updating tools. For this purpose, a new ensemble approach, namely EnsembleEDIST2, is presented. It combines the three diversity techniques in order to take benefit from their advantages and outperform their limits. Additionally, it makes use of EDIST2, as drift detection mechanism, in order to monitor the ensemble\u2019s performance and detect changes.

Satellite images, in particular data from the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM +) sensors, are often integrated with field plots from forest inventory programs, leveraging the complete spatial coverage of imagery with detailed ecological information from a sample of plots to spatially model forest conditions and resources. However, in remote and unmanaged areas such as Canada's northern forests, financial and logistic constraints can severely limit the availability of inventory plot data. Additionally, Landsat spectral information has known limitations for characterizing vertical vegetation structure and biomass; while clouds, snow, and short growing seasons can limit development of large area image mosaics that are spectrally and phenologically consistent across space and time. In this study we predict and map forest structure and aboveground biomass over 37 million ha of forestland in Saskatchewan, Canada. We utilize lidar plots\u2014observations of forest structure collected from airborne discrete-return lidar transects acquired in 2010\u2014as a surrogate for traditional field and photo plots. Mapped explanatory data included Tasseled Cap indices and multi-temporal change metrics derived from Landsat TM/ETM + pixel-based image composites. Maps of forest structure and total aboveground biomass were created using a Random Forest (RF) implementation of Nearest Neighbor (NN) imputation. The imputation model had moderate to high plot-level accuracy across all forest attributes (R2 values of 0.42\u20130.69), as well as reasonable attribute predictions and error estimates (for example, canopy cover above 2 m on validation plots averaged 35.77%, with an RMSE of 13.45%, while unsystematic and systematic agreement coefficients (ACuns and ACsys) had values of 0.63 and 0.97 respectively). Additionally, forest attributes displayed consistent trends in relation to the time since and magnitude of wildfires, indicating model predictions captured the dominant ecological patterns and processes in these forests. Acknowledging methodological and conceptual challenges based upon the use of lidar plots from transects, this study demonstrates that using lidar plots and pixel compositing in imputation mapping can provide forest inventory and monitoring information for regions lacking ongoing or up-to-date field data collection programs.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2016.01.015", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2266591399", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["119728493", "16169693", "84621818", "86024600", "108922448", "84116344", "20642707", "130798580", "4418643", "89141", "54758980", "86219373", "197535812", "64189607", "84277854", "129494315", "55034451", "82399558", "85161336", "85652294", "36784164", "16888352", "15290120", "84945423", "128833917", "54712091", "26051679", "131196455", "23541992", "44908942", "128512889", "130401325", "205013370", "5140933", "39692953", "122416603", "6361699", "55251284", "73544906", "1171161", "86207133", "84205419", "85175075", "129548243", "14460926", "127234314", "53334068", "15582056", "129016675", "128947646", "56475792", "131737456", "128921564", "89358557", "129201671", "15737232", "22908029", "3900606", "56301222", "55281662", "129627611", "31349523", "14327012", "55418520", "130133337", "55654419", "15943450", "53600638", "18842796", "84638603", "126505387", "140676645", "84687774", "140663136", "119972206", "10027646", "34859513", "154584081", "129378931", "128863833", "129909424"], "inbound_citations": ["43992448", "84179581", "92372124", "90030941", "73463634", "133823205", "209315643", "9992986", "15729414", "91190359", "198422624", "30928888", "19715487", "56481877", "20533679", "42120812", "208224935", "92979232", "49302100", "91619672", "91648221", "55635019", "6805770", "90809177", "52925987", "60442742"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19765611"}

The hypothesis is that an optimal wavelet can be approximated by deriving it from underlying components of the EEG. The SNAP was compared to standard wavelets by measuring Support Vector Machine-based EEG classification accuracy when using different wavelets/filters for EEG analysis. When classifying P300 evoked potentials, the error, as a function of the wavelet/filter used, ranged from 6.92% to 11.99%, almost twofold. Classification using the SNAP was more accurate than that with any of the six standard wavelets tested.

Mitigation hinges on understanding which sources are contributing to its toxicity. Black Carbon (BC), an indicator of particles generated from traffic sources, has been associated with a number of health effects however due to its high spatial variability, its concentration is difficult to estimate. We previously fit a model estimating BC concentrations in the greater Boston area; however this model was built using limited monitoring data and could not capture the complex spatio-temporal patterns of ambient BC. In order to improve our predictive ability, we obtained more data for a total of 24,301 measurements from 368 monitors over a 12 year period in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. We also used Nu-Support Vector Regression (nu-SVR) \u2013 a machine learning technique which incorporates nonlinear terms and higher order interactions, with appropriate regularization of parameter estimates. We then used a generalized additive model to refit the residuals from the nu-SVR and added the residual predictions to our earlier estimates. Both spatial and temporal predictors were included in the model which allowed us to capture the change in spatial patterns of BC over time. The 10 fold cross validated (CV) R 2 of the model was good in both cold (10-fold CV R 2 = 0.87) and warm seasons (CV R 2 = 0.79).

The objective of this research is to develop a method for the classification of documents into multiple categories with fuzzy logic. This method was built from a process of pattern recognition and, also, two variables called similarity and accuracy were used. The proposed fuzzy classification method uses variables that express the ability to analyze the similarity and accuracy of a document through a database of terms. The database of terms is generated by a collection of pre-classified documents in categories of interest. The documents processed according to the similarity and accuracy in the database of terms composes a training set also called knowledge base. From this database, it is possible to identify a pattern that specifies a set of rules through a knowledge discovery process. This process involves the data mining of the knowledge base. Thus, it was possible to define a general model that is used in the creation of rules and membership functions of the fuzzy model for the classification of documents into multiple categories. The general model of the rules identified in the data mining process and implemented in fuzzy model considers the most significant variables and also contributes to the specification of the membership functions, such as the definition of linguistic terms of fuzzy sets. Thus, it was possible to implement a more deterministic approach regarding the input, membership functions and inference rules of the fuzzy model.

The analysis of laminates with curvilinear fibers coupled with the fiber path optimization requires a large number of function evaluations, each time-consuming. To reduce the time for analysis and thus for optimization, a metamodel is often proposed. This work examines a set of metamodeling techniques for the design optimization of composite laminates with variable stiffness. Three case studies are considered. The first two pertain to the fiber path design of a plate under uniform compression. The third concerns the optimization of a composite cylinder under pure bending. Four metamodeling methods, namely Polynomial Regression, Radial Basis Functions, Kriging and Support Vector Regression, are tested, and their performance is compared. Accuracy, robustness, and suitability for integration within an optimization framework are the appraisal criteria. The results show that the most accurate and robust models in exploring the design space are Kriging and Radial Basis Functions.

{"paper_id": "16750251", "title": "Multi-phase learning for jazz improvisation and interaction", "authors": [{"first": "Judy", "middle": ["A."], "last": "Franklin", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This article presents a model for computational learning composed of two phases that enable a machine to interactively improvise jazz with a human. To explore and demonstrate this model, a working system has been built, called CHIME for Computer Human Interacting Musical Entity. In phase 1, a recurrent neural network is used to train the machine to reproduce 3 jazz melodies. Using this knowledge, CHIME can interactively play music with a human in real time by trading fours in jazz improvisation. The machine is further trained in phase 2 with a real-valued reinforcement learning algorithm. Included in the paper are details of the mechanisms for learning and interaction and the results. The paper presentation includes real-time demonstrations of CHIME. Introduction The goal in developing CHIME was to use machine learning to enable a machine to learn to improvise jazz and to interact with a human player. Creating this kind of human/machine interaction has great aesthetic and philosophical appeal. CHIME starts as a beginner, but after training can \u201ctrade fours\u201d with a human. That is each improvises (makes up original jazz melodies in real time) for four measures while the other listens. Then the other takes a turn and so on. These four measures are played over a chord structure. In trading fours, a player tries to incorporate some of the other player\u2019s music while adding new material. The type of machine learning used is based in connectionist artificial networks and includes both supervised learning (recurrent back-propagation) and reinforcement learning. Connectionist or artificial neural network (ANN) learning has much to offer human-computer interaction as has been explored by (Griffith and Todd 1999, Todd and Loy 1991, and Hornel and Menzel 1998). Complex mappings between inputs and outputs can be learned. Recurrent artificial neural networks are neural networks with a feedback loop from the output units to units at one of the preceding layers. In this way the network is given information about its past actions. The networks can be trained prior to use and are also capable of real-time learning (learning while doing). Reinforcement learning offers the ability to learn using indirect feedback about the effects of the network\u2019s outputs. CHIME demonstrates a model for computational learning that consists of phases of learning. Currently there are two phases. In phase 1, the learning method is supervised learning (recurrent back-propagation) where the machine is trained to play three jazz tunes. In supervised learning, the correct output is always known and an error is formed that is the difference between the actual output of the network and the correct output. This error is used to train the network. Phase 1 has its basis in work by (Todd 1991). After phase 1 training, the machine is able to trade fours with the human, on-line and in real time. In phase 2 the trained recurrent network is expanded and further trained via reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a natural approach for learning to improvise because it uses a trial and error basis for learning that allows it to discover new solutions to problems. It does not need an exact error to learn. After this additional training the computer can also trade fours in real time. Figure 1 shows the CHIME architecture for training, learning, and real-time interaction. The top box shows phase 1, where the initial recurrent network is trained on existing melodies. The inputs to the 1 This work was funded in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation, under grant CDA-9720508 through the Human Computer Interaction Program. It was also supported (non-financially) by the John Payne Music Center in Brookline, Massachusetts, U.S.A. All opinions in the article are the author\u2019s own. 2 network are shown as boxes on the left. In phase 1, the network input is a decaying history of its own output (the recurrent feedback link), as well as a representation of the chord over which it is improvising, and a number representing which song it is learning. After phase 1 training, when it is interacting with a human, its input is a decaying history of the human\u2019s most recent improvisation and again the current chord. In phase 2, the network receives both the recurrent feedback link as well as the human\u2019s improvisation. During the phase 2 training period, it can use either a recorded human improvisation, or it can be trained while interacting with a human. In both phases the network is given the current chord over which it is improvising. A reinforcement value gives some indication of how \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d the output is. At this stage of CHIME, a set of rudimentary rules for jazz is used to obtain the reinforcement value. Figure 1. The CHIME architecture for learning, and interaction in real-time with a human. On the right of Figure 1 is 1) an adaptive critic that learns to predict reinforcement values in order to account for delays between actions and results, and 2) a mechanism to adaptively scale the reinforcement so that it can continue to learn after it has learned to perform reasonably well. Use of Recurrent Artificial Neural Networks (Todd 1991) used a recurrent network for classical melody learning and generation. The connection from output to input provides a memory of recently played notes. The network was taught, using backpropagation, to reproduce melodies. The network was able to distinguish between various melodies by noting the distinction in inputs called plan inputs. Interestingly, the network was able to generalize; when given a plan that it had not seen before, it generated a new melody. In phase 1, a recurrent network is first trained off-line using supervised learning. A diagram of a recurrent network, based on Jordan\u2019s work (Jordan 1986), is shown in Figure 2. It is similar to that used by Todd except that it has been augmented with the chord input. There are several other more subtle changes as well. The network is composed of the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer. Each node in the output layer corresponds to a note that can be played, or a rest, or a new note indicator. When an output node value is above a fixed threshold it is a candidate note. A rest is included as a candidate. The output with the highest value above the threshold is chosen as the next note. The note indicator output indicates whether this is a new note (i.e. note indicator output is greater than the threshold) or if it is the same note being held for another time increment. The network has a range of two octaves (24 chromatic notes of Western tonal music). Each unit in the hidden and output layers utilizes the sum of its inputs, multiplied by weights. The output units are linear and their output is simply this sum.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In Proc.

The tags describe the geographic objects in a way that is understandable by both humans and computers. The variability in contributor behaviour creates reliability concerns for the tagging quality of OSM data. The detection of irregular contributions may improve OSM data quality and editing tools. This research applies the random forest algorithm on geospatial variables in order to detect outliers without ground-truth reference data to direct human inspection. An application to OSM data for Toronto, Ontario, was effective in revealing abnormal amenity tagging of school and hospital objects. 1. Introduction OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an online platform enabling registered volunteers to contribute geospatial data by digitizing point-, line-, or polygon-shaped geographic objects and annotating them with tags referring to common feature classes such as roads and restaurants (Haklay 2008). OSM tags are semantically structured as key-value pairs, where the key refers to a broad class of geographic objects and the value details the specific geographic object being tagged (Ballatore et al. 2013). Examples of tags are amenity=school, highway=residential, and building=house. The open and flexible nature of OSM tagging leads to varying contribution behaviour by different communities (Mooney et al. 2010). The varying contribution behaviour creates concerns about the quality of OSM data and the community standards of OSM tagging. Quality control and corrections rely heavily on human interaction, which raises additional questions on the reliability of OSM data. Finally, the experience of the volunteer contributor has an effect on the tagging quality of each geographic object as experienced contributors are more familiar with the tagging norms of the area being edited. Although OSM is an effective and efficient platform for generating masses of geospatial data, it is plagued by reliability, quality, and completeness issues. The aim of this paper is to examine the ability of an automated machine learning algorithm, the random forest algorithm, to support manual human inspection and minimize bias in OSM data editing. The use of an automated algorithm improves the detection of abnormal tagging behaviour, avoids the bias of human judgement, and reduces the time required to search through masses of tagged geographic objects. A combination of human knowledge and experience with the logical accuracy of machines could improve OSM tagging quality and standards, and enable the development of advanced editing tools. 2.

Many techniques have been proposed for indirect rotor position detection for SR machines. However, their characteristics can be summed up as being based on a lookup table plus an interpolation algorithm, making them specific to a particular machine. For economic reasons and also dynamic performance, sensorless algorithms need a learning mechanism to allow them to adapt to a new SR machine or even adapt to changes in the SRM parameters. This paper presents a novel methodology for position sensor elimination for SR machines. Using the voltage from each conducting phase and the reference current signal as inputs, the rotor speed is first obtained as the output of a neurofuzzy learning system used as a \u201cvirtual\u201d speed sensor. Then, the rotor position is determined by integrating the estimated value of speed. The effectiveness of the proposed sensorless technique was investigated through a series of real-time experiments on an SR drive system. The experimental results show that the suggested \u201cvirtual\u201d speed sensor and corresponding rotor position can operate well in a sensorless SR speed control system.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TPEL.2011.2129597", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2097925871", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["16727893", "7551482", "110622381", "60962771", "38456820", "119918958", "111829978", "111275636", "2224444", "1167084", "23527166", "20954379", "11949221", "8117749", "13375104", "110836239", "16559083", "18833035", "44196040", "22269828", "6930989", "28789413", "38364646", "139085788", "42994846", "109793478", "110809905", "110806045", "3333100", "24989967", "110252564"], "inbound_citations": ["23998549", "41492927", "115599848", "18454308", "47576345", "34333731", "25810542", "53533553", "43021071", "10976473", "23195179", "20945584", "42894978", "35996984", "54456120", "13280191", "27442069", "44811629", "24895418", "11244850", "46873290", "12888261", "52301009", "20556604"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33257510"}

In some special applications, limited by the geometric space and mechanical structure of the imaging system, projections can only be collected with a scanning range of less than 90\u00b0. We call this kind of serious limited-angle problem the ultra-limited-angle problem, which is difficult to effectively alleviate by traditional iterative reconstruction algorithms. With the development of deep learning, the generative adversarial network (GAN) performs well in image inpainting tasks and can add effective image information to restore missing parts of an image. In this study, given the characteristic of GAN to generate missing information, the sinogram-inpainting-GAN (SI-GAN) is proposed to restore missing sinogram data to suppress the singularity of the truncated sinogram for ultra-limited-angle reconstruction. We propose the U-Net generator and patch-design discriminator in SI-GAN to make the network suitable for standard medical CT images. Furthermore, we propose a joint projection domain and image domain loss function, in which the weighted image domain loss can be added by the back-projection operation. Then, by inputting a paired limited-angle/180\u00b0 sinogram into the network for training, we can obtain the trained model, which has extracted the continuity feature of sinogram data. Finally, the classic CT reconstruction method is used to reconstruct the images after obtaining the estimated sinograms. The simulation studies and actual data experiments indicate that the proposed method performed well to reduce the serious artifacts caused by ultra-limited-angle scanning.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6767251", "pubmed_id": "31547346", "doi": "10.3390/s19183941", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2972922788", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["71324694", "72385503", "29227354", "23439463", "120029587", "45126757", "121544082", "9460239", "123186073", "206014441", "7393744", "4305082", "10259488", "18893174", "7706661", "24369963", "25952890", "3074096", "1250615", "21014974", "451848", "64871730", "59054662", "6200260", "206770979", "56174833", "119100906", "11758569", "3655281", "20587279", "3719281", "18781152", "6635779", "10974757", "116186196", "207761262"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202745991"}

This paper presents a biologically inspired, sequential learning spiking neural classifier (SLSNC) for pattern classification problems. It consists of a two layered neural network and a separate decision block which estimates the predicted class label. Inspired by observations in the neuroscience literature, the input layer employs a new neuron model which converts real valued stimuli into spikes with varying amplitudes and firing times. The intermediate layer neurons are modeled as integrate-and-fire spiking neurons. The decision block identifies that intermediate neuron which fires first and returns the class label associated with that neuron as the predicted class label. The sequential learning algorithm for the spiking neural network automatically determines the network structure from the training samples and adapts its synaptic weights by long term potentiation and long term depression. Performance of SLSNC has been evaluated using a number of benchmark classification problems and the results have been compared with other well-known spiking neural network classifiers in the literature as well as with the standard support vector machine (SVM) with a Gaussian kernel and the fast learning Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifiers.

Deep feature learning, however, typically requires a large amount of training data, which may not be feasible for some application domains. Transfer learning can be one of the approaches to alleviate this problem by transferring data from data-rich source domain to data-scarce target domain. Existing transfer learning methods typically perform one-shot transfer learning and often ignore the specific properties that the transferred data must satisfy. To address these issues, we introduce a constrained deep transfer feature learning method to perform simultaneous transfer learning and feature learning by performing transfer learning in a progressively improving feature space iteratively in order to better narrow the gap between the target domain and the source domain for effective transfer of the data from source domain to target domain. Furthermore, we propose to exploit the target domain knowledge and incorporate such prior knowledge as constraint during transfer learning to ensure that the transferred data satisfies certain properties of the target domain. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed constrained deep transfer feature learning method, we apply it to thermal feature learning for eye detection by transferring from the visible domain. We also applied the proposed method for cross-view facial expression recognition as a second application.

One proposed technique to select good features with few inter-dependencies is minimal Redundancy Maximal Relevance mRMR [ 12 ], but this can be impractical with large feature sets. In many situations, features are extracted from signal data such as vehicle telemetry, medical sensors, or financial time-series, and it is possible for feature redundancies to exist both between features extracted from the same signal intra-signal, and between features extracted from different signals inter-signal. We propose a two stage selection process to take advantage of these different types of redundancy, considering intra-signal and inter-signal redundancies separately.

These projects include data mining of coarse-grained side chain orientation in the protein data bank and the prediction of such orientation for each individual residue using statistical learning methods, the motions of protein and protein complexes using the elastic network model and statistical methods and clustering of structures within an ensemble of NMR-derived protein structures. The first research topic is about the side chain orientation in protein structures. A coarse-grained measurement for side chain orientation is used, and the relationship between this type of side chain orientation measurement and the hydrophobicity of residue type is established. Along with the research on the side chain orientation, visualization software to visualize this coarse-grained side chain orientation is developed using openGL and C++ language. In addition, several predictive models for side chain orientation of individual residues are constructed using several statistical machine learning methods (General linear regression, Regression tree, Bagging of regression tree, Neural Network and Support Vector Machine). The second topic is about the dynamics of protein and protein complexes using the elastic network model. In this part, the effects of different superposition methods on the correspondence between the experimental conformational changes extracted from the cluster of structures using principal component analysis and the normal modes are studied, and we obtain a better correspondence for some protein structures using the maximum likelihood based superposition method. In addition, we also apply the elastic network model to study the dynamics of the small ribosomal subunit. In this project, we perform a series of protein subunit removal computational experiments and study the effect of removing some protein subunits on the motion of the partial 30S structures simulated with the elastic network model. Through these studies, we find that S6 interacts with S18 in the small ribosomal subunit, which is consistent with the previous computation and experimental results from other researchers. xiv Another project is the application of principal component shaving method for clustering structures in an ensemble of NMR-derived protein structures. Principal component shaving is often used to find the similar gene expression pattern in microarray experiment, and this method is applied to cluster similar structures in an ensemble of NMR-derived protein structures. The results show that similar structures can be clustered together by using this method.

Narcotic pollutants, that act by nonspecifically disrupting the functioning of cell membranes, are categorized as polar and nonpolar compounds. The toxicity prediction of narcotic pollutants with QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationships) depends on the reliable determination of the mechanism of toxic action. The classification of the chemical compounds as polar and nonpolar narcotic pollutants based on structural characteristics is of utmost importance in predicting the aquatic toxicity for new chemicals. Method. Support vector machine (SVM) is a new machine learning algorithm that proved to be reliable in the classification of organic and bioorganic compounds. In this study we have investigated the application of SVM for the classification of 190 narcotic pollutants (76 polar and 114 nonpolar). Using an efficient descriptor selection algorithm, the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital, the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and the most negative partial charge on any non\u2013hydrogen atom in the molecule, all computed with the AM1 method, were found to be necessary for the discrimination of the polar and nonpolar compounds. The prediction power of each SVM model was evaluated with a leave\u201320%\u2013out cross\u2013validation procedure. Results. The classification performances of SVM models generated with the dot, polynomial, radial basis function, neural, and anova kernels, show that the statistical performances of SVM depend strongly on the kernel type and various parameters that control the kernel shape. An SVM model obtained with the anova kernel offered the best results, with three errors in calibration and four errors in prediction, all for nonpolar chemicals. Conclusions. SVM is a powerful and flexible classification algorithm, with many potential applications in molecular design, optimization of chemical libraries, and QSAR.

Building an intelligent and scalable spam detection system is highly desirable but faces difficulties such as lack of labeled training data, particularly for languages other than English. In this paper, we take the spam (Spanish) job posting detection as the target problem and build a generic machine learning pipeline for multi-lingual spam detection. The main components are feature generation and knowledge migration via transfer learning. Specifically, in the feature generation phase, a relatively large labeled data set is generated via machine translation. Together with a large set of unlabeled human written Spanish data, unigram features are generated based on the frequency. In the second phase, machine translated data are properly reweighted to capture the discrepancy from human written ones and classifiers can be built on top of them. To make effective use of a small portion of labeled data available in human written Spanish, an adaptive transfer learning algorithm is proposed to further improve the performance.

It only captures the dynamics of a scene and is able to capture almost \"continuous\" motion. However, different from frame-based camera that reflects the whole appearance as scenes are, the event camera casts away the detailed characteristics of objects, such as texture and color. To take advantages of both modalities, the event camera and frame-based camera are combined together for various machine vision tasks. Then the cross-modal matching between neuromorphic events and color images plays a vital and essential role. In this paper, we propose the Event-Based Image Retrieval (EBIR) problem to exploit the cross-modal matching task. Given an event stream depicting a particular object as query, the aim is to retrieve color images containing the same object. This problem is challenging because there exists a large modality gap between neuromorphic events and color images. We address the EBIR problem by proposing neuromorphic Events-Color image Feature Learning (ECFL). Particularly, the adversarial learning is employed to jointly model neuromorphic events and color images into a common embedding space.

The standard training method of CRFs can be very slow for large-scale applications. As an alternative to the standard training method, piecewise training divides the full graph into pieces, trains them independently, and combines the learned weights at test time. But piecewise training does not scale well in the variable cardinality. In this paper we present separate training for undirected models based on the novel Co-occurrence Rate factorization (CR- F). Separate training is a local training method without global propagation. In contrast to directed markov models such as MEMMs, separate training is unaff ected by the label bias problem even it is a local normalized method. We do experiments on two NLP tasks, i.e., POS tagging and NER. Results show that separate training (i) is unaffected by the label bias problem; (ii) reduces the training time from weeks to seconds; and (iii) obtains competitive results to the standard and piecewise training on linear-chain CRFs. Separate training is a promising technique for scaling undirected models for natural language processing tasks.

However, variations in MRI acquisition protocols result in different appearances of normal and diseased tissue in the images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have shown to be successful in many medical image analysis tasks, are typically sensitive to the variations in imaging protocols. Therefore, in many cases, networks trained on data acquired with one MRI protocol, do not perform satisfactorily on data acquired with different protocols. This limits the use of models trained with large annotated legacy datasets on a new dataset with a different domain which is often a recurring situation in clinical settings. In this study, we aim to answer the following central questions regarding domain adaptation in medical image analysis: Given a fitted legacy model, (1) How much data from the new domain is required for a decent adaptation of the original network?; and, (2) What portion of the pre-trained model parameters should be retrained given a certain number of the new domain training samples? To address these questions, we conducted extensive experiments in white matter hyperintensity segmentation task. We trained a CNN on legacy MR images of brain and evaluated the performance of the domain-adapted network on the same task with images from a different domain. We then compared the performance of the model to the surrogate scenarios where either the same trained network is used or a new network is trained from scratch on the new dataset.

In this study, we aimed to propose a system to automatically assess the HYS score of patients with PD. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The system was evaluated and tested on a dataset containing 55 subjects where 35 of them were patients and 20 of them were healthy controls. The resting tremor data were gathered with the 3 axis accelerometer of the Nintendo Wii (Wiimote). The clinical disability of the PD was graded from 1 to 5 by the HYS and tremor was recorded twice from the more affected side in each patient and from the dominant extremity in each control for a 60 seconds period. The HYS scores were learned with Support Vector Machines (SVM) from the features of the tremor data. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Thirty-two of the subjects with PD were classified correctly and 18 of the normal subjects were also classified correctly by our system. The system had average 0.89 accuracy rate (Range: 81-100% changing according to grading by HYS). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: We compared quantitative measurements of hand tremor in PD patients, with staging of PD based on accelerometer data gathered using the Wii sensor. Our results showed that the machine learning based system with simple features could be helpful for diagnosis of PD and estimate HYS score. We believed that this portable and easy-to-use Wii sensor measure might also be applicable in the continuous monitoring of the resting tremor with small modifications in routine clinical use.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26757439", "doi": "10.3233/THC-151124", "venue": "Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine", "journal": "Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine", "mag_id": "2264807271", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["59409818", "49479165"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:29348033"}

To address this issue, we take a first step towards a rigorous study of GAN dynamics. We propose a simple model that exhibits several of the common problematic convergence behaviors (e.g., vanishing gradient, mode collapse, diverging or oscillatory behavior) and still allows us to establish the first convergence bounds for parametric GAN dynamics. We find an interesting dichotomy: a GAN with an optimal discriminator provably converges, while a first order approximation of the discriminator leads to unstable GAN dynamics and mode collapse.

To date, there is no overall solution to this problem that uses a sensor capable of detecting PTWs and taking into consideration their interaction with the other vehicles on the road (for example: Inter-lane traffic, when PTWs move in between two lanes on a highway), and no state-of-the-art technical solutions can be adapted to measure this category of vehicle in traffic (unlike cars and trucks).

We examined effects of field and landscape parameters on wild bee species\u2019 richness, abundance and functional traits in Austrian vineyards over two years using Generalised Linear Mixed models, Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Random Forests. Alternating tillage was compared with no tillage in two inter-rows per vineyard. Forage availability in these inter-rows was estimated by flower coverage at each sampling date, and landscape features were analysed within a radius of 750 m around the vineyards. Across all vineyards we found 84 wild bee species with a mean abundance (\u00b1SD) of 29 (\u00b116.6). Forage availability had the strongest positive effect on wild bee diversity and abundance. In comparison to no tillage, alternating tillage slightly increased wild bee diversity and abundance. Eusocial wild bees were more abundant in untilled inter-rows, whereas solitary wild bees were more closely associated with alternating tilled vineyards. At the landscape scale, the percentage of artificial areas (mostly villages) and distance to semi-natural elements raised wild bee diversity and abundance. The proportion of woodland increased the abundance of wild bees, in particular of eusocial taxa. Solitary wild bee abundance was enhanced by the number of solitary trees.

This passive sensing method, called hydrodynamic imaging, is complementary to sonar and vision systems and is suitable for collision avoidance and near-field covert sensing. This sensing method has so far been demonstrated on a biological scale from several to tens of centimeters. Here, we present measurements using a large-scale artificial lateral line of 3.5 meters, consisting of eight all-optical 2D-sensitive flow sensors. We measure the fluid flow as produced by the motion of five different objects, towed across a swimming pool. This results in repeatable stimuli, whose measurements demonstrate a complementary aspect of 2D-sensing. These measurements are both used for constructing temporal hydrodynamic signatures, which reflect the object\u2019s shape, and for flow-feature based near-field object classification. For the latter, we present a location-invariant feature extraction method which, using an Extreme Learning Machine neural network, results in a classification F1-score up to 98.6% with selected flow features. We find that, compared to the traditional sensing dimension parallel to the sensor array, the novel transverse fluid velocity component bears more information about the object shape.

In this study, the Landsat TM (L5, L8) of 2018, 2009 and 1998 were selected and median reflectance of spectral bands in Kharif and Rabi season were used for the classification. In addition, three important machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function (SVM-RBF), Random forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) were selected to evaluate the performance in transferability for agricultural land use classification using GEE. Seven land use/cover classes such as built-up, cropland, fallow land, vegetation etc. were selected based on literature review and local land use classification scheme. In this classification, several strategies were employed such as feature extraction, feature selection, parameter tuning, sensitivity analysis on size of training samples, transferability analysis to assess the performance of the selected machine learning algorithms for land use/cover classification. The result shows that SVM-RBF outperforms the RF and CART for both spatial and temporal transferability analysis.

However, setting up valid simulations requires expert knowledge, acquired skills, and sufficient expertise. Design engineers, who perform finite element analysis (FEA) infrequently, must be assisted and their FEA results need to be checked for plausibility. An automatic plausibility check for finite element (FE) simulations in linear structural mechanics can identify non-plausible simulations and warn the user to interpret the results cautiously or ask for expert help. In this context, currently available tools can only compare very similar simulations. However, as the amount of available simulation data in the industry increases more and more, a data-driven simulation check is an obvious next step. Nevertheless, the question arises how simulation data of very different parts and simulations can be transferred to a single software tool, how this tool can learn the relevant rules behind plausible simulations, and how it can be applied to new simulations. In this context, it is especially important to train a metamodel that is able to generalize the rules so that it can later on be applied to unknown simulations. This paper presents an approach to transfer different FE meshes, corresponding FE results and boundary conditions to an individual matrix of fixed size for very different structural mechanic FE simulation. The novel approach uses spherical detector surfaces to project three-dimensional information on its surface. It allows generating the so-called \u201cDNA of an FE simulation\u201d; classification algorithms i.e. Support Vector Machines or Deep Learning Neural Networks such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can then classify this information. The whole methodology reduces the dimension of a 3D finite element simulation to a 2D matrix of numeric values. The matrix contains all the relevant information for the classification in \u201cplausible\u201d or \u201cnon-plausible\u201d. An implausible simulation contains errors, which would be quickly identified by an experienced simulation engineer, whereas a plausible simulation does not contain such errors.

In GA-BN algorithm, GA makes a heuristic search to find most relevant feature model that increase accuracy of BN algorithm with the use of a 10-fold cross-validation strategy. The subsets of features are sequentially used to identify six dermatological diseases via a BN fitting the corresponding data. The algorithm, in this case, produces 99.20% classification accuracy in the diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases. The strength of feature model generated for BN is furthermore tested with the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Simple Logistics (SL) and Functional Decision Tree (FT). The resultant classification accuracies of algorithms are 98.36%, 97.00%, 98.36% and 97.81% respectively. On the other hand, BN algorithm with classification accuracy of 99.20% is quite a high diagnosis performance for erythemato-squamous diseases.

Previous work has shown the efficacy of the linear input transformation approach for speaker adaptation [1][2][3], but has focused only on training global transformations. This approach is clearly suboptimal since it assumes that a single transformation is appropriate for every region in the acoustic feature input space, that is, for every phonetic class, microphone, and noise level. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to train mixtures of transformation networks (MTNs) in the hybrid connectionist recognition framework. This approach is based on the idea of partitioning the acoustic feature space into R regions and training an input transformation for each region.

A large branch of these systems analyzes neuroimaging data using machine learning algorithms and are able to estimate the diagnosis of a new subject. Due to the high dimensionality of brain neuroimages compared to the number of examples available for training these systems, a dimensionality reduction strategy is recommended. In this work, we demonstrate a method to select regions of interest from molecular neuroimages, reducing, that way, their dimensionality. It is based on Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) and the Bhattacharyya distance. First, the average of all the images of a given modality is calculated. Subsequently, this image is segmented by a method based on HMRF. As a result, different maps are obtained according to the intensity and neighborhood of the voxels (it is more likely that a given voxel belongs to the same map than the voxels in its neighborhood). The resulting maps are then used as a mask to segment all our neuroimages. Subsequently, the data corresponding to the most discriminative maps are selected as regions of interest. The discriminative capacity is estimated by means of the Bhattacharyya distance. Finally, a Support Vector Machine classifier is used to separate controls and patients using the selected maps as features. This approach was evaluated using two sets of neuroimages, one with Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients and healthy subjects and another one with parkinsonian patients and controls. For both datasets, the proposed method achieved higher accuracy rates than classical approaches, what suggest that segmentation based on HMRF is an interesting approach to select regions of interest from molecular neuroimaging data.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/NSSMIC.2018.8824521", "venue": "2018 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference Proceedings (NSS/MIC)", "journal": "2018 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference Proceedings (NSS/MIC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2971866250", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13488562", "3613692", "206490341", "4959737", "215037278", "51975244", "207203830", "16281709", "15828865", "40097075", "215078769", "42670095", "7138354", "17578642"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201846891"}

The array was then incubated with GCF samples collected from 25 NOR and 25 SP patients. Differentially expressed proteins between NOR and SP patients were then used to build receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and compare five classification models, including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, k Nearest Neighbor, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Classification and Regression Trees. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Seven proteins (CRP, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, MMP-13, Osteoprotegerin, Osteoactivin) were significantly upregulated in SP patients compared with NOR, while RANK was significantly downregulated. The highest diagnostic accuracy using a ROC curve was observed for IL-1\u03b2 with an area under the curve of 0.984. Five of the proteins (IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, MMP-13, Osteoprotegerin, Osteoactivin) were identified as important features for classification.

At Mt. Etna volcano (Italy), a pattern recognition system based on infrasonic waveform features has been developed.

After the clustering process, by using a common location method (semblance method) and additional volcanological information concerning the intensity of the explosive activity, we were able to associate each cluster to a particular source vent and/or a kind of volcanic activity. Finally, for automatic event location, clusters were used to train a model based on Support Vector Machine, calculating optimal hyperplanes able to maximize the margins of separation among the clusters.

For SVM and ASNN calculations, the ISIDA fragment descriptors were used, whereas Simplex descriptors were employed in RF models. The models have been validated using three different protocols: \"Points out\", \"Mixtures out\" and \"Compounds out\", based on the specific rules to form training/test sets in each fold of cross-validation. A final validation of the models has been performed on an additional set of 94 mixtures represented by combinations of novel 34 compounds and modeling set chemicals with each other.

Majority of these entity is mitral valve prolapse in developed countries. Endoscopic mitral valve surgery is a relatively new procedure and preparation in the right intercostal space are crucial for success completion of the procedure. We aimed to explore clinical variables and chest X-rays in order to build most performant model that can predict the right intercostal space for thoracotomy. Methods Overall 234 patients underwent fully endoscopic mitral valve surgery. All patients had preoperative two projection radiography. Intercostal space for right thoracotomy was decided by expert cardiac surgeons taking in consideration the height, weight, chest radiography, anatomical position of skin incision, nipple position and the sex. In order to predict the right intercostal space we have used clinical data and we have collected all radiographies and feed it to deep neural network algorithm. We have spitted the whole data-set into two subsets: training and testing data-sets. We have used clinical data and build an algorithm (Random Forest) in order to have reference model. Results The best-performing classifier was GoogLeNet neural network (now on we will reffera as Deep Learning) and had an AUC of 0.956. Algorithm based on clinical data (Random Forest) had AUC of 0.529 using only chest x-rays.

First, how to learn a sparse feature representation by mapping each cluster of patches into few dimensions is one challenging issue. Sparse coding techniques with $l_{1}$ norm regularization are widely used to learn sparse features. However, $l_{1}$ norm regularization may not achieve enough sparsity. Furthermore, the initial value has a great influence on the sparsity of codes during the iterative optimization process. Second, how to learn a classifier in a supervised manner in order to improve the generalization is another issue. This paper therefore proposes a scene recognition method and it mainly includes two processes. One is the homotopy iterative hard thresholding (HIHT) algorithm that encodes the sparse representations of local patches by incorporating an $l_{0}$ norm regularization. Furthermore, a homotopy continuity strategy is used to improve the sparsity of feature codes by adaptively tuning the regularization factor from large to small values and using the sparse solution of last iteration as the warm start of the next iteration. The other is the extreme learning machine (ELM)-based classifier. Experimental results in 15-class scene data set have shown that the HIHT algorithm outperforms other unsupervised sparse feature learning algorithms in terms of sparsity and entropy.

We took two real-world datasets, Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic (WBCD) and PD600 as our training datasets, and the experiment results demonstrated that DMC-SVM could extract more abstract features that make this model more generalized, and for this reason, DMC-SVM has the better ability while dealing with classification problems.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2018.00114", "venue": "2018 7th International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics (IIAI-AAI)", "journal": "2018 7th International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics (IIAI-AAI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2937631562", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "194951", "14727192", "16217041", "2309950", "9928823", "34146161", "53049262", "207165665", "6636078", "8799873", "12468157", "206038660", "23138357", "5158633", "207763512", "206741496", "351666", "206468984", "207226212", "1056745", "43680425", "7905624", "62184605", "42523075", "5575601"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:121323617"}

Beamformers in the frequency domain, in particular, have proved useful in this endeavor. However, the localization accuracy and efficacy of such spatial filters can be markedly limited by bias from correlation between cerebral sources and short duration of source activity, both essential issues in the localization of brain data. Here, we evaluate a method for frequency-domain localization of oscillatory neural activity based on the relevance vector machine (RVM). RVM is a Bayesian algorithm for learning sparse models from possibly overcomplete data sets. The performance of our frequency-domain RVM method (fdRVM) was compared with that of dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS), a frequency-domain spatial filter that employs a minimum variance adaptive beamformer (MVAB) approach. The methods were tested both on simulated and real data. Two types of simulated MEG data sets were generated, one with continuous source activity and the other with transiently active sources. The real data sets were from slow finger movements and resting state. Results from simulations show comparable performance for DICS and fdRVM at high signal-to-noise ratios and low correlation. At low SNR or in conditions of high correlation between sources, fdRVM performs markedly better. fdRVM was successful on real data as well, indicating salient focal activations in the sensorimotor area. The resulting high spatial resolution of fdRVM and its sensitivity to low-SNR transient signals could be particularly beneficial when mapping event-related changes of oscillatory activity.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "23729235", "doi": "10.1007/s10339-013-0568-y", "venue": "Cognitive Processing", "journal": "Cognitive Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2122444425", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["14989061", "62668597", "3347625", "13907960", "15947499", "35615494", "14038706", "29649156", "2994870", "9899534", "15691446", "11417178", "15164277", "7572538", "12167769", "765538", "52804549", "16200710", "41233694", "39590880", "206790699", "6873364", "24756702", "16885151", "4557628", "14490730", "207673395", "9892730", "12764298", "37528789", "7596571", "18224413", "15082296", "15730337", "18200032", "2567055", "6339688", "7854545", "28317758", "3338113"], "inbound_citations": ["59389617"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12432229"}

To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, it is applied to the 127-bus test system.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.23919/ELECO47770.2019.8990506", "venue": "2019 11th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ELECO)", "journal": "2019 11th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ELECO)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3006031226", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["110214112", "29017402", "5034484", "14007770", "32927479", "12311932", "115286328", "109637510", "47554202", "56597483", "49573920", "49573920", "49193353", "67874722", "57190580", "195832774", "53746341", "56598708", "59241437", "195832385", "70259561", "64294544", "6916627", "1106731", "206592484", "14124313", "195908774", "206592484", "206597351", "362467", "6628106"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211207143"}

These methods tackle with success potential changes between source and target data, however several classification tasks may face imbalance data, hence degrading the performance of such transfer methods. In this paper, we study the impact of class imbalance on these algorithms and propose an adaptation for each of them, named SER* and STRUT*.

Classification of a PPI network is completed by comparing the empirical network to a variety of model networks types (i.e. Networks that are not directly based on any empirical network). Before attempting to classify any empirical network it is essential to determine each algorithms ability to sort known model networks into their respective categories. For this paper, five classification algorithms (degree distribution distance, characteristic curve, relative graph let frequency, graph let degree distribution, and cross scoring) were tested on their ability to sort nine different model networks types into their respective categories. The model networks were all based on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI network. Results found the all of the algorithms, except cross scoring, to be extremely lacking in both accuracy and efficiency. The methods correctly classified networks less than 60% of the time suggesting that their ability to classify empirical PPI networks should be strongly questioned.

The class includes planted constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), as well as more general structures motivated by coding and community clustering problems. It is shown that under mild assumptions on the kernel, the conditional entropy of the node variables given the edge variables concentrates around a deterministic threshold. This implies in particular the concentration of the number of solutions in a broad class of planted CSPs, the existence of a threshold function for the disassortative stochastic block model, and the proof of a conjecture posed by [RKPSS10] on parity check codes.

In this study, the performance of CAD approach using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), second order statistics calculated from Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Higher-Order Spectra (HOS) texture descriptors are compared. The proposed system is validated using 400 MI and 400 normal ultrasound images, obtained from 80 patients with MI and 80 normal subjects. The extracted features are ranked based on t-value and fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to obtain the best performance using minimum number of features. The features extracted from DWT coefficients obtained an accuracy of 99.5%, sensitivity of 99.75% and specificity of 99.25%; GLCM have achieved an accuracy of 85.75%, sensitivity of 90.25% and specificity of 81.25%; and HOS obtained an accuracy of 93.0%, sensitivity of 94.75% and specificity of 91.25%. Among the three techniques presented DWT yielded the highest classification accuracy. Thus, the proposed CAD approach may be used as a complementary tool to assist cardiologists in making a more accurate diagnosis for the presence of MI.

It is therefore necessary to be able to recognize touch gestures in order to make human-robot interaction even more natural. We propose a method to recognize touch gestures.

In this population-based study of non-demented subjects, most of the associations between biomarkers and memory z-scores accrued after 70 years of age.

Evaluation of importance of the features used in the prediction and their subsequent selection is an immensely important step in the process of classification and data mining. This paper presents a study on the importance of student demographic features in the process of predicting. The study and performed analyses used the demographic data collected from the Information System for Higher Education (ISVU). For determining the importance of demographic features in the study the following methods have been used: Information Gain (IG), Gain Ratio (GR), Sequential Backward Selection (SBS), Sequential Forward Selection (SFS). The results show the features rank, their importance weight in the prediction and comparison of the results and the use of different methods. Two classification algorithms for evaluating the impact of ranking features to the quality of prediction are used: Naive Bayes i Support Vector Machine (SVM). Final results provide guidelines for the development of a new prediction model. I. INTRODUCTION Predicting the success of students has long been a topic which is being studied in various scientific communities. So far they have conducted various studies and analyses related to success in learning, finding the answer to the question how to achieve better results, and the relation regarding student properties and their impact on studying success. Predicting the success of students is closely associated with the concept of data mining and machine learning. In the research various techniques of learning and classification algorithms were used [1],[2]. Demographic data are an integral part of each classification that includes information about people, users, students, etc. For the purposes of the research in this article, we used Information System of Higher Education Institutions (ISVU), the data from Medimurje University of Applied Sciences in Cakovec, Croatia. Data mining and machine learning are the scientific fields in which the concept of prediction has been explored, various algorithms have been developed in order to achieve better prediction accuracy [3],[4]. When mentioning prediction, it primarily refers to classification of data to determine their membership depending on their features. If the prediction is determined on the basis of input data and achieved results, then we are taking about Supervised Learning [5].", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859754", "venue": "2014 37th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)", "journal": "2014 37th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2041427328", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13205785", "18555223", "8283563", "15312600", "14477318", "18212166", "18448024", "15582616", "12916662", "26173050", "5918824", "2357415", "42182119", "667586", "47128183", "15834575", "14819792"], "inbound_citations": ["73646865", "58534703", "18642275", "58004287", "16655650", "30315142", "36382678"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15709592"}

However, these techniques do not utilize the relationship among different devices, which is crucial to detect fraudulent activities. In this paper, we propose an effective device fraud detection framework called FeatNet, which incorporates device features and device relationships in network representation learning. Specifically, we partition the device network into bipartite graphs and generate the neighborhoods of vertices by revised truncated random walk.

This is due to the forex trading systems exist leverage which the invested capital will be doubled if the predicted results of buy / sell is accurate, but Trading Forex having high risk level, but by knowing the right time to trade (buy or sell), the losses can be avoided. Traders who invest in the foreign exchange market is expected to have the ability to analyze the circumstances and situations in predicting the difference in currency exchange rates. Forex price movements that form the pattern (curve) up and down greatly assist traders in making decisions. The movement of the curve used as an indicator in the decision to purchase (buy) or sell (sell). This study compares (Comparation) type algorithm kernel on Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the movement of the curve in live time trading forex using the data GBPUSD, 1H. Results of research on the study of the results and discussion can be concluded that the Kernel Dot, Kernel Multiquaric, Kernel Neural inappropriately used for data is non-linear in the case of data forex to follow the pattern of trend curves, because curves generated curved linear (straight) and then to type of kernel is the closest curve similar to the curve trend of online forex trading is Anova kernel and kernel radial, a little closer Combination Gaussian kernel, kernel Epachnenikof and to kernel polynomial form a parabolic curve open. key words: Trading Forex, Support Vector Machine, Kernel Anova, Dot Kernel, Kernel Multiquaric, Kernel Neural, Prediction, radial Kernel, Kernel Gaussian Combination, Epachnenikof kernel, polynomial kernel, EURUSD H1", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.26877/jiu.v2i2.1142", "venue": "Jurnal Informatika Upgris", "journal": "Jurnal Informatika Upgris", "mag_id": "2626585750", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:168831477"}

To better distinguish true from false positive calls, we present a method that uses genotype array data from the sequenced samples, rather than public data such as HapMap or dbSNP, to train an accurate classifier using Random Forests. We demonstrate our method on a set of variant calls obtained from 642 African-ancestry genomes from the The Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA), sequenced to high depth (30X). Results We have applied our classifier to compare call sets generated with different calling methods, including both single-sample and multi-sample callers. At a False Positive Rate of 5%, our method determines true positive rates of 97.5%, 95% and 99% on variant calls obtained using Illumina\u2019s single-sample caller CASAVA, Real Time Genomics\u2019 multisample variant caller, and the GATK Unified Genotyper, respectively. Since most NGS sequencing data is accompanied by genotype data for the same samples, our method can be trained on each dataset to provide a more accurate computational validation of site calls compared to generic methods. Moreover, our method allows for adjustment based on allele frequency (e.g., a different set of criteria to determine quality for rare vs. common variants) and thereby provides insight into sequencing characteristics that indicate data quality for variants of different frequencies.

In this context, Question Classification plays an important role for individuation of answer type. It involves the use of Natural Language Processing of the question, the extraction of a broad variety of features, and the use of machine learning algorithms to map features with a given taxonomy of question classes. In this work, a novel learning approach is proposed, based on the use of Support Vector Machines, for building a set of classifiers, each one to use for different questions and comprising the respective features, chosen through a particular forward-selection procedure. This approach aims at decreasing the total number of features, by avoiding those giving scarce information and/or noise. A Question Classification framework is implemented, comprising new sets of features with low numerosity. The application on a benchmark dataset shows classification accuracy competitive with the state-of-the-art, by considering a lower number of features.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-39345-2_52", "venue": "IIMSS", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2522597144", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52013539", "69610012", "32615227", "52988817", "23973625", "8279923"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44987841"}
