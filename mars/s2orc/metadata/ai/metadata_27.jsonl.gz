Approach We computed eigen values from the coefficient matrix of the MVAR model for classifying three different non-motor cognitive task in EEG based brain computer interface (BCI) system. In the first stage, the application of MEMD to multichannel EEG data gave rise to adaptive i.e. data driven decomposition of the multivariate time series data into a large number of IMF groups. In the second stage, the sensitive IMF groups were selected according to their task correlation factor. MVAR model of order six was developed from the five sensitive IMF groups and finally the eigen values of the correlation matrix derived from the coefficient matrix was employed for forming the feature vectors. At the last stage, the extracted feature vectors were fed to a Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier for automatic classification of mental task EEG signals. We tested our approach on the mental task EEG data sets of three subjects. Main result We achieved highest value of average classification accuracy of 94.43% for binary classification of the first pair of mental task i.e baseline and mental arithmetic task using polynomial kernel and 91.65% for the second pair i.e mental arithmetic and mental letter composing task using radial basis function (RBF) with ten fold cross validation.

In this case, the need for parallel processing becomes important. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze and perform computation times of different classification algorithms on many datasets using parallel profiling and computing techniques. Performance analysis is based on many factors, such as the unique nature of the dataset, the size, and type of the class, the diversity of the data in the data set, and so on.

This framework is a generalization of the notion of kernels used in support vector machines in the sense that allows one to use similarity functions that do not need to be positive semi-definite nor symmetric. The similarities are then used to define an explicit projection space where a linear classifier with good generalization properties can be learned. In this paper, we propose to study experimentally the usefulness of similarity based projection spaces for transfer learning issues. More precisely, we consider the problem of domain adaptation where the distributions generating learning data and test data are somewhat different. We stand in the case where no information on the test labels is available. We show that a simple renormalization of a good similarity function taking into account the test data allows us to learn classifiers more performing on the target distribution for difficult adaptation problems. Moreover, this normalization always helps to improve the model when we try to regularize the similarity based projection space in order to move closer the two distributions.

A very common method for this prediction is the use of Random Forest built on Genomic Features such as gene expression. However, effective drug sensitivity prediction requires the use of multiple heterogeneous dataset but it is rare that all such information is available for all drug and cell line combinations. To effectively incorporate all available data into a drug sensitivity prediction problem requires the use of stacking multiple models, built using a variety of different methods and data. In this article we investigate stacking in the context of drug sensitivity prediction. First, we examine basic models utilized in drug sensitivity prediction including the Random Forest, Neural Network, and K-Nearest Neighbor approach. To stack individual models we utilize a linear stacking method built utilizing a held-out validation set. We then investigate which form of stacking is most effective in improving accuracy. The two forms of stacking investigate are vertical stacking, in which our training samples are split and then stacked, and horizontal stacking, where our features are split before stacking. From a theoretical standpoint we have shown that horizontal stacking outperforms vertical stacking, especially as the sample size becomes large. Our theory is then proven utilizing both synthetically generated data, as well as data extracted from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Despite having the best individual predictor, vertical stacking consistently underperformed compared to horizontal stacking. Finally, we build a stacked model utilizing data extracted from a variety of sources. Gene Expression for individual cell lines are taken from the GDSC database, drug target data is data mined from Pubchem and physical features are extracted utilizing PaDEL-Descriptor software. Using this data we aim to predict the Area Under the Curve value for individual drug-cell line combinations. We examine the performance of individual and stacked models. We note that stacking models built on two heterogeneous datasets provide superior performance to stacking different models built on the same dataset. It is also noted that stacking provides a noticeable reduction in the bias of our predictors when the dominant eigenvalue of the principle axis of variation in the residuals is significantly higher than the remaining eigenvalues.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3107411.3110413", "venue": "ACM-BCB '17", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2749792424", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53104356", "57012595", "199549087", "195547467", "209324286", "4712484"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2622608"}

Besides, the newly collected testing data are usually unlabeled, which results in the subclass DTL-based methods called unsupervised deep transfer learning based (UDTL-based) intelligent fault diagnosis.

In order to classify products into binary classes of quality due to abusive and non-abusive handling (1, \u22121), useful features of the time-temperature curve were extracted to train the network using support vector classification (SVC). It was generally possible to classify shrimps based on end-of-storage quality by the available kernels; however, the radial basis function (RBF) was found to be the most suitable in terms of best fit and lower cost of calibration.

We will present how important the selection of an activation function is in the learning stage. A lot of work is developed and presented for SLFNs up to now.

Main task of an activation function is to map the input value of a neural network to the output node with a high learning or achievement rate. However, determining the correct activation function is not as simple as thought. First we try to show the effect of the activation functions on different datasets and then we propose a method for selection process of it due to the characteristic of any dataset.

To dissect the factors that result in effective siRNA sequences a regression kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach was used to quantitatively model RNA interference activities. Eight overall feature mapping methods were compared in their abilities to build SVM regression models that predict published siRNA activities. The primary factors in predictive SVM models are position specific nucleotide compositions. The secondary factors are position independent sequence motifs (N-grams) and guide strand to passenger strand sequence thermodynamics. Finally, the factors that are least contributory but are still predictive of efficacy are measures of intramolecular guide strand secondary structure and target strand secondary structure. Of these, the site of the 5' most base of the guide strand is the most informative. The capacity of specific feature mapping methods and their ability to build predictive models of RNAi activity suggests a relative biological importance of these features. Some feature mapping methods are more informative in building predictive models and overall t-test filtering provides a method to remove some noisy features or make comparisons among datasets. Together, these features can yield predictive SVM regression models with increased predictive accuracy between predicted and observed activities both within datasets by cross validation, and between independently collected RNAi activity datasets. Feature filtering to remove features should be approached carefully in that it is possible to reduce feature set size without substantially reducing predictive models, but the features retained in the candidate models become increasingly distinct.

However, there exists no systematic approach to predict whether an individual has sufficient thigh muscle strength necessary for FES-LCE exercise. Objective. To develop and test a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model as a predictor of thigh muscle strengths sufficient for short-duration FES-LCE exercise and compare the model's performance with other well-known statistical methods. Methods. Six healthy male individuals with SCI, having age (32.0 \u00b1 12.5 years), height (1.8 \u00b1 0.04 m), and weight (79.12 \u00b1 10.76 kg), participated in static and dynamic experiments. During static experiments, absolute crank torque measurements were used to estimate thigh muscle strengths in response to maximum FES intensities of 70 mA, 105 mA, and 140 mA at fixed crank positions on an FES-LCE. During dynamic experiments, changes in power output measurements were used to classify rider performance as \u2018Fatigue\u2019 or \u2018No Fatigue\u2019 during short-duration FES-LCE at maximum stimulation intensities of 70 mA, 105 mA, and 140 mA and flywheel resistance levels of 0/8th, 1/8th, and 2/8th kilopounds. A Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model was developed to classify static offline muscle strength observations with online rider performances. PAC's discriminatory power was compared with logistic regression (LR), Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and an artificial neural network (ANN) model. Results. PAC and ANN learning models correctly identified 100% of the training examples. PAC's average performance on the validation set was 93.1%. The ANN and LR performed comparable with 92.8% and 93.1% accuracy, respectively. The LDA method faired well on the validation set at 89.9%. Conclusions. PAC performed well in identifying muscle strengths associated with the online performance criterion. Although PAC did not perform best during cross-validation, this model has many advantages over the other methods. PAC can adapt to changes in classification schemes and is more amenable to theoretical analyses than the other methods.

This novel model improves robustness in incomplete data, when compared to existing systems, by designing a novel encoding scheme in BERT, a powerful language representation model solely based on attention mechanisms. Incomplete data in natural language processing refer to text with missing or incorrect words, and its presence can hinder the performance of current models that were not implemented to withstand such noises, but must still perform well even under duress. This is due to the fact that current approaches are built for and trained with clean and complete data, and thus are not able to extract features that can adequately represent incomplete data. Our proposed approach consists of obtaining intermediate input representations by applying an embedding layer to the input tokens followed by vanilla transformers. These intermediate features are given as input to novel denoising transformers which are responsible for obtaining richer input representations. The proposed approach takes advantage of stacks of multilayer perceptrons for the reconstruction of missing words' embeddings by extracting more abstract and meaningful hidden feature vectors, and bidirectional transformers for improved embedding representation.

Japanese children (42 boys and 26 girls) attending primary school were invited to participate in this study. We used a triaxial accelerometer with a sampling interval of 32 Hz and within a measurement range of \u00b16 G. Participants were asked to perform 6 nonlocomotive and 5 locomotive activities. We measured raw synthetic acceleration with the triaxial accelerometer and monitored oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production during each activity with the Douglas bag method. In addition, the resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured with the subject sitting on a chair to calculate metabolic equivalents (METs). When the ratio of unfiltered synthetic acceleration (USA) and filtered synthetic acceleration (FSA) was 1.12, the rate of correct discrimination between nonlocomotive and locomotive activities was excellent, at 99.1% on average. As a result, a strong linear relationship was found for both nonlocomotive (METs = 0.013\u00d7synthetic acceleration +1.220, R2 = 0.772) and locomotive (METs = 0.005\u00d7synthetic acceleration +0.944, R2 = 0.880) activities, except for climbing down and up. The mean differences between the values predicted by our model and measured METs were -0.50 to 0.23 for moderate to vigorous intensity (>3.5 METs) PAs like running, ball throwing and washing the floor, which were regarded as unpredictable PAs. In addition, the difference was within 0.25 METs for sedentary to mild moderate PAs (<3.5 METs).

To realize the full potential of deep learning for PET imaging, large datasets are required for training. However, dataset sizes are restricted due to limited availability.

Furthermore, we show that generated PET images can be used for synthetic data augmentation, and improve the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for predicting progression to AD.

We generate high quality PET images from corresponding MRIs using cGANs, and we evaluate the quality of generated PET images by comparison to real images. We then use the trained cGANs to generate synthetic PET images from additional MRI dataset. Finally we build a 152-layer ResNet to compare the MCI classification performance using both traditional data augmentation method and our proposed synthetic data augmentation method.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work tackling the fully automatic detection and position regression of basal/apical slices in CMR volumes in a dataset-invariant manner. We achieve this by maximizing the ability of a CNN to regress the position of basal/apical slices within a single dataset, while minimizing the ability of a classifier to discriminate image features between different data sources.

In this paper, in order to find the optimized grinding condition to reduce the manufacturing expense and to meet requirements of ground workpiece optimization algorithm using E.S.(Evolutionary Strategy) is proposed. The proposed algorithm has been employed to find the optimal grinding and dressing condition using the grinding process models and nonlinear grinding constraints. The optimized results also presents the guide line of grinding process. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through the experimental results.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1679957762", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109318572"}

After visiting each city (each city can be visited once), he returns to the departure city. Let\u2019s suppose that there is one road to connect each two cities. What is the best route to follow in order to minimize the distance of the journey? TSP has been proven to be a NP-hard problem, i.e. failure of finding a polynomial time algorithm to get a optimal solution. TSP is easy to interpret, yet hard to solve. This problem has aroused many scholars\u2019 interests since it was put forward in 1932. However, until now, no effective solution has been found. Though TSP only represents a problem of the shortest ring road, in actual life, many physical problems are found to be the TSP. Example 1, postal route. Postal route problem is a TSP. Suppose that a mail car needs to collect mails in n places. Under such circumstances, you can show the route through a drawing containing n+1 crunodes. One crunode means a post office which this mail car departures from and returns to. The remaining n crunodes mean the crunodes at which the mails need to be collected. The route that the mail car passes through is a travelling route. We hope to find a travelling route with the shortest length. Example 2, mechanical arm. When a mechanical arm is used to fasten the nuts for the ready-to-assembling parts on the assembly line, this mechanical arm will move from the initial position (position where the first nut needs to be fastened) to each nut in proper order and then return to the initial position. The route which the mechanical arm follows is a travelling route in the drawing which contains crunodes as nuts; the most economical travelling route will enable the mechanical arm to finish its work within the shortest time. Example 3, integrated circuit. In the course of manufacturing the integrated circuit, we often need to insert thousands of electrical elements. It will consume certain energy when moving from one electrical element to the other during manufacturing. How can we do to arrange the manufacturing order to minimum the energy consumption? This is obviously a solution for TSP. Except for the above examples, problems like route distribution of transportation network, choice of tourist route, laying of pipelines needed for city planning and engineering construction are interlinked with the problems of finding the shortest route. So, it is of significance to make a study on the problem of the shortest route. This renders us a use value. As finding a solution for TSP plays an important role in the real life, since the TSP appeared, it has attracted many scholars to make a study on it.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/12897", "venue": "Traveling Salesman Problem, Theory and Applications", "journal": "Traveling Salesman Problem, Theory and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1502251465", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["119484781"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53326196"}

Our study uses multiple machine learning classifiers to identify the sediment types of the Caminada dredge pit in the eastern part of the submarine sandy Ship Shoal of the Louisiana inner shelf of the United States (USA), and compares the performance of multiple supervised classification methods. High-resolution bathymetry and backscatter data, as well as 58 sediment grab samples were collected in the Caminada pit in August 2018, about two years after dredging. Two primary features (bathymetry and backscatter) and four secondary features were selected in the machine learning models. Three supervised classifications were tested in the study area: Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Regularized Logistic Regression. The models were trained using three different combinations of features: (1) all six features, (2) only bathymetry and backscatter features, and (3) a subset of selected features. The best performing model was the Random Forest method, but its performance was relatively poor when dealing with a few mixed (sand and mud) surficial sediment samples. The model provides a new and efficient method to predict the change of sediment distribution inside the Caminada pit over time, and is more reliable when predicting mixed bed with rough pit bottoms. Our results can be used to better understand the impacts on biological communities by (1) direct defaunation after initial sand excavation, (2) later mud accumulation in topographic lows, and (3) other geological and physical processes. In the future, the deposition and redistribution of mud inside the Caminada pit will continue, likely impacting benthos and water quality. Backscatter, roughness derived from bathymetry, rugosity derived from backscatter, and bathymetry (in the importance order from high to low) were identified as the most effective predictors of sediment texture for mineral resources management.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/w11061257", "venue": null, "journal": "Water", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2953141858", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["53657210", "145492579", "130058282", "140689938", "154341897", "53669192", "23129850", "205996611", "152391338", "1395143", "135100852", "58933700", "130615751", "146267015", "128457775", "127474816", "130213920", "42476116", "61156451", "6057926", "13969706", "55180969", "134476636", "132358020", "130631034", "131485346", "129350443", "18912881", "55021619", "55977962", "85736870", "25088186", "129337734", "207738357", "878802", "2884606", "54978398", "129697140", "128772795", "127650819", "128608595", "14066858", "86058889", "129075370", "20060904", "215069879", "54760227", "53052538", "55334144", "129568994", "129195423", "23390645", "108712382", "128756080"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196589877"}

In particular, online MOT is more demanding due to its diverse applications in time-critical situations. A main issue of realizing online MOT is how to associate noisy object detection results on a new frame with previously being tracked objects. In this work, we propose a multi-object tracker method called CRF-boosting which utilizes a hybrid data association method based on online hybrid boosting facilitated by a conditional random field (CRF) for establishing online MOT. For data association, learned CRF is used to generate reliable low-level tracklets and then these are used as the input of the hybrid boosting. To do so, while existing data association methods based on boosting algorithms have the necessity of training data having ground truth information to improve robustness, CRF-boosting ensures sufficient robustness without such information due to the synergetic cascaded learning procedure. Further, a hierarchical feature association framework is adopted to further improve MOT accuracy. From experimental results on public datasets, we could conclude that the benefit of proposed hybrid approach compared to the other competitive MOT systems is noticeable.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5375903", "pubmed_id": "28304366", "doi": "10.3390/s17030617", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2595295855", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7524689", "1067638", "206590483", "918485", "3198903", "1606049", "32640", "20469562", "7402913", "15005943", "1828261", "8974920", "1625846", "407037", "906702", "8797237", "338104", "10991044", "1000705", "277918", "927988", "16692650", "61732280", "1002931", "14073049", "9458741", "14520710", "9341129", "207061032", "1572388", "686324", "2633157", "10562255", "2536395", "5681609", "11266272", "12780603", "9088971", "64001238", "12943282", "116757950", "6638556", "16134208", "9536044", "4834008", "15911858"], "inbound_citations": ["59414053"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3372863"}

This paper proposes a character attention generative adversarial network named CAGAN for restoring heavily degraded character patterns in historical documents so that OCRs improve their accuracy and even help archeologists to decode them. The network is based on the U-Net like architecture [1] with skip connections, and it is trained by the proposed loss function including the common adversarial loss (global loss) and the hierarchical character attentive loss (local loss). We made an experiment on 118 categories of most common Japanese Kanji characters, collected from severely damaged historical documents called Heijokyo mokkan written during the Nara period in Japan.

Proximity measure is a convenient way to demonstrate impractical significance of values of memberships in the intuitionistic fuzzy set. However, the related works of Pappis (Fuzzy Sets Syst 39(1):111\u2013115, 1991), Hong and Hwang (Fuzzy Sets Syst 66(3):383\u2013386, 1994), Virant (2000) and Cai (IEEE Trans Fuzzy Syst 9(5):738\u2013750, 2001) did not model the measure in the context of the intuitionistic fuzzy set but in the Zadeh\u2019s fuzzy set instead. In this paper, we examine this problem and propose new notions of \u03b4-equalities for the intuitionistic fuzzy set and \u03b4-equalities for intuitionistic fuzzy relations. Two fuzzy sets are said to be \u03b4-equal if they are equal to an extent of \u03b4. The applications of \u03b4-equalities are important to fuzzy statistics and fuzzy reasoning. Several characteristics of \u03b4-equalities that were not discussed in the previous works are also investigated. We apply the \u03b4-equalities to the application of medical diagnosis to investigate a patient\u2019s diseases from symptoms. The idea is using \u03b4-equalities for intuitionistic fuzzy relations to find groups of intuitionistic fuzzified set with certain equality or similar degrees then combining them. Numerical examples are given to illustrate validity of the proposed algorithm.

Results show that the overlaps between areas of high AGB with high IUCN red listed avian species richness and endemic avian species richness were fairly limited at 13% and 8% at the 1-km scale. The overlap between 1) low AGB and low IUCN richness, and 2) low AGB and low endemic avian species richness was higher at 36% and 12% respectively.

Compared to other physiological experimental signals frequently used in emotion recognition, EEG signals are easy to record but not easy to disguise. However, because of high dimensionality of EEG data and the diversity of human emotions, feature extraction and classification of EEG signals are still difficult. In this paper, we propose deep forest with multi-scale window (MSWDF) to identify EEG emotions. Deep Forest is an integrated method of decision trees. In the MSWDF, features can be extracted by multi-granularity scanning with multi-scale windows. Compared with deep neural network, the MSWDF not only has less parameters to adjust, but also can realize the classification of the dataset with small samples. In the MSWDF, raw EEG signals were firstly filtered and segmented into samples. Regarding EEG signals as multivariate time series, a new multi-granularity scanning strategy with variable windows is proposed to extract features from EEG samples. After classifying EEG features by the cascade forest, the recognition results are compared with these of Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The results of the analysis suggest that it is probably too early to assume that car travel demand is close to a peak throughout Europe. It would be more accurate to claim that a plateau has been reached in a few EU Member States with a developed economy, high car ownership rates and slowly changing demographic profiles. Evidence shows that in some of these countries car use has peaked. However, significant growth in car use should be expected in Eastern Europe. The trends concerning the use of passenger cars are certainly not uniform across the EU since each Member State has its own socio-economic conditions and follows a different path as regards car dependency. In addition, some of the indications of changes in trends can be circumstantial or temporary, as for example the impacts that the economic crisis may have on car ownership and use. Others are long term and perhaps not clearly visible yet. The changing structure of the economy, the longer periods of education for the young, the more fragmented and deregulated labour market and the changing cultural values (i.e. the high value of digital connectivity) may be gradually changing the role of the car in the society in the long term, but there is still not sufficient evidence to suggest that they already are having an impact throughout Europe. Part of the impact of the factors analysed here may simply be the result of postponing decisions related to car use. However, even postponement alters the total level of demand, for if one age group now makes fewer trips than it did before, it lowers the overall level of demand. Evidence also shows that the young groups who are now postponing driving a car do not reach the levels of car use in their 30s and 40s that the generation before had.

This paper introduces a strategy for automatic detection of polyps larger than 5 mm.

This problem is formulated as a Competitive Influence Maximization (CIM). Recently, a reinforcement learning has been used to solve the CIM problem, that is, to find an optimal strategy against competitor in order to maximize the commutative reward under the competition from other agents. However, reinforcement learning agents require huge training time to find an optimal strategy whenever the settings of the agents or the networks change. To tackle this issue, we propose a transfer learning method in reinforcement learning to reduce the training time and utilize the knowledge gained on source network to target network. Our method relies on two ideas, the first one is the state representation of the source and target networks in order to efficiently utilize the knowledge gained on source network to target network.

Since there is no reliable test to differentiate between different ovarian tumors, accurate classification could facilitate adequate referral to a gynecological oncologist, improving survival. The goal of our study was to assess the potential value of a SELDI-TOF-MS based classifier for discriminating between patients with a pelvic mass. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Our study design included a well-defined patient population, stringent protocols and an independent validation cohort. We compared serum samples of 53 ovarian cancer patients, 18 patients with tumors of low malignant potential, and 57 patients with a benign ovarian tumor on different ProteinChip arrays. In addition, from a subset of 84 patients, tumor tissues were collected and microdissection was used to isolate a pure and homogenous cell population. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis (DLDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification on serum samples comparing cancer versus benign tumors, yielded models with a classification accuracy of 71-81% (cross-validation), and 73-81% on the independent validation set. Cancer and benign tissues could be classified with 95-99% accuracy using cross-validation. Tumors of low malignant potential showed protein expression patterns different from both benign and cancer tissues. Remarkably, none of the peaks differentially expressed in serum samples were found to be differentially expressed in the tissue lysates of those same groups. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Although SELDI-TOF-MS can produce reliable classification results in serum samples of ovarian cancer patients, it will not be applicable in routine patient care. On the other hand, protein profiling of microdissected tumor tissue may lead to a better understanding of oncogenesis and could still be a source of new serum biomarkers leading to novel methods for differentiating between different histological subtypes.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3494530", "pubmed_id": "22824475", "doi": "10.1186/1477-5956-10-45", "venue": "Proteome Science", "journal": "Proteome Science", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2145791981", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["10750245", "24823292", "86954487", "27534914", "24127818", "39281289", "24446609", "46654038", "7272187", "44353370", "32876643", "19666918", "20632039", "58452344", "14128491", "690024", "23258051", "21918233", "10974575", "2783112", "6074151", "41560261", "20319379", "24176069", "7296892", "2229565", "39112913", "17578642", "4794285"], "inbound_citations": ["5706329", "73485030", "2401127", "27197611", "22418407", "22649492", "9940831", "1518935", "52221315", "91190738", "12966987"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13860839"}

During the last two decades, satellite remote sensing data have been extensively used for wetland mapping and monitoring worldwide. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) imagery is a complex and multi-dimensional data, which has high potential to discriminate different land cover types. However, despite significant improvements to both information content in PolSAR imagery and advanced classification approaches, wetland classification using PolSAR data may not provide acceptable classification accuracy. This is because classification accuracy using PolSAR imagery strongly depends on the polarimetric features that are incorporated into the classification scheme. In this paper, a novel feature weighting method for PolSAR imagery is proposed to increase the classification accuracy of complex land cover. Specifically, a new coefficient is determined for each element of the coherency matrix by integration of Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and physical interpretation of the PolSAR data. The proposed methodology was applied to multi-temporal polarimetric C-band RADARSAT-2 data in the Avalon Peninsula, Deer Lake, and Gros Morne pilot sites in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Different combinations of input features, including original PolSAR features, polarimetric decomposition features, and modified coherency matrix were used to evaluate the capacity of the proposed method for improving the classification accuracy using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The results demonstrated that the modified coherency matrix obtained by the proposed method, Van Zyl, and Freeman-Durden decomposition features were the most important features for wetland classification. The fine spatial resolution maps obtained in this study illustrate the distribution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats for the three wetland pilot sites in Newfoundland using the modified coherency matrix and other polarimetric features.

Feature clustering is a powerful alternative to feature selection for reducing the dimensionality of text data. In this paper we propose a new information-theoretic divisive algorithm for feature/word clustering and apply it to text classification. Existing techniques for such \"distributional clustering\" of words are agglomerative in nature and result in (i) sub-optimal word clusters and (ii) high computational cost. In order to explicitly capture the optimality of word clusters in an information theoretic framework, we first derive a global criterion for feature clustering. We then present a fast, divisive algorithm that monotonically decreases this objective function value. We show that our algorithm minimizes the \"within-cluster Jensen-Shannon divergence\" while simultaneously maximizing the \"between-cluster Jensen-Shannon divergence\". In comparison to the previously proposed agglomerative strategies our divisive algorithm is much faster and achieves comparable or higher classification accuracies. We further show that feature clustering is an effective technique for building smaller class models in hierarchical classification.

UWB can be used in many scenarios and its effectiveness in through wall detection along with its excellent resolution for person localization is one of the best applications of IR-UWB. The main objective of this work is to propose a concept for intelligent radar systems employing UWB augmented by machine learning approaches to not only localize but understand the location of a person or target within a building. Although suitably developed UWB is excellent for obtaining localizing data it does not automatically understand what that location effectively means or where it is thus further methods are required to create meaningful data for end user appreciation. Learning from the huge amount of UWB signal data through Multi Class Support Vector Machine (MC-SVM) architecture enables a truly evolving scheme to both localize targets and identify them in a useful way.

Of many approaches used, image classification based on feature parameters has often proven to be particularly useful. However, large image databases can be computationally costly to analyse, and the datasets are susceptible to noise. Hence, it is essential to determine which feature parameters hold the most useful information, in order to improve the classification rate and computation time. This paper presents a performance evaluation of dimension reduction techniques currently used in pattern recognition. A comparison of three methods is conducted, in order to determine which is able to produce the best results over a large range of image datasets. The methods analysed are: Non-Linear Fisher, Principal Component Analysis and kernel Principal Component Analysis. These are then tested against four different classifiers to obtain the best combination. These classifiers are: Linear Discriminant Classifier, Quadratic Discriminant Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machine Classifiers. For further analysis, two combined dimension reduction and classification methods are tested: Minimum Classification Error and reduced feature space Support Vectors. For the comparison, four datasets of images with different scales and rotations are used, i.e. Brodatz textures, artificially generated isotropic fractal images and Talysurf images of sandblasted and abraded steel surfaces. The results showed that a combination of the Non-Linear Fisher dimension reduction technique and a Linear Support Vector Machine Classifier gave the best performance overall and are the most promising for the application in automated machine condition monitoring and expert free failure analysis. Further improvement can be achieved by performing a step-wise dimension reduction by first reducing the features using the Principal Component Analysis method, then further reduction with the Non-Linear Fisher technique.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11249-006-9067-y", "venue": null, "journal": "Tribology Letters", "mag_id": "2076973155", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["55828888"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135907563"}

The fundamental limitations in pain assessment in neonates stem from subjective assessment criteria, rather than quantifiable and measurable data. This often results in poor quality and inconsistent treatment of patient pain management. Recent advancements in pattern recognition techniques using relevance vector machine (RVM) learning techniques can assist medical staff in assessing pain by constantly monitoring the patient and providing the clinician with quantifiable data for pain management. The RVM classification technique is a Bayesian extension of the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, which achieves comparable performance to SVM while providing posterior probabilities for class memberships and a sparser model.

To dramatically reduce annotation cost, this paper presents a novel method to naturally integrate active learning and transfer learning (fine-tuning) into a single framework, called AFT*, which starts directly with a pre-trained CNN to seek\"worthy\"samples for annotation and gradually enhance the (fine-tuned) CNN via continuous fine-tuning.

We constructed a logit quasi-likelihood model to examine the insurance impact using 2008 Tennessee Hospital Outpatient Discharge Data. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Among a total of 2,177,955 ED visits in the analysis, uninsured status was significantly associated with the likelihood that an ED visit was nonurgent or PCS. These associations were different for men and women and across major racial groups. On average, uninsured status was associated with an increased probability of 0.038 of being nonurgent and 0.054 of being PCS, relative to private insurance status. The corresponding numbers for public insurance status were 0.060 and 0.075, respectively. For nonurgent or PCS probabilities that are not close to 0, higher nonurgent or PCS likelihoods corresponded to lower ED cost per visit to third-party insurers and patients. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Lack of insurance was associated with a higher probability of a nonurgent or PCS ED visit when compared with private insurance. When uninsured individuals gain coverage under the Affordable Care Act through either Medicaid expansion (public coverage) or insurance exchanges (private coverage), the average nonurgent or PCS probabilities could change either way given the opposite effects of public and private insurance coverage.

The automated delineation of lesion is a prerequisite prior to characterization, which is challenging itself. Thus, this paper has two major objectives: (a) design of a segmentation system which can model by learning the lesion characteristics and this is posed as a Bayesian model; (b) develop a psoriasis risk assessment system (pRAS) by crisscrossing the blocks which drives the fundamental machine learning paradigm. Methods The segmentation system uses the knowledge derived by the experts along with the features reflected by the lesions to build a Bayesian framework that helps to classify each pixel of the image into lesion vs. background. Since this lesion has several stages and grades, hence the system undergoes the risk assessment to classify into five levels of severity: healthy, mild, moderate, severe and very severe. We build nine kinds of pRAS utilizing different combinations of the key blocks. These nine pRAS systems use three classifiers (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Neural Network (NN)) and three feature selection techniques (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) and Mutual Information (MI)). The two major experiments conducted using these nine systems were: (i) selection of best system combination based on classification accuracy and (ii) understanding the reliability of the system. This leads us to computation of key system performance parameters such as: feature retaining power, aggregated feature effect and reliability index besides conventional attributes like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity. Results Using the database used in this study consisted of 670 psoriasis images, the combination of SVM and FDR was revealed as the optimal pRAS system and yielded a classification accuracy of 99.84% using cross-validation protocol. Further, SVM-FDR system provides the reliability of 99.99% using cross-validation protocol. Conclusions The study demonstrates a fully novel model of segmentation embedded with risk assessment. Among all nine systems, SVM-FDR produced best results. Further, we validated our pRAS system with automatic segmented lesions against manually segmented lesions showing comparable performance.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28859832", "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.07.011", "venue": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "mag_id": "2742585132", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3450471", "4757658", "195812183", "214810015", "58669744", "52962071", "174802900", "141442551"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25690692"}

Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Multiple Kernel Learning SVM is used for the estimation and classification. Originality of our paper is that the hyperspectral data is used for both lightning environment estimation and perceptual color classification of an object. Suppose that the lightning environment is given, the perceptual color of the object is classified in each environment. Additionally, perceptual color is estimated by using result of the lightning environment estimation. A novel dataset which consists of the hyperspectral image of 15 objects taken in 4 different lightning environments is constructed in our experiment. Experimental result of the hyperspectral data are compared by those of common color spaces, such as RGB and L*a*b. The estimation and classification with SVM and MKL SVM are compared in the experiments. From the experimental results, hyperspectral data enabled us to present a separated scheme which consists of the lightning environment estimation and perceptual color classification while previous color spaces could not.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-54407-6_24", "venue": "ACCV Workshops", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2597288165", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27535719"}

We propose a deep learning-based interactive segmentation method to improve the results obtained by an automatic CNN and to reduce user interactions during refinement for higher accuracy.

Another CNN takes as input the user interactions with the initial segmentation and gives a refined result.

In designing a classifier, two main problems have to be solved, on one hand the option concerning a suitable structure and on the other hand the selection of an algorithm for parameter estimation. The algorithm for parameter estimation performs the optimization of a conven- able selected cost function with respect to the empirical risk which is directly related to the representativeness of the available learning sequence. The choice of the structure is made such that to maximize the generalization capacity, that is to assure good performance in classifying new data coming from the same classes.

In this thesis, starting from the AGES-Reykjavik Database, predictive analysis is done using both regression and classification ML algorithms. The Database is composed of 11 NTRA parameters extracted from Computed Tomography (CT) scans of mid-femur section of a 65-95 years old population, (4 related to muscle tissues, 4 to the fat, and 3 to the connective tissues) and by 25 measurements of which the most relevant are Body Mass Index (BMI), Cholesterol (SCHOL) and LEF biometric parameters (normal/fast gait speed, time up-to-go, and isometric leg strength). There are 3157 patients in AGES I and the same number in AGES II (same measurements on the same patients taken 5-6 after AGES I), so in total 6314. After an accurate study of the outliers and of the Nan values in the database, regression and classification are applied in order to predict at first BMI (parameter used to test the methodology) using tree-based regression algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Ada Boosting and Gradient Boosting. Then the algorithms are extended also to SCHOL and LEF measurements. A proper Train-Test division of the dataset is done using k_fold cross-validation. Different selections of initial features are used combined with the different databases, with different k-fold divisions and using the 4 algorithms in order to obtain the best coefficient of determination (R2) as an evaluator of the quality of the regression\u2019s prediction. Afterward, BMI and the other measurements are divided into 3 and 5 classes and the same methodology is used to classify them. For this classification analysis, the accuracy parameter (Jaccard Index - JI) is calculated to evaluate the quality of the results. The best results are obtained for the test parameter BMI. The max R2 for BMI is 0,8305 and it is obtained using as regressors the 11 NTRA parameter, AGESI+II, k_fold=16, and the Gradient Boosting Algorithm with n_estimators=200. For each R2 value obtained mixing all the possible combinations, the amplitude of the connective tissue and of the fat always cover more than 50% of all the feature importance. The classification gives a max JI=0,797 for 3 classes, while with 5 classes the max JI is 0,741. For what concern SCHOL, Normal Gait, and Time up-to-go, R2 and JI are not good enough to allow you to consider NTRA parameters as predictive features for them. On the other hand, the results of regression and classification for Leg Strength are satisfactory with a maximum R2 of 0,613 obtained using a particular selection of NTRA features, AGES-I, k_fold=16, and Gradient Boosting Algorithm. The best JI for Leg Strength is obtained with the division in 3 classes and is equal to 0,638. In conclusion, this study provides good results in terms of prediction, using both regression and classification for the BMI and the Leg Strength starting from a CT scan and adding eventually other physiological parameters. The methodology and the tree-based algorithms which are effective for BMI and Leg Strength can be eventually, in future works, extended also to other parameters present in the database.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2979202769", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209990956"}

Based on the notion of temporal walks, we describe a general class of embeddings called continuous-time dynamic network embeddings (CTDNEs) that completely avoid the issues and problems that arise when approximating the temporal network as a sequence of static snapshot graphs. Unlike previous work, CTDNEs learn dynamic node embeddings directly from the temporal network at the finest temporal granularity and thus use only temporally valid information. As such CTDNEs naturally support online learning of the node embeddings in a streaming real-time fashion.

However, as its use in applications is growing, such as in automatic cars, the ability to predict a longer usage time is required. To be able to do this, two issues should be considered: (1) the influence of both the ambient temperature and the rise in temperature caused by Joule heat, and (2) the influence of changes in the state of charge (SOC). In response, we propose the use of a model-based extreme learning machine (Model-ELM, MELM) to predict the battery future voltage, power, and surface temperature for any given load current. The standard ELM is a kind of single-layer feedforward network (SLFN). We propose using a set of rough models to replace the active functions (such as logsig()) in the ELM for better generalization performance. The model parameters and initial SOC in these \u201crough models\u201d are randomly selected within a given range, so little prior knowledge about the battery is required. Moreover, the identification of the complex nonlinear system can be transferred into a standard least squares problem, which is suitable for online applications. The proposed method was tested and compared with RLS (Recursive Least Square)-based methods at different ambient temperatures to verify its superiority. The temperature prediction accuracy is higher than \u00b11.5 \u00b0C, and the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of the power prediction is less than 0.25 W.

There have been several studies focusing on mapping these anomalies by utilizing ever evolving multispectral and hyperspectral imaging instruments, which has proven their capacity for mapping both hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-induced alterations so far. These studies broadly comprise of methods like calculating band ratios, spectral angle mapping, spectral feature fitting, and principal component analysis as detection techniques. However, there is a lack of concentration on advanced signature based detection algorithms and unmixing methods for mapping surface manifestations of hydrocarbon microseeps. Signature based detection algorithms utilize target spectra to correlate with each pixel\u2019s spectrum in order to allocate possible target locations. Unmixing methods, on the other hand, require no input spectra beforehand, aiming to resolve each pixel\u2019s spectral constituents and their corresponding abundance fractions. In this paper, the potential of all these methods in mapping microseepage related anomalies are evaluated by implementing and comparing them for Gemrik Anticline, one of the prospective hydrocarbon exploration fields in Turkey. Hence, it provides a complete knowledge on determination surface manifestations of hydrocarbon microseeps with the help of well known supervised target detection algorithms and hyperspectral unmixing algorithms. The study area is located in the Southeastern Anatolia, between the cities of Adiyaman and \u015eanliurfa. The spectral signatures were collected with Analytical Spectral Devices Inc.

River flow data are important for engineers to design, build and operate various water projects and development. The monthly river flow data taken from Department of Irrigation and Drainage, Malaysia are used in this study. This study aims to develop a suitable model for short-term forecasting of monthly river flow in three catchment areas in Malaysia. The hybrid model based on a combination of two methods of Self Organizing Map (SOM) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) model referred as SOM-LSSVM model is introduced. The hybrid model using the \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d approach where SOM algorithm is used to cluster the data into several disjointed clusters. Next, the LSSVM model is used to forecast the river flow for each cluster. This study also provides a method for determining the input structure that will be used by Artificial Neural Network (ANN), LSSVM and hybrid SOM-LSSVM models. There are three techniques used to determine the number of input structures. The first technique is based on the past trend river flow data, the second technique is based on the stepwise regression analysis and the third technique is the best Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The experiments present a comparison between a hybrid model and a single model of ARIMA, ANN, and LSSVM. The comparison to determine the best of the model is based on three types of statistical measures of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Correlation Coefficient (r). The results have shown that the hybrid model shows better performance than other models for river flow forecasting. It also indicates that the proposed model can be predicted more accurately and provides a promising alternative technique in river flow forecasting.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2239783391", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113042811"}

Of the 265 patients with suicidality, 58.5 % were discharged home (ideation = 72.1 % vs. attempt/preparation = 33.7 %, p < 0.0001). In patients with suicidal ideation, outpatient disposition was associated with higher GAF score, school referral, and adjustment disorder (p < 0.0001). In patients with suicidal attempt/preparation, outpatient disposition was associated with higher GAF score, lower acuity rating, and school referral (p < 0.0001). Suicidality is common among PPERS evaluations. Higher GAF score and school referral distinguished suicidal ideation from suicidal attempt/preparation and was associated with outpatient disposition in both presentations. Increased education of referral sources and establishment of different non-PPERS evaluation systems may improve identification of non-emergent suicidal presentations and encourage more appropriate outpatient referrals.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25331538", "doi": "10.1007/s00787-014-0624-x", "venue": "European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry", "journal": "European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2012337024", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3676721", "27384747", "15196691", "34374154", "24358917", "215179620", "28228137", "10984484", "205651683", "24901105", "26665709", "20864352", "22600201", "24087473", "29083241", "21893905", "19245448", "30874835", "22268998", "25390689", "45710879", "28574948", "24710913", "22690017", "25143987", "34357149", "25497619", "7738278", "8545722", "15262645", "23313794", "37032156", "7614649", "6909729", "25628850", "11549262"], "inbound_citations": ["3636006", "201093607"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12038754"}

This paper presents a novel spatial feature, mean shift (MS) vector-based shape feature (MSVSF), to improve the classification accuracy of very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery. MSVSF is a ${\\bf 3} \\times {\\bf 1}$ feature vector extracted in per-pixel fashion. It describes the shape of a spectrally homogeneous area surrounding each pixel by measuring the two-dimensional (2-D) image deformation of its local area imposed by the MS vector. The proposed feature is particularly effective to discriminate objects with similar spectral response but different 2-D shapes, such as buildings and roads. Independent component analysis is adopted to extract spectral features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is adopted to classify the spectral and spatial features and several state-of-the-art spatial/structural features are compared to the proposed feature. A synthetic experiment demonstrates that the proposed feature has good capability to describe 2-D shapes with different scale, two real dataset experiments on QuickBird and IKONOS images show MSVSF has achieved better overall accuracy (OA) than the compared ones. In addition, the MSVSF feature is extended to the object-based classification (OBC), and the result shows that the MSVSF is effective to improve the classification accuracy on high resolution images of the urban area.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2357832", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2007555690", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["29216474", "16775850", "16143967", "4637792", "12431193", "4635357", "35441173", "67785475", "18485838", "6629776", "206786900", "15374375", "129979579", "13284902", "130936610", "3239148", "15049946", "17204697", "14544839", "128600373", "55083729", "130746518", "14932180", "691081", "31311624", "15299210", "14842224", "122725444", "122675401", "7443466", "4639400", "6793216", "18340548", "24486848", "6906514", "194951", "14495716", "17790307", "22519235", "52998092", "33795954", "54741771", "8418208"], "inbound_citations": ["2878645", "7788417", "126695319", "2960326", "56596985", "1591687", "4641127", "213365892", "49547631", "25074527", "197585774", "36756299"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6165221"}

Three physical therapy tasks with multiple difficulty levels are selected by our PT co-author to help PD patients improve balance and mobility.

Therefore, the patient's error can be reported to the PT, who can remotely supervise the patient's performance and conformance on the training tasks. Moreover, the PT can update the tasks that the patient should perform through the cloud-based platform in a timely manner, which enables personalized treatment for the patient.

We introduce a CRF based scene labeling model that incorporates both local features and features aggregated over the whole image or large sections of it. Secondly, traditional CRF learning requires fully labeled datasets which can be costly and troublesome to produce. We introduce a method for learning CRFs from datasets with many unlabeled nodes by marginalizing out the unknown labels so that the log-likelihood of the known ones can be maximized by gradient ascent. Loopy Belief Propagation is used to approximate the marginals needed for the gradient and log-likelihood calculations and the Bethe free-energy approximation to the log-likelihood is monitored to control the step size.

By using the Gaussian classifier, the sensitivity to noise on a number of benchmarks data sets is diminished, and it learns a more efficient internal representation of a mapping. The incremental topology-learning mechanisms of GNG enable TGARAM to connect the generated nodes and build a topology-preserving map. In addition, TGARAM retains multi-channel ARAM network architecture and thus capable to learn multiple mappings simultaneously across multi-modal input patterns, in an online and incremental manner. Multiple sensory sources can be transmitted to TGARAM to build a topological map and improve the estimation of localization, in order to be as generic as possible.

Among these methods, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as one of the best time-frequency method has been used for both stationary and transitory signals. Some deficiencies of CWT are problem of overlapping and distortion ofsignals. In this condition, a large amount of redundant information exists so that it may cause false alarm or misinterpretation of the operator. In this paper a modified method called Exact Wavelet Analysis is used to minimize the effects of overlapping and distortion in case of gearbox faults. To implement exact wavelet analysis, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used for this purpose. This method have been implemented for the acceleration signals from 2D acceleration sensor acquired by Advantech PCI-1710 card from a gearbox test setup in Amirkabir University of Technology. Gearbox has been considered in both healthy and chipped tooth gears conditions. Kernelized Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial basis functions has used the extracted features from exact wavelet analysis for classification. The efficiency of this classifier is then evaluated with the other signals acquired from the setup test. The results show that in comparison of CWT, PSO Exact Wavelet Transform has better ability in feature extraction in price of more computational effort. In addition, PSO exact wavelet has better speed comparing to Genetic Algorithm (GA) exact wavelet in condition of equal population because of factoring mutation and crossover in PSO algorithm.

Although several alternatives to improve PNNs' reliability and performance and/or to reduce computational costs exist, PNNs are currently not well recognised as SVMs because the SVMs were compared with standard PNNs. To rule out this idea, the microhabitat suitability for the Eastern Iberian chub (Squalius valentinus Doadrio & Carmona, 2006) was modelled with SVMs and four types of PNNs (homoscedastic, heteroscedastic, cluster and enhanced PNNs); all of them optimised with Differential Evolution. The fitness function and several performance criteria (correctly classified instances, true skill statistic, specificity and sensitivity) and partial dependence plots were used to assess respectively the performance and reliability of each habitat suitability model. Heteroscedastic and enhanced PNNs achieved the highest performance in every index but specificity. However, these two PNNs rendered ecologically unreliable partial dependence plots. Conversely, homoscedastic and cluster PNNs rendered ecologically reliable partial dependence plots. Thus, Eastern Iberian chub proved to be a eurytopic species, presenting the highest suitability in microhabitats with cover present, low flow velocity (approx. 0.3 m/s), intermediate depth (approx. 0.6 m) and fine gravel (64\u2013256 mm). PNNs outperformed SVMs; thus, based on the results of the cluster PNN, which also showed high values of the performance criteria, we would advocate a combination of approaches (e.g., cluster & heteroscedastic or cluster & enhanced PNNs) to balance the trade-off between accuracy and reliability of habitat suitability models.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecoinf.2017.10.008", "venue": "Ecol.

In this work we focus on two of the most prominent such challenges, namely scene understanding and path planning. Scene understanding is a challenging computer vision task with recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieving results that notably surpass prior traditional feature driven approaches. Here, we build on recent work in urban road-scene understanding, training a state of the art CNN architecture towards the task of classifying off-road scenes. We analyse the effects of transfer learning and training data set size on CNN performance, evaluating multiple configurations of the network at multiple points during the training cycle, investigating in depth how the training process is affected. We compare this CNN to a more traditional feature-driven approach with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and demonstrate state-of-the-art results in this particularly challenging problem of off-road scene understanding. We then expand on this with the addition of multi-channel RGBD data, which we encode in multiple configurations for CNN input. We evaluate each of these configuration over our own off-road RGBD data set and compare performance to that of the network model trained using RGB data. Next, we investigate end-to-end navigation, whereby a machine learning algorithm optimises to predict the vehicle control inputs of a human driver. After evaluating such a technique in an off-road environment and identifying several limitations, we propose a new approach in which a CNN learns to predict vehicle path visually, combining a novel approach to automatic training data creation with state of the art CNN architecture to map a predicted route directly onto image pixels.

Moreover, these models can capture some of the complex, time-varying dynamics of language development. Here, a model is presented in which dyads of artificial agents (each a recurrent neural network based on Rogers, et al., 2004) were trained in a structured environment to develop a language and use it to coordinate in a simple task. The model was informed by an experiment with human subjects based on existing work (Clark & Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Selten & Warglien, 2007). While inconclusive, the study offers some insight into the strengths and weaknesses of this particular approach to modeling metonymy production.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2165019484", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["125081273", "123964995", "2763403", "203443752", "14084134", "151433507", "10301716", "3712075", "202927997", "147085499", "164074526", "198168616", "143537260", "1349064", "209396626", "62245742", "2925250"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32088449"}

The proposed multirobot transfer learning framework is based on a combined ${\\mathcal{L}_1}$ adaptive control and an iterative learning control approach. The key idea is that the adaptive controller forces dynamically different systems to behave as a specified reference model. The proposed multitask transfer learning framework uses theoretical control results (e.g., the concept of vector relative degree) to learn a map from desired trajectories to the inputs that make the system track these trajectories with high accuracy. This map is used to calculate the inputs for a new, unseen trajectory.

Later, conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN) have attracted attention for its easy adaptation for many picture-to-picture problems. CGANs have been applied for a wide variety of tasks, such as background masking, segmentation, medical image processing, and superresolution.

From the extracted veins, parameters such as the width and length of each vein are calculated, along with the cotton wool region size and contour of the image. In all, these four parameters are used to detect the stages of diabetic retinopathy. The width and length are calculated from the segmented area by using a basic formula. The area of the cotton wool region is obtained by subtracting the value of the area of the vein region.

The GCM assumes that a set of tasks is assigned to pairs of nodes and their outcomes are compared by neighboring nodes. Given that comparisons are performed by the nodes themselves, faulty nodes can incorrectly claim that fault-free nodes are faulty or that faulty ones are fault-free. The collections of all matches and mismatches, i.e., The comparison outcomes, among the nodes are used to identify the set of permanently faulty nodes. First, we show how SVMs can be adapted to the GCM-based diagnosis problem.

The girdling was applied at the end of leaf development stage. Foliar spray was applied three times at 7-d intervals from 14 days after girdling. Random Forests (RF) was applied to compute the percentage of flowering from plant hormone concentrations observed on 0, 7, 21, 35, 49, 56 and 63 days after the treatment, and to evaluate variable importance to illustrate physiological responses to horticultural treatments. In the field experiment, the three horticultural techniques could induce off-season flowering, while untreated trees had no flower, but leaf flushing. The RF model showed fair performance for modelling the percentage of flowering. The variable importance illustrated the effects of plant hormones in different tissues (i.e. wood, bark, leaves and apical bud) and timing (i.e. sampling dates). The variable importance of the total cytokinins and zeatin/zeatin riboside were observed to be high in wood, leaves and apical bud, while the importance of auxin in bark, wood and apical bud was found to be low on day 35. The RF model could present additional information for a deeper understanding of plant hormone dynamics in plant tissues and critical timing required for flower induction, which can be used for better and improved farmers\u2019 management and practices in the future.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.08.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Agriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia", "mag_id": "1413247003", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:82515502"}

Cockburn The standard approach to tracking an object of interest in a video stream is to use an object detector, a classifier and a tracker in sequential order. This work investigates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) as classifiers for real-time tracking systems, combining them with Kalman Filter predictors. Support VectorMachines have been proved successful in a variety of classification tasks such as recognizing faces, cars, handwriting and others. However their use has been hampered by the complexity and computational time involved in the training and classification stages. In recent years new methods and techniques for training and classification of Support Vector Machines have been discovered making pos sible their utilization in real-time applications. These methods have been explored and im proved resulting in a framework for fast prototyping and development of real-time tracking systems. New optimal and sub-optimal methods for parallel SVM training based on biased and unbiased versions of the Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm are presented. They provide a trade-off between time performance and accuracy. Time performance in the classification stage is significantly improved by reducing the number of support vectors with almost no loss in accuracy. New methods to allow the reduction with different kernels are presented.

The seismic behavior of buildings is strongly affected by the ST, including material, age, height, and other main structural features. Previous works deployed in situ data integrated with remote sensing information to statistically infer STs through supervised ML methods. We propose a transferable methodology with specific focus on situations with imbalanced in situ data (i.e., the number of available labeled samples for model learning differs largely between different STs). We learn a transferable model by selecting features from an exhaustive set. The transferability relies on deploying geometric features characterizing individual buildings; thus, the model is less sensitive to domain adaption problems frequently induced by e.g., changes in acquisition parameters of remotely sensed imagery. Thereby, we show that few geometry features enable generalization capabilities similar to models learned with a large number of features describing spectral, geometrical or contextual building properties. We rely on an extensive geodatabase containing almost 18,000 building footprints. We follow a Random Forest (RF)-based feature selection strategy to objectively identify most valuable features for prediction.

Video frames are naturally generated by the inherent pixel flows from preceding frames based on the appearance and motion dynamics in the video. However, existing methods focus on directly hallucinating pixel values, resulting in blurry predictions. In this paper, we develop a dual motion Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) architecture, which learns to explicitly enforce future-frame predictions to be consistent with the pixel-wise flows in the video through a dual-learning mechanism. The primal future-frame prediction and dual future-flow prediction form a closed loop, generating informative feedback signals to each other for better video prediction. To make both synthesized future frames and flows indistinguishable from reality, a dual adversarial training method is proposed to ensure that the future-flow prediction is able to help infer realistic future-frames, while the future-frame prediction in turn leads to realistic optical flows. Our dual motion GAN also handles natural motion uncertainty in different pixel locations with a new probabilistic motion encoder, which is based on variational autoencoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed dual motion GAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on synthesizing new video frames and predicting future flows.

The proposed 3D descriptor allows classification of an object represented by a point cloud, as human or non-human. It is derived from the well-known Histogram of Oriented Gradient by employing surface normals instead of gradients. The process consists in an appropriate subdivision of the object point cloud into blocks. These blocks provide the spatial distribution modeling of the surface normal orientation into the different parts of the object. This distribution modelling is expressed as a histogram. In addition we have set up a multi-kinect acquisition system that provides us with Complete Point Clouds (CPC) (i.e. 360\u00b0 view). Such CPCs enable a suitable processing, particularly in case of occlusions. Moreover they allow for the determination of the human frontal orientation. Based on the proposed 3D descriptor, we have developed a human detection method that is applied on CPCs. First, we evaluated the 3D descriptor over a set of CPC candidates by using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The learning process was conducted with the original CPC database that we have built. The results are very promising. The descriptor can discriminate human from non-human candidates and provides the frontal direction of humans with high precision.

Despite the upsurge of research in sentiment analysis in recent years, there is a dearth in literature on sentiment analysis applied to banks social media data and mostly on African datasets. Against this background, this study applied machine learning technique (support vector machine) for sentiment analysis of Nigerian banks twitter data within a 2-year period, from 1st January 2017 to 31st December 2018. After crawling and preprocessing of the data, LibSVM algorithm in WEKA was used to build the sentiment classification model based on the training data.

The precision for both the positive and negative classes was above 0.7, the recall for the negative class was 0.696 and that of the positive class was 0.741 which shows the prediction did better than chance in addition to other measures. Applying the model in predicting the sentiments of the five Nigerian banks twitter data reveals that the number of positive tweets within this period was slightly greater than the number of negative tweets.

The most commonly used method for plant density quantification is based on visual counting from ground level. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a method for estimating wheat plant density at the emergence stage based on high resolution imagery taken from UAV at very low altitude with application to high throughput phenotyping in field conditions. A Sony ILCE \u03b15100L RGB camera with 24 Mpixels and equipped with a 60 mm focal length lens was flying aboard an hexacopter at 3 to 7 m altitude at about 1 m/s speed. This allows getting ground resolution between 0.20 mm to 0.45 mm, while providing 59\u201377% overlap between images. The camera was looking with 45\u00b0 zenith angle in a compass direction perpendicular to the row direction to maximize the cross section viewed of the plants and minimize the effect of the wind created by the rotors. Agisoft photoscan software was then used to derive the position of the cameras for each image. Images were then projected on the ground surface to finally extract subsamples used to estimate the plant density. The extracted images were first classified to separate the green pixels from the background and the rows were then identified and extracted. Finally, image object (group of connected green pixels) was identified on each row and the number of plants they contain was estimated using a Support Vector Machine whose training was optimized using a Particle Swarm Optimization. Three experiments were conducted in Greoux, Avignon and Clermont sites with some variability in the sowing dates, densities, genotypes, flight altitude, and growth stage at the time of the image acquisition. The application of the method on the 270 samples available over the three sites provides a RMSE and relative RMSE on estimates of 34.05 plants/m 2 and 14.31% with a bias of 9.01 plants/m 2 . However, differences in performances were observed between the three sites, mostly related to the growth stage at the time of the flight. Plants should have between one to two leaves when images are taken. Further, a specific sensitivity analysis shows that the ground resolution of the images should be better than 0.40 mm. Finally, the repeatability of the method is good especially when images are taken from similar observational geometries. The current limits and possible improvements of the method proposed are finally discussed.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2017.06.007", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2624387057", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["51965682", "215321412", "204885365", "51965480", "53563243", "215478086", "51965616", "212415984", "207809036", "19202162", "215382103", "199489667", "29163874", "208224677", "60441900", "57193253", "215725010", "211120342", "189989163", "52934901", "190529152", "209519817", "181790065", "215438535", "7970768", "214691246", "211108203", "215259552", "123735536", "51931990", "25332346", "204740598", "215306069", "85527349", "209380672", "195064382", "201148489", "207817605", "52306618", "60442898", "215395612", "214879933", "53046532", "212742293", "3341393", "3775765", "211165837", "85499017", "144207694", "52050916", "71717560", "53749851", "905192", "215250715", "3766826"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133867093"}

Over the past decades, there has been a very active research in the development of Raman spectroscopy techniques for oncological applications and large scale clinical diagnosis. A major issue that has received little attention in the Raman literature is the fact that variations in instrumental responses and intrinsic spectral backgrounds over different days of measurements or devices creates strong inconsistency of Raman intensity spectra over the various experimental condition, thus making the use of Raman spectroscopy on a large scale and reproductive basis difficult. We explore different methods to tackle this inconsistency and show that regular preprocessing methods such as baseline correction, normalization or wavelet transformation are inefficient on our datasets. We find that subtracting the mean background spectrum estimated by identifying non-cell regions in Raman images makes the data more consistent. As a proof of concept, we employ our single-cell Raman Imaging protocol to diagnosis challenging follicular lesions, that is known to be particularly difficult due to the lack of obvious morphological and cytological criteria for malignancy. We explore dimensionality reduction with both PCA and feature selection methods, and classification is then performed at the single cell level with standard classifiers such as k Nearest Neighbors or Random Forest. We investigate Raman hyperspectral images from FTC133, RO82W-1 and NthyOri 3-1 cell lines and show that the chemical information for the diagnosis is mostly contained in the cytoplasm.

An accurate prediction of the images to its correct label (heritage site) allows more proficient searches through specific terms, thus helping in the studying and understanding the heritage assets.

Specifically, we focused on the McElmo Creek tributary confluence with the San Juan River in south-western Utah, USA. We quantified variation in species occurrences at this confluence zone from May 2012 to December 2015 relative to temporal and environmental conditions. We considered occurrences among species relative to tagging origins (tributary versus mainstem), season and time of day. Generally, fishes tagged in the focal tributary were more likely to be detected compared to fish tagged in the mainstem river or other tributaries. Additionally, adults were most likely to be detected across multiple years compared to subadults. Based on a Random Forests model, the best performing environmental variables for predicting seasonal detections included mainstem discharge during run-off season (razorback sucker Xyrauchen texanus), tributary discharge during monsoon season (Colorado pikeminnow Ptychocheilus lucius) and mainstem water temperature (flannelmouth sucker Catostomus latipinnis and channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus).

The combination of these methods enables low-bandwidth anomalies to easily be identified in high-bandwidth network traffic. Using only low-dimensional network information allows for near real-time identification of anomalies. The data set was collected from 1999 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation data set.

Particularly, we train 3 segmentation models using 2D image patches and slices obtained in axial, coronal and sagittal views respectively, and combine them to segment brain tumors using a voting based fusion strategy. Our method could segment brain images slice-by-slice, much faster than those based on image patches. We have evaluated our method based on imaging data provided by the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Challenge (BRATS) 2013, BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2016. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method could build a segmentation model with Flair, T1c, and T2 scans and achieve competitive performance as those built with Flair, T1, T1c, and T2 scans.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1702.04528", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6029627", "pubmed_id": "29040911", "doi": "10.1016/j.media.2017.10.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Medical Image Analysis", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2587828787", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["18813513", "3789099", "1996665", "7116508", "247457", "8297367", "1910930", "1241368", "36055012", "8638426", "247457", "12002692", "1799558", "148067", "16436015", "5574079", "207763512", "8379335", "6226279", "20843340", "8254931", "56507745", "1739295", "5829509", "27118835", "54526983", "4487151", "204735153", "8914016", "33059236", "14124313", "25310609", "60463698", "10699202", "9723312", "10283138", "653920", "64544026"], "inbound_citations": ["71152886", "203606150", "77388031", "44154325", "204740265", "3756492", "211522481", "209492245", "174803511", "209497408", "198931894", "204028368", "155107470", "212705262", "52927547", "133608002", "174799168", "208630254", "1946654", "53283469", "57721135", "197935442", "201143434", "52956484", "204250247", "209498181", "128359746", "52884210", "215304592", "51612941", "211086084", "3569181", "49410826", "52167332", "53290664", "204939621", "62913361", "96431000", "46947401", "195883781", "209404968", "176251008", "198190290", "215723334", "44157050", "57354539", "202125220", "53037545", "201017944", "204734613", "4955316", "167221207", "211029206", "209456880", "210148979", "208613435", "213004724", "67855384", "201786869", "83458538", "79968851", "207987948", "214619269", "53233163", "56379747", "211553789", "204229190", "211060042", "174799359", "215353719", "214870327", "215571878", "203076861", "209460419", "211126679", "44102318", "204848556", "198167385", "209408155", "91751865", "3461270"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11675522"}

The task is challenging considering the small target of logos and the wide range of variability in shape, color, and illumination.

Two prelogo detection steps, that is, vehicle region detection and a small RoI segmentation, rapidly focalize a small logo target. An enhanced Adaboost algorithm, together with two types of features of Haar and HOG, is proposed to detect vehicles. An RoI that covers logos is segmented based on our prior knowledge about the logos' position relative to license plates, which can be accurately localized from frontal vehicle images. A two-stage cascade classier proceeds with the segmented RoI, using a hybrid of Gentle Adaboost and Support Vector Machine (SVM), resulting in precise logo positioning.

In order to mix and fully utilize the multiple routes bus arrival time data, the weighted average travel time and three Forgetting Factor Functions (FFFs) \u2013 F1, F2 and F3 \u2013 are introduced. Based on different combinations of input variables, five prediction models are proposed. Three widely used algorithms, i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neutral Network (ANN) and Linear Regression (LR), are tested to find the best for arrival time prediction. Bus location data of 11 road segments from Yichun (China), covering 12 bus stops and 16 routes, are collected to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches. The results show that the newly introduced parameters, the weighted average travel time, can significantly improve the prediction accuracy: the prediction errors reduce by around 20%. The algorithm comparison demonstrates that the SVM and ANN outperform the LR. The FFFs can also affect the performance errors: F1 is more suitable for ANN algorithm, while F3 is better for SVM and LR algorithms. Besides, the virtual road concept in this paper can slightly improve the prediction accuracy and halve the time cost of predicted arrival time calculation. ::: First published online 02 May 2017", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3846/16484142.2017.1298055", "venue": null, "journal": "Transport", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2611551198", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["27287020", "14690345", "961425", "110282533", "18929025", "108718791", "14727192", "109993542", "107015506", "128431139", "30302690", "110345685", "8599018", "167185346", "7252134", "12397663", "109848527", "11153969", "30388658", "111319879", "197408744", "109396844", "15926803", "109718666", "110385372", "109219665"], "inbound_citations": ["131774042", "207959069", "195770395", "209853487"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54874734"}

The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. Over the past decade there has been a growing effort to introduce neuroscience in primary and secondary schools, however hands-on laboratories have been limited to anatomical or electrophysiological activities. Modern neuroscience research labs are increasingly using computational tools to model circuits of the brain to understand information processing. Here we introduce the use of neurorobots - robots controlled by computer models of biological brains - as an introduction to computational neuroscience in the classroom. Neurorobotics has enormous potential as an education technology because it combines multiple activities with clear educational benefits including neuroscience, active learning, and robotics. We describe a 1-week introductory neurorobot workshop that teaches high school students how to use neurorobots to investigate key concepts in neuroscience, including spiking neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and adaptive action selection. Our do-it-yourself (DIY) neurorobot uses wheels, a camera, a speaker, and a distance sensor to interact with its environment, and can be built from generic parts costing about $170 in under 4 hrs. Our Neurorobot App visualizes the neurorobot's visual input and brain activity in real-time, and enables students to design new brains and deliver dopamine-like reward signals to reinforce chosen behaviors. We ran the neurorobot workshop at two high schools (n = 295 students total) and found significant improvement in students\u2019 understanding of key neuroscience concepts and in students\u2019 confidence in neuroscience, as assessed by a pre/post workshop survey. Here we provide DIY hardware assembly instructions, discuss our open-source Neurorobot App and demonstrate how to teach the Neurorobot Workshop.

An interesting problem of how to guide the dimensionality reduction for the unlabeled target data by exploiting useful knowledge, such as label information, from multiple source tasks arises in such a scenario. In this paper, we propose a new method for dimensionality reduction in the transfer learning setting. Unlike traditional paradigms where the useful knowledge from multiple source tasks is transferred through distance metric, our proposal firstly converts the dimensionality reduction problem into integral regression problems in parallel. Gaussian process is then employed to learn the underlying relationship between the original data and the reduced data. Such a relationship can be appropriately transferred to the target task by exploiting the prediction ability of the Gaussian process model and inventing different kinds of regularizers.

Since experimental methods for predicting PPIs are both expensive and time-consuming, many computational methods have been developed to predict PPIs and interaction networks, which can be used to complement experimental approaches. However, these methods have limitations to overcome. They need a large number of homology proteins or literature to be applied in their method. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix-based protein sequence representation approach to predict PPIs, using an ensemble learning method for classification. We construct the matrix of Amino Acid Contact (AAC), based on the statistical analysis of residue-pairing frequencies in a database of 6323 protein\u2013protein complexes. We first represent the protein sequence as a Substitution Matrix Representation (SMR) matrix. Then, the feature vector is extracted by applying algorithms of Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the SMR matrix. Finally, we feed the feature vector into a Random Forest (RF) for judging interaction pairs and non-interaction pairs. Our method is applied to several PPI datasets to evaluate its performance. On the S . c e r e v i s i a e dataset, our method achieves 94 . 83 % accuracy and 92 . 40 % sensitivity.

It can be cast as an optimization problem with triplet constraints. Due to the vast number of triplet constraints, a sampling strategy is essential for DML. With the tremendous success of deep learning in classifications, it has been applied for DML. When learning embeddings with deep neural networks (DNNs), only a mini-batch of data is available at each iteration. The set of triplet constraints has to be sampled within the mini-batch. Since a mini-batch cannot capture the neighbors in the original set well, it makes the learned embeddings sub-optimal. On the contrary, optimizing SoftMax loss, which is a classification loss, with DNN shows a superior performance in certain DML tasks. It inspires us to investigate the formulation of SoftMax. Our analysis shows that SoftMax loss is equivalent to a smoothed triplet loss where each class has a single center. In real-world data, one class can contain several local clusters rather than a single one, e.g., birds of different poses. Therefore, we propose the SoftTriple loss to extend the SoftMax loss with multiple centers for each class. Compared with conventional deep metric learning algorithms, optimizing SoftTriple loss can learn the embeddings without the sampling phase by mildly increasing the size of the last fully connected layer.

It is a method to measure and record different electrical potentials of the heart. The electrical potential generated by electrical activity in cardiac tissue is measured on the surface of the human body. This ECG can be classified as normal and abnormal signals. In this paper, a thorough experimental study was conducted to show the superiority of the generalization capability of the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) in the automatic classification of ECG beats.

Thus, new tools are required in order to adequately monitor and further diagnose anomalies that other segments of the DSL network cannot identify due to the pragmatic issues raised by hardware or software misconfigurations. In this work we present a fundamentally new approach for classifying known DSL-level anomalies by exploiting the properties of novelty detection via the employment of one-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs). By virtue of the imbalance residing in the training samples that consequently lead to problematic prediction outcomes when used within two-class formulations, we adopt the properties of one-class classification and construct models for independently identifying and classifying a single type of a DSL-level anomaly. Given the fact that the greater number of the installed Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) within the DSL network of a large European ISP were misconfigured, thus unable to accurately flag anomalous events, we utilize as inference solutions the models derived by the one-class SVM formulations built by the known labels as flagged by the much smaller number of correctly configured DSLAMs in the same network in order to aid the classification aspect against the monitored unlabeled events. By reaching an average over 95% on a number of classification accuracy metrics such as precision, recall and F-score we show that one-class SVM classifiers overcome the biased classification outcomes achieved by the traditional two-class formulations and that they may constitute as viable and promising components within the design of future network fault management strategies.

To handle the widely existed large-scale networks, most of the existing scalable methods, e.g., DeepWalk, LINE and node2vec, resort to the negative sampling objective so as to alleviate the expensive computation. Though effective at large, this strategy can easily generate false, thus low-quality, negative samples due to the trivial noise generation process which is usually a simple variant of the unigram distribution. In this paper, we propose a Ranking Network Embedding (RNE) framework to leverage the ranking strategy to achieve scalability and quality simultaneously. RNE can explicitly encode node similarity ranking information into the embedding vectors, of which we provide two ranking strategies, vanilla and adversarial, respectively. The vanilla strategy modifies the uniform negative sampling method with a consideration of edge existance. The adversarial strategy unifies the triplet sampling phase and the learning phase of the model with the framework of Generative Adversarial Networks. Through adversarial training, the triplet sampling quality can be improved thanks to a softmax generator which constructs hard negatives for a given target. The effectiveness of our RNE framework is empirically evaluated on a variety of real-world networks with multiple network analysis tasks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-16142-2_3", "venue": "PAKDD", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2927299114", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["86509174"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:92999563"}

Despite growing evidence that members of the gut microbiota can drive tumorigenesis, little is known about what happens to it after treatment for an adenoma or carcinoma. This study tested the hypothesis that treatment for adenoma or carcinoma alters the abundance of bacterial populations associated with disease to those associated with a normal colon. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes in the feces of 67 individuals before and after treatment for adenoma (N = 22), advanced adenoma (N = 19), and carcinoma (N = 26). Results There were small changes to the bacterial community associated with adenoma or advanced adenoma and large changes associated with carcinoma. The communities from patients with carcinomas changed significantly more than those with adenoma following treatment (P-value < 0.001). Although treatment was associated with intrapersonal changes, the change in the abundance of individual OTUs in response to treatment was not consistent within diagnosis groups (P-value > 0.05). Because the distribution of OTUs across patients and diagnosis groups was irregular, we used the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to identify groups of OTUs that could be used to classify pre and post-treatment samples for each of the diagnosis groups. Although the three models could differentiate between the pre and post-treatment samples, there was little overlap between the OTUs that were indicative of each treatment. To determine whether individuals who underwent treatment were more likely to have OTUs associated with normal colons we used a larger cohort that contained individuals with normal colons and those with adenomas, advanced adenomas, and carcinomas. We again built Random Forest models and measured the change in the positive probability of having one of the three diagnoses to assess whether the post-treatment samples received the same classification as the pre-treatment samples. Samples from patients who had carcinomas changed towards a microbial milieu that resembles the normal colon after treatment (P-value < 0.05). Finally, we were unable to detect any significant differences in the microbiota of individuals treated with surgery alone and those treated with chemotherapy or chemotherapy and radiation (P-value > 0.05). Conclusions By better understanding the response of the microbiota to treatment for adenomas and carcinomas, it is likely that biomarkers will eventually be validated that can be used to quantify the risk of recurrence and the likelihood of survival. Although it was difficult to identify significant differences between pre and post-treatment samples from patients with adenoma and advanced adenoma, this was not the case for carcinomas. Not only were there large changes in pre versus post-treatment samples for those with carcinoma, but these changes were towards a more normal microbiota.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/138222", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2615567361", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["80828621", "26107957"], "inbound_citations": ["52948748", "210967872", "198963159", "215507363"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196638185"}

Privacy concerns become evident because there are a large number of private data by various applications in the smart city, such as sensitive data of governments or proprietary information of enterprises. To protect the private data, the proposed model uses the BGV encryption scheme to encrypt the private data and employs cloud servers to perform the high-order back-propagation algorithm on the encrypted data efficiently for deep computation model training. Furthermore, the proposed scheme approximates the Sigmoid function as a polynomial function to support the secure computation of the activation function with the BGV encryption.

The chapter focuses on a class of networks where the order p of the linear predictive process is specified and produced an analytical solution for the weights of this class to minimize the network cost function. It is discussed that when the estimation errors are uncorrelated this solution is the same as that of conventional lp analysis. The few preliminary results explain that the nature of speech, with its correlated excitation mitigates against the weight values of the class corresponding exactly to the conventional lp coefficients, as predicted by the theory. However as in the case of conventional lp analysis, good classification of sounds has been indicated by preliminary results and this in turn has suggested a form of connectionist vector quantization (CVQ) structure.

We first construct deep CNN layers for color and depth separately, and then connect them with our carefully designed multi-modal layers, which fuse color and depth information by enforcing a common part to be shared by features of different modalities. In this way, we obtain features reflecting shared properties as well as modal-specific properties in different modalities. The information of the multi-modal learning frameworks is back-propagated to the early CNN layers. Experimental results show that our proposed multi-modal feature learning method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on two widely used RGB-D object benchmark datasets.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCV.2015.134", "venue": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "journal": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2207044458", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17726917", "1912619", "461853", "925787", "704982", "1053307", "15771800", "6681692", "5360764", "18874645", "1241368", "13259596", "5652420", "1377132", "11654786", "206592218", "207763512", "14986048", "2714905", "5240721", "14915716", "130535382", "6383532", "6788752", "4071727", "16900529", "2814088", "18527840", "16383961", "6943286", "6556382"], "inbound_citations": ["198147921", "211297626", "4375867", "131776464", "55315961", "21128482", "4402568", "204194411", "196018461", "52363789", "11700226", "12399890", "6567742", "70192277", "115198485", "157057809", "88478210", "201067840", "9859520", "52270119", "210945630", "59340800", "208095823", "54437247", "4260948", "3519253", "46963834", "7852451", "206595370", "26491463", "8104750", "57756460", "3295267", "58630384", "202712499", "17603911", "3409727", "9759547", "4399925", "52960951", "20399413", "10915531", "46967793", "52041950", "211243921", "64575775", "58776046"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7410379"}

The feature extraction approach consists of three stages. First, we employ EMD to decompose nonstationary single-trial time series into narrowband components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with time scales dependent on the data. Second, we adopt unsupervised K-means clustering to group the IMFs and residues into several clusters across all trials and channels. Third, we use the supervised common spatial patterns (CSP) approach to design spatial filters for the clustered spatiotemporal signals. We exploit the support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the extracted features to decode the reported perception on a single-trial basis. We demonstrate that the CSP feature of the cluster in the gamma frequency band outperforms the features in other frequency bands and leads to the best decoding performance. We also show that the EMD-based feature extraction can be useful for evoked potential estimation.

Temperature, rainfall, sunshine hours, growing degree days, and MODIS-derived NDVI for each of the eight districts of Punjab province were used to forecast yield for the year 2014. The same independent variables were used to forecast wheat yield of the whole...", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/01431161.2017.1323282", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2617564741", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202786821", "69687892", "214666868", "3951317", "201833892", "25074527", "202899821", "214736852", "204244316"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134081985"}

One of the main limitations of current approaches is that both factors are learned by mapping one source latent space to videos, which complicates the generation task as a single data point must be informative of both background and foreground content. In this paper we propose a GAN framework for video generation that, instead, employs two latent spaces in order to structure the generative process in a more natural way: 1) a latent space to generate the static visual content of a scene (background), which remains the same for the whole video, and 2) a latent space where motion is encoded as a trajectory between sampled points and whose dynamics are modeled through an RNN encoder (jointly trained with the generator and the discriminator) and then mapped by the generator to visual objects' motion. Additionally, we extend current video discrimination approaches by incorporating in the learning procedure motion estimation and, leveraging the peculiarity of the generation process, unsupervised pixel-wise dense predictions. Extensive performance evaluation showed that our approach is able to a) synthesize more realistic videos than state-of-the-art methods, b) learn effectively both local and global video dynamics, as demonstrated by the results achieved on a video action recognition task over the UCF-101 dataset, and c) accurately perform unsupervised video object segmentation on standard video benchmarks, such as DAVIS, SegTrack and F4K-Fish.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1803.09092", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2794977364", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1033682", "1282515", "11758569", "1277217", "2057420", "206771128", "23519254", "14803274", "9933254", "6945308", "876150", "8785311", "1930231", "11699847", "3147510", "2659157", "12712095", "24069181", "8234308", "206595056", "4357800", "206770979", "1082740", "11996618", "6126495", "2063813", "5574079", "1949934", "14981833", "3194346", "10939070", "3185202", "16608752", "2980297", "7649856", "11290566", "206766608", "15601477", "7197134", "206592484", "1687220", "8865260", "13209309"], "inbound_citations": ["71150186", "181950201", "53789985", "51867471"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4429134"}

Natural images exhibit strong spatial dependencies, and modeling these dependencies in a principled manner is crucial to achieve good classification accuracy. In this work, we present Discriminative Random Fields (DRFs) to model spatial interactions in images in a discriminative framework based on the concept of Conditional Random Fields proposed by lafferty et al.(2001). The DRFs classify image regions by incorporating neighborhood spatial interactions in the labels as well as the observed data. The DRF framework offers several advantages over the conventional Markov Random Field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in computer vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used for modeling observations in the MRF framework. Third, the interaction in labels in DRFs is based on the idea of pairwise discrimination of the observed data making it data-adaptive instead of being fixed a priori as in MRFs. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where the likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters.

Numerous theoretical and practical issues are addressed in the paper. The first one concerns the determination of negative examples relevant for the problem at hand and the training of a reference classifier in the case of an unbalanced number of positive and negative examples. The second one focuses on the reduction of the computational complexity of the reference classifier during the test phase, without increasing its generalization error.

They are able to estimate the regression function in an incremental manner. The estimators apply two techniques commonly used in concept-drifting data streams, i.e., the forgetting factor and the sliding window. The methods are applicable for models in which both the function and the noise variance change over time. Although nonparametric methods based on Parzen kernels were previously successfully applied in the literature to online regression function estimation, the problem of estimating the variance of noise was generally neglected. It is sometimes of profound interest to know the variance of the signal considered, e.g., in economics, but it can also be used for determining confidence intervals in the estimation of the regression function, as well as while evaluating the goodness of fit and in controlling the amount of smoothing. The present paper addresses this issue. Specifically, variance estimators are proposed which are able to deal with concept drifting data by applying a sliding window and a forgetting factor, respectively. A number of conducted numerical experiments proved that the proposed methods perform satisfactorily well in estimating both the regression function and the variance of the noise.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2478/amcs-2018-0043", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2895158127", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["6284079", "15874451", "12397401", "2762225", "123137993", "17815065", "32501945", "206452028", "51875900", "22101076", "122653538", "207208264", "123252183", "121921420", "16119217", "43315484", "117118089", "123576367", "4490973", "35602172", "123377795", "8343012", "39341019", "122932724", "13940616", "664165", "121945634", "124678445", "11580933", "6123215", "18042383", "18563621", "10781010", "6112072", "120297876", "5874117", "46878869", "14687075"], "inbound_citations": ["203606723"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67772090"}

However, in real-world application, the network trained by a vibration signal dataset will be applied to target signal datasets with different distributions, which can be triggered easily by rotating speed oscillation and load variation. Hence, based on transfer learning, some vibration signal-based methods which are robust to working conditions have been proposed to address this problem. Nevertheless, most of them need target datasets in network training, and the network should be trained whenever it meets a new vibration signal dataset. So we construct a three-stage deep fault diagnosis network utilizing adaptive batch normalization (AdaBN), which is highly efficient for free of target datasets in training and does not need repeated training in its application. In the first stage, the vibration signal samples are processed into more regular and discriminative frequency spectra. In the second stage, a fourlayer AdaBN based deep neural network (DNN) is pre-trained by stacked autoencoders (SAE) and then finely tuned only using the source dataset.

In many real-world tasks, new observations may point out the inadequacy of the learned model. In such a case, incremental approaches allow to adjust it, instead of learning a new model from scratch. Specifically, when a negative example is wrongly classified by a model, specialization refinement operators are needed. A powerful way to specialize a theory in Inductive Logic Programming is adding negated preconditions to concept definitions. This paper describes an empowered specialization operator that allows to introduce the negation of conjunctions of preconditions using predicate invention.

In case of factoid questions, we can use a question classifier (trained according to a target taxonomy) and a named entity recognizer. Unfortunately, this latter cannot be applied to generate answers related to non-factoid questions. In this paper, we tackle such problem by designing classifiers of non-factoid answers. As the feature design for this learning task is very complex, we take advantage of tree kernels to generate large feature set from the syntactic parse trees of passages relevant to the target question. Such kernels encode syntactic and lexical information in Support Vector Machines which can decide if a sentence focuses on a target taxonomy subject.

While recent deep learning based object removal methods have shown promising results on this task for some structured scenes, none of them have addressed the problem of object removal in facial images. The objective of this work is to remove microphone object in facial images and fill hole with correct facial semantics and fine details. To make our solution practically useful, we present an interactive method called MRGAN, where the user roughly provides the microphone region. For filling the hole, we employ a Generative Adversarial Network based image-to-image translation approach. We break the problem into two stages: inpainter and refiner. The inpainter estimates coarse prediction by roughly filling in the microphone region followed by the refiner which produces fine details under the microphone region. We unite perceptual loss, reconstruction loss and adversarial loss as joint loss function for generating a realistic face and similar structure to the ground truth. Because facial image pairs with or without microphone do not exist, we have trained our method on a synthetically generated microphone dataset from CelebA face images and evaluated on real world microphone images. Our extensive evaluation shows that MRGAN performs better than state-of-the-art image manipulation methods on real microphone images although we only train our method using the synthetic dataset created.

SAR sensor in its fully polarimetric mode has an advantage to retrieve scattering property of different component of forest structure and LiDAR has the capability to measure structural information with very high accuracy. This study was focused on retrieval of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) using Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) based point clouds and scattering property of forest vegetation obtained from decomposition modelling of RISAT-1 fully polarimetric SAR data. TLS data was acquired for 14 plots of Timli forest range, Uttarakhand, India. The forest area is dominated by Sal trees and random sampling with plot size of 0.1 ha (31.62m*31.62m) was adopted for TLS and field data collection. RISAT-1 data was processed to retrieve SAR data based variables and TLS point clouds based 3D imaging was done to retrieve LiDAR based variables. Surface scattering, double-bounce scattering, volume scattering, helix and wire scattering were the SAR based variables retrieved from polarimetric decomposition. Tree heights and stem diameters were used as LiDAR based variables retrieved from single tree vertical height and least square circle fit methods respectively. All the variables obtained for forest plots were used as an input in a machine learning based Random Forest Regression Model, which was developed in this study for forest AGB estimation. Modelled output for forest AGB showed reliable accuracy (RMSE = 27.68 t/ha) and a good coefficient of determination (0.63) was obtained through the linear regression between modelled AGB and field-estimated AGB. The sensitivity analysis showed that the model was more sensitive for the major contributed variables (stem diameter and volume scattering) and these variables were measured from two different remote sensing techniques.

Speaker recognition is a process where a person is recognized on the basis of his/her voice signals (R. C Campbel, 1997). Speaker recognition can be divided into speaker verification and speaker identification. These can furthermore be divided into text dependent and text independent systems. To date, our technology has yet to provide speaker recognition system for many application include access control system, security control for confidential information, transaction authentication and telephone banking. Pattern classification plays as a crucial part in speaker modeling component chain. The result of pattern classification will strongly affect the speaker recognition engine to decide whether to accept or reject a speaker. Many research efforts have been done in speaker recognition pattern classification. There are Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Vector Quantization (VQ), Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian mixture model (GMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM)(Sadaoki Furui, 1997)and so forth. Building robust speaker recognition systems are often difficult because speech signal is dynamic and influenced by many sources of variation. The past two decades have seen significant progress being made to cope with this problem using different techniques. From among these techniques, hybrid two types of pattern classification have reported promising results in improving the accuracy result. Although producing considerable improvement, these hybrid techniques are still somewhat restricted in terms of recognition accuracy for large data set. Since previous works have reported substantial examples of successful implementation in combining two classification techniques, this research intends to produce a new ways of hybrid techniques in order to solve the accuracy problem for incremental data set condition. We put forward a new VQ-GMM mixture model to improve recognition rate of the speaker identification system in the chapter. VQ and GMM are widely applied to the speaker identification, but both have some disadvantages. To overcome those shortages, we introduce a new hybrid VQ/GMM model to improve recognition rate of the speaker identification system in the chapter. Although in baseline form, the VQ-based solution is less accurate than the GMM, but it offers simplicity in computation. Besides, after some experiments, we found that VQ and GMM techniques are suitable apply for the speaker independent task. Therefore, we hope to make use of their merits via a hybrid VQ/GMM classifier. There are many forms of GMM and other pattern classification techniques adaptation in the past. In hybrid VQ/GMM, most of them use VQ as an optimization function to reduce Expectation Maximization algorithm in order to improve the training speed (Reynolds and Rose, 1995; J. Pelecano, 2000). Besides, some researchers use GMM as a post-processor after VQ cluster the speech signal into regions (Qiguang Lin et al, 1996). In our proposed hybrid modeling, both VQ model and GMM model will run parallel after signal preprocessing process. A comparison performance of hybrid VQ/GMM, DTW, VQ, GMM and SVM techniques for speaker recognition will be done through the experiments and will reported in this chapter. This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 2, we reviews proposed speaker recognition framework. In Section 3, we discuss how we construct the hybrid modeling for pattern classification. Section 4 shows the experimental result for the comparison performance. Finally, section 5 we concludes our work.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "150587182", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108040668"}

SVC leads to the optimal hyperplane (maximal margin) criterion for separable datasets but, in the nonseparable case, the SVC minimizes the L1 norm of the training errors plus a regularizing term, to control the machine complexity. The L1 norm is chosen because it allows to solve the minimization with a Quadratic Programming (QP) scheme, as in the separable case. But the L1 norm is not truly an \"error counting\" term as the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) inductive principle indicates, leading therefore to a biased solution. This effect is specially severe in low complexity machines, such as linear classifiers or machines with few nodes (neurons, kernels, basis functions). Since one of the main goals in data mining is that of explanation, these reduced architectures are of great interest because they represent the origins of other techniques such as input selection or rule extraction. Training SVMs as accurately as possible in these situations (i.e., without this bias) is, therefore, an interesting goal. ::: ::: We propose here an unbiased implementation of SVC by introducing a more appropriate \"error counting\" term. This way, the number of classification errors is truly minimized, while the maximal margin solution is obtained in the separable case. QP can no longer be used for solving the new minimization problem, and we apply instead an iterated Weighted Least Squares (WLS) procedure. This modification in the cost function of the Support Vector Machine to solve ERM was not possible up to date given the Quadratic or Linear Programming techniques commonly used, but it is now possible using the iterated WLS formulation.

To study the relationship between arc electrical signal and welding stability, the multi-scale entropy method was introduced to analyze the current signals under different welding process parameters. Under the short-circuiting droplet transition mode, the larger shielding gas flow rate led to, the more stable welding and the smaller amplitude of multi-scale entropy curves. When the welding current parameter increased gradually, the droplet transition mode changed, and the amplitude of multi-scale entropy curves increased. As the welding voltage rose, the droplet transfer frequency decreased and the multi-scale entropy increased. Furthermore, the four-class prediction of welding forming quality was studied by combining with the genetic algorithm-based support vector machine (GA-SVM). The multi-scale entropy distribution was closely related to the type and stability of short-circuiting transfer in the welding process.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2019.107282", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "mag_id": "2990348963", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213933068"}

Firstly, statistic filter is used to extract the feature signals of pump faults from the measured vibration signals across an optimum frequency region, and nondimensional symptom parameters (NSPs) are defined to represent the feature signals for distinguishing fault types.

Transfer learning can be a daunting task when feature spaces which require transfer differ in their distribution of information.

To tackle this problem, transfer learning is a promising direction that leverages source data to improve performance on related, target data. Most transfer learning methods focus on minimizing data distribution mismatch. However, a big challenge in brain imaging is the large domain discrepancies in cognitive experiment designs and subject-specific structures and functions. A recent transfer learning approach minimizes domain dependence to learn common features across domains, via the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). Inspired by this method, we propose a new Domain Independent Support Vector Machine (DI-SVM) for transfer learning in brain condition decoding.

For dealing with mechanical optimisation, the first idea is to connect directly the mechanical solver with the optimizer. However, this approach is not conceivable in many cases because of the time consuming for obtaining the mechanical solution associated to a set of design parameters and the numerous iterations require by the optimizer for locating precisely the optimum. In particular the direct approach is unsuitable for dealing with costly industrial optimisation problems. Therefore, metamodels has been introduced for providing very inexpensive approximation of the objective and/or constrained function. Largely used since the 1950's many kinds of metamodels have been developped. They are built from a few actual responses providing by a solver associated to a set of sample points obtained by a sampling strategy. More recently many kinds of common metamodels has been extended for dealing with responses and gradients. Thus we propose to focus on these methods. Taking into account derivatives of the actual function allows us to built more accurate approximations with the same number of sample points [1, 2]. Thus indirect gradient-based metamodels, gradient-based Least-Square, Inverse Distance Weighting, Moving Least-Square, Weighting Least-Square, Radial Basis Function, Kriging and Support Vector Regression [3] are the most common gradient-based metamodels and they will be presented. The kernel-based metamodels (RBF, Kriging, SVR) will be more precisely detailed because they propose higher quality of approximation and better capacities for dealing with multimodal actual functions and higher number of design parameters in comparison with other techniques. Some comparisons of these approximation techniques will be proposed by considering global approximation criteria and global optimisation framework. In particular, the issue of the determination of the hyperparameters will be discussed. Factors of choice of well adapted approximation technique will be also proposed and discussed. In order to illustrate the performance of the gradient-based metamodels, many analytical functions will be considered with many number of design parameters.

However, the cognitive function of these articulations has not been examined so far. We start addressing this question by investigating the effect of 1) utterance type and 2) planning on pause posture occurrence and properties in American English. We first examine whether pause postures exist in American English. In an electromagnetic articulometry study, seven participants produced sentences varying in linguistic structure (stress, boundary, sentence type). To determine the presence of pause postures, as well as to lay the groundwork for their future automatic annotation and detection, a Support Vector Machine Classifier was built to identify pause postures. Results show that pause postures exist for all speakers in this study but that the frequency of occurrence is speaker dependent. Across participants, we find that there is a stable relationship between the pause posture and other events (boundary tones and vowels) at prosodic boundaries, parallel to previous work in Greek. We find that the occurrence of pause postures is not systematically related to utterance type.

In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of tree species classification of urban forests using aerial-based HyMap hyperspectral imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. First, we conducted an object-based image analysis (OBIA) to segment individual tree crowns present in LiDAR-derived Canopy Height Models (CHMs). Then, hyperspectral values for individual trees were extracted from HyMap data for band reduction through Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation which allowed us to reduce the data to 20 significant bands out of 118 bands acquired. Finally, we compared several different classifications using Random Forest (RF) and Multi Class Classifier (MCC) methods. Seven tree species were classified using all 118 bands which resulted in 46.3% overall classification accuracy for RF versus 79.6% for MCC. Using only the 20 optimal bands extracted through MNF, both RF and MCC achieved an increase in overall accuracy to 87.0% and 88.9%, respectively. Thus, the MNF band selection process is a preferable approach for tree species classification when using hyperspectral data. Further, our work also suggests that RF is heavily disadvantaged by the high-dimensionality and noise present in hyperspectral data, while MCC is more robust when handling high-dimensional datasets with small sample sizes.

The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient

However, SVMs are likely to perform poorly in situations with data imbalance between the classes, particularly when the target class is under-represented. This paper proposes a Near-Bayesian Support Vector Machine (NBSVM) for such imbalanced classification problems, by combining the philosophies of decision boundary shift and unequal regularization costs. Based on certain assumptions which hold true for most real-world datasets, we use the fractions of representation from each of the classes, to achieve the boundary shift as well as the asymmetric regularization costs.

To have a desirable clustering, the separability among different classes of data needs to be improved. A common manner in accomplishing this objective is to utilize the advantages of metric learning in clustering and vice versa. Clustering provides an estimation of class labels and metric learning maximizes the separability among these different estimated classes of data. This procedure is performed in an iterative fashion, alternating between clustering and metric learning. Here, a new method is proposed, called discriminative fuzzy c-means (Dis-FCM), in which FCM and metric learning are integrated into one joint formulation. Unlike traditional approaches, which simply alternate between clustering and metric learning, Dis-FCM applies both simultaneously. Here, FCM provides an estimation of class labels. This can avoid the problem of fast convergence, which is common in previous algorithm. Moreover, Dis-FCM is able to handle not only numerical data, but also categorical data, which are not found in traditional methods.

Cells in images that are captured from various biomedical applications usually have different shapes and motility, which pose difficulties for the automated event detection in cell videos. Current methods to detect cellular events are based on supervised machine learning and rely on tedious manual annotation from investigators with specific expertise. So that our LSTM network could be trained in an unsupervised manner, we designed it with a branched structure where one branch learns the frequent, regular appearance and movements of objects and the second learns the stochastic events, which occur rarely and without warning in a cell video sequence. We tested our network on a publicly available dataset of densely packed stem cell phase-contrast microscopy images undergoing cell division. This dataset is considered to be more challenging that a dataset with sparse cells. We compared our method to several published supervised methods evaluated on the same dataset and to a supervised LSTM method with a similar design and configuration to our unsupervised method. We used an F1-score, which is a balanced measure for both precision and recall.

However, in reality, most data are scattered across different organizations and cannot be easily integrated under many legal and practical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a new technique and framework, known as federated transfer learning (FTL), to improve statistical models under a data federation. The federation allows knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy, and enables complimentary knowledge to be transferred in the network. As a result, a target-domain party can build more flexible and powerful models by leveraging rich labels from a source-domain party. A secure transfer cross validation approach is also proposed to guard the FTL performance under the federation. The framework requires minimal modifications to the existing model structure and provides the same level of accuracy as the non-privacy-preserving approach.

While \u201cnon-signature\u201d whistles exist, and may be important components of bottlenose dolphins\u2019 communicative repertoire, they have not been studied extensively. This is in part due to the difficulty of attributing whistles to specific individuals, a challenge that has limited the study of not only non-signature whistles but the study of general acoustic exchanges among socializing dolphins. In this paper, we propose the first machine-learning-based approach to identifying the source locations of semi-stationary, tonal, whistle-like sounds in a highly reverberant space, specifically a half-cylindrical dolphin pool. We deliver time-of-flight and normalized cross-correlation measurements to a random forest model for high-feature-volume classification and feature selection, and subsequently deliver the selected features into linear discriminant analysis, linear and quadratic Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian process models.

MH prediction preprocessing makes use of the spatial piecewise-continuous nature of hyperspectral imagery to integrate spectral and spatial information.

At each step, it adopts the LogDet divergence to maintain the closeness between two successively learned Mahalanobis matrices, and utilizes the hinge loss to enforce a large margin between relatively dissimilar samples. More importantly, the Mahalanobis matrix can be updated by closed-form solution at each step. Furthermore, if the initial matrix is positive semi-definite (PSD), the learned matrices in the following steps are always PSD. Based on the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions and the built equivalence between the passive-aggressive learning family and the Bregman projections, we have proved the global convergence of SLMOML.

The aim of this research was to determine, if UAV-based imagery, collected one, two, four, six, seven and eight weeks before harvest could predict fresh shoot mass, tomato fruit numbers, and yield mass at harvest and if predictions varied for control and salt-treated plants. A Random Forest approach was used to model biomass and yield. The results showed that shape features such as plant area, border length, width and length had the highest importance in the random forest models. A week prior to harvest, the explained variance of fresh shoot mass, number of fruits and yield mass were 86.60%, 59.46% and 61.09%, respectively. The explained variance was reduced as a function of time to harvest. Separate models may be required for predicting yield of salt-stressed plants, whereas the prediction of yield for control plants was less affected if the model included salt-stressed plants.

For this reason, statistical approaches to clustering can fail because low probability mass is associated with a single image. Moreover, related images will therefore have subtle differences as measured by their probabilities.

We analyze the heterogeneity of a region across individuals by computing the pairwise difference between voxels. We review various complexity measures like entropy and Kolmogorov complexity. Using autoencoders, we analyze the inherent dimensionality of regions of white matter structure as a means for measuring complexity. The intrinsic complexity of a region can be determined by how effectively it can be predicted given its neighborhood. We pose this as the problem of inpainting a three dimensional region of the brain given its context with deep generative modeling using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) conditioned on the neighborhood. The discriminator is trained on differentiating between real and generated patches while the generator is simultaneously trained to adversarially fool the discriminator and minimize the voxel-wise reconstruction loss between the actual and generated patches. We study the comparative performance of a well-trained GAN across regions of the brain in multiple subjects and identify particularly challenging or complex regions of brain wiring.

When classifying high-dimensional fMRI data, we must also regularize to improve model stability, and the interactions between classifier and regularization techniques are still being investigated. Classifiers are usually compared on large, multisubject fMRI datasets. However, it is unclear how classifier/regularizer models perform for within-subject analyses, as a function of signal strength and sample size. We compare four standard classifiers: Linear and Quadratic Discriminants, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. Classification was performed on data in the linear kernel (covariance) feature space, and classifiers are tuned with four commonly-used regularizers: Principal Component and Independent Component Analysis, and penalization of kernel features using L1 and L2 norms. We evaluated prediction accuracy (P) and spatial reproducibility (R) of all classifier/regularizer combinations on single-subject analyses, over a range of three different block task contrasts and sample sizes for a BOLD fMRI experiment. We show that the classifier model has a small impact on signal detection, compared to the choice of regularizer. PCA maximizes reproducibility and global SNR, whereas Lp-norms tend to maximize prediction. ICA produces low reproducibility, and prediction accuracy is classifier-dependent. However, trade-offs in (P,R) depend partly on the optimization criterion, and PCA-based models are able to explore the widest range of (P,R) values. These trends are consistent across task contrasts and data sizes (training samples range from 6 to 96 scans). In addition, the trends in classifier performance are consistent for ROI-based classifier analyses.

Interested in grapevine buds detection in natural field conditions, this paper presents a classification method for images of grapevine buds ranging 100 to 1600 pixels in diameter, captured in outdoor, under natural field conditions, in winter (i.e., no grape bunches, very few leaves, and dormant buds), without artificial background, and with minimum equipment requirements.

When evaluated over images containing buds of at least 100 pixels in diameter, the approach achieves a recall higher than 0.9 and a precision of 0.86 over all windowed-patches covering the whole bud and down to 60% of it, and scaled up to window patches containing a proportion of 20%-80% of bud versus background pixels.

Additionally, considering climate change projections for the water-limited Mediterranean region, increased air temperatures and decreased precipitation are anticipated, leading to dramatic declines in lake water levels as well as severe water scarcity problems. The study site, Lake Beysehir, the largest freshwater lake in the Mediterranean basin, is \u2013 like other Mediterranean lakes \u2013 threatened by climatic changes and over-abstraction of water for irrigated crop farming. Therefore, implementation of strict water level management policies is required. In this study, an integrated modeling approach was used to predict the future water levels of Lake Beysehir in response to potential future changes in climate and land use. Water level estimation was performed by linking the catchment model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with a Support Vector Regression model ( e -SVR). The projected increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation based on the climate change models led to an enhanced potential evapotranspiration and reduced total runoff. On the other hand, the effects of various land use scenarios within the catchment appeared to be comparatively insignificant. According to the e -SVR model results, changes in hydrological processes caused a water level reduction for all scenarios. Moreover, the MPI-ESM-MR General Circulation Model outputs produced the most dramatic results by predicting that Lake Beysehir may dry out by the 2040s with the current outflow regime. The results indicate that shallow Mediterranean lakes may face a severe risk of drying out and losing their ecosystem values in the near future if the current intensity of water abstraction is not reduced.

The rice brown planthopper (BPH) outbreak is one of several causes of damage to rice crops in Thailand. A traditional way to monitor the early outbreak is to routinely and randomly count the density of BPHs spreading around the rice field.

Smart phone devices with a sufficient camera quality are currently affordable and convenient for farmers to capture images from their rice fields. Based on the Support Vector Machines algorithm trained on color and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) image features, the proposed system not only automatically detects the position of BPHs in the collected images, but is also able to classify the life stage of each hopper. The use of a red-frame mark on the camera screen to guide BPH image capturing helps improving the overall processing accuracy. Field experiments with the Rice Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives of Thailand shows the proposed system achieved an approximately 89% detection F-measure and an 87% BPH life-stage classification accuracy.

ALL makes around 80% of childhood leukemia and it mostly occur in the age group of 3\u20137. The nonspecific nature of the signs and symptoms of ALL often leads to wrong diagnosis. Diagnostic confusion is also posed due to imitation of similar signs by other disorders. Careful microscopic examination of stained blood smear or bone marrow aspirate is the only way to effective diagnosis of leukemia. Techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunophenotyping, cytogenetic analysis and cytochemistry are also employed for specific leukemia detection. The need for automation of leukemia detection arises since the above specific tests are time consuming and costly. Morphological analysis of blood slides are influenced by factors such as hematologists experience and tiredness, resulting in non standardized reports. A low cost and efficient solution is to use image analysis for quantitative examination of stained blood microscopic images for leukemia detection. A fuzzy clustering based two stage color segmentation strategy is employed for segregating leukocytes or white blood cells (WBC) from other blood components. Discriminative features i.e. nucleus shape, texture are used for final detection of leukemia. In the present paper two novel shape features i.e., Hausdorff Dimension and contour signature is implemented for classifying a lymphocytic cell nucleus.

Because the image data characteristics could dramatically change over time, it is important for the classifier to adapt to the new data incrementally. In this chapter, we present an online metric learning model to address the online image classification/scene recognition problem via adaptive similarity measurement. Given a number of labeled samples followed by a sequential input of unseen testing samples, the similarity metric is learned to maximize the margin of the distance among different classes of samples. By considering the low-rank constraint, our online metric learning model not only provides competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, but also guarantees to converge. A bi-linear graph is also applied to model the pair-wise similarity, and an unseen sample is labeled depending on the graph-based label propagation, while the model can also self-update using the new samples that are more confident labeled. With the ability of online learning, our methodology can well handle the large-scale streaming video data with the ability of incremental self-update.

To prove the effectiveness of our combined approach, we use recently published human fibroblasts cell cycle data and, performing in vivo experiments, we demonstrate that our computational strategy is able not only to confirm well-known cell cycle-regulated genes, but also to predict not yet identified ones.

Compared with features produced in earlier layers, the deep features are better at expressing semantic and contextual information. The proposed deep feature learning scheme shifts the focus from concrete features with details to abstract ones with semantic information. It considers not only individual objects and local contexts but also their relationships by building a multi-scale deep feature learning network (MDFN). MDFN efficiently detects the objects by introducing information square and cubic inception modules into the high-level layers, which employs parameter-sharing to enhance the computational efficiency. MDFN provides a multi-scale object detector by integrating multi-box, multi-scale and multi-level technologies. Although MDFN employs a simple framework with a relatively small base network (VGG-16), it achieves better or competitive detection results than those with a macro hierarchical structure that is either very deep or very wide for stronger ability of feature extraction. The proposed technique is evaluated extensively on KITTI, PASCAL VOC, and COCO datasets, which achieves the best results on KITTI and leading performance on PASCAL VOC and COCO. This study reveals that deep features provide prominent semantic information and a variety of contextual contents, which contribute to its superior performance in detecting small or occluded objects.

They are however not always able to reproduce the high spatial discontinuity of permafrost at the micro-scale (scale of a specific landform; ten to several hundreds of meters). To overcome this lack, we tested an alternative modelling approach using three classification algorithms belonging to statistics and machine learning: Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines and Random forests. These supervised learning techniques infer a classification function from labelled training data (pixels of permafrost absence and presence) with the aim of predicting the permafrost occurrence where it is unknown. The research was carried out in a 588 km 2 area of the Western Swiss Alps. Permafrost evidences were mapped from ortho-image interpretation (rock glacier inventorying) and field data (mainly geoelectrical and thermal data). The relationship between selected permafrost evidences and permafrost controlling factors was computed with the mentioned techniques. Classification performances, assessed with AUROC, range between 0.81 for Logistic regression, 0.85 with Support Vector Machines and 0.88 with Random forests. The adopted machine learning algorithms have demonstrated to be efficient for permafrost distribution modelling thanks to consistent results compared to the field reality. The high resolution of the input dataset (10 m) allows elaborating maps at the micro-scale with a modelled permafrost spatial distribution less optimistic than classic spatial models. Moreover, the probability output of adopted algorithms offers a more precise overview of the potential distribution of mountain permafrost than proposing simple indexes of the permafrost favorability. These encouraging results also open the way to new possibilities of permafrost data analysis and mapping.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28284636", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.02.041", "venue": "The Science of the total environment", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "mag_id": "2593621897", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211730043", "199563969", "215475623", "135279921", "199101682", "8032755", "189931096", "208045074", "52947671", "203074571"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4272034"}

The power market players are interested in maximizing the profits and minimizing the risks through selling and buying electricity. As a result, it is of importance to obtain accurate information on electricity pricing forecasting in advance so that their aim is achieved.

Also, this paper makes use of the Mahalanobis kernel in GP rather than the Gaussian one so that GP is generalized to approximate nonlinear systems.

A controlled AC voltage with a lower frequency than the line frequency is injected into the DC-link ink voltage, which then causes AC power ripples at the DC output side. By extracting the AC voltage and power components on the DC output side using digital filters, the capacitance can then be calculated using the Support Vector Regression (SVR) method. A continuous-valued function that plots the fundamental interrelation between a given input (capacitance power) and its corresponding output (capacitance value) can be estimated using SVR and based on the training data.

The many diverse functions of myristoylation on proteins, such as membrane targeting, signal pathway regulation and apoptosis, are largely due to the lipid modification, whereas abnormal or irregular myristoylation on proteins can lead to several pathological changes in the cell. Objective: To better understand the function of myristoylated sites and to correctly identify them in protein sequences, this study conducted a novel computational investigation on identifying myristoylation sites in protein sequences. Materials and Methods: A training dataset with 196 positive and 84 negative peptide segments were obtained. Four types of features derived from the peptide segments following the myristoylation sites were used to specify myristoylatedand non-myristoylated sites. Then, feature selection methods including maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (mRMR), incremental feature selection (IFS), and a machine learning algorithm (extreme learning machine method) were adopted to extract optimal features for the algorithm to identify myristoylation sites in protein sequences, thereby building an optimal prediction model. Results: As a result, 41 key features were extracted and used to build an optimal prediction model. The effectiveness of the optimal prediction model was further validated by its performance on a test dataset. Furthermore, detailed analyses were also performed on the extracted 41 features to gain insight into the mechanism of myristoylation modification.

They intuitively retrieve patterns from years of experience to make treatment decisions. Short of personal consultations, there is no way to access this vast \u201cexperience database.\u201d Experience Engine (XE) is a machine learning solution to structure experiential knowledge relevant for decision making, derive a similarity metric for patients who have received similar treatments, and predict treatment decisions that experts are likely to recommend. Methods: 277 patient histories relating to 743 breast cancer tumor board decisions at two tertiary care centers were abstracted as the training set for machine learning. 161 distinct histories relating to 496 decisions for a separate expert opinion service at one of the centers was the holdout test set. Data was structured into 690 features based on a novel ontology designed specifically for breast cancer decision making. To uncover nonlinear similarities, (for example, treatments for younger patients with multiple comorbidities and elderly patients may be similar), treatment decisions were grouped by timing and modality into 13 groups, such as primary surgery, 1st line palliative chemotherapy, etc. Similarity metric was derived using machine learning on the training set. The target for prediction was the specific treatment decision i.e. TAC or another adjuvant regimen. The primary endpoint was percent accuracy of agreement between XE9s predicted decision and experts9 actual decision in the holdout test set. Multiple similarity distance metrics including Bhattacharya, Eskin, Goodall, etc., and multiclass classification algorithms such as Extreme Gradient Boosted Trees, Support Vector Machines, etc., were systematically evaluated to arrive at the algorithms that best fit each treatment group. Results: The winning XE algorithms were 71% to 89% accurate for the various treatment groups, in predicting the actual treatment decisions recommended by the experts. The most frequent treatments recommended across all groups were standard evidence based therapies, as are often recommended by experts. For instance, when XE recommended standard adjuvant therapies for Her2- patients, it was 88% to 97% accurate. When XE recommended nonstandard therapies for the same treatment group, it was 72% to 90% accurate, related to larger number of nonstandard therapies within each treatment group and smaller samples of patients who underwent each type of nonstandard therapy. XE learned to weigh features relating to comorbidities and toxicities when recommending nonstandard therapies. Conclusion: Machine learning on a structured database of past treatment decisions made by experts, can yield a predicted treatment decision that an expert is likely to recommend for a new patient. By including complex decisions that consider toxicities and morbidities, a rich source of knowledge can be created. Despite the limited dataset, XE learned features that experts strongly consider when making decisions. XE has the potential to analyze variations in decision making at expert practices, assess when to recommend nonstandard therapies, and serve as a training tool for new oncologists to make expert grade treatment decisions.

As a result, an image segmentation approach based on US-ELM and spFCM (NS-UF) is proposed, so as to improve the effect of clustering in embedded space.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry has shown its ability to provide precise measurements of the ground surface displacement at high spatial and temporal resolution. In SAR interferometry, the processed interferograms are combined together via interferogram stacking or time series analysis. Stacking is a temporal averaging of the interferograms which results in mean displacement velocity. However, time series analysis of a significant number of interferograms enables us to study the short-term as well as ling-term behavior of the subsidence. In this research, three different case studies were accomplished for subsidence monitoring. The subsidence in the Varamin plain was studied using 13 ENVISAR ASAR images spanning between 2003/08/03 and 2005/11/20. The maximum subsidence rate extracted from Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) time series was estimated as 0.4 m/year. The second case study was to monitor the subsidence in the Neyshabour plain. In this area, the interferogram stacking using 9 ENVISAT ASAR images spanning between 2004/01/10 and 2005/06/18 was applied. The maximum subsidence rate was estimated as 0.16 m/year. Groundwater level measurements made at piezometric wells were applied to compare to the interferometry results. The piezometric wells mostly show the increase in water level depth caused by over-exploitation of groundwater. The groundwater information jointly with stratigraphic profiles highly correlate with subsidence in the area. In the last case study, the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) which is a proper method of time series analysis in areas with high decorrelation effects, was used in the Shahriar plain. A hybrid method of conventional and PSI was proposed in order to address the problem of monitoring the high-rate deformation. There are 22 ENVISAT ASAR images available in the study area spanning between 2003 and 2008. The maximum subsidence rate was estimated as 0.25 m/year. The time series analysis results were then compared to the groundwater level information at piezometric wells. Due to the low correlation between water level decline and subsidence rate at some piezometric wells, it can be concluded that other geology and hydrogeological factors play important role in controlling the subsidence occurrence. To show this, two data mining methods including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network as well as Support Vector Regression (SVR) were applied to model the subsidence in Shahriar plain using 6 different geology and hydrogeology factors as input and the subsidence rate extracted from interferometry as output of the model. These models can be further applied to estimate the subsidence rate in pixels in which the interferometry technique cannot measure the deformation due to some reasons including insufficient correlation.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-73383-8_12", "venue": "Natural Hazards GIS-Based Spatial Modeling Using Data Mining Techniques", "journal": "Natural Hazards GIS-Based Spatial Modeling Using Data Mining Techniques", "mag_id": "2905554279", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133823612"}

To be effective, the parameters of random forests must be carefully tuned. This is usually done by choosing values that minimize the prediction error on a held out dataset. We argue that error reduction is only one of several metrics that must be considered when optimizing random forest parameters for commercial applications. We propose a novel metric that captures the stability of random forests predictions, which we argue is key for scenarios that require successive predictions. We motivate the need for multi-criteria optimization by showing that in practical applications, simply choosing the parameters that lead to the lowest error can introduce unnecessary costs and produce predictions that are not stable across independent runs. To optimize this multi-criteria trade-off, we present a new framework that efficiently finds a principled balance between these three considerations using Bayesian optimisation. The pitfalls of optimising forest parameters purely for error reduction are demonstrated using two publicly available real world datasets.

In application, ANNs are evaluated in comparison to traditional forecasting models to evaluate if their nonlinear and adaptive properties yield superior forecasting performance in terms of robustness and accuracy. Furthermore, as ANNs are data-driven models, an emphasis is placed on the data collection stage by compiling extensive candidate input variable pools, a task frequently underperformed by prior research. In evaluating their performance, ANNs are applied to the domains of: exchange rate forecasting, volatility forecasting, and macroeconomic forecasting. ::: Regarding exchange rate forecasting, ANNs are applied to forecast the daily logarithmic returns of the EUR/USD over a short-term forecast horizon of one period. Initially, the analytic method of Technical Analysis (TA) and its sub-section of technical indicators are utilized to compile an extensive candidate input variable pool featuring standard and advanced technical indicators measuring all technical aspects of the EUR/USD time series. The candidate input variable pool is then subjected to a two-stage Input Variable Selection (IVS) process, producing an informative subset of technical indicators to serve as inputs to the ANNs. A collection of ANNs is then trained and tested on the EUR/USD time series data with their performance evaluated over a 5-year sample period (2012 to 2016), reserving the last two years for out of sample testing. A Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) model serves as a benchmark with the in-sample and out-of-sample empirical results demonstrating the MACD is a superior forecasting model across most forecast evaluation metrics. ::: For volatility forecasting, ANNs are applied to forecast the volatility of the Nikkei 225 Index over a short-term forecast horizon of one period. Initially, an extensive candidate input variable pool is compiled consisting of implied volatility models and historical volatility models. The candidate input variable pool is then subjected to a two-stage IVS process. A collection of ANNs is then trained and tested on the Nikkei 225 Index time series data with their performance evaluated over a 4-year sample period (2014 to 2017), reserving the last year for out-of-sample testing. A GARCH (1,1) model serves as a benchmark with the out-of-sample empirical results finding the GARCH (1,1) model to be the superior volatility forecasting model. ::: ::: The research concludes with ANNs applied to macroeconomic forecasting, where ANNs are applied to forecast the monthly per cent-change in U.S. civilian unemployment and the quarterly per cent-change in U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP). For both studies, an extensive candidate input variable pool is compiled using relevant macroeconomic indicator data sourced from the Federal Bank of St Louis. The candidate input variable pools are then subjected to a two-stage IVS process. A collection of ANNs is trained and tested on the U.S. unemployment time series data (UNEMPLOY) and U.S. GDP time series data. The sample periods are (1972 to 2017) and (1960 to 2016) respectively, reserving the last 20% of data for out of sample testing. In both studies, the performance of the ANNs is benchmarked against a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model and a Naive forecast. In both studies, the ANNs outperform the SVR benchmark model. ::: The empirical results demonstrate that ANNs are superior forecasting models in the domain of macroeconomic forecasting, with the Modular Neural Network performing notably well. However, the empirical results question the utility of ANNs in the domains of exchange rate forecasting and volatility forecasting. A MACD model outperforms ANNs in exchange rate forecasting both in-sample and out-of-sample, and a GARCH (1,1) model outperforms ANNs in volatility forecasting.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2978803711", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208121032"}

In both stages, new A-optimality experimental design-based criteria we used. In the preprocessing stage, a lower bound of the A-optimality design criterion is derived and applied as a subset selection metric, but in the later stage, the A-optimality design criterion is incorporated into a new composite cost function that minimises model prediction error as well as penalises the model parameter variance. The utilisation of NeuDeC leads to unbiased model parameters with low parameter variance and the additional benefit of a parsimonious model structure.

The terminology best-scored stands for selecting one density tree with the best estimation performance out of a certain number of purely random density tree candidates and we then name the selected one the best-scored random density tree. In this manner, the ensemble of these selected trees that is the best-scored random density forest can achieve even better estimation results than simply integrating trees without selection. From the theoretical perspective, by decomposing the error term into two, we are able to carry out the following analysis: First of all, we establish the consistency of the best-scored random density trees under $L_1$-norm. Secondly, we provide the convergence rates of them under $L_1$-norm concerning with three different tail assumptions, respectively. Thirdly, the convergence rates under $L_{\\infty}$-norm is presented. Last but not least, we also achieve the above convergence rates analysis for the best-scored random density forest.

In this paper, we propose a new framework to enhance the resolution of hyperspectral images by exploiting the knowledge from natural images: The relationship between low/high-resolution images is the same as that between low/high-resolution hyperspectral images. In the proposed framework, the mapping between low- and high-resolution images can be learned by deep convolutional neural network and be transferred to hyperspectral image by borrowing the idea of transfer learning. In addition, to study the spectral characteristic between low- and high-resolution hyperspectral image, collaborative nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) is proposed to enforce collaborations between the low- and high-resolution hyperspectral images, which encourages the estimated solution to extract the same endmembers with low-resolution hyperspectral image.

Using the neuropsychological measures, machine learning (Support Vector Machine binary classification model) classified the TLE and control groups with 74% accuracy with processing speed (NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test) the best predictor. In TLE, slower processing speed was associated predominantly with decreased local gyrification in regions including the rostral and caudal middle frontal gyrus, inferior precentral cortex, insula, inferior parietal cortex (angular and supramarginal gyri), lateral occipital cortex, rostral anterior cingulate, and medial orbital frontal regions, as well as three small regions of the temporal lobe.

Such simulators are typically based on either empirical correlations (e.g., Beggs and Brill, Mukherjee and Brill, Duns and Ros) or first-principles mechanistic models (e.g., Ansari, Xiao, TUFFP Unified, Leda Flow Point model, OLGAS). The simulators allow one to evaluate the pressure drop in a multiphase pipe flow with acceptable accuracy. However, the only shortcoming of these correlations and mechanistic models is their applicability (besides steady-state versions of transient simulators such as Leda Flow and OLGA). Empirical correlations are commonly applicable in their respective ranges of data fitting; and mechanistic models are limited by the applicability of the empirically based closure relations that are a part of such models. In order to extend the applicability and the accuracy of the existing accessible methods, a method of pressure drop calculation in the pipeline is proposed. The method is based on well segmentation and calculation of the pressure gradient in each segment using three surrogate models based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms trained on a representative lab data set from the open literature. The first model predicts the value of a liquid holdup in the segment, the second one determines the flow pattern, and the third one is used to estimate the pressure gradient. To build these models, several ML algorithms are trained such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network, and their predictive abilities are cross-compared. The proposed method for pressure gradient calculation yields R 2 = 0.95 by using the Gradient Boosting algorithm as compared with R 2 = 0.92 in case of Mukherjee and Brill correlation and R 2 = 0.91 when a combination of Ansari and Xiao mechanistic models is utilized. The application of the above-mentioned ML algorithms and the larger database used for their training will allow extending the proposed methodology to a wider applicability range of input parameters as compared to standard accessible techniques. The method for pressure drop prediction based on ML algorithms trained on lab data is also validated on three real field cases. Validation indicates that the proposed model yields the following coefficients of determination: R 2 = 0.806 , 0.815 and 0.99 as compared with the highest values obtained by commonly used techniques: R 2 = 0.82 (Beggs and Brill correlation), R 2 = 0.823 (Mukherjee and Brill correlation) and R 2 = 0.98 (Beggs and Brill correlation). Hence, the method for calculating the pressure distribution could give comparable or even higher scores on field data by contrast to correlations and mechanistic models. This fact is an indicator that the model can be scalable from the lab to the field conditions without any additional retraining of ML algorithms.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1905.09746", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.petrol.2019.05.055", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2945421839,2953243017", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Chemistry", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["129016109", "103747866", "114329398", "62545878", "61432285", "124468742", "129717490", "109831626", "108892649", "129217293", "63982032", "119923627", "110224120", "67727240", "128766387", "108635426", "70066752", "108577367", "130793390", "89141", "10659969", "7955044", "59606293", "57380285", "206787478", "123298597", "51905225", "8993325", "40027675", "103485830", "62841469", "6628106", "111215595", "3769315", "3783839", "129117370", "221230", "5346670"], "inbound_citations": ["214618986"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:162183865"}

Our key contribution to this end is a new decentralized approach for learning GANs from non-iid data called Forgiver-First Update (F2U), which a) asks clients to train an individual discriminator with their own data and b) updates a generator to fool the most `forgiving' discriminators who deem generated samples as the most real. Our theoretical analysis proves that this updating strategy indeed allows the decentralized GAN to learn a generator's distribution with all the input classes as its global optimum based on f-divergence minimization. Moreover, we propose a relaxed version of F2U called Forgiver-First Aggregation (F2A), which adaptively aggregates the discriminators while emphasizing forgiving ones to perform well in practice.

We test a Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm on 1,953 races across 31 different dog tracks and explore the role of a simple betting engine on a wide range of wager types. From this we triangulated our results on three dimensions of evaluation: accuracy, payout and betting efficiency. We found that accuracy and payouts were inversely linked, where our system could correctly predict Wins 45.35% of the time with a betting efficiency of 87.4% (return per bet) for high accuracy low payout, or predict Superfecta Box wagers with 6.45% accuracy and a 2,195.5% return per bet, corresponding to low accuracy high payout. This implied that AZGreyhound was able to correctly identify longshot dogs and we investigate the reasons why as well as the system's performance. INTRODUCTION The ability to predict future events with a certain level of accuracy has its appeal with gamblers and academics alike. This diverse demographic subset seeks to find an edge in predictive sciences, albeit with different motivations. The underlying problem with prediction lies within the problem dynamics, where important parameters are difficult to identify, are constantly shifting and the full effect of selected parameters has not been fully explored. The ultimate question becomes, can profitable predictions be made from the parameters selected? Greyhound racing is recognized as one of the nation's largest spectator sports. According to the American Greyhound Track Operators Association, it is currently legal in 16 states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Other states do not hold live racing but offer simulcasts (broadcasts of remote races) for betting. Greyhound racing has a following that parallels horse racing. Many of the same elements in animal athleticism exist in both sports and also the betting on these races. The key to betting is determining how to systemically predict the winners and combinations of winning bets. Bettors must carefully read all the information on the race card and gather as much information about the dogs as possible. Bettors will examine the dogs and their physical conditions, how they have shown in past races, their breeding and bloodlines, their assigned grades for how well they perform, as well as their odds against the dogs they will race against. Weather also plays a role as some bettors rely on the inside traps (part of the track) during wet races. Even weights of the dogs come into play. Lighter dogs and the longshots tend to get bumped and pushed out of the running in the first couple of turns. Greyhound racing is considered by many to be the most consistent and predictable form of racing (GRAA, 2008). Some expert greyhound bettors recommend keeping bets simple when first starting. Bets on win, place or show are easiest. A win means your dog finished first, place means it finished first or second and show means your dog finished first, second or third. If you can pick the winning dogs in certain categories over a series of races, that will earn more money. Our research motivation is to build upon prior machine learning techniques in the domain of Greyhound Racing and more closely examine the effect of longshots on racing prediction and payouts. We further examine the impact of non-traditional wager types and more robustly examine their resulting accuracy, payouts and return on wagers. LITERATURE REVIEW Predicting race outcomes can generally be broken into three distinct areas: mathematical, psychological and data mining techniques.

ORM is different from most existing models in that it views IR as ordinal regression problem (i.e. ranking problem) instead of binary classification. It is noted that the task of IR is to rank documents according to the user information needed, so IR can be viewed as ordinal regression problem. Two parameter learning algorithms for ORM are presented. One is a perceptron-based algorithm. The other is the ranking Support Vector Machine (SVM). The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been evaluated on the task of ad hoc retrieval using three English Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) sets and two Chinese TREC sets. Results show that ORM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art language model approaches and OKAPI system in all test sets; and it is more appropriate to view IR as ordinal regression other than binary classification.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11767-006-0256-5", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Electronics (China)", "mag_id": "2059681751", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16475058"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62714578"}

In a modified version of SVMs, called Least Squares SVM classifiers (LS-SVMs), a least squares cost function is proposed so as to obtain a linear set of equations in the dual space. While the SVM classifier has a large margin interpretation, the LS-SVM formulation is related in this paper to a ridge regression approach for classification with binary targets and to Fisher's linear discriminant analysis in the feature space. Multiclass categorization problems are represented by a set of binary classifiers using different output coding schemes. While regularization is used to control the effective number of parameters of the LS-SVM classifier, the sparseness property of SVMs is lost due to the choice of the 2-norm. Sparseness can be imposed in a second stage by gradually pruning the support value spectrum and optimizing the hyperparameters during the sparse approximation procedure. In this paper, twenty public domain benchmark datasets are used to evaluate the test set performance of LS-SVM classifiers with linear, polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. Both the SVM and LS-SVM classifier with RBF kernel in combination with standard cross-validation procedures for hyperparameter selection achieve comparable test set performances. These SVM and LS-SVM performances are consistently very good when compared to a variety of methods described in the literature including decision tree based algorithms, statistical algorithms and instance based learning methods. We show on ten UCI datasets that the LS-SVM sparse approximation procedure can be successfully applied.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi":

At the last stage, we used Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the selected features in falls and ADLs. We have used raw acceleration data and extracted all the features. Then we selected features based on the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) criterion and Double Input Symmetrical Relevance (DISR) in the fall detection experiment. We have found that the DISR feature selection criterion is more effective in acceleration based fall detection system. The results show 100% classification accuracy and zero false positive rates in fall detection for the DISR based selected features.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IC4ME247184.2019.9036529", "venue": "2019 International Conference on Computer, Communication, Chemical, Materials and Electronic Engineering (IC4ME2)", "journal": "2019 International Conference on Computer, Communication, Chemical, Materials and Electronic Engineering (IC4ME2)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3011651862", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["19213640", "25803739", "73106215", "14195780", "207102846", "67868900", "11293874", "110503861", "16511125", "12537772", "14948775", "14604895", "28637672", "15480929", "5539396"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214582843"}

They act as cheap-to-evaluate alternatives to the original model reducing the computational cost, while still providing improved designs. The Surrogate-Based Optimization (SBO) paradigm consists of accelerating the optimization process by essentially exploiting surrogates for the objective and constraint evaluations, with a minimal number of function calls to the high-fidelity model for keeping the computational time within affordable limits. In order to be useful within an industrial context (as turbomachinery applications), it is crucial that this SBO process is capable of efficiently handling highly constrained design problems. This work presents an SBO framework focusing on the research of feasible regions through an exploitation of both interpolation/regression and classification surrogate models. This strategy is implemented in the integrated optimization platform MINAMO, Cenaero's in-house design space exploration and multi-disciplinary optimization platform, see [3]. For highly constrained problems, one of the key ingredients towards the eventual location of the global optimum indeed first lies in the identification of the potential feasible region(s). In this work, the information retrieved from interpolation/regression surrogates (cheap-to-evaluate alternatives to the original high-fidelity models used both for the evaluation of objective and constraint functions) and classification surrogates (via Probabilistic Support Vector Machines (PSVM), used to identify feasible regions, see e.g. [2]) is blended in order to devise efficient Infill Sampling Criteria (ISC) that extract a maximum knowledge from a minimal number of simulations. This promotes an enhanced balance between exploitation, exploration and feasibility, which may be considered as the Graal quest for SBO. Baert et al. [1] have demonstrated the proposed strategy on a complex industrial design problem based on NASA Rotor 37. The performance of this innovative SBO framework will be illustrated here on widely used nonlinear constrained benchmark problems available in the literature.

The conditional random field (CRF), a log-linear model representing the conditional distribution of the observation labels, is one of the most successful approaches for sequential data labeling and classification, and has lately received significant attention in machine learning as it achieves superb prediction performance in a variety of scenarios. Nevertheless, existing CRF formulations can capture only one- or few-timestep interactions and neglect higher order dependences, which are potentially useful in many real-life sequential data modeling applications. To resolve these issues, in this paper we introduce a novel CRF formulation, based on the postulation of an energy function which entails infinitely long time-dependences between the modeled data. Building blocks of our novel approach are: 1) the sequence memoizer (SM), a recently proposed nonparametric Bayesian approach for modeling label sequences with infinitely long time dependences, and 2) a mean-field-like approximation of the model marginal likelihood, which allows for the derivation of computationally efficient inference algorithms for our model.

One practically important problem is: can the labeled data from other related sources help predict the target task, even if they have (a) different feature spaces (e.g., image vs. text data), (b) different data distributions, and (c) different output spaces? This paper proposes a solution and discusses the conditions where this is possible and highly likely to produce better results. It works by first using spectral embedding to unify the different feature spaces of the target and source data sets, even when they have completely different feature spaces. The principle is to cast into an optimization objective that preserves the original structure of the data, while at the same time, maximizes the similarity between the two. Second, a judicious sample selection strategy is applied to select only those related source examples.

At present, the concordance of functional maps derived by ECoG-FLM and electrical cortical stimulation mapping (ESM) remains rather low. This impedes the transition of ECoG-FLM into an independent functional mapping modality. As ESM is considered the gold standard of functional mapping, we aimed to use it in combination with machine learning (ML) approaches (\u201cESM-ML guide\u201d), to improve the accuracy of ECoG-FLM. METHODS: The ECoG data was collected from 6 patients (29.67 \u00b1 12.5 yrs; 19\u201352 yrs; 3 males, 3 females). Patient ECoG activity was recorded (g.USBamp, g.tec, Austria) during administration of language tasks. For data analysis: (1) All ECoG sites were divided into ESM positive [ESM(+)] and ESM negative [ESM(\u2212)]; (2) Features of ESM(+) and ESM(\u2212) sites in the ECoG signal were determined by analyzing the signal in the frequency domain; (3) ML classifiers [Random Forest (RF) and Deep Learning (DL)] were trained to identify these features in language-related ECoG activity; (4) The accuracy of the ESM-ML guided classification was compared with the accuracy of the conventional ECoG-FLM. RESULTS: The conventional approach demonstrated: 58% accuracy, 22% sensitivity, and 78% specificity. The \u201cESM-ML guide\u201d approach with RF classifier demonstrated: 76.2% accuracy, 73.6% sensitivity and 78.78% specificity. The DL classifier achieved the highest performances compared to all others with 83% accuracy, 84% sensitivity and 83% specificity. CONCLUSION: ECoG-FLM accuracy can be improved by using an \u201cESM-ML guide\u201d, making the use of ECoG-FLM feasible as a stand-alone methodology. The long-term goal is to create a tool-box with \u201cready to use an ESM-ML guide\u201d algorithm trained to provide high accuracy ECoG-FLM results by classifying between ESM(+) and ESM(\u2212) contacts in prospective sets of language-related ECoG data and, thus, contribute towards improved surgical outcomes.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-05668-1_2", "venue": "Brain-Computer Interface Research", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2961318873", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["92396168"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197538348"}

After introducing relevant terminology and the goals and range of possible knowledge of both attackers and defenders, we survey recent work on test-time evasion (TTE), data poisoning (DP), backdoor DP, and reverse engineering (RE) attacks and particularly defenses against the same. In so doing, we distinguish robust classification from anomaly detection (AD), unsupervised from supervised, and statistical hypothesis-based defenses from ones that do not have an explicit null (no attack) hypothesis. We also consider several scenarios for detecting backdoors. We provide a technical assessment for reviewed works, including identifying any issues/limitations, required hyperparameters, needed computational complexity, as well as the performance measures evaluated and the obtained quality. We then delve deeper, providing novel insights that challenge conventional AL wisdom and that target unresolved issues, including: robust classification versus AD as a defense strategy; the belief that attack success increases with attack strength, which ignores susceptibility to AD; small perturbations for TTE attacks: a fallacy or a requirement; validity of the universal assumption that a TTE attacker knows the ground-truth class for the example to be attacked; black, gray, or white-box attacks as the standard for defense evaluation; and susceptibility of query-based RE to an AD defense. We also discuss attacks on the privacy of training data. We then present benchmark comparisons of several defenses against TTE, RE, and backdoor DP attacks on images.

OPUS employed the effective pruning techniques for unordered search and succeeded in improving the efficiency. In this paper, we propose an application of OPUS to an ILP system Progol. However, because of the difference of representation language, it is not applicable to ILP directly. We make the conditions clear under which the pruning techniques in OPUS can be applied in the framework of Progol.

Microarray data consists of thousands of variables, but the available data is very little. Conventional classification methods are not effective and efficient to handle this type of data. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning method that can be used for classification on the high-dimensional dataset. Therefore, reducing data dimensions will simplify and accelerate the classification process. Feature selection will eliminate irrelevant features so that it can improve the quality and accuracy of classification and can accelerate the learning process. Several approaches have been carried out for the feature selection process, including the feature selection with wrapper-based approach. Wrapper-based algorithm used in this research is Crazy Particle Swarm Optimization (CRAZYPSO) and Advanced Binary Ant Colony Optimization (ABACO). Both of CRAZYPSO and ABACO algorithm are inspired by the movement behavior of animal in finding food sources. This research uses k-fold cross-validation accuracy to compare the CRAZYPSO and ABACO algorithm for feature selection in the case of microarray data classification using Support Vector Machine Classification. The result shows that ABACO algorithm gives better result than CRAZYPSO algorithm with higher accuracy rate and less selected features.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procs.2019.11.167", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia Computer Science", "mag_id": "2997358369", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212896041"}

Data was collected from experiments using PDs of different sources under controlled laboratory conditions at the Tony Davies High Voltage Laboratory, University of Southampton. Artificial PD signals were injected into the HV electrode of a bushing and a high frequency current transformer (HFCT) was used to monitor the current between the tap-point and earth. The signals produced by four different artificial PD sources (corona discharge in air, floating discharge in oil, internal discharge in oil and surface discharge in air) were acquired using the peak detection mode of the oscilloscope and were processed to extract the feature that was used by each algorithm. The feature extraction algorithm involved the use of the Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) on phase synchronous measurements corrupted by artificial AWGN. Once the SVM was trained using part of the data acquired in the laboratory then the remaining data was corrupted by noise of two different amplitudes, giving SNRs of 7 dB and 3dB. These noisy data were classified using the SVM and the classification results were recorded.

One of the most basic tasks, counting the number of larvae, is tedious labor-intensive work.

Prediction of protein subcellular locations is crucial to the understanding of various protein functions.

The proposed ensemble SVM-SubLoc has achieved the highest success rates of 99.7% using hybrid features of Haralick textures and local binary patterns (HarLBP), 99.4% using hybrid features of Haralick textures and Local Ternary Patterns (HarLTP). In addition, SVM-SubLoc has yielded 99.0% accuracy using only local ternary patterns (LTPs) based features. The dimensionality of HarLBP feature vector is 581 compared with 78 and 52 for HarLTP and LTPs, respectively.

In this study, we propose a novel automatic CAD system to distinguish abnormal brains from normal brains in MRI scanning. Methods: The proposed method simplifies the task to a binary classification problem. We used discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) to extract wavelet packet coefficients from MR brain images. Next, Shannon entropy (SE) and Tsallis entropy (TE) were harnessed to obtain entropy features from DWPT coefficients. Finally, generalized eigenvalue proximate support vector machine (GEPSVM), and GEPSVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel, were employed as classifier. We tested the four proposed diagnosis methods (DWPT + SE + GEPSVM, DWPT + TE + GEPSVM, DWPT + SE + GEPSVM + RBF, and DWPT + TE + GEPSVM + RBF) on three benchmark datasets of Dataset-66, Dataset-160, and Dataset-255. Results: The 10 repetition of K-fold stratified cross validation results showed the proposed DWPT + TE + GEPSVM + RBF method excelled not only other three proposed classifiers but also existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy. In addition, the DWPT + TE + GEPSVM + RBF method achieved accuracy of 100%, 100%, and 99.53% on Dataset-66, Dataset-160, and Dataset-255, respectively. For Dataset-255, the offline learning cost 8.4430s and online prediction cost merely 0.1059s.

Physical-empirical models have been developed in this study using three widely used Machine Learning (ML) methods namely, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Bayesian Artificial Neural Networks (BANN) for the prediction of rainfall and rainfall related extremes during Northeast Monsoon (NEM) in Peninsular Malaysia from synoptic predictors. The gridded daily rainfall data of Asian Precipitation\u2014Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE) was used to estimate four rainfall indices namely, rainfall amount, average rainfall intensity, days having >95-th percentile rainfall, and total number of dry days in Peninsular Malaysia during NEM for the period 1951\u20132015. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis sea level pressure (SLP) data was used for the prediction of rainfall indices with different lead periods. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was used to select the SLP at different NCEP grid points which were found significantly correlated with NEM rainfall indices. The results showed superior performance of BANN among the ML models with normalised root mean square error of 0.04\u20130.14, Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency of 0.98\u20131.0, and modified agreement index of 0.97\u20130.99 and Kling-Gupta efficient index 0.65\u20130.96 for one-month lead period prediction. The 95% confidence interval (CI) band for BANN was found narrower than the other ML models. Almost all the forecasted values by BANN were also found with 95% CI, and therefore, the p-factor and the r-factor for BANN in predicting rainfall indices were found in the range of 0.95\u20131.0 and 0.25\u20130.49 respectively. Application of BANN in prediction of rainfall indices with higher lead time was also found excellent.

In this research, we have compared the estimated result in varying software among three algorithms. These algorithms can be used in the early stages of software life cycle and can help project managers to conduct effort estimation efficiently before starting the project. It avoids project overestimation and underestimation among other benefits. Software size, productivity, complexity and requirement stability are the input factors of these three models. Softwares are classified into three categories (i.e. small, medium, large) based on software size.

In the testing phase, current classifier is applied to the vectors' projections on the sub-spaces concerned.

Thus, the methods proposed for recognizing human actions in videos cannot be applied to still images. A big challenge in action recognition in still images is the lack of large enough datasets, which is problematic for training deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to the overfitting issue. In this paper, by taking advantage of pre-trained CNNs, we employ the transfer learning technique to tackle the lack of massive labeled action recognition datasets. Furthermore, since the last layer of the CNN has class-specific information, we apply an attention mechanism on the output feature maps of the CNN to extract more discriminative and powerful features for classification of human actions. Moreover, we use eight different pre-trained CNNs in our framework and investigate their performance on Stanford 40 dataset. Finally, we propose using the Ensemble Learning technique to enhance the overall accuracy of action classification by combining the predictions of multiple models.

Firstly, we propose an architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks to generate good quality synthetic 2D MRIs from multi-modality MRIs (T1 contrast-enhanced, T2, FLAIR). Secondly, we propose a deep learning scheme based on 3-streams of Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs) followed by sensor information fusion. The rational behind using CAEs is that it may improve glioma classification performance (as comparing with conventional CNNs), since CAEs offer noise robustness and also efficient feature reduction hence possibly reduce the over-fitting. A two-round training strategy is also applied by pre-training on GAN augmented synthetic MRIs followed by refined-training on original MRIs.

Geochemical anomaly detection can be regarded as a binary classification problem. The similarity between geochemical samples can be measured by their distance. The key issue of this classification is to find the intrinsic relationship and distance between geochemical samples to separate geochemical anomalies from background. In this paper, a hybrid method that integrates random forest and metric learning (RFML) is used to identify geochemical anomalies related to Fe-polymetallic mineralization in Southwest Fujian Province of China. RFML does not require any specific statistical assumption on geochemical data, nor does it depend on sufficient known mineral occurrences as the prior knowledge. The geochemical anomaly map obtained by the RFML method showed that the known Fe deposits and the generated geochemical anomaly area have strong spatial association. Meanwhile, the receiver operating characteristic curves for the results of RFML and another method, namely maximum margin metric learning, indicated that the RFML method exhibited better performance, suggesting that RFML can be effectively applied to recognize geochemical anomalies.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11053-019-09471-y", "venue": "Natural Resources Research", "journal": "Natural Resources Research", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2921482850", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["11225010", "8600094", "60993494", "207738357", "89141", "15370811", "93954142", "10895910", "129071685", "127632303", "130307060", "135160970", "44337214", "128823788", "127530591", "27453746", "52927586", "118174561", "122844634", "13595676", "650045", "18062732", "131436559", "127448980", "129097212", "129707626", "132419055", "2702042", "129594559", "132917732", "134489689", "129306255", "16237703", "129774903", "128890393", "134569504", "53895145", "129355900", "14189533", "129230673", "134523726", "127938433", "135336216", "131290766", "130242827", "22117231", "43738046", "135385485", "4689654", "133586005", "17592539", "43168190", "62180304", "129123659", "133747517", "128414404", "129590347", "131501604", "129445719", "134852205", "130336532", "128822063", "129835254", "134208522", "129153001"], "inbound_citations": ["198410366"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135128043"}

The two main variables used in the Triangle method, that is, land-surface temperature LST and vegetation cover, were downscaled and calculated at 100 m spatial resolution. LSTs were downscaled applying the Wavelet-Artificial Intelligence Fusion Approach WAIFA on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS and Landsat imageries. Vegetation fractions were also estimated at 100 m spatial resolution using linear spectral un-mixing and Wavelet\u2013AI models. Vegetation indices VIs were replaced with the vegetation fractions obtained from sub-pixel classification in the Ts\u2013VI triangle space. The downscaled data were then used for calculating the evaporative fraction EF, temperature-vegetation-dryness index TVDI, vegetation temperature condition index VTCI, and temperature-vegetation index TVX at 100 m spatial resolution. Thereafter, surface SM modelling was performed using a combination of Particle Swarm Optimization with Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System PSO-ANFIS and Support Vector Regression PSO-SVR modelling approaches. Results showed that the best input data set to estimate SM includes EF, TVDI, Ts, Fvegetation, Fsoil, temperature T, precipitation at time tPt, Pt \u20131, Pt \u20132, and irrigation I. It was also confirmed that PSO-SVR outperformed the PSO-ANFIS modelling approach and could estimate SM with a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.93 and a root mean square error RMSE of 1.29 at 100 spatial resolution.

The site gives the best deal on a product, the threshold or the limit to form a group is proposed by the site. The basic problem with Online stores is that they offer discounts to customers without knowing the customer interest on a particular product. The gap of Online group shopping is rectified by taking feedback from the customer when the customer visits the site. Discounts are offered to the customer based on customer interest. In this paper the focus is on group of people interested in a particular product from among the ones displayed on the site and predict the potential buyer based on feedback taken. The paper uses Support Vector Machine for generating results. Paper further compares SVM with C4.5 algorithm. The comparative analysis of true positive and true negative is 98% and 98% respectively for SVM after testing, C4.5 giving 76% for true positive and 98% for true negative. It's known that SVM works well for linear classification. SVM is not about \u201cyes/no\u201d classification, but it is trained to give numerical values. The paper deals with proper classification of data or products. The paper further proves that good classification leads to better retrieval of information. The question is, are the customers able to specify the product being purchased? If yes a feedback is taken. Second question being once the customers specify the product is the product information specified with fast response. The number of feedbacks are used for generating a threshold.

One of the possible solutions is to detect the personality, and the study is based on the individual\u2019s sense of humor. Throughout the twentieth century, psychologists show an outgoing interest in study of individual\u2019s sense of humor. Since individual differences in humor and their relation to psychological well-being can be used to detect the particular personality traits. Machine learning has been used for personality detection involves the development and initial validation of questionnaire, which assesses four dimensions relating to individual differences in the uses of humor. Which are Self-enhancing (humor used to enhance self), Affiliative (humor used to enhance the relationship with other), Aggressive (humor used to enhance the self at the expense of others), and Self-defeating (the humor used to enhance relationships at the expense of self). Machine learning is gaining importance, nowadays, as it enables computers to perform self-learning without being programmed for a specific task. Psychologists seek to measure personality through different methods. Nowadays, the human being is so much complex that it is difficult to estimate the personality of an individual manually.

While many efforts have been made in this direction, it still remains a real challenge. Moreover, the issue is even more complex as full texts are not always freely available. Then, using only partial information to annotate these documents is promising but remains a very ambitious issue. MethodsWe propose two classification methods: a k-nearest neighbours (kNN)-based approach and an explicit semantic analysis (ESA)-based approach. Although the kNN-based approach is widely used in text classification, it needs to be improved to perform well in this specific classification problem which deals with partial information. Compared to existing kNN-based methods, our method uses classical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for ranking the labels. Additional features are also investigated in order to improve the classifiers' performance. In addition, the combination of several learning algorithms with various techniques for fixing the number of relevant topics is performed. On the other hand, ESA seems promising for this classification task as it yielded interesting results in related issues, such as semantic relatedness computation between texts and text classification. Unlike existing works, which use ESA for enriching the bag-of-words approach with additional knowledge-based features, our ESA-based method builds a standalone classifier. Furthermore, we investigate if the results of this method could be useful as a complementary feature of our kNN-based approach.ResultsExperimental evaluations performed on large standard annotated datasets, provided by the BioASQ organizers, show that the kNN-based method with the Random Forest learning algorithm achieves good performances compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, reaching a competitive f-measure of 0.55% while the ESA-based approach surprisingly yielded reserved results.ConclusionsWe have proposed simple classification methods suitable to annotate textual documents using only partial information. They are therefore adequate for large multi-label classification and particularly in the biomedical domain. Thus, our work contributes to the extraction of relevant information from unstructured documents in order to facilitate their automated processing.

Traditionally studying underwater deposits of CRC involved physical sampling from Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) or using dredges. Recently, acoustic measurements of crust thickness have been demonstrated that can give a significantly higher spatial resolution for measurement. The probe makes high resolution measurements of sub-surface reflections to calculate the thickness of the deposit. However, CRC coverage is often not continuous and it is difficult to determine from the acoustic signals alone whether an acoustic signal was measured over CRC or not. The authors propose a method to filter these using visual information (3D colour map of the seafloor) from the same region. After locating the acoustic beam on the seafloor, points around the region are selected. A number of analyses are performed on this point cloud to extract parameters that can reliably discriminate between exposed CRC and other types of seafloor. The proposed method was tested on two areas of seafloor - one which is known to contain crust and one which does not contain crust. These two sets of data were then used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The trained classifier was then tested with the training sets and a test set containing both crust and non-crust regions to verify if the CRC is being detected reliably. The results were promising; in 85.4% of the cases, the detection was successful. The performance will be verified by using larger sets of data.

However, it also introduces a critical spectral variability problem for hyperspectral target detection, which makes the hyperspectral target detection much difficult than the classical spectral match issue. Many traditional detection methods have been proposed to deal with the spectral variability. However, these algorithms are still highly susceptible to the target spectral variability. The single input restriction and the inherent spectral characteristics mining problem are the main issues with these methods. The multitask learning (MTL) technique may have the potential to solve the above hyperspectral target detection issues since it can extract the inherent similarity and difference within multiple priori target spectra to learn a robust target spectral signature. This paper proposed a MTL-based reliability analysis method for hyperspectral target detection (MultiRely). This approach: 1) utilizes multiple priori target spectra to better represent the target spectral characteristics and construct multiple related detection tasks; 2) takes full advantage of the multitask learning technique to explore the spectral similarity and difference between multiple priori target spectra; 3) and applies the reliability analysis to obtain a reliable target spectrum in order to alleviate the target spectral variability. Experiments on two real hyperspectral datasets and one synthetic hyperspectral dataset illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art detectors.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2894802", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2915888826", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["128377279", "62165049", "57654888", "17601973", "44102128", "51965641", "51838779", "11508439", "10286353", "1525786", "12240632", "49546006", "64461971", "206668929", "2772030", "34821906", "129713219", "30127189", "129853711", "36958850", "22256758", "17942927", "43486044", "16763250", "1741625", "16026397", "1653473", "14755873", "11508439", "38434861", "11318838", "5415861", "2073227", "451328", "53304422", "7554099", "207752942", "52049395", "4853672", "8816235", "134808757", "9722614", "3765094", "11194336", "13967968", "5783396", "207328143", "4630551", "37245245", "1744007", "3015203"], "inbound_citations": ["209337137", "191207456", "212703131"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127645973"}

Motivated by these methods, we propose a predictor called IDP-FSP, which is an ensemble of three CRF-based predictors called IDP-FSP-L, IDP-FSP-S, and IDP-FSP-G. These three predictors are specially designed to predict long, short, and generic disordered regions, respectively, and they are constructed based on different features. To the best of our knowledge, IDP-FSP is the first predictor that combines a sequence labeling algorithm with IDRs of different lengths.

In this study, we proposed an identification approach which integrates XGboost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) and NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) for insider trading regulation. First, the insider trading cases that occurred in the Chinese security market were automatically derived, and their relevant indicators were calculated and obtained. Then, the proposed method trained the XGboost model and it employed the NSGA-II for optimizing the parameters of XGboost by using multiple objective functions. Finally, the testing samples were identified using the XGboost with optimized parameters. Its performances were empirically measured by both identification accuracy and efficiency over multiple time window lengths. Results of experiments showed that the proposed approach successfully achieved the best accuracy under the time window length of 90-days, demonstrating that relevant features calculated within the 90-days time window length could be extremely beneficial for insider trading regulation. Additionally, the proposed approach outperformed all benchmark methods in terms of both identification accuracy and efficiency, indicating that it could be used as an alternative approach for insider trading regulation in the Chinese security market.

Effective disease diagnosis has become increasingly important, especially in the patients with mutation of PD related gene.

In order to be more effective in assisting diagnosis, we further improve the deep polynomial network (DPN) as the hierarchical stacked DPN (HSDPN) and propose a stage-wise hierarchical deep polynomial ensemble learning (SHDPEL) framework for encoding multiple features to obtain high-level feature representations of different neuroimaging segmentation in PD diagnosis. Specifically, we train different segmentation features separately in the first stage. In next stage, different combinations of feature pairs will be used to learn the correlative information between different segmentations. We further integrate all branches by using a voting ensemble strategy for the classification.

However, the unmonitored deployment of UAVs called the amateur drones (AmDr) can lead to serious security threats and risk to human life and infrastructure. Therefore, timely detection of the AmDr is essential for the protection and security of sensitive organizations, human life and other vital infrastructure. AmDrs can be detected using different techniques based on sound, video, thermal, and radio frequencies. However, the performance of these techniques is limited in sever atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we propose an efficient unsupervise machine learning approach of independent component analysis (ICA) to detect various acoustic signals i.e., sounds of bird, airplanes, thunderstorm, rain, wind and the UAVs in practical scenario. After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), the power spectral density (PSD) and the Root Mean Square Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to detect the presence or absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a single or multiple AmDrs at a time in the presence of multiple acoustic interfering signals. The proposed technique is verified through extensive simulations and it is observed that the RMS values of PSD with KNN performs better than the MFCC with KNN and SVM.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.01519", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.comcom.2020.02.065", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3007968337", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["31627777", "21246270", "17855217", "9147429", "55852255", "55548606", "54892376", "126463918", "18415292", "125493265", "18118107", "22317815", "54681596", "128917225", "208113398", "211080635", "8819688", "28242664", "19397607", "19397607", "5143584", "68183893", "38976469", "46892729", "16460800", "125671857", "53440757", "4949058", "15839895", "144071", "39391827", "36097509", "29272262", "24774449", "1524747", "46957802", "63180999", "64543020", "961425"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211818214"}

The final classifier in cascades takes advantages of VC-dimension minimization and weighted margin learning, which provides a new investigation into the literature of classifier design.

This work is focused on the prediction of monthly mean daily global solar radiation (GSR) for different cities in India with most influencing input parameters identified using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software. WEKA identifies month, latitude, maximum temperature and bright sunshine hours as the most influencing and relative humidity as the least influencing input parameter.

Semantic segmentation provides a semantic label for each pixel in image using a predefined set of labels. Most pixel labeling approaches use Conditional Random Field (CRF). The main goal of this paper is to incorporate high level information in pixel labeling. In our approach, high level information as well as low level information is incorporated in data term of CRF. In the proposed approach, the set of semantic labels is divided into three subsets based on effective high level information for each class label. Then, a unified approach based on CRF is designed for pixel labeling for different categories of class labels. In our approach, the prior knowledge of segment labels, segment-level, object-level and context-level information are jointly considered. Prior probability of segment labels is considered by employing foreground/background information to lead each segment to be in a true class label category. Object detection results and shape models are used to consider object-level information. Here, object detection results and shape information are combined in a way shape model compensates object detector's false negatives. Also, to consider context-level information, context model is introduced. Co-occurrences of semantic labels, their spatial layout with respect to each other and spatial extent of each class label are jointly considered in context model. Finally, to optimize the problem, graph cut is used. To evaluate the proposed approach, it is applied on the well-known 21-MSRC dataset.

On the other hand, already much manual effort has gone into the construction of semantic lexicons such as the WordNet that represent the meanings of words by defining the various relationships that exist among the words in a language. We consider the question, can we improve the word representations learnt using a corpora by integrating the knowledge from semantic lexicons?.

Active learning has been typically combined with supervised learning. In this thesis, the author addresses the small sample problems in active learning that the small number of labeled data may lead to poor classifiers during the active learning process. This important aspect of active learning has been largely ignored by researchers. By combining active learning with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to solve the small sample problems, three schemes are utilized in this thesis. The following paragraphs overview the contributions of this thesis. The first scheme aims to improve the quality of the selected data, i.e., choose the data that convey more information to the learner. In traditional active learning, the similarity measurement between two data only relies on themselves. It may lead to low quality of the selected data, as they do not reflect information on the whole dataset. In order to select data with high quality, the motivation is to incorporate unlabeled data to improve the similarity measurement between the data. In order to support the proposed methods using this scheme, a criterion that the selected data should maximize the class entropy is suggested from the view point of information theory. Based on this principle, a general data selection framework is inferred that the selected data should be as dissimilar from each other as possible. Then under the inferred framework, three similarity measurements and three novel active learning methods are proposed and derived respectively. For the first proposed method, the weight of an edge in a graph is directly employed as the similarity between two data points connected by this edge. During the process of active learning, a single-side strategy is proposed to modify the weights of the graph. This leads to a dynamic similarity measurement which is able to unfold the similarity between data better than fixed strategies, such as the well-known Angle Diversity incorporated Active Learning with SVM (AD-ALSVM). For the second proposed method, the data are first mapped into a manifold", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "965295590", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61039384"}

One challenge of TSVMs is that the performance degeneration is caused by unlabeled examples that are obscure or misleading for the discovery of the underlying distribution. To address this problem, we disclose the underlying data distribution and describe the margin distribution of TSVMs as the first-order (margin mean) and second-order (margin variance) statistics of examples. Since the optimization problems of TSVMs are not convex, we utilize the concave-convex procedure and variation of stochastic variance reduced gradient methods to solve them. Particularly, we propose two specific algorithms to optimize the margin distribution of TSVM via maximizing the margin mean and minimizing the margin variance simultaneously, which the generalization ability is improved and being robust to the outliers and noise. In addition, we derive a bound on the expectation of error according to the leave-one-out cross-validation estimate, which is an unbiased estimate of the probability of test error. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on diversity datasets.

In recent years, epigenetic investigations have found that there is a close correlation between DNA methylation and aging. With the development of DNA methylation research, a quantitative statistical relationship between DNA methylation and different ages was established based on the change rule of methylation with age, it is then possible to predict the age of individuals. All the data in this work were retrieved from the Illumina HumanMethylation BeadChip platform (27K or 450K). We analyzed 16 sets of healthy samples and 9 sets of diseased samples. The healthy samples included a total of 1899 publicly available blood samples (0\u2013103 years old) and the diseased samples included 2395 blood samples. Six age-related CpG sites were selected through calculating Pearson correlation coefficients between age and DNA methylation values. We built a gradient boosting regressor model for these age-related CpG sites. 70% of the data was randomly selected as training data and the other 30% as independent data in each dataset for 25 runs in total. In the training dataset, the healthy samples showed that the correlation between predicted age and DNA methylation was 0.97, and the mean absolute deviation (MAD) was 2.72 years. In the independent dataset, the MAD was 4.06 years. The proposed model was further tested using the diseased samples. The MAD was 5.44 years for the training dataset and 7.08 years for the independent dataset. Furthermore, our model worked well when it was applied to saliva samples.
