We focus on a set of binding data obtained from 113 different protein kinases and 20 inhibitors. It was attained through ATP site-dependent binding competition assays and constitutes the first available dataset of this kind. We extract information about the investigated molecules from various data sources to obtain an informative set of features.ResultsA Support Vector Machine (SVM) as well as a decision tree algorithm (C5/See5) is used to learn models based on the available features which in turn can be used for the classification of new kinase-inhibitor pair test instances. We evaluate our approach using different feature sets and parameter settings for the employed classifiers. Moreover, the paper introduces a new way of evaluating predictions in such a setting, where different amounts of information about the binding partners can be assumed to be available for training. Results on an external test set are also provided.ConclusionsIn most of the cases, the presented approach clearly outperforms the baseline methods used for comparison. Experimental results indicate that the applied machine learning methods are able to detect a signal in the data and predict binding affinity to some extent. For SVMs, the binding prediction can be improved significantly by using features that describe the active site of a kinase. For C5, besides diversity in the feature set, alignment scores of conserved regions turned out to be very useful.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3151211", "pubmed_id": "21708012", "doi": "10.1186/1758-2946-3-22", "venue": "Journal of Cheminformatics", "journal": "Journal of Cheminformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2117712317", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["5413245", "7266303", "18363040", "6748300", "7780811", "7795019", "17406543", "7260461", "7785631", "82009153", "45746", "59843478", "194951", "1536643", "16370560", "18070033", "9062076", "124175"], "inbound_citations": ["22442670", "8144027", "145023908", "3312336", "54209054", "124175", "215438977", "17572460", "16053606", "38278113", "210039587", "20283058"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124175"}

An alternative to increase revenue is by using internet. Some SMEs already develop their website, but they don't have same navigation. The websites confuse the potential buyers. So, a website's aggregator is essential. This aggregator is made without the owner of the SMEs to register their website, which means it can automatically show website's content that already been made. For this purpose, two stages is required. First is to find relevant SMEs websites, and the second is to extract information automatically. This paper focuses on information extractor to extract information from SMEs e-commerce website with or without shopping cart feature, used to make an automatic SME aggregator and make prototype database. Learning algorithms is needed to recognize information that will be extracted. The research is about how to preprocessing website pages and what is the best algorithm for automatic information extraction. The system will compare three algorithms, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. Algorithm with the best accuracy will be used for the system's model.

We study this question, as well as a variant in which structural risk minimization (SRM) is performed where the class hierarchy is taken over the length of conjunctions.We show that maximum margin algorithms using the Boolean kernels do not PAC learn t(n)-term DNF for any t(n) = \u03c9(1), even when used with such a SRM scheme. We also consider PAC learning under the uniform distribution and show that if the kernel uses conjunctions of length \u02dc\u03c9(\u221an) then the maximum margin hypothesis will fail on the uniform distribution as well.

Different from the existing methods, this scheme firstly converts the original system into a nonaffine system containing only one unknown term by equivalent transformation, thus avoiding the cumbersome and complex indirect design process of traditional backstepping methods. Secondly, a high-performance finite-time-convergence-differentiator (FD) is designed, through which the system state variables and their derivatives are accurately estimated to ensure the control effect. Thirdly, based on the implicit function theorem, the ELM neural network is introduced to approximate the uncertain items of the system, which simplifies the repeated adjustment process of the network training parameters. Meanwhile, the minimum learning parameter algorithm (MLP) is adopted to design the adaptive law for the norm of the network weight vector, which significantly reduces calculations.

We show that responses at the final layer of DCNNs are not sufficiently localized for accurate object segmentation.

We overcome this poor localization property of deep networks by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF).

For the purpose of convenience and safety, 2D texture analysis has been used to diagnose osteoporosis. In this study, a supervised method using proposed texture features to identify osteoporotic cases from healthy was proposed. We designed two groups of new features, Encoded GLCM and Encoded LBP, each of which contains two subgroups through encoding the Gabor and Hessian information into the Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) features respectively. These two groups of features, together with the raw feature group containing the GLCM and LBP features, totally 560 features, were categorized into various groups and used to train the Random Forest classifier. Classification performances using these features were compared inter-and intra-groups/subgroups. And the performance using each individual feature was also provided. We conducted feature selection based on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) inside a voting scheme to further increase the efficiency. The inter-and intra-groups/subgroups results indicate that the Encoded GLCM and Encoded LBP, are more discriminative than the raw GLCM and LBP features for the identification of the osteoporosis; The best individual feature is from the Encoded LBP group and can achieve 70% of balanced accuracy; Furthermore, using only ten of the proposed features through feature selection, the balanced accuracy can even be improved from 60% to 71%.

After selection of some good genes based on signal-to-noise ratio, unsupervised learning like clustering and supervised learning like k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier are widely used in cancer researches to correlate the pathological behavior of cancers with the gene expression levels' differences in cancerous and normal tissues. By applying adaptive searches like Probabilistic Model Building Genetic Algorithm (PMBGA), it may be possible to get a smaller size gene subset that would classify patient samples more accurately than the above methods. In this paper, we propose a new PMBGA based method to extract informative genes from microarray data using Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier.

This study performs classification of patients' existing records and categorization of new records on the basis of trained model by implementing data mining techniques, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree (CART), Random Forest, and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). Findings of this research will help medical practitioners to classify patients on the basis of other valuable health related information and observe the physical role limitations in patients at age of 50 and above. For instance, knowing the general health scales of patients can help practitioners to predict the physical activity scale in patients, and thus help practitioners in e.g. risk assessment and drawing up treatment and care plans. The contribution of this study is to utilize a study covering 55 years' observations of the candidates in order to help practitioners to identify and predict the physical role limitation in people when they turn 50 and over on the basis of other health related information.

We predominantly used data from the eBird citizen-science project to model probabilities of occurrence relative to land-use patterns, spatial distribution of wetlands, and climate. We projected models to potential future climate conditions using five representative general circulation models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5). We used Random Forests to model probabilities of occurrence and compared the time periods 1981-2010 (hindcast) and 2041-2070 (forecast) in \"model space.\" Projected changes in shorebird probabilities of occurrence varied with species-specific general distribution pattern, migration distance, and spatial extent. Species using the western and northern portion of the study area exhibited the greatest likelihoods of decline, whereas species with more easterly occurrences, mostly long-distance migrants, had the greatest projected increases in probability of occurrence. At an ecoregional extent, differences in probabilities of shorebird occurrence ranged from -0.015 to 0.045 when averaged across climate models, with the largest increases occurring early in migration. Spatial shifts are predicted for several shorebird species. Probabilities of occurrence of wintering Mallards and Northern Pintail are predicted to increase by 0.046 and 0.061, respectively, with northward shifts projected for both species. When incorporated into partner land management decision tools, results at ecoregional extents can be used to identify wetland complexes with the greatest potential to support birds in the nonbreeding season under a wide range of future climate scenarios.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5330909", "pubmed_id": "28261460", "doi": "10.1002/ece3.2755", "venue": "Ecology and evolution", "journal": "Ecology and evolution", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2587372028", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["17966966", "18669472", "9788040", "54187891", "8696122", "62228752", "15786910", "88658963", "89141", "154788309", "207002527", "14303648", "89551365", "3626971", "8961205", "87392493", "34862154", "8504894", "127875160", "10455227", "4582489", "126931942", "188341", "85210822", "86082089", "84594241", "16522296", "28890024", "154807516", "52840329", "53536143", "129275091", "88686606", "8658142", "86659618", "27778922", "129547156", "84083253", "13399195", "12918562", "84103298", "6654902", "87277564", "41694551", "85889693", "129278938", "86615647", "207266000", "59393459", "10976403", "53309572", "16298611", "85401998", "128774418", "55717467", "89236816", "9059854", "41368186", "53606005", "84101921", "86027527"], "inbound_citations": ["53287969", "53607507", "52086057"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32323101"}

Atlas-based auto-segmentation (ABAS) methods have shown great promise for getting accurate segmentation results especially when multiple atlases are used. In this work, we aim to further improve the performance of ABAS by integrating it with learning-based segmentation techniques. In particular, the Random Forests (RF) supervised learning algorithm is applied to construct voxel-wise structure classifiers using both local and contextual image features. Training of the RF classifiers is specially tailored towards structure border regions where errors in ABAS segmentation typically occur.

Since it is not uncommon that data from a software project is insufficient for training a reliable defect prediction model, transfer learning that borrows data/knowledge from other projects to facilitate the model building at the current project, namely cross-project defect prediction (CPDP), is naturally plausible. Most CPDP techniques involve two major steps, i.e., transfer learning and classification, each of which has at least one parameter to be tuned to achieve their optimal performance. This practice fits well with the purpose of automated parameter optimization. However, there is a lack of thorough understanding about what are the impacts of automated parameter optimization on various CPDP techniques. In this paper, we present the first empirical study that looks into such impacts on 62 CPDP techniques, 13 of which are chosen from the existing CPDP literature while the other 49 ones have not been explored before. We build defect prediction models over 20 real-world software projects that are of different scales and characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that: (1) Automated parameter optimization substantially improves the defect prediction performance of 77\\% CPDP techniques with a manageable computational cost. Thus more efforts on this aspect are required in future CPDP studies. (2) Transfer learning is of ultimate importance in CPDP. Given a tight computational budget, it is more cost-effective to focus on optimizing the parameter configuration of transfer learning algorithms (3) The research on CPDP is far from mature where it is \"not difficult\" to find a better alternative by making a combination of existing transfer learning and classification techniques.

The study is conducted on a real data set collected on the Paris suburb of Alfortville. A comparison with two time series approaches namely Naive method and Autoregressive Moving Average Model (ARMA) is performed. This study is the first step towards the development of the hourly solar irradiance forecasting hybrid models.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0078", "venue": "2016 15th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)", "journal": "2016 15th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2585773698", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9885843", "96538337", "109029366", "123158436", "7138354", "110829504", "15329257", "119801285", "2675420", "62082134", "67314301", "120564233", "21554575", "117901649", "55693482", "110266530", "206787478", "5398743"], "inbound_citations": ["55887008", "125512918", "204747907", "59236249", "57366341"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15329411"}

Unlike previous theories, our model is derived from a single assumption: that the prior probability distribution of boundary completion shape can be modeled by a random walk in a lattice whose points are positions and orientations in the image plane (i.e., the space that one can reasonably assume is represented by neurons of the mammalian visual cortex). Our model does not employ numerical relaxation or other explicit minimization, but instead relies on the fact that the probability that a particle following a random walk will pass through a given position and orientation on a path joining two boundary fragments can be computed directly as the product of two vector-field convolutions. We show that for the random walk we define, the maximum likelihood paths are curves of least energy, that is, on average, random walks follow paths commonly assumed to model the shape of illusory contours.

Many existing methods found out the DME affected patients by estimating the fovea thickness. These methods have the issues of lower accuracy and higher time complexity. In order to overwhelm the above limitations, a hybrid approaches based DR detection is introduced in the proposed work. At first, the input image is preprocessed using green channel extraction and median filter. Subsequently, the features are extracted by gradient-based features like Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) with Complete Local Binary Pattern (CLBP). The texture features are concentrated with various rotations to calculate the edges. We present a hybrid feature selection that combines the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution Feature Selection (DEFS) for minimizing the time complexity. A binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier categorizes the 13 normal and 75 abnormal images from 60 patients.

The false alarm filter allows us to discard many false positives using a reduced selection of features, which are chosen from a wide set of features. Filtering is defined as a binary problem, where all speed limit signs are grouped together against noisy examples and it is the previous stage to the input of a recognition module based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

In particular, we describe a novel and specialized ensemble model which can be decomposed into multiple customized decision-tree-based base learners. To aid in model synthesis, a generic computer-aided design flow is proposed to generate samples, select features, tune hyperparameters, and train the ensemble estimator. Besides this, a hardware realization of the trained ensemble estimator is presented for on-chip real-time power estimation.

We collected demographic, clinical and treatment data, household income, employment and work disability status, comorbidity, scales for function, pain, global, and fatigue, the Regional Pain Scale (RPS), the Symptom Intensity (SI) scale (a linear combination of the RPS and the fatigue scales) and linear combinations of the Health Assessment Questionnaire, pain and global severity. We used logistic regression analyses with multivariable fractional polynomial predictors, and Random Forest analysis to determine the importance of the predictors. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The cross-sectional prevalence of self-reported depression was 15.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 14.7-15.7%) and the incidence rate was 5.5 (95% CI 5.3-5.7) per 100 patient years of observation. The cumulative risk of SRD after 9 years was 38.3% (95% CI 36.6-40.1%). Almost all variables were significant predictors in logistic models. In Random Forest analyses, the SI scale, followed by comorbidity, best predicted self-reported depression, and no other variable or combination of variables improved prediction compared with the SI scale. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Pain extent and fatigue (SI scale) are the dominant predictors of SRD. These variables, also of central importance in the symptomatology of fibromyalgia, are powerful markers of distress.

TTUR has an individual learning rate for both the discriminator and the generator. Using the theory of stochastic approximation, we prove that the TTUR converges under mild assumptions to a stationary local Nash equilibrium. The convergence carries over to the popular Adam optimization, for which we prove that it follows the dynamics of a heavy ball with friction and thus prefers flat minima in the objective landscape. For the evaluation of the performance of GANs at image generation, we introduce the \"Frechet Inception Distance\" (FID) which captures the similarity of generated images to real ones better than the Inception Score.

To do that we collect data by a normalized questionnaire from young healthy volunteers and then, we use the results of a semen analysis to asses the accuracy in the prediction of the three classification methods mentioned above. The results show that Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines show the highest accuracy, with prediction accuracy values of 86% for some of the seminal parameters.

When labeled data is scarce, it is very essential to be able to make use of additionally available unlabeled data to learn a distance metric in a semi-supervised manner. Despite the presence of a few traditional, non-deep semi-supervised metric learning approaches, they mostly rely on the min-max principle to encode the pairwise constraints, although there are a number of other ways as offered by traditional weakly-supervised metric learning approaches. Moreover, there is no flow of information from the available pairwise constraints to the unlabeled data, which could be beneficial. This paper proposes to learn a new metric by constraining it to be close to a prior metric while propagating the affinities among pairwise constraints to the unlabeled data via a closed-form solution.

In this paper we re-examine the use of bottom-up approaches to the construction of logic programs. In particular, we explore variants of Plotkin's Relative Least General Generalisation (RLGG) which are based on subsumption relative to a bottom clause. With Plotkin's RLGG, clause length grows exponentially in the number of examples. By contrast, in the Golem system, the length of ij-determinate RLGG clauses were shown to be polynomially bounded for given values of i and j. However, the determinacy restrictions made Golem inapplicable in many key application areas, including the learning of chemical properties from atom and bond descriptions. In this paper we show that with Asymmetric Relative Minimal Generalisations (or ARMGs) relative to a bottom clause, clause length is bounded by the length of the initial bottom clause. ARMGs, therefore do not need the determinacy restrictions used in Golem. An algorithm is described for constructing ARMGs and this has been implemented in an ILP system called ProGolem which combines bottom-clause construction in Progol with a Golem control strategy which uses ARMG in place of determinate RLGG. ProGolem has been evaluated on several well-known ILP datasets. It is shown that ProGolem has a similar or better predictive accuracy and learning time compared to Golem on two determinate real-world applications where Golem was originally tested. Moreover, ProGolem was also tested on several non-determinate realworld applications where Golem is inapplicable. In these applications, ProGolem and Aleph have comparable times and accuracies. The experimental results also suggest that ProGolem significantly outperforms Aleph in cases where clauses in the target theory are long and complex.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-13840-9_13", "venue": "ILP", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1558302907", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14548105", "1943360", "21222240", "2343422", "2389020", "15772014", "5254984", "10474755", "139099431", "7928748", "14992676", "6183510", "12643399", "196608877", "415529", "39666367", "39529255", "118467251", "62688491", "17137602", "60699326", "15982740", "11059482"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17802811"}

Two different heavy-tailed distributions are used in this paper. One is the Laplace distribution, and the corresponding model is denoted as RBELM-l. In RBELM-l, the posterior distribution is replaced by an approximate surrogate function, and then the parameters learning problem can be solved by means of Maximum Likelihood-type II (ML-II). The other is the Student's t-distribution, and the corresponding model is denoted as RBELM-t. In order to solve RBELM-t, the Student's t-distribution is written as a scale-mixture of infinitely many Normal distributions and a Gamma distribution. Then, the variational inference method is used to obtain an approximate solution for the parameters. Also, we propose two methods for giving weights to the likelihood function based on the concepts of robust statistic.

"abstract": "Wetlands are integral parts of the global ecosystem as they can prevent or reduce the severity of floods,feed ground water,and provide unique habitats for flora and fauna.Wetland remote sensing classification is one of the most important means to realize wetland dynamic monitoring,management and utilization.But spectral uncertainty or vagueness caused by spectral confusion between-class and spectral variation within-class remains a challenge to the wetland remote sensing classification.Exploring small sample size,high accuracy classification methods are hence necessary,due to the complex aquatic-terrestrial environments of wetlands,which are relatively difficult to acquire training samples by field survey.Traditional remote sensing classification methods usually require large training data sets,for instance,maximum likelihood classification,a widely used classical supervised classification method in remote sensing.The method of maximum likelihood classification assumes that the training statistics for each class have a normal distribution.Training of a maximum likelihood classification aims at a complete description of each class.To achieve this goal,the training set should be sufficiently large.Furthermore,the training data instances should be typical and representative of the classes in order to derive appropriate training statistics on which the classification can be based.It is hard to find such training samples in wetland remote sensing classification due to the wetland's complexity and ecological vulnerability.New approaches which need small training data sets and could deal with high feature dimensions remain to be investigated.In this paper,wetland remote sensing classification using support vector machine was explored by using Zhalong National Nature Reserve.The support vector machine is a new generation of supervised learning system that is based on the principle of statistical learning theory,which had gained wide acceptance in the remote sensing community for its solid statistical foundation and excellent empirical performance.One of the main advantages of support vector machine regarding remote sensing classification is that the approach only considers samples that are close to the class boundaries,the so-called support vectors.Using this,support vector machine works satisfactorily even with small training sets.Zhalong National Nature Reserve is a typical fresh water wetland area dominated by reed vegetation type.As an important breeding habitat of Red Crown crane(a rare wetland bird),Zhalong National Nature Reserve was firstly listed as the wetlands of international importance by the Ramsar Convention in 1987.The scientific management and protection of Zhalong National Nature Reserve has been highlighted by the government.Primary analysis was made with respect to the impact of sample size and feature dimensionality on the classification accuracy of the support vector machine,in comparison with classical maximum likelihood classifier.Training samples were partitioned into five sample sizes per class 20,40,60,80 and 100,based on stratified random sampling strategy.Each group of sample size combined with low and high dimensional features were used for wetland remote sensing classification respectively.The low dimensional features only include 11 feature bands while high dimensional features consist of 44 feature bands:11 feature bands and spectral,textural and terrain features.The wetland remote sensing classification based on support vector machine and maximum likelihood classifier had been explored using five kinds of sample size with low dimensional feature and high dimensional feature respectively.Our results showed that support vector machine performed better than maximum likelihood classifier in general.The classification accuracy tends to increase with the sample size grows larger.The highest classification accuracy(overall accuracy up to 88.125%) was obtained by support vector machine with 100 training samples per class plus high dimensional features.The total wetland area classified in Zhalong National Nature Reserve was 90 307.17 ha,including 8 301.15 ha water body,and 33 063.57 ha water covering marsh and 48 942.45 ha without water covering marsh.With high dimensional feature,support vector machine successfully solved the problem of'dimension disaster' and obtained an ideal classification result by combining spectral,textural and terrain features simultaneously.The support vector machine could still achieve good accuracies even the training sample size is as small as 20 or 40.Whereas maximum likelihood classifier classifier could not be trained with such small sample sizes at all,which indicate that maximum likelihood classifier classifier has a great constraint on sample sizes,especially for high dimensional features.Considering of its less constraints on training sample sizes and of its higher capability in dealing with dimensional features,the support vector machine is thus considered to be better suitable to wetland remote sensing classification,as training samples are hard to be acquired by field survey.That is,the support vector machine is an effective tool in wetland remote sensing classification.Meanwhile,we found 9 532.8 ha Saline-alkaline land in Zhalong National Nature Reserve.That means that the ecological environment of Zhalong National Nature Reserve is particularly vulnerable.Actions of scientific protection and management are required for these valuable wetland resources.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Wetland Science", "mag_id": "2392092317", "mag_field_of_study":

This dissertation proposes supervised and unsupervised algorithms that are naturally integrated in a scalable framework to solve the entity resolution problem, which lies at the heart of the information integration process. ::: This dissertation focuses on two incarnations of the entity resolution problem that arise in the data mining and natural language processing areas. First, name disambiguation occurs when one is seeking a list of publications of an author in a digital library, who has used different name variations and when there are multiple other authors with the same name. We present an efficient integrative framework that disambiguates the extracted author metadata from paper headers in a divide-and-conquer fashion: based on the metadata records extracted from paper headers, a blocking method retrieves candidate classes of authors with similar names and a density-based clustering method, DBSCAN, clusters the records by author. The distance metric between papers used for clustering is calculated by an online active selection Support Vector Machines algorithm LASVM. We prove that by recasting transitivity as density connectivity in DBSCAN, transitivity is guaranteed for core points. The method achieves high accuracy on a manually labeled dataset and readily disambiguates about a million author metadata records in CiteSeer, which paves the way for the fielded search by author name feature in CiteSeer X. Second, as a key step towards document understanding in natural language processing, we investigate the problem of cross document coreference (CDC), which aims to decipher the true reference of a named entity across the boundary of documents. This dissertation presents a novel cross document coreference approach that leverages the profiles of entities which are constructed by information extraction tools and reconciled using a within-document coreference module. We propose to match the profiles by using a learned ensemble distance function comprised of a suite of similarity specialists. We develop a kernelized soft relational clustering algorithm that makes use of the learned distance function to partition the entities into fuzzy sets of identities. Evaluation on a large benchmark collection shows that the proposed methods achieve competitive coreference results. We further discuss the details of the implementation of the CDC and web person search system. ::: This dissertation surveys the literature on author name disambiguation in citations and paper headers, citation matching and cross document coreference. Additionally, we explore the social networks of the disambiguated authors, performing a comprehensive study of the network and community level characteristics and proposing a stochastic model to predict collaborations of individuals.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1751399799", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203197167"}

Bacteria can inhabit either the endosphere, the region inside the plant root, or the rhizosphere, the soil region just outside the plant root. Our goal is to understand if using genomic data and media dependent metabolic model information is better for training machine learning of predicting bacterial ecological niche than media independent models or pure genome based species trees. We considered three machine learning techniques: support vector machine, non-negative matrix factorization, and artificial neural networks. In all three machine-learning approaches, the media-based metabolic models and flux balance analyses were more effective at predicting bacterial niche than the genome or PRMT models. Support Vector Machine trained on a minimal media base with Mannose, Proline and Valine was most predictive of all models and media types with an f-score of 0.8 for rhizosphere and 0.97 for endosphere. Thus we can conclude that media-based metabolic modeling provides a holistic view of the metabolome, allowing machine learning algorithms to highlight the differences between and categorize endosphere and rhizosphere bacteria.

Loop exposure outside the bacterial cell membranes makes TMBBs important targets for vaccine or drug therapies.

In this paper, we propose a novel robust semi-supervised graph representation learning method based on graph convolutional network.

Moreover, to make the model robust with noise in the pseudo-label, we propose to apply a large margin classifier to the learned representation.

Wireless spoofing attacks are easy to launch and can significantly impact the performance of networks. The flexibility and openness of wireless networks enables an adversary to masquerade as other devices easily. The traditional approach to detect spoofing attacks is to apply cryptographic authentication. Here using spatial information, a physical property of each node, so hard to falsify and not depend on cryptographic security, on the beginning for (1) detecting spoofing attacks; (2) determining the number of attackers when multiple node pretend as a same node identity, and (3) localizing multiple adversaries.

{"paper_id": "17826875", "title": "Towards Object-Relational Data Mining.", "authors": [{"first": "Francesca", "middle": ["A."], "last": "Lisi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Donato", "middle": [], "last": "Malerba", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Mining data of complex data types (e.g. spatial, multimedial, etc.) is deemed an important research frontier in data mining. These data types are often currently modelled according to the object-relational data model. In this paper we face the problem of de ning a general framework for mining object-relational databases instead of concentrating on speci c forms of data mining tailored to speci c data types (e.g. spatial data mining, multimedia data mining, etc.). Such a framework allows us to formulate data mining tasks in application domains characterized by objects, properties of objects, relations between objects and concept hierarchies. The hybrid language AL-log and an ILP approach are the building blocks of the framework. Frequent pattern discovery at multiple levels of description granularity is taken as a showcase of ORDM. 1 Background and motivation Data models play a relevant role in data mining [8]. Yet data mining techniques often make assumptions on the representation of input data which mismatch the data model adopted by the database to be mined. Indeed most techniques, here collectively referred to as Classical Data Mining (CDM), have been developed for data in the single-table form traditionally used in statistics. However, real-world data is seldom of this form. Rather, relational databases are widely used. Only recently a large body of research, named Relational Data Mining (RDM) and aimed at overcoming the limits of CDM in dealing with relational databases, has emerged [6]. We would like to emphasize that RDM is not simply data mining in relational databases. This de nition would not be suAEcient to distinguish it from CDM, which has been nonetheless extensively applied to relational databases. We de ne research on RDM as the study of methods and techniques for discovering relational patterns in relational data to emphasize that the relational data model is an invariant of the discovery process. RDM techniques have been mainly developed within the eld of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), a research area at the intersection of machine learning and logic programming [12]. Data in ILP is expected to be represented in Horn clausal logic. Therefore there is a natural t between relational databases and ILP techniques as regards the data model. ILP was initially concerned with the synthesis of logic programs from examples and background knowledge. The recent developments, however, have broadened the range of learning problems of ILP from the traditional predictive tasks (classi cation rules) of machine learning to the descriptive ones more peculiar to data mining. E.g., WARMR [4] is an ILP system for frequent pattern discovery where data and patterns are represented in Datalog [3]. Mining data of complex data types (e.g. spatial, multimedial, etc.) is deemed an important research frontier in data mining [8]. These data types are often currently modelled according to the object-relational data model. In this paper we de ne Object-Relational Data Mining as the study of methods and techniques for discovering object-relational patterns in object-relational data and face the problem of de ning a general framework for ORDM instead of concentrating on speci c forms of data mining tailored to speci c data types (e.g. spatial data mining, multimedia data mining, etc.). Such a framework allows us to formulate data mining tasks in application domains characterized by objects, properties of objects, relations between objects, and concept hierarchies (or taxonomies). An open question in ORDM research is: what approach? ILP seems a good candidate, except for the pure relational data model it adopts. Complex data types require appropriate representation and reasoning means. Description Logics (DLs) are particularly interesting because they have been invented for representing and reasoning with structural knowledge and concept hierarchies [1]. Unfortunately in exchange for the ability to model and reason about value restrictions in domains with a rich hierarchical structure, DLs o er a weaker than usual query language. This makes also pure DLs inadequate as a knowledge representation and reasoning means in ORDM problems. Hybrid languages such as AL-log [5] appear more promising because they combine description logics and functionfree Horn clausal logic. In this paper we show that AL-log can be the starting point for the de nition of a general framework for ORDM obtained by upgrading ILP solutions for RDM to ILP solutions for ORDM. Also we extend the work on spatial data mining presented in [10]. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls the link between description logics and databases. Section 3 de nes the data mining task chosen as ORDM showcase. Section 4 presents the application of the AL-log framework to the ORDM showcase. Section 5 concludes the paper with nal remarks and directions for future work. 2 Description logics and databases Description Logics (DLs) are fragments of rst-order logic with equality [1]. From the beginning DLs have been considered general-purpose languages for knowledge representation and reasoning. They were considered especially e ective for those domains where the knowledge could be easily organized along a hierarchical structure, based on the is-a relationship. This motivated the use of DLs as a modeling language in the design and maintenance of large, hierarchically structured bodies of knowledge. E.g. the description logic ALC [13] allows for the speci cation of structural knowledge in terms of concepts, roles, and individuals. Individuals represent objects in the domain of interest. Concepts represent classes of these objects, while roles represent binary relations between concepts. Complex concepts can be de ned by means of constructs, such as u and t. An ALC knowledge base is a two-component system. The intensional component T consists of concept hierarchies spanned by is-a relations between concepts, namely inclusion statements of the form C v D (read \"C is included in D\") where C and D are two arbitrary concepts. The extensional component M speci es instance-of relations, e.g. concept assertions of the form a : C (read \"a belongs to C\") where a is an individual and C is a concept. In ALC an interpretation I = ( I ; ) consists of a set I (the domain of I) and a function I (the interpretation function of I). E.g., it maps concepts to subsets of I and individuals to elements of I such that a 6= b if a 6= b (unique names assumption). We say that I is a model for C v D if C D , and for a : C if a 2 C . The main reasoning services for ALC knowledge bases are checking whether logically implies an inclusion (i.e. j= C v D) or a membership assertion (i.e. j= o : C). The former inference is called subsumption check, the latter instance check. Both checks boil down to the more general problem of checking the satis ability of an ALC knowledge base . The relationship between DLs and databases is also rather strong [1]. Several investigations have been carried out on the usage of DLs to formalize objectoriented data models and semantic data models. In these proposals concept descriptions in DLs are used to present the schema of a database. On the other hand, since a concept description provides necessary and suAEcient conditions for objects to satisfy it, it is natural to treat it as a query, thus leading to a uni cation of two traditionally distinct languages: the data de nition and data manipulation languages. Unfortunately in exchange for a more expressive description of the schema, DLs pay the price of a weaker than usual query language. Queries can only return subsets of existing concepts, rather than creating new concepts (as in standard SQL databases). Furthermore, the selection conditions are rather limited. Given the expressive limitations of DL concepts alone as queries, it has been reasonable to consider extending Datalog queries with DLs. In one approach, exempli ed by the AL-log language [5], ALC concept assertions are used essentially as type constraints on variables appearing in function-free Horn clauses. E.g., q(X) item(X,Y), item(X,Z) & X:Order, Y:DairyProduct, Z:GrainsCereals give a avor of what unary conjunctive queries look like in AL-log. Here the concept assertions Y:DairyProduct and Z:GrainsCereals restrict the range of the variables Y and Z to individuals of the concepts DairyProduct and GrainsCereals respectively. We claim that AL-log can be used as a formal language for objectrelational data models. 3 A case study for ORDM A good representative of the class of data mining tasks which our framework can elegantly deal with is frequent pattern discovery at multiple levels of description granularity. This task and related issues have been already discussed in [10]. For the sake of brevity we only recall the formal problem statement.

In particular, overlapping features usually exist in a lexicon-based approach. In this work, we present a probabilistic address parser based on linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs), which allow more expressive token-level features compared to hidden Markov models (HMMs).

Another is post-processing of the output sequences of the parser by combining its conditional probability and a score function, which is based on a learned stochastic regular grammar (SRG) that captures segment-level dependencies. Experiments were conducted by comparing the CRF parser to a HMM parser and a semi-Markov CRF parser in two real-world datasets. The CRF parser out-performed the HMM parser and the semi-Markov CRF in both datasets in terms of classification accuracy.

This study investigated the feasibility of leveraging computer vision and machine learning to help autonomous vehicles decide to wait or to enter when reaching roundabouts. A grid-based image processing approach with a single camera at normal roundabouts (GBIPA-SC-NR) is proposed in this paper to characterize traffic situations that can be used for machine learning algorithms to learn the roundabout joining criteria. Video road clips recorded when human drivers reach and then join various roundabouts at different locations were utilised for this learning process, with a selection of four supervised classification algorithms (i.e. the Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Decision Tree).

An important theoretical contribution of this paper is the development of the projected margin concept. This value is computed as the margin vector projection on a lower dimensional subspace and is used as an upper bound for the current value of the hypothesis in the search process.

Because knowledge graph datasets typically only contain positive facts, sampling useful negative training examples is a non-trivial task. Replacing the head or tail entity of a fact with a uniformly randomly selected entity is a conventional method for generating negative facts used by many previous works, but the majority of negative facts generated in this way can be easily discriminated from positive facts, and will contribute little towards the training. Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs), we use one knowledge graph embedding model as a negative sample generator to assist the training of our desired model, which acts as the discriminator in GANs. The objective of the generator is to generate difficult negative samples that can maximize their likeliness determined by the discriminator, while the discriminator minimizes its training loss. This framework is independent of the concrete form of generator and discriminator, and therefore can utilize a wide variety of knowledge graph embedding models as its building blocks. In experiments, we adversarially train two translation-based models, TransE and TransD, each with assistance from one of the two probability-based models, DistMult and ComplEx. We evaluate the performances of KBGAN on the link prediction task, using three knowledge base completion datasets: FB15k-237, WN18 and WN18RR.

By utilizing high-throughput sequencing technologies, the biological function of RNA-editing has been actively investigated. Currently, RNA-editing is considered to be a key regulator that controls various cellular functions, such as protein activity, alternative splicing pattern of mRNA, and substitution of miRNA targeting site. DARNED, a public RDD database, reported that there are more than 300-thousands RNA-editing sites detected in human genome(hg19). Moreover, multiple studies suggested that RNA-editing events occur in highly specific conditions. According to DARNED, 97.62 % of registered editing sites were detected in a single tissue or in a specific condition, which also supports that the RNA-editing events occur condition-specifically. Since RNA-seq can capture the whole landscape of transcriptome, RNA-seq is widely used for RDD prediction. However, significant amounts of false positives or artefacts can be generated when detecting RNA-editing from RNA-seq. Since it is difficult to perform experimental validation at the whole-transcriptome scale, there should be a powerful computational tool to distinguish true RNA-editing events from artefacts. ::: ::: ::: RESULT ::: We developed RDDpred, a Random Forest RDD classifier. RDDpred reports potentially true RNA-editing events from RNA-seq data. RDDpred was tested with two publicly available RNA-editing datasets and successfully reproduced RDDs reported in the two studies (90 %, 95 %) while rejecting false-discoveries (NPV: 75 %, 84 %). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: RDDpred automatically compiles condition-specific training examples without experimental validations and then construct a RDD classifier. As far as we know, RDDpred is the very first machine-learning based automated pipeline for RDD prediction. We believe that RDDpred will be very useful and can contribute significantly to the study of condition-specific RNA-editing.

This study aims to develop a prediction method for the high dimensional state subject to respiratory motion. Compared to conventional linear dimension reduction based approaches, our method utilizes manifold learning to construct a descriptive feature submanifold, where more efficient and accurate prediction can be performed. ::: Methods: ::: We developed a prediction framework for high-dimensional state subject to respiratory motion. The proposed method performs dimension reduction in a nonlinear setting to permit more descriptive features compared to its linear counterparts (e.g., classic PCA). Specifically, a kernel PCA is used to construct a proper low-dimensional feature manifold, where low-dimensional prediction is performed. A fixed-point iterative pre-image estimation method is applied subsequently to recover the predicted value in the original state space. We evaluated and compared the proposed method with PCA-based method on 200 level-set surfaces ::: reconstructed from surface point clouds captured by the VisionRT system. The prediction accuracy was evaluated with respect to root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) for both 200ms and 600ms lookahead lengths. ::: Results: ::: The proposed method outperformed PCA-based approach with statistically higher prediction accuracy. In one-dimensional feature subspace, our method achieved mean prediction accuracy of 0.86mm and 0.89mm for 200ms and 600ms lookahead lengths respectively, compared to 0.95mm and 1.04mm from PCA-based method. The paired t-tests further demonstrated the statistical significance of the superiority of our method, with p-values of 6.33e-3 and 5.78e-5, respectively. ::: Conclusion: ::: The proposed approach benefits from the descriptiveness of a nonlinear manifold and the prediction reliability in such low dimensional manifold.

It remains an open question how an accurate solution to a multi-class problem can be obtained by using a logic based learning method. In this paper we present a novel logic based approach to solve challenging multi-class classification problems. Our technique is based on the use of large margin methods in conjunction with the kernels constructed from first order rules induced by an ILP system. The proposed approach learns a multi-class classifier by using a divide and conquer reduction strategy that splits multi-classes into binary groups and solves each individual problem recursively hence generating an underlying decision list structure. We also study the well known one-vs-all scheme in conjunction with logic-based kernel learning. In order to construct a highly informative logical and relational space we introduce a low dimensional embedding method. The technique is amenable to skewed/non-skewed class distribution where multi-class problems such as protein fold recognition are generally characterized by highly uneven class distribution. We performed a series of experiments to evaluate the proposed rule selection and multi-class schemes. The methods were applied to solve challenging problems in computation biology and bioinformatics, namely multi-class protein fold recognition and mutagenicity detection.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVM we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use evolution strategies in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions just as for traditional SVM. We will show that evolutionary SVM are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on eight real-world benchmark data sets in terms of generalization performance. They always outperform traditional approaches in terms of the original optimization problem. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite or indefinite kernel functions.

Excluding proteins and/or ligands that are similar to those in the test sets from the training set has a significant effect on scoring function performance, but does not remove the predictive power of ligand-based features. Furthermore a RF using only ligand-based features is predictive at a level similar to classical scoring functions and it appears to be predicting the mean binding affinity of a ligand for its protein targets. ::: ::: ::: AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION ::: Data and code to reproduce all the results are freely available at http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/resources. ::: ::: ::: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ::: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31598630", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btz665", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "mag_id": "2980234582", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["213769071", "211010901", "214722992"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204030086"}

The biochemical indexes of PQ poisoning patients in different status are collected and analyzed by the independent-sample test. After that, Fisher scores feature selection is applied to screen prognostic factors from biochemical indexes.

The created ELM method is rigorously evaluated for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The results show that there is statistical significance between dead and survived people in biochemical indexes (P<;0.01). Feature selection revealed that direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), the ratio of ALT/AST, and creatinine are the most crucial indexes, which correlated with the prognosis of PQ poisoning. The maximal classification accuracy is 79.6% when these six indexes are selected as the dataset. In conclusion, the biochemical test is related to the prognosis of PQ poisoning patients.

The simulated model gives rotor currents, the multi-resolution analysis of which is conducted in the wavelet domain for the detection of broken bars. The analyzed data itself is indicative of the incipient faults, but mere human inspection can sometimes lead to unexpected faults. Hence, a classification scheme using Support Vector Machine is adopted.

In addition, an experienced or knowledgeable attacker can get to make out the system\u2019s weakness and can hack the sensible information or any resource and so, it is essential to provide protection against attack or intrusion. Additionally, to handle poor performance or low latency for the clients, filtering malicious accesses becomes the main concern of an administrator. Some of the traditional Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems fail to overcome the abovementioned problems. As a result, this research proposes a novel approach named Enhanced Intrusion Detection Prevention System to prevent, protect and respond the various network intrusions in the internet. Our proposed system use client-server architecture, which contains main server and several clients. Clients record the doubtful actions taking place in the Internet and record the suspicious information. Then, this recorded information is forwarded to the main server for further usage. After that, the main server analyses the received data and then make decision whether to provide a security alert or not; then the received information is displayed via an interface. In addition, server verifies the data packets using IDPS and classifies the attacks using Support Vector Machine. Finally, as per the attack type Honeypot system sends irrelevant data to the attacker.

Excellent solutions have been demonstrated mostly in image processing applications which involve large, continuous output spaces. There is almost no application of these powerful tools to problems having small dimensional output spaces. Regression problems involving the inductive learning of a map, $y=f(x,z)$, $z$ denoting noise, $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\times \\mathbb{R}^k \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m$, with $m$ small (e.g., $m=1$ or just a few) is one good case in point. The standard approach to solve regression problems is to probabilistically model the output $y$ as the sum of a mean function $m(x)$ and a noise term $z$; it is also usual to take the noise to be a Gaussian. These are done for convenience sake so that the likelihood of observed data is expressible in closed form. In the real world, on the other hand, stochasticity of the output is usually caused by missing or noisy input variables. Such a real world situation is best represented using an implicit model in which an extra noise vector, $z$ is included with $x$ as input. CGAN is naturally suited to design such implicit models. This paper makes the first step in this direction. Using synthetic datasets we show that CGAN possesses a better ability to model complex noise forms.

For example, \"screen\" is an aspect in iPhone, but not only iPhone has a screen, many electronic devices have screens too. When \"screen\" appears in a review of a new domain (or product), it is likely to be an aspect too. Knowing this information enables us to do much better extraction in the new domain.

However, the former requires adequate labeled samples and informative negative samples, and are also ineffective in measuring the high-order connections among papers, while the latter needs complicated feature engineering or supervision to construct the network. We propose a novel generative adversarial framework to grow the two categories of models together: (i) the discriminative module distinguishes whether two papers are from the same author, and (ii) the generative module selects possibly homogeneous papers directly from the heterogeneous information network, which eliminates the complicated feature engineering. In such a way, the discriminative module guides the generative module to select homogeneous papers, and the generative module generates high-quality negative samples to train the discriminative module to make it aware of high-order connections among papers. Furthermore, a self-training strategy for the discriminative module and a random walk based generating algorithm are designed to make the training stable and efficient.

Prominent applications of such programs have been concerned with determining \u201cstructure-activity\u201d relationships in the areas of molecular biology and chemistry. Typically the task here is to predict the \u201cactivity\u201d of a compound (for example, toxicity), from its chemical structure. A summary of the research in the area is: (a) ILP programs have largely been restricted to qualitative predictions of activity (\u201chigh\u201d, \u201clow\u201d etc.); (b) When appropriate attributes are available, ILP programs have equivalent predictivity to standard quantitative analysis techniques like linear regression. However ILP programs usually perform better when such attributes are unavailable; and (c) By using structural information as background knowledge, an ILP program can provide comprehensible explanations for biological activity. This paper examines the use of ILP programs as a method of \u201cdiscovering\u201d new attributes. These attributes could then be used by methods like linear regression, thus allowing for quantitative predictions while retaining the ability to use structural information as background knowledge. Using structure-activity tasks as a test-bed, the utility of ILP programs in constructing new features was evaluated by examining the prediction of biological activity using linear regression, with and without the aid of ILP learnt logical attributes. In three out of the five data sets examined the addition of ILP attributes produced statistically better results. In addition six important structural features that have escaped the attention of the expert chemists were discovered.

In order to evaluate the quality of a constructive learning algorithm, not only the learning efficiency of the algorithm need to be measured, but also the topological complexity of the constructed network has to be examined. This paper discusses both the learning speeds and the network sizes of constructive learning algorithms. As the backprop requires more nodes than necessary for the network to converge, it is used as a reference to measure the complexity of constructive networks. Experiments using two constructive algorithms, cascade correlation and stack, indicates that the network built by constructive learning algorithms can have less complexity than the network required by the backprop algorithm. >", "year": 1994, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICNN.1994.374191", "venue": "Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)", "journal": "Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1486447856", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["30443043", "62696404", "2757547", "44826720", "61566132", "50263509"], "inbound_citations": ["17420482", "62223350", "16968332", "16967926", "17673221", "15450858", "8064235"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59200442"}

The function approximation concerns itself with finding a relation within a set of samples supplied before. The goal of the function approximator is to select the best function from a set of possible functions to approximate the true relation contained in the noisy data set. In previously LFFC research, different function approximator has been used: the Least Squares Approximator, the neural networks such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)and B-splines Networks, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM), ect. Recently a new off-line approximator called Key Sample Machine (KSM) has been developed during the Ph.D research of dr. ir. B.J. de Kruif. A series of tests had been made to evaluate the performance of KSM and showed it gives a smaller prediction error for noisy data in a shorter time compared with other methods. However, these tests have not been performed with a sufficient number of different problems/data sets. With a smaller volume of data sets, it is impossible to characterize the behaviour of KSM in a broad statistical view. For this purpose a standard of experimentation should be valid in the sense that there are no artefacts created by random factors or by a faulty experimental setup. The goal of this research is to test and evaluate the KSM algorithm by standard experiments and to compare it with other available methods (SVM,LSSVM,RBFN) on standard sets of regression problems through simulation. Nine well-known approximation benchmarking problems are used in our simulation, including six real-world data sets and three artificial data sets. The comparison is performed with respect to the ability to approximate various data sets, the efficiency of learning, and the ability to train samples from the real-world data. Simulation results show that the KSM yields good performance, especially when considering the efficiency, which is very important for its application in the online LFFC setting.

Among the variety of existing data sources, the satellites continuously observing the surface of the Earth are key to the monitoring of our environment. The new generation of satellite sensors are tremendously increasing the possibilities of applications but also increasing the need for efficient processing methodologies in order to extract information relevant to the users' needs in an automatic or semi-automatic way. This is where machine learning comes into play to transform complex data into simplified products such as maps of land-cover changes or classes by learning from data examples annotated by experts. These annotations, also called labels, may actually be difficult or costly to obtain since they are established on the basis of ground surveys. As an example, it is extremely difficult to access a region recently flooded or affected by wildfires. In these situations, the detection of changes has to be done with only annotations from unaffected regions. In a similar way, it is difficult to have information on all the land-cover classes present in an image while being interested in the detection of a single one of interest. These challenging situations are called novelty detection or one-class classification in machine learning. In these situations, the learning phase has to rely only on a very limited set of annotations, but can exploit the large set of unlabeled pixels available in the images. This setting, called semi-supervised learning, allows significantly improving the detection. In this Thesis we address the development of methods for novelty detection and one-class classification with few or no labeled information. The proposed methodologies build upon the kernel methods, which take place within a principled but flexible framework for learning with data showing potentially non-linear feature relations. The thesis is divided into two parts, each one having a different assumption on the data structure and both addressing unsupervised (automatic) and semi-supervised (semi-automatic) learning settings. The first part assumes the data to be formed by arbitrary-shaped and overlapping clusters and studies the use of kernel machines, such as Support Vector Machines or Gaussian Processes. An emphasis is put on the robustness to noise and outliers and on the automatic retrieval of parameters. Experiments on multi-temporal multispectral images for change detection are carried out using only information from unchanged regions or none at all. The second part assumes high-dimensional data to lie on multiple low dimensional structures, called manifolds. We propose a method seeking a sparse and low-rank representation of the data mapped in a non-linear feature space. This representation allows us to build a graph, which is cut into several groups using spectral clustering. For the semi-supervised case where few labels of one class of interest are available, we study several approaches incorporating the graph information. The class labels can either be propagated on the graph, constrain spectral clustering or used to train a one-class classifier regularized by the given graph. Experiments on the unsupervised and oneclass classification of hyperspectral images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5075/epfl-thesis-6184", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1828968418", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60581472"}

The experimental results on clinical data show that the proposed network can suppress image noise more effectively while preserving better image fidelity than three selected state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1910.06749", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2981163295", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["2701650", "7212319", "34494741", "9359088", "7836948", "21571446", "52071870", "14883988", "11206708", "198302893", "59603039", "192602649", "1250615", "3283965", "192574808", "54443973", "5575601", "3719281", "206429151", "206594692", "2722012", "49421366", "13943041", "980236", "2286534", "10894094", "8758543", "740063", "6628106", "5707386", "29902885"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204575900"}

It is particularly important for electric vehicles or portable devices. In this paper, the proposed SOC estimator extracts model parameters from battery charging/discharging testing cycles, using cell current, cell voltage, and cell temperature as independent variables. Tests are carried out on a 60 Ah lithium-ion cell with the dynamic stress test cycle to set up the SVM model.

Generally, time response consists of two parts. Firstly, control center receives signals from the field and then process those signals to determine the appropriate setting of FACTS devices according to load level and location of fault. Secondly, FACTS devices react based on the signals sent by control center to prevent voltage collapse. The total response time should be shorter than the time to voltage collapse. Two kinds of FACTS devices, Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) and Static VAR Compensator (SVC), are used to represent series and shunt type devices, respectively.

Created when an itinerary is booked, they contain travel and passenger information. It is usual for airlines and other actors in the industry to inter-exchange and access each other's PNR, creating the challenge of using them without infringing data ownership laws. To address this difficulty, we propose a method to generate realistic synthetic PNRs using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Unlike other GAN applications, PNRs consist of categorical and numerical features with missing/NaN values, which makes the use of GANs challenging. We propose a solution based on Cram\\'{e}r GANs, categorical feature embedding and a Cross-Net architecture. The method was tested on a real PNR dataset, and evaluated in terms of distribution matching, memorization, and performance of predictive models for two real business problems: client segmentation and passenger nationality prediction.

Standard Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) algorithms and classical first order logic are not well-suited for managing rules with exceptions. Indeed, a hypothesis that is induced accumulates all the exceptions of the rules contained in it. Moreover, with multiple-class problems, classifying an example in two different classes (even if one is the right one) is not correct, so a rule that contains some exceptions may prevent another rule which has no exception from being useful. This paper proposes a new possibilistic logic framework for weighted ILP. It induces rules which are progressively more and more accurate, and allows us to manage exceptions by controlling their accumulation. In this setting, we first propose an algorithm for learning rules when the background knowledge and the examples are stratified into layers having different levels of priority or certainty. This allows the induction of general but uncertain rules together with more specific and less uncertain rules.

We found that topsoil CEC in the 2010s was significantly lower than in the 1980s, with an overall decline of about 14%. Topsoil CEC decreased significantly in alpine meadow, alpine steppe, meadow steppe, and typical steppe by 11%, 20%, 27% and 9% respectively. Desert steppe was the only ecosystem type which experienced no significant change.

In this paper we attempt to use a powerful classification method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), to attack this problem. Our key insight is that the availability of the source taxonomy data could be helpful to build better classifiers in this scenario, therefore it would be beneficial to do transductive learning rather than inductive learning, i.e., learning to optimize classification performance on a particular set of test examples.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel approach, called Supervised Feature Learning Network Based on the Improved LLE (SFLNet) for face recognition. The goal of SFLNet is to extract features efficiently. Thus SFLNet consists of learning kernels based on the improved Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and multiscale feature analysis. Instead of taking image pixels as the input of LLE algorithm, the improved LLE uses linear discriminant kernel distance (LDKD). Besides, the outputs of the improved LLE are convolutional kernels, not the dimensional reduction features. Mutiscale feature analysis enhances the insensitive to complex changes caused by large pose, expression, or illumination variations. So SFLNet has better discrimination and is more suitable for face recognition task.

Soil texture is the main factor to be considered before doing cultivation. It affects the crop selection and regulates the water transmission property. The conventional hydrometer method determines the percentage of sand, silt, and clay present in a soil sample. This method is very cost and time-consuming process. In this approach, we collect 50 soil samples from the different region of west Guwahati, Assam, India. The samples are photographed under a constant light condition using an Android mobile of 13 MP cameras. The fraction of sand, silt, and clay of the soil samples are determined using the hydrometer test. The result of the hydrometer test is processed with the United State Department of Agriculture soil classification triangle for the final soil classification. Soil images are processed through the different stages like pre-processing of soil images for image enhancement, extracting the region of interest for segmentation and the texture analysis for feature vector. The feature vector is calculated from the Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) histogram, color moments, color auto Correlogram, Gabor wavelets, and discrete wavelet transform. Finally, Support Vector Machine classifier is used to classify the soil images using linear kernel. The proposed method gives an average of 91.37 % accuracy for all the soil samples and the result is nearly the same with the United State Department of Agriculture soil classification.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.inpa.2019.08.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Information Processing in Agriculture", "mag_id": "2967565346", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204872283"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202128135"}

However, the recent financial crisis affected urban growth trends considerably. This paper uses the observed LUC trends between 1991 and 2016 to sketch three divergent future scenarios of economic development. The observed LUC trends are then analysed using 27 dynamic, biophysical, socio-economic, terrain and proximity-based factors, to generate transition potential maps, implementing a Random Forests (RF) regression modelling approach.

The resulting maps are subjected to a multiple resolution sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of spatial resolution of the input data to the model outputs. Findings show that, under the current setting of an underdeveloped land use planning apparatus, a long-term scenario of high economic growth will increase built-up surfaces in the region by almost 24%, accompanied by a notable decrease in natural areas and cropland.

Here, we unlock standardized and systematically collected information on post-harvest management and farmer-reported post-harvest loss estimates from the Living Standards Measurement Study \u2013 Integrated Surveys in Agriculture. Using the data from Ethiopia, the objective is to disentangle factors that induce or relate to post-harvest losses in cereals. The data of approximately 2500 households and 5500 cereal records were analysed. Cereal post-harvest loss was reported by only 10% of these households. The average self-reported post-harvest loss was 24%. Rodents and other pests were most frequently reported to cause these losses. Adoption of improved storage methods was limited and most cereals were stored inside the house in bags. Random Forests (RF) was applied to gain insight into factors and conditions favouring post-harvest losses. Application of RF explained 31% of the variation in post-harvest losses reported by farmers. Three major factors associated with post-harvest losses were the distance of the household dwelling to the nearest market, the distance of the household dwelling to the main road, and average annual rainfall. Losses increased the further households were located from a market or main road, and losses also tended to decrease with higher rainfall. The standardized and nationally representative survey data from Ethiopia used were a good starting point for modelling post-harvest losses but the finally available information appeared to be partial. Therefore, this paper calls for better data collection, which could help to better target interventions needed to reduce post-harvest losses.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12571-017-0714-y", "venue": "Food Security", "journal": "Food Security", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2754966987", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["67762735", "89141", "60993494", "154228086", "25643417", "122433948", "6471216", "17543318", "153812118", "11081741", "15153338", "17914636", "16387193", "7161110", "119972206"], "inbound_citations": ["204784852", "208172130", "146771592", "169977819", "197897415", "209176032", "198190261", "202024191"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21905933"}

Its application to classification tasks implies the use of both labeled (training) data and unlabeled (working) data to build a classifier whose main goal is that of classifying (only) unlabeled data as accurately as possible. Unlike the classical inductive setting, no general rule valid for all possible instances is generated. Transductive learning is most suited for those applications where the examples for which a prediction is needed are already known when training the classifier. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature on building transductive classifiers from data stored in a single table of a relational database. Nonetheless, no attention has been paid to the application of the transduction principle in a (multi-)relational setting, where data are stored in multiple tables of a relational database. In this paper we propose a new transductive classifier, named TRANSC, which is based on a probabilistic approach to making transductive inferences from relational data. This new method works in a transductive setting and employs a principled probabilistic classification in multi-relational data mining to face the challenges posed by some spatial data mining problems. Probabilistic inference allows us to compute the class probability and return, in addition to result of transductive classification, the confidence in the classification. The predictive accuracy of TRANSC has been compared to that of its inductive counterpart in an empirical study involving both a benchmark relational dataset and two spatial datasets. The results obtained are generally in favor of TRANSC, although improvements are small by a narrow margin.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-73499-4_25", "venue": "In: P.

The recent great improvements on benchmark data sets achieved by increasingly complex unsupervised learning methods and deep learning models with lots of parameters usually requires many tedious tricks and much expertise to tune. However, filters learned by these complex architectures are quite similar to standard hand-crafted features visually. In this paper, unsupervised learning methods, such as PCA or auto-encoder, are employed as the building block to learn filter banks at each layer. The lower layer responses are transferred to the last layer (trans-layer) to form a more complete representation retaining more information. In addition, some beneficial methods such as local contrast normalization and whitening are added to the proposed deep trans-layer networks to further boost performance. The trans-layer representations are followed by block histograms with binary encoder schema to learn translation and rotation invariant representations, which are utilized to do high-level tasks such as recognition and classification. Compared to traditional deep learning methods, the implemented feature learning method has much less parameters and is validated in several typical experiments, such as digit recognition on MNIST and MNIST variations, object recognition on Caltech 101 dataset and face verification on LFW dataset. The deep trans-layer unsupervised learning achieves 99.45% accuracy on MNIST dataset, 67.11% accuracy on 15 samples per class and 75.98% accuracy on 30 samples per class on Caltech 101 dataset, 87.10% on LFW dataset.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1509.08038", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2270076411", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["130535382", "206590483", "1658773", "10546515", "2156851", "195908774", "2714905", "11575226", "90113", "12008458", "3116168", "14805281", "14542261", "6949717", "10600578", "8141422", "14884315", "18118994", "1302462", "9893011", "6353329", "7782960", "5785086", "4525490", "1502583", "11257247"], "inbound_citations": ["234193"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7984403"}

In this paper, we propose a newly-designed multitask learning network (FullLVNet), which is constituted by a deep convolution neural network (CNN) for expressive feature embedding of cardiac structure; two followed parallel recurrent neural network (RNN) modules for temporal dynamic modeling; and four linear models for the final estimation.

Experiments on MR sequences of 145 subjects show that FullLVNet achieves high accurate prediction with our intra- and inter-task relatedness, leading to MAE of 190 mm\\(^2\\), 1.41 mm, 2.68 mm for average areas, RWT, dimensions and error rate of 10.4% for the phase classification.

Neglect dyslexia patients make many errors when naming isolated words, whereas they perform nearly normally when required to make a lexical decision judgment. This behavior has been interpreted in terms of a dual route model where a preserved lexical route is used to perform the lexical decision task, and an impaired non-lexical phonological route is used for naming. We trained a connectionist model to read single words and then lesioned it in order to simulate neglect dyslexia. We show that the damage to the model contributes to the same naming/lexical decision dissociation in a model with a single route for reading. Introduction Neglect dyslexia is a reading impairment usually associated with right brain damage and unilateral visuospatial neglect. Patients with neglect dyslexia may fail to read verbal material on the left side of an open book, or the beginning words of a line of text, or more often the beginning letters of a single word (Bisiach & Vallar, 1988; Hillis & Caramazza, Neglect dyslexia has been traditionally described according to a general framework of word representation proposed by Caramazza and Hillis (1990). In this model the process of word recognition has been hypothesized to be hierarchically organized through three stages (referred to as retinocentric , stimulus-centered and word-centered ), and neglect dyslexia has been shown to arise independently at each of these levels with different patterns of reading errors. With reference to the retinocentric level of representation, neglect dyslexia has been interpreted as an impairment of selective attention to the visual hemifield contralateral to the lesion in reference to a spatial coordinate system centred on the eye fixation point. Damage at this level results in the classic failure to correctly report the initial letters of a centrally presented word. In the last few years a mounting body of evidence has suggested that partial information from the contralesional side is accessible at many levels of processing in these patients. Vallar, Guariglia, Nico, & Tabossi (1996) documented a patient with severe neglect dyslexia who was impaired when asked to read aloud compound words such as girasole (sunflower), made up of two words: gira (turn) and sole (sun), but was able to produce appropriate associations to the compound as a whole (e.g. rose). This relative sparing of the associative task suggests that information from the neglected side of the space is still accessible to the lexical processing system to some degree. Relatedly, some patients with mild neglect dyslexia impairments make less errors in reading words than nonwords (Ladavas, Shallice, & Zanella, 1997a). This lexical effect also suggests that the lexical representation of a word might be partially accessed. Further evidence for preserved processing of some aspect of lexical processing from the contralesional portion of the word comes from a series of investigations by Ladavas, Umilta\u2019 and Mapelli (1997b). The authors found that Italian patients who could not read words or nonwords aloud were nevertheless able to perform correctly on a lexical decision task and a semantic categorization task (living-nonliving) 1 . This dissociation was found for the same stimuli. Furthermore, Arduino, Burani and Vallar (2003) showed that, for neglect patients, lexical decision was influenced by the same morpho-lexical variables that influence lexical decision in control participants. The authors asked 6 Italian neglect dyslexic patients to perform a reading task on a list of words and nonwords and then tested them on the same stimuli on a lexical decision task. Patients made fewer errors in lexical decision for a written stimulus than in reading the word aloud. Arduino et al. (2003) also showed that lexical decision was influenced by the frequency of the word (high frequency words more likely to be accepted as lexical entries than low frequency words) and by the presence of a high frequency neighbor for the nonwords (a nonword with a high frequency neighbor was less likely to be rejected). Neglect dyslexia therefore provides insight into the interaction and relative sparing of levels of lexical processing in the brain. In the next section we review models of reading that have been posited to account for the fine-grained behavioral data in neglect dyslexics. Neglect dyslexia and the Reading System The dissociation between reading and lexical decision has been interpreted by Ladavas et al. (1997a, 1997b) in terms of an interaction between the attentional system and the two main routes proposed by the dual route model of reading (Coltheart, 1978; Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001). According to this theory, there are two different procedures for producing a phonological code and Patient data comes from untimed responses. Performance under such circumstances is almost 100% correct for reading and lexical decision in matched controls.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2624058345", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149171116"}

Promising conversion results have been demonstrated recently using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). However, the performance is generally only tested on images from one MR scanner, which neglects the potential of neural networks to find general high-level abstract features. In this study, we explored the generalizability of the generator models, trained on a single field strength scanner, to data acquired with higher field strengths. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: T2-weighted 0.35T MRIs and CTs from 51 patients treated for prostate (40) and cervical cancer (11) were included. 25 of them were used to train four different generators (SE-ResNet, DenseNet, U-Net, and Embedded Net). Further, an ensemble model was created from the four network outputs. The models were validated on 16 patients from a 0.35T MR scanner. Further, the trained models were tested on the Gold Atlas dataset, containing T2-weighted MR scans of different field strengths; 1,5T(7) and 3T(12), and 10 patients from the 0.35T scanner. The sCTs were dosimetrically compared using clinical VMAT plans for all test patients. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: For the same scanner (0.35T), the results from the different models were comparable on the test set, with only minor differences in the MAE (35-51HU body). Similar results were obtained for conversions of 3T GE Signa and the 3T GE Discovery images (40-62HU MAE) for three of the models. However, larger differences were observed for the 1.5T images (48-65HU MAE). The overall best model was found to be the ensemble model. All dose differences were below 1%. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: This study shows that it is possible to generalize models trained on images of one scanner to other scanners and different field strengths.

As one potential candidate among different alternative \"green energy\" solutions forsustainable development, the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) has been received extensiveresearch attention since many years for energy and transportation applications. The PEMFC stacks, can produceelectricity directly from electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen in the air, with the only by-productsof water and heat. If the hydrogen is produced from renewable energy sources, this energy conversion is 100% ecofriendly.However, the relatively short lifespan of PEMFCs operating under non-steady-state conditions (for vehicles forexample) impedes its massive use. The accurate prediction of their aging mechanisms can thus help to designproper maintenance patterns of PEMFCs by providing foreseeable performance degradation information. In addition,the prediction could also help to avoid or mitigate the unwanted degradation of PEMFC systems during operation.This thesis proposes a novel data driven approach to predict the performance degradation of the PEMFC using animproved relevance vector machine method.Firstly, the theoretical description of the PEMFC during operation will be presented followed by an extensivelydetailed illustration on impacts of operational conditions on PEMFC performance, along with the degradationmechanisms on each component of PEMFC. Moreover, different approaches of PEMFC performance prediction inthe literature will also be briefly introduced.Further, a performance prediction method using an improved Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) would be proposedand demonstrated. The prediction results based on different training zones from historical data will also bediscussed and compared with the prediction results using conventional Support Vector Machine (SVM).Moreover, a self-adaptive kernel RVM prediction method will be introduced.

However, this kind of countermeasure for the ELM or incremental learning is seldom reported. This paper considers the situation that a trained SLFN suffers from the coexistence of node fault and node noise. We develop two fault tolerant incremental ELM algorithms for the regression problem, namely node fault tolerant incremental ELM (NFTI-ELM) and node fault tolerant convex incremental ELM (NFTCI-ELM). The NFTI-ELM determines the output weight of the newly inserted node only. We prove that in terms of the training set mean squared error (MSE) of faulty SLFNs, the NFTI-ELM converges. Our numerical results show that the NFTI-ELM is superior to the conventional ELM and incremental ELM algorithms under faulty situations. To further improve the performance, we propose the NFTCI-ELM algorithm. It not only determines the output weight of the newly inserted node, but also updates all previously trained output weights.

Therefore, alternative options are needed to be developed to mitigate the dangers associated with crop failure due to prevalence of disease and changing weather conditions that causes drought and loss of fertility in arable lands. Furthermore, It is also important to identify commercialisation potential of underutilised crops apart from biophysical and land qualities. The economic and demographic characteristics of an area which is conducive for normal commercial crops can be used to benchmark commercialisation potentials for underutilised crops. Hence, this project aims to assess the commercialisation possibility of underutilised crops on a large scale for under-developed areas with currently no possibility of growing commercial crops probably due to climate, soil characteristics. Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was implemented in conjunction with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and associated fitness functions to generate training data from approximate models which was developed for normal cash crops. The results showed that accurate classifications are obtainable even when the training is done with data from approximate and artificially generated data through implementation of a Genetic algorithm which includes constraints that reflect physical conditions found in rural villages. The simulation results showed that SVM is capable of acting as a filter for the inaccuracy in training data which is inherently present in the approximate models, thus allowing for better classification to be done on training data.

MalClassifier allows identifying the malware family behind detected malicious network activity without requiring access to the infected host or malicious executable reducing overall response time. MalClassifier abstracts the malware families' network flow sequence order and semantics behaviour as an n-flow. By mining and extracting the distinctive n-flows for each malware family, it automatically generates network flow sequence behaviour profiles. These profiles are used as features to build supervised machine learning classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbour and Random Forest) for malware family classification. We compute the degree of similarity between a flow sequence and the extracted profiles using a novel fuzzy similarity measure that computes the similarity between flows attributes and the similarity between the order of the flow sequences. For classifier performance evaluation, we use network traffic datasets of ransomware and botnets obtaining 96% F-measure for family classification. MalClassifier is resilient to malware evasion through flow sequence manipulation, maintaining the classifier's high accuracy.

A number of adversarial learning methods have been proposed to learn the reward function together with the dialog policy. However, to alternatively update the dialog policy and the reward model on the fly, the algorithms to update the dialog policy are limited to policy gradient-based algorithms, such as REINFORCE and PPO. Besides, the alternative training of the dialog agent and the reward model can easily get stuck in local optimum or result in mode collapse. In this work, we propose to decompose the previous adversarial training into two different steps. We first train the discriminator with an auxiliary dialog generator and then incorporate this trained reward model to a common reinforcement learning method to train a high-quality dialog agent. This approach is applicable to both on-policy and off-policy reinforcement learning methods.

To overcome mode collapse problem and preserve more details for the crack signals, labels of the signals are introduced into the network and Mean Squared Error (MSE) is also added to the generator loss as a regularization. The proposed method is testified in two experiments: Gaussian noise elimination and mechanical noise elimination. The mechanical noise is acquired in actual railway environment. Through the training process of enhancing crack signals submerged by noise, an optimal parametrization for the network was first selected. The trained generator could be seen as an AutoEncoder and automatically obtain the filter architecture for certain noises. The eventual results demonstrated that the improved LSGANs could preserve more details of the crack signals than traditional denoizing method after noise elimination and has a significant robustness.

MHC Class II epitopes are short peptides with length between 9 and 25 amino acids which are bound by MHC. These epitopes are recognized by T-Cell Receptors and leads to activation of cellular and humoral immune system and, ultimately, to ef- fective destruction of pathogenic organism. Successful prediction of MHC class II epitopes is more difficult than MHC class I epitopes due to open binding groove at both ends in class II molecules, this structure leads to variable length for MHC II epitopes and complicating the task for detecting the core binding 9-mer. Large efforts have been exerted in devel- oping algorithms to predict which peptides will bind to a given MHC class II molecules. In this paper we presented a novel classification algorithm for predicting MHC Class II epitopes using Multiple Instance Learning technique. Separated Con- structive Clustering Ensemble (SCCE) is our new version for Constructive Clustering Ensemble (CCE)(27). This method was used for converting multiple instance learning problem into normal Single Instance Problem. Most of the processing in this method lies mainly in vector preparation step before using classifier; Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been used as a method with proven performance in a wide range of practical applications(38). SCCE integrated many algorithms like Genetic Algorithm, K medoid clustering, Ensemble learning and Support vector machine in an orchestration to predict the MHC II epitopes. SCCE was tested over three benchmark data sets and proved to be very competitive with the state of art regression methods. SCCE achieved these results using only binder and non binder flags; without need for regression data.

We compare two approaches to global sensitivity analysis to rank the relative importance of the model parameters in determining the presence and magnitude of alternative stable states, and find that the two most influential parameters are the death rate of coral and the rate of maturation of algae out of the vulnerable stage. The Random Forest approach for global sensitivity analysis, recently adopted by ecologists, provides a more efficient method for ranking the relative importance of parameters than a variance-based approach that has been used frequently by computer scientists and engineers.

However, these digital computers have already begun to reach certain physical limits of their implementation via silicon microelectronics technology (dissipation, speed, integration limits, energy consumption). Alternative approaches, more powerful, more efficient and with less consume of energy, have constituted a major scientific issue for several years. Many of these approaches naturally attempt to get inspiration for the human brain, whose operating principles are still far from being understood. In this line of research, a surprising variation of recurrent neural network (RNN), simpler, and also even sometimes more efficient for features or processing cases, has appeared in the early 2000s, now known as Reservoir Computing (RC), which is currently emerging new brain-inspired computational paradigm. Its structure is quite similar to the classical RNN computing concepts, exhibiting generally three parts: an input layer to inject the information into a nonlinear dynamical system (Write-In), a second layer where the input information is projected in a space of high dimension called dynamical reservoir and an output layer from which the processed information is extracted through a so-called Read-Out function. In RC approach the learning procedure is performed in the output layer only, while the input and reservoir layer are randomly fixed, being the main originality of RC compared to the RNN methods. This feature allows to get more efficiency, rapidity and a learning convergence, as well as to provide an experimental implementation solution. This PhD thesis is dedicated to one of the first photonic RC implementation using telecommunication devices. Our experimental implementation is based on a nonlinear delayed dynamical system, which relies on an electro-optic (EO) oscillator with a differential phase modulation. This EO oscillator was extensively studied in the context of the optical chaos cryptography. Dynamics exhibited by such systems are indeed known to develop complex behaviors in an infinite dimensional phase space, and analogies with space-time dynamics (as neural network ones are a kind of) are also found in the literature. Such peculiarities of delay systems supported the idea of replacing the traditional RNN (usually difficult to design technologically) by a nonlinear EO delay architecture. In order to evaluate the computational power of our RC approach, we implement two spoken digit recognition tests (classification tests) taken from a standard databases in artificial intelligence TI-46 and AURORA-2, obtaining results very close to state-of-the-art performances and establishing state-of-the-art in classification speed.

A comparison between four classifiers previously assessed - Adaboost, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) - and two proposed classifiers - Bayesian ANN (BANN), Relevance Vector Machine - was conducted using a database of 7,568 cases and two open source databases. The Random Forest (RF) achieved the highest average result and was proposed as a benchmark classifier. The proposal to use model certainty to introduce a third, unclassified, class was investigated using the BANN. An increase in the classification accuracy was demonstrated, however the proportion of cases in the unclassified class was too great to be of practical value. The information content of time series was explored using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The average performance of the HMM was comparable with the performance of the benchmark with a smaller distribution across validation folds, demonstrating that time-series information provides more stable estimates of class than stationary methods. Finally a method of system identification was implemented. Significant differences between feature trends and histograms in low pH (L 7.1) and healthy pH (\u2265 7.1) cases were observed. These features were used as classifier inputs, and achieved performance similar to existing feature sets.

Recent falls in sequencing costs have increased the demand for simple, efficient and accurate methods for rapid detection or diagnosis with proved applications in medicine, agriculture and forensic science. We describe a reference\u2010 and alignment\u2010free approach for predicting environments and host phenotypes from 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on k\u2010mer representations that benefits from a bootstrapping framework for investigating the sufficiency of shallow sub\u2010samples.

On the other hand, very often tasks faced by machine learning systems arrive sequentially, and therefore it is reasonable to ask whether a better approach can be taken than retraining such systems from scratch given newly available data. Indeed, by drawing analogy from human learning, a novel skill could be acquired more easily whenever the learner shares a relevant past experience. In response to this observation, the machine learning community has drawn its attention towards a form of learning known as transfer learning - learning a novel task by leveraging upon auxiliary information extracted from previous tasks. Tangible progress has been made in both theory and practice of transfer learning; however, many questions are still to be addressed. In this thesis we will focus on an efficient type of transfer learning, known as the Hypothesis Transfer Learning (HTL), where auxiliary information is retained in a form of previously induced hypotheses. This is in contrast to the large body of work where one transfers from the data associated with previously encountered tasks. In particular, we theoretically investigate conditions when HTL guarantees improved generalization on a novel task subject to the relevant auxiliary (source) hypotheses. We investigate HTL theoretically by considering three scenarios: HTL through regularized least squares with biased regularization, through convex empirical risk minimization, and through stochastic optimization, which also touches the theory of non-convex transfer learning problems. In addition, we demonstrate the benefits of HTL empirically, by proposing two algorithms tailored for real-life situations with application to visual learning problems - learning a new class in a multi-class classification setting by transferring from known classes, and an efficient greedy HTL algorithm for learning with large number of source hypotheses. From theoretical point of view this thesis consistently identifies the key quantitative characteristics of relatedness between novel and previous tasks, and explicitates them in generalization bounds.

Unfortunately, the discovery of synergistic combinations by purely experimental means is only feasible on small sets of drugs. In silico modeling methods can substantially widen this search by providing tools able to predict which of all possible combinations in a large compound library are synergistic. Here we investigate to which extent drug combination synergy can be predicted by exploiting the largest available dataset to date (NCI-ALMANAC, with over 290,000 synergy determinations). Each cell line is modeled using primarily two machine learning techniques, Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), on the datasets provided by NCI-ALMANAC. This large-scale predictive modeling study comprises more than 5000 pair-wise drug combinations, 60 cell lines, 4 types of models and 5 types of chemical features. The application of a powerful, yet uncommonly used, RF-specific technique for reliability prediction is also investigated. The evaluation of these models shows that it is possible to predict the synergy of unseen drug combinations with high accuracy (Pearson correlations between 0.43 and 0.86 depending on the considered cell line, with XGBoost providing slightly better predictions than RF). We have also found that restricting to the most reliable synergy predictions results in at least two-fold error decrease with respect to employing the best learning algorithm without any reliability estimation. Alkylating agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and topoisomerase inhibitors are the drugs whose synergy with other partner drugs are better predicted by the models. Despite its leading size, NCI-ALMANAC comprises an extremely small part of all conceivable combinations.

Multiple large scale phenotypic high-throughput screens against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) have generated dose response data, enabling the generation of machine learning models. These models also incorporated cytotoxicity data and were recently validated with a large external data set. A cheminformatics data-fusion approach followed by Bayesian machine learning, Support Vector Machine, or Recursive Partitioning model development (based on publicly available Mtb screening data) was used to compare individual data sets and subsequent combined models. A set of 1924 commercially available molecules with promising antitubercular activity (and lack of relative cytotoxicity to Vero cells) were used to evaluate the predictive nature of the models. We demonstrate that combining three data sets incorporating antitubercular and cytotoxicity data in Vero cells from our previous screens results in external validation receiver operator curve (ROC) of 0.83 (Bayesian or RP Forest). Models that do not have the highest 5-fold cross-validation ROC scores can outperform other models in a test set dependent manner. We demonstrate with predictions for a recently published set of Mtb leads from GlaxoSmithKline that no single machine learning model may be enough to identify compounds of interest. Data set fusion represents a further useful strategy for machine learning construction as illustrated with Mtb.

The processing mechanism can train the network protocol feature database precisely over the big data platform, which improves the efficiency of the network in terms of log anomaly detection. Moreover, we propose an ensemble prediction algorithm based on time series (EPABT) considering the characteristics of the statistical log analysis to predict abnormal features during the network traffic analysis. We then present a new asymmetric error cost (AEC) evaluation criterion to meet the characteristics of CPPS. The experimental results demonstrate that the EPABT provides an efficient tool for detecting the accuracy and reliability of abnormal situation prediction as compared with the several state-of-the-art algorithms.

TheKB is composed of the Rule Base (RB) constituted by theset of fuzzy rules, and of the Data Base (DB), containingthe membership functions of the fuzzy partitions associatedto the linguistic variables.

The hybrid modeling was based on the combination of three existing Artificial Intelligence techniques: Functional Networks, Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System, and Support Vector Machines, using six datasets by utilizing the functional approximation capabilities of Functional Networks, the ability of Type-2 Fuzzy Logic to handle uncertainties and the scalability and robustness of Support Vector Machines in handling small and high-dimensional data. The hybridization was done in a way that allows one technique to further improve on the output of the other. Various Artificial intelligence techniques have been used in the prediction of oil and gas reservoir properties but each technique have exhibited specific capabilities, demonstrated certain limitations and posed a number of challenges. They have proven clearly that no single technique is perfect in all situations; hence the need for hybrid models that will combine the best characteristics of each technique in a single package and in the process, increase the confidence in the prediction of various oil and gas reservoir properties. This will result in increased production of more crude oil and hydrocarbons to meet the increasing world\u2019s demand. The results showed that the hybrid models perform better with higher correlation coefficients than the individual techniques when used alone for the same sets of data. In terms of execution time, the hybrid models took less time for both training and testing than the Type-2 Fuzzy Logic, but more time than Functional Networks and Support Vector Machines. This could be the price to pay for having better and more robust models.

As it was shown recently, the magnitude of deterioration depends not only on the directly neighboring elements but on almost all elements and their specific configuration. Hence, to fully explain human visual perception, one needs to take large parts of the visual field into account and combine all the aspects of vision that become relevant at such scale.

MicroRNAs (miR) serve as key regulators of gene expression and are promising biomarkers of disease state. Hypothesis: MiR profiles obtained via next-generation sequencing can detect antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR). Methods: The Genomic Research Alliance for Transplantation (GRAfT) is a multicenter, prospective study that enrolls thoracic transplant recipients. Using a case-control study format, we selected cardiac transplant recipients with and without AMR or TCMR. The entire human miR transcriptome was sequenced from plasma. After quantile normalization, top miRs were selected based on a fold-change \u2265 \u00b12 and an uncorrected p Results: Plasma miR sequencing was performed on 19 patients: 8 - no rejection, 6 - AMR and 5 - TCMR. We identified 47 and 74 miRs that were differentially expressed between the subjects with no rejection and AMR or TCMR, respectively. Nine miRs were differentially expressed in the same direction in both AMR and TCMR (miR-1257, 1299, 4470, 4524b, 487a, 545, 548az, 6867, 7161, fold-change range -3.0 to 2.8). Random Forest analysis ranked miRs based on importance and identified a miR signature that separated the three groups (AMR, TCMR, and normal, Figure). The confusion matrix indicated a highly successful profile discrimination rate between the three groups with an error rate of 5.4%. Conclusion: Plasma miR profiles obtained via transcriptomic sequencing show strong discriminatory ability at detecting subtypes of rejection. We identified key miRs that may be implicated in the pathological pathways that underlie both AMR and TCMR.

Mechanistic clues can be revealed by applying labelling techniques such as immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridisation to brain tissue sections. Precision in both assigning anatomical location to the sections and quantifying labelled features is crucial for output validity, with either using a stereological approach or an image based feature extraction. However, both approaches are restricted by the need to manually delineate anatomical regions. To circumvent this limitation, we present the QUINT workflow for quantification and spatial analysis of labelling in series of rodent brain section images based on available 3D reference atlases. The workflow is semi-automated, combining three open source software that can be operated without scripting knowledge, making it accessible to most researchers. As an example, a brain region specific quantification of amyloid plaques across whole transgenic Tg2576 mouse brain series, immunohistochemically labelled for three amyloid related antigens is demonstrated. Firstly, the whole brain image series were registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas to produce customised atlas maps adapted to match the cutting plan and proportions of the sections (QuickNII software). Secondly, the labelling was segmented from the original images by the Random Forest Algorithm for supervised classification (ilastik software). Finally, the segmented images and atlas maps were used to generate plaque quantifications for each region in the reference atlas (Nutil software). The method yielded comparable results to manual delineations and to the output of a stereological method.

The reason is that small objects usually lack sufficient detailed appearance information, which can distinguish them from the backgrounds or similar objects. To deal with the small object detection problem, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end multi-task generative adversarial network (MTGAN), which is a general framework. In the MTGAN, the generator is a super-resolution network, which can up-sample small blurred images into fine-scale ones and recover detailed information for more accurate detection. The discriminator is a multi-task network, which describes each inputted image patch with a real/fake score, object category scores, and bounding box regression offsets.

A random forest approach is proposed for relating beta distributed outcomes to explanatory variables. The approach explicitly makes use of the likelihood function of the beta distribution for the selection of splits during the tree-building procedure. In each iteration of the tree-building algorithm one chooses the combination of explanatory variable and splitting rule that maximizes the log-likelihood function of the beta distribution with the parameter estimates derived from the nodes of the currently built tree.

Unfortunately, such data is highly unstructured and currently no techniques exist to automatically extract useful insights to inform policy decisions and help direct humanitarian efforts.

Knowledge about the subcellular localization of apoptotic protein is constructive in understanding the mechanism of programmed cell death, determining the functional characterization of the protein, screening candidates in drug design, and selecting protein for relevant studies. It is also proclaimed that the information required for determining the subcellular localization of protein resides in their corresponding amino acid sequence. In this work, a new biological feature, class pattern frequency of physiochemical descriptor, was effectively used in accordance with the amino acid composition, protein similarity measure, CTD (composition, translation, and distribution) of physiochemical descriptors, and sequence similarity to predict the subcellular localization of apoptosis protein. AdaBoost with the weak learner as Random-Forest was designed for the five modules and prediction is made based on the weighted voting system. Bench mark dataset of 317 apoptosis proteins were subjected to prediction by our system and the accuracy was found to be 100.0 and 92.4 %, and 90.1 % for self-consistency test, jack-knife test, and tenfold cross validation test respectively, which is 0.9 % higher than that of other existing methods. Beside this, the independent data (N151 and ZW98) set prediction resulted in the accuracy of 90.7 and 87.7 %, respectively.

Thus, its automation is desirable because it would hugely reduce the workload of the clinicians, while at the same time reduce the subjectivity in diagnosis. However there are still open issues like the amount of data required for training and testing algorithms, the computational load when dealing with high resolution images and, most of all, the large variability in the analyzed data (mainly due to different cell types, cell densities, stains, magnification levels, and so on).The segmentation of ROIs can be expressed as a Semantic Segmentation problem for which Deep Learning models are proven to be particular suitable.However building these models require an huge amount of annotated training data. To overcome this limitation, Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation have been proposed as possible solutions.In this thesis I show how Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation can be leveraged for Semantic Segmentation of histopathological images. To my knowledge, such approach represents a novelty not only in the biomedical field, but also in many other fields of computer vision.In this thesis the UNet convolutional-deconvolutional neural network is implemented in Keras (Tensoflow/Theano backend) and trained using the Camelyon16 Dataset (H&E breast cancer Whole-Slide Images). Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) are first preprocessed (tissue regions segmented from fatty and white background areas and then stain-normalized) and then fed as tiles to the CNN. The outputs are probability maps, whose pixel intensity values express the probability of being part of a cancer metastasis. In a second phase, a fine-tuning of the pre-trained UNet is performed on the GlaS (H&E glands images) and ISBI12 (Drosophila first instar larva ventral nerve cord ssTEM) datasets in order to understand if the trained model can be used for segment completely other types of images for which the available datasets are not sufficient. Fine Tuning was aided by a Data Augmentation pre-processing. Results are very promising and, to my knowledge, this work represents a novelty in the computer vision field.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2914137323", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86803522"}

There are two parts to this framework, viz. (1) Documents often have layout structure, such that logically coherent text is grouped together into fields using some mark-up language. We use a log-linear model, which associates one or more features with each field. Weights associated with the field features are learnt from training data and these weights quantify the per-class importance of the field features in determining the category for the document. (2) We employ a technique that exploits the parse tree of fields that are phrasal constructs, such as title and associates weights with words in these constructs while boosting weights of important words called focus words. These weights are learnt from example instances of phrasal constructs, marked with the corresponding focus words. The learning is accomplished by training a classifier that uses linguistic features obtained from the text's parse structure. The weighted words, in fields with phrasal constructs, are used in obtaining features for the corresponding fields in the overall framework. SSCAT was tested on the supervised categorization task of over one million products from Yahoo!'s on-line shopping data. With an accuracy of over 90%, our classifier outperforms Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.

In the radio-frequency (RF) DFL system, radio transmitters (RTs) and radio receivers (RXs) are used to sense the target collaboratively, and the location of the target can be estimated by fusing the changes of the received signal strength (RSS) measurements associated with the wireless links. In this paper, we will propose an extreme learning machine (ELM) approach for DFL, to improve the efficiency and the accuracy of the localization algorithm. Different from the conventional machine learning approaches for wireless localization, in which the above differential RSS measurements are trivially used as the only input features, we introduce the parameterized geometrical representation for an affected link, which consists of its geometrical intercepts and differential RSS measurement. Parameterized geometrical feature extraction (PGFE) is performed for the affected links and the features are used as the inputs of ELM. The proposed PGFE-ELM for DFL is trained in the offline phase and performed for real-time localization in the online phase, where the estimated location of the target is obtained through the created ELM. PGFE-ELM has the advantages that the affected links used by ELM in the online phase can be different from those used for training in the offline phase, and can be more robust to deal with the uncertain combination of the detectable wireless links. Experimental results show that the proposed PGFE-ELM can improve the localization accuracy and learning speed significantly compared with a number of the existing machine learning and DFL approaches, including the weighted K-nearest neighbor (WKNN), support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN), as well as the well-known radio tomographic imaging (RTI) DFL approach.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5424756", "pubmed_id": "28420187", "doi": "10.3390/s17040879", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2605919849", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["981528", "215213894", "3494790", "54075189", "207165124", "3217301", "10317399", "16485294", "18635345", "36864073", "8561842", "44819715", "116858", "15037168", "28334699", "45873946", "31489172", "54060070", "55292565", "11023093", "43930966", "16329533", "15972373", "5658890", "15890184", "15153987", "14215483", "9818116", "3443991", "3695381", "3674725", "12725155", "11992979", "541461", "700382", "15372324", "20974343", "2529228", "14114179", "13892102"], "inbound_citations": ["24554419", "52300531", "52269796", "3467929", "4778783", "49541780", "52932863", "54630240", "204831184", "208321455", "211690921", "3520224", "197455275", "102349409", "49657594", "207904276", "58666693", "155109158", "49322647", "106399612", "165120713"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3448473"}

When the class variable should increase according to a subset of explanatory variables, the problem must satisfy the monotonicity constraint. It is well known that standard classification tree algorithms, such as CART or C4.5, are not guaranteed to produce monotonic trees, even if the data set is completely monotone. Recently, some classifiers have been designed to handle these kinds of problems. In decision trees, growing and pruning mechanisms have been updated to improve the monotonicity of the trees. In this paper, we study the suitability of using these mechanisms in the generation of Random Forests. For this, we propose a simple ensemble pruning mechanism based on the degree of monotonicity of the resulting trees. The performance of several decision trees are evaluated through experimental studies on monotonic data sets. We deduce that the trees produced by the Random Forest also hold the monotonicity restriction but achieve a slightly better predictive performance than standard algorithms.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00354-015-0402-4", "venue": "New Generation Computing", "journal": "New Generation Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2293054526", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2959889", "16217041", "60993494", "829105", "12596492", "3187495", "207738357", "89141", "36669431", "23126988", "56542270", "28294173", "17064749", "7553535", "17257979", "7649812", "207679591", "21223007", "217893", "19155732", "14617242", "17714478", "11860436", "11138237", "1137749", "20676689", "1114321", "33515987", "11557714", "8358240", "477985", "37522698"], "inbound_citations": ["86712964", "47018516", "88521925", "209428648", "10095358", "13801437", "163156117", "126382906", "212415141", "21729440", "53111799", "8558281"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14119994"}

While some studies have shown that frequency has no effect when AoA is controlled for, more recent studies have found independent contributions of frequency and AoA. Connectionist models have repeatedly shown strong effects of frequency, but little attention has been paid to whether they can also show AoA effects. Indeed, several researchers have explicitly claimed that they cannot show AoA effects. In this work, we explore these claims using a simple feed forward neural network.

Handwriting features like slant, curvature, line separation, chain code, character shapes, and more, can be extracted from different methods. Therefore, the multi-feature sets are irrelevant and redundant. The conflict of the features exists in the sets, which affects the accuracy of classification and the computing cost. This paper proposes an approach, named kernel mutual information (KMI), that focuses on feature selection. The KMI approach can decrease redundancies and conflicts. In addition, it extracts an optimal subset of features from the writing samples produced by male and female writers. To ensure that KMI can apply the various features, this paper describes the handwriting segmentation and handwritten text recognition technology used. The classification is carried out using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on two databases. The first database comes from the ICDAR 2013 competition on gender prediction, which provides the samples in both Arabic and English. The other database contains the Registration-Document-Form (RDF) database in Chinese. The proposed and compared methods were evaluated on both databases.

In many of these problems, there exist inherent temporal and spacial dependencies between the output vectors, as well as repeating output patterns and input-output associations, that can provide more robust and accurate predictors when modelled properly. With this intrinsic motivation, we propose a novel Output-Associative Relevance Vector Machine (OA-RVM) regression framework that augments the traditional RVM regression by being able to learn non-linear input and output dependencies. Instead of depending solely on the input patterns, OA-RVM models output structure and covariances within a predefined temporal window, thus capturing past, current and future context. As a result, output patterns manifested in the training data are captured within a formal probabilistic framework, and subsequently used during inference. As a proof of concept, we target the highly challenging problem of dimensional and continuous prediction of emotions from naturalistic facial expressions. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed OA-RVM regression by performing both subject-dependent and subject-independent experiments using the SAL database.

Such learning machines are used in forecasting because of their robustness, efficiency, and sparseness. The MVRVM model was trained on solar wind and geomagnetic activity data sampled every hour with activity periods of various intensities, durations, and features. It was found that during the training phase, for a given error threshold, 14.60% of the training data was needed to explain the features of the data. The trained model was then tested on 177 different storm intervals, at various levels of geomagnetic activity, to generate simultaneous forecasts of the three indices at a lead time of one hour (1-h). The focus of the modeling was to assess the forecasts during main storm (MS) time periods when the indices show enhanced activity above quiet time values. The forecasts obtained by the MVRVM model reported in this paper returned a MS time average prediction efficiency, PE \u00af of 82.42%, 84.40%, and 76.00% and RMSE \u00af of 13.70 nT, 97.00 nT, and \u22120.77 mV/m, for the Dst , AL , and PC indices, respectively. The qualitative numbers indicated that the model underestimated the peak amplitude of the indices during the geomagnetic activity, but the peaks were forecasted on time by the model, on average.

Since many chemical processes often show nonlinear dynamics, techniques like extended Kalman filter (EKF) and nonlinear dynamic data reconciliation (NDDR) have been developed to improve the data quality. Recently, the recursive nonlinear dynamic data reconciliation (RNDDR) technique has been proposed, which combines the merits of EKF and NDDR techniques. However, the RNDDR technique cannot handle measurements with gross errors. In this paper, a support vector (SV) regression approach for recursive simultaneous data reconciliation and gross error detection in nonlinear dynamical systems is proposed. SV regression is a compromise between the empirical risk and the model complexity, and for data reconciliation it is robust to random and gross errors. By minimizing the regularized risk instead of the maximum likelihood in the RNDDR, our approach could achieve not only recursive nonlinear dynamic data reconciliation but also gross error detection simultaneously. The nonlinear dynamic system simulation results in this paper show that the proposed approach is robust, efficient, stable, and accurate for simultaneous data reconciliation and gross error detection in nonlinear dynamic systems within a recursive real-time estimation framework.

In reality, it is astonishing to see that humans can recognize any object at a single glance. Machines however, find it difficult to recognise objects since the object appearance may have variation due to photometric effects, clutter, occlusions or rotation. But, all these variations are instantaneously handled by human brains. In spite of the fact that the objects may vary depending on point of view or any changes in size or scale, humans can smoothly identify the object. This task is yet a major problem for machines. Hence, there is a need to develop a model which can efficiently and effectively recognize 3D objects. This paper proposes a 3D object recognition framework in order to solve the problem faced by computer vision systems. In the proposed model, key points are extracted using Intrinsic Shape Signature (ISS). The geometric information surrounding these points is determined by using Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) descriptor. The resulting feature matrix is the local feature of an object.

Data-driven procedures based on Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs) have produced remarkable results on energy disaggregation. Nevertheless, these procedures have various weaknesses; there is a scalability problem as the number of devices to observe rises, and the inference step is computationally heavy. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been demonstrated to be a viable solution to deal with FHMM shortcomings. Nonetheless, there are two significant limitations: A complicated and time-consuming training system based on back-propagation has to be employed to estimate the neural architecture parameters, and large amounts of training data covering as many operation conditions as possible need to be collected to attain top performances. In this work, we aim to overcome these limitations by leveraging upon the unique and useful characteristics of the extreme learning machine technique, which is based on a collection of randomly chosen hidden units and analytically defined output weights.

Initial stage of cascade, simple rule based classification techniques and later part of the cascade, a more complex algorithm which is a combination of Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classification techniques are utilized to separate pedestrian from non-pedestrian objects.

While area under forest cover can provide useful information regarding discrete changes in forest cover, it does not provide any insight on subtle changes within the broad vegetation class, e.g. forest degradation. Continental or national-level studies, mostly utilizing coarse-scale satellite data, are likely to fail in capturing these changes due to the fine spatial and long temporal characteristics of forest degradation. Yet, these long-term changes affect forest structure, composition and function, thus ultimately limiting successful implementation of SDG targets. Using a multi-scale, satellite-based monitoring approach, our goal is to provide an easy-to-implement reporting framework for South Asian forest ecosystems. We systematically analyze freely available remote sensing assets on Google Earth Engine for monitoring degradation and evaluate the potential of multiple satellite data with different spatial resolutions for reporting forest degradation. Taking a broad-brush approach in step 1, we calculate vegetation trends in six south Asian countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during 2000\u20132016. We also calculate rainfall trends in these countries using the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) rainfall data, and further calculate Rain-Use Efficiency (RUE) that shows vegetation trends in the context of rainfall variability. In step 2, we focus on two protected area test cases from India and Sri Lanka for evaluating the potential of finer-resolution satellite data compared to MODIS, i.e. Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data, for capturing forest degradation signals, which will ultimately contribute towards SDG indicators 15.1.1 and 15.1.2. We find that most countries show a fluctuating trend in vegetation condition over the years, along with localized greening and browning. The Random Forest (RF) classifier utilized in step 2 was able to generate accurate maps (87% and 91% overall accuracy for Indian and Sri Lankan test cases, respectively) of non-intact forest within the protected areas. We find that almost one-third of the Indian test case is degraded forest, even though it shows overall greening as per the broad-brush approach. This finding corroborates our argument that utilizing higher-resolution satellite data (e.g. 10-m) than those normally used for national-level studies will be crucial for reporting SDG indicator 15.2.1: \u201cprogress towards sustainable forest management\u201d.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2019.111592", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2995201670", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211830287"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214079941"}

AdaBoost, short for \"Adaptive Boosting\", is the most well-known boosting algorithm. AdaBoost has many strengths. Among them, there is sufficient empirical evidence pointing to its performance being generally superior to that of individual classifiers. In addition, even when combining a large number of weak learners, AdaBoost can be very robust to overfitting usually with lower generalization error than other competing ensemble methodologies, such as bagging and random forests. However, AdaBoost, as most hard margin classifiers, tends to be sensitive to outliers and noisy data, since it assigns observations that have been misclassified a higher weight in subsequent iterations. It has recently been proven that for any booster with a potential convex loss function, and any nonzero random classification noise rate, there is a data set, which can be efficiently learnable by the booster if there is no noise, but cannot be learned with accuracy better than 1/2 with random classification noise present. Several techniques to identify and potentially delete (peel) noisy samples in binary classification are proposed in order to improve the performance of AdaBoost.

Enabling robots to recognise different materials (concrete, metal etc.) in a scene is important for many tasks, e.g. robotic interventions in nuclear decommissioning. Previous work on 3D semantic reconstruction has predominantly focused on recognition of everyday domestic objects (tables, chairs etc.), whereas previous work on material recognition has largely been confined to single 2D images without any 3D reconstruction. Meanwhile, most 3D semantic reconstruction methods rely on computationally expensive post-processing, using Fully-Connected Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), to achieve consistent segmentations. In contrast, we propose a deep learning method which performs 3D reconstruction while simultaneously recognising different types of materials and labeling them at the pixel level. Unlike previous methods, we propose a fully end-to-end approach, which does not require hand-crafted features or CRF post-processing. Instead, we use only learned features, and the CRF segmentation constraints are incorporated inside the fully end-to-end learned system. We present the results of experiments, in which we trained our system to perform real-time 3D semantic reconstruction for 23 different materials in a real-world application. The run-time performance of the system can be boosted to around 10Hz, using a conventional GPU, which is enough to achieve realtime semantic reconstruction using a 30fps RGB-D camera.

Moreover, experiments with reduced data were conducted to evaluate whether the conclusions from combining scaling methods with SVR could be generalised.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-96944-2_8", "venue": "Contributions to Statistics", "journal": "Contributions to Statistics", "mag_id": "2894901512", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:70345884"}

Data reduction using Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) or independent component analysis (ICA) was followed by k-means clustering or agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) for unsupervised learning to assess tumor grade and for tissue type segmentation of MRSI data. ::: ::: ::: ::: Results ::: ::: An accuracy of 93% in classification of glioma grade II and grade IV, with 100% accuracy in distinguishing tumor and normal spectra, was obtained by LE with unsupervised clustering, but not with the combination of k-means and ICA. With 1H MRSI data, LE provided a more linear distribution of data for cluster analysis and better cluster stability than ICA. LE combined with k-means or AHC provided 91% accuracy for classifying tumor grade and 100% accuracy for identifying normal tissue voxels. Color-coded visualization of normal brain, tumor core, and infiltration regions was achieved with LE combined with AHC. ::: ::: ::: ::: Conclusion ::: ::: The LE method is promising for unsupervised clustering to separate brain and tumor tissue with automated color-coding for visualization of 1H MRSI data after cluster analysis.

This has led to an increase in the number of people living with progressive neurodegenerative disorders like dementia. Consequently, the strain this is places on health and social care services means providing 24-hour monitoring is not sustainable. Technological intervention is being considered, however no solution exists to non-intrusively monitor the independent living needs of patients with dementia. As a result many patients hit crisis point before intervention and support is provided. In parallel, patient care relies on feedback from informal carers about significant behavioural changes. Yet, not all people have a social support network and early intervention in dementia care is often missed. The smart meter rollout has the potential to change this. Using machine learning and signal processing techniques, a home energy supply can be disaggregated to detect which home appliances are turned on and off. This will allow Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) to be assessed, such as eating and drinking, and observed changes in routine to be detected for early intervention. The primary aim is to help reduce deterioration and enable patients to stay in their homes for longer. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Decision Forest classifier are modelled using data from three test homes. The trained models are then used to monitor two patients with dementia during a six-month clinical trial undertaken in partnership with Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust. In the case of load disaggregation for appliance detection, the SVM achieved (AUC=0.86074, Sen=0.756 and Spec=0.92838). While the Decision Forest achieved (AUC=0.9429, Sen=0.9634 and Spec=0.9634).

However, the ability to distinguish adults with MDD from healthy individuals using resting-state EEG features has reached a bottleneck. To address this limitation, we collected EEG data as participants engaged with positive pictures from the International Affective Picture System. Because MDD is associated with blunted positive emotions, we reasoned that this approach would yield highly dissimilar EEG features in healthy versus depressed adults. We extracted three types of relative EEG power features from different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) during the emotion task and resting state. We also applied a novel classifier, called a conformal kernel support vector machine (CK-SVM), to try to improve the generalization performance of conventional SVMs. We then compared CK-SVM performance with three machine learning classifiers: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), conventional SVM, and quadratic discriminant analysis. The results from the initial analyses using the LDA classifier on 55 participants (24 MDD, 31 healthy controls) showed that the participant-independent classification accuracy obtained by leave-one-participant-out cross-validation (LOPO-CV) was higher for the EEG recorded during the positive emotion induction versus the resting state for all types of relative EEG power. Furthermore, the CK-SVM classifier achieved higher LOPO-CV accuracy than the other classifiers. The best accuracy (83.64%; sensitivity = 87.50%, specificity = 80.65%) was achieved by the CK-SVM, using seven relative power features extracted from seven electrodes. Overall, combining positive emotion induction with the CK-SVM classifier proved useful for detecting MDD on the basis of EEG signals. In the future, this approach might be used to develop a brain\u2013computer interface system to assist with the detection of MDD in the clinic.

The aim of this article was to explore the LULC dynamics in the HSCZ to assess where LULC changes are expected to occur under two different business-as-usual (BAU) assumptions. Two scenarios have been assumed in the present study. The first scenario, addresses the BAU assumption to show what would happen if the past trend in 1993\u20131998\u20132003 has continued until 2023 under continuing the United Nations (UN) sanctions against Iraq and particularly Kurdistan region, which extended from 1990 to 2003.

Future land use changes are simulated to the year 2023 using a Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov chain model under two different scenarios (Iraq under siege and Iraq after siege). Four LULC classes were classified from Landsat using Random Forest (RF). Their accuracy was evaluated using \u03ba and overall accuracy. The CA-Markov chain method in TerrSet is applied based on the past trends of the land use changes from 1993 to 1998 for the first scenario and from 2003 to 2008 for the second scenario. Based on this model, predicted land use maps for the 2023 are generated. Changes between two BAU scenarios under two different conditions have been quantitatively as well as spatially analysed.

This paper proposes a combinatorial selection of machine learning algorithms and their settings to define the most performing among several optimal results. The ranking problem is solved by using the Plackett\u2013Luce (PL) model-based strategy. The final aim is to obtain the damage indicator as indifferent as possible to harmless environmental and operational variations but still sensitive to structural changes, suitable to investigate the dynamic response of a structure.

Wind speed prediction is usually one of the most important tasks in wind farming, and companies that manage these farms invest large amounts of money to improve their prediction systems. In this paper, we propose an improvement to an existing wind speed prediction system, using banks of regression Support Vector Machines (SVMr) for a final regression step in the system. Several novel SVMr structures are proposed in this paper to manage the diversity in input data arising from the use of different global forecasting models and several parameterizations of a mesoscale model, included in the basic version of the prediction system. We show that the system implementing SVMr banks outperforms the basic system without taking into account diversity in the input data. It also performs better than a similar system using banks of multi-layer perceptrons. All the tests are carried out using real data from several wind turbines on a wind farm in southeast Spain.

So during the process operations, the estimated and the smoothed actual outputs are compared, and residual/error signals are generated that is used by the classifier to detect and diagnose the process possible faults. The method is applied to a benchmark case study, showing a high enhancement in such PCTs due to the introduction of the process dynamics information to these PCTs via the MDKs, and by smoothing the noise and imputing the missing measurements using the static kriging.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compchemeng.2017.03.016", "venue": "Computers & Chemical Engineering", "journal": "Computers & Chemical Engineering", "mag_id": "2598694793", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206924185"}

We first over-segmented brain images into superpixels and then extracted statistical and textural features to capture characteristics of superpixels. To overcome the shortage of annotated data, an uncertainty-based active learning strategy was designed to adaptively and iteratively select the most informative unlabeled data to be annotated for training a Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM).

Next, the obtained outlines are expressed as truncated Elliptical Fourier Series (EFS) expansions, whose coefficients are utilized as discriminatory features and processed by an ensemble of SVM classifiers. In order to experimentally illustrate the merit of the proposed scheme, this work reports classification results on a 3-class target recognition problem using SAR intensity imagery from the well-known Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset. The novel approach was compared to selected methods mentioned in the literature in terms of classification accuracy.

Firstly, a Weakly Supervised Metric Learning(WSML) framework is proposed, which combines the clustering and manifold constraints simultaneously. Secondly, the general framework is applied to signer adaptation and achieves good performance. Thirdly, a fragment based feature is designed for sign language representation and the effectiveness is verified in large vocabulary datasets. Our proposed WSML framework can be decomposed into two key steps. The first one is to learn a generic metric from the given labeled data. Then the second step is to realize the distance metric adaptation by considering the clustering and manifold constraints with the unlabeled data. To learn a generic distance metric, the labeled data are used under clustering assumption with classical large margin hinge loss. Specifically, the distances between data points within the same cluster(with same label) should be minimized and the distances between data points from different clusters(with different labels) should be maximized.

Significant associations between marker staining and tumor pathology (DTC versus benign) were determined using contingency table and Mann-Whitney U (MU) tests.

The number and size of the storage roots are two potential phenotypic traits reflecting crop yield and quality. Counting and measuring the size of cassava storage roots are usually done manually, or semi-automatically by first segmenting cassava root images. However, occlusion of both storage and fibrous roots makes the process both time-consuming and error-prone. ::: ::: While Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) have shown performance above the state-of-the art in many image processing and analysis tasks, there are currently a limited number of CNN-based methods for counting plant features. This is due to the limited availability of data, annotated by expert plant biologists, which represents all possible measurement outcomes. Existing works in this area either learn a direct image-to-count regressor model by regressing to a count value, or perform a count after segmenting the image. We, however, address the problem using a direct image-to-count prediction model. This is made possible by generating synthetic images, using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), to provide training data for missing classes. We automatically form cassava storage root masks for any missing classes using existing ground-truth masks, and input them as a condition to our GAN model to generate synthetic root images. We combine the resulting synthetic images with real images to learn a direct image-to-count prediction model capable of counting the number of storage roots in real cassava images taken from a low cost aeroponic growth system}. These models are used to develop a system that counts cassava storage roots in real images. Our system first predicts age group ('young' and 'old' roots; pertinent to our image capture regime) in a given image, and then, based on this prediction, selects an appropriate model to predict the number of storage roots.

The motive to build code smell prediction model is to propose a model with less false positive code smells. Also, the proposed model is cross validated using 10-fold cross validation Methods/Statistical Analysis: To build a smell prediction model, two code smell detection tools are used i.e. IPlasma and PMD. The metrics are extracted using understand and IPlasma. To achieve the above mentioned objective, two experiments are performed. One is using the code smells of the PMD and the other one is using the smells of the IPLasma. The smells of the PMD are associated with the metrics that are extracted using Understand. Then, the model is trained using the different supervised learning algorithms that are called classifiers i.e. Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Kstar. Findings: In this research work, two experiments are performed. One is using the code smells of the PMD and other one is using the code smells of the IPlasma. From the results obtained i.e. with the code smells of the PMD, it is concluded that Random Forest predicts small number of false positive and false negative code smells as the precision and Recall of the Random Forest in each dataset is larger than the other two classifier\u2019s. Moreover, the ROC value of Random Forest is higher in some datasets and in some datasets the ROC value of KStar is higher. The results obtained i.e. with the code smells of the IPlasma, it is concluded that again Random Forest predict code smells more correctly than the other two classifiers and give less number of false positive and false negative code smells. Moreover, there is an exception, there is one dataset in which Random Forest and KStar both shows 100% accuracy i.e., Precison and Recall both are equal to 1, which shows that both classifiers predicts no false positive and false negative code smells. Moreover, the ROC value of Random Forest is higher than the other two classifiers, even in some datasets it is equals to 1. Using this it is concluded that Random Forest gives the best code smell predicting model. Application/Improvements: The results of this experiments shows only one case where the false positive and false negative code smells are not predicted by the models. This can improve such that on apply each and every dataset it gives zero false positive code smells.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.17485/ijst/2017/v10i24/115002", "venue": null, "journal": "Indian journal of science and technology", "mag_id": "2733474585", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64886496"}

Recent techniques have attempted to investigate the capabilities of deep learning approaches to tackle the hyperspectral image classification. This work shows how to further improve the hyperspectral image classification through using both a deep representation and contextual information. To implement this objective, this work proposes a new Conditional Random Field (CRF) model (named DBN-CRF) with the potentials defined over the deep features produced by a Deep Belief Network (DBN). The newly formulated DBN-CRF model takes advantage of the strength of DBNs in learning a good representation and the ability of CRFs to model contextual (spatial) information in both the observations and labels. Within a piecewise training framework, an efficient training method is proposed to train the whole DBN-CRF model end-to-end. This means that the parameters in DBN and CRF can be jointly trained and thus the proposed method can fully use the strength of both DBN and CRF. Moreover, in the proposed training method, the end-to-end training can be implemented with a standard back-propagation algorithm, avoiding the repeated inference usually involved in CRF training and thus is computationally efficient.

Besides, the general dull response problem is even worsened when the model is confronted with meaningless response training instances.

Therefore, the development and application of sensing technologies and data analysis using machine learning approaches to enable the automatic detection of cracks have become very important. The purpose of this research is to develop a robust method for automatic condition assessment of real-life concrete structures for the detection of relatively small cracks at early stages. A damage identification approach is proposed using the parametric modeling and machine learning approaches to analyze the sensors data. The data obtained from transducers mounted on concrete beams under static loading in laboratory. These data are used as the input parameters. The method relies only on the measured time responses. After filtering and normalization of the data, Autoregressive all-pole model parameters (Yule-Walker method) are considered as features and used as the inputs of a newly developed Self-Advising Support Vector Machine (SA-SVM) for the classification purpose in civil Engineering area.

Remote monitoring systems are well-suited to managing patients suffering from CHF, and can reduce deaths and re-hospitalizations, as shown by the literature, including multiple systematic reviews. The monitoring system proposed in this paper aims at helping CHF stakeholders make appropriate decisions in managing the disease and preventing cardiac events, such as decompensation, which can lead to hospitalization or death. Monitoring activities are stratified into three layers: scheduled visits to a hospital following up on a cardiac event, home monitoring visits by nurses, and patient's self-monitoring performed at home using specialized equipment. Appropriate hardware, desktop and mobile software applications were developed to enable a patient's monitoring by all stakeholders. For the first two layers, we designed and implemented a Decision Support System (DSS) using machine learning (Random Forest algorithm) to predict the number of decompensations per year and to assess the heart failure severity based on a variety of clinical data. For the third layer, custom-designed sensors (the Blue Scale system) for electrocardiogram (EKG), pulse transit times, bio-impedance and weight allowed frequent collection of CHF-related data in the comfort of the patient's home. We also performed a short-term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis on electrocardiograms self-acquired by 15 healthy volunteers and compared the obtained parameters with those of 15 CHF patients from PhysioNet's PhysioBank archives. We report numerical performances of the DSS, calculated as multiclass accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in a 10-fold cross-validation. The obtained average accuracies are: 71.9% in predicting the number of decompensations and 81.3% in severity assessment. The most serious class in severity assessment is detected with good sensitivity and specificity (0.87 / 0.95), while, in predicting decompensation, high specificity combined with good sensitivity prevents false alarms. The HRV parameters extracted from the self-measured EKG using the Blue Scale system of sensors are comparable with those reported in the literature about healthy people. The performance of DSSs trained with new patients confirmed the results of previous work, and emphasizes the strong correlation between some CHF markers, such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and ejection fraction (EF), with the outputs of interest.

Also, face feature representation often requires several dimensions, which poses additional challenges for face recognition. In this thesis is proposed a novel face recognition method with the objective of to be robust to many issues which can affect the face features in practice and it is based on projections of high dimensional face image representations into lower dimensionality and highly discriminative spaces. This is achieved by a modified Orthogonal Locality Preserving Projections (OLPP) method that uses a supervised alternative locality definition scheme designed to preserve the face class (individuals) structure in the obtained lower dimensionality face feature space unlike the typical OLPP method which preserves the face data structure. Besides, a new kernel equation is proposed to calculate affinities among face samples, presenting better class structure preservation when compared to the heat kernel used by the typical OLPP method. The proposed method can work with sparse and dense face image representations (i.e. it can use sub-sets or all face image pixels), and a sparse and a dense feature extraction methods are proposed, which preserve the color information during the feature extraction process from the facial images improving on the typical OLPP method which uses grayscale low-resolution face images. New test face images are classified in the obtained lower dimensionality feature space using a trained soft margins Support Vector Machine (SVM), so it performs better than the nearest neighbor rule used in the typical OLPP method. A set of experiments was designed to evaluate the proposed method under various conditions found in practice (such as changes in head pose, face expression, illumination, and in the presence of occlusion artifacts). The experimental results were obtained using five challenging public face databases (namely, PUT, FEI, FERET, Yale and ORL). These experiments confirm that the proposed feature extraction method integrated to the proposed transformation to a discriminative lower dimensionality space using the alternative classification scheme with SVM and soft margins obtains higher recognition rates than the OLPP method itself and methods representative of the state-ofthe-art even when are used color (RGB) face images in high resolution (PUT, FEI and FERET face databases) as well as grayscale face images in low resolution (Yale and ORL face databases).", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2286291987", "mag_field_of_study": ["Art"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:193355575"}

Miguel Island's vascular plant flora (Archipelago of the Azores, Portugal) consists of approximately 1000 taxa and is largely dominated by non-indigenous taxa. However, existing indigenous vascular plant taxa are particularly important because they compose a very valuable ecosystem, the Azorean Laurel Forest. One of its most significant areas is the core of Pico da Vara/Ribeira do Guilherme Special Protected Area, in the former Natural Reserve of Pico da Vara, located in the mountain complex of Serra da Tronqueira. The rapid spread of some very aggressive invasive alien species, such as Pittosporum undulatum Vent. and Clethra arborea Aiton, are causing serious damages to this ecosystem. Its direct competition with native species has resulted in a significant decline in native populations and ecosystem area. This paper assessed the effectiveness of High Spatial Resolution IKONOS satellite imagery for vegetation mapping in Pico da Vara Natural Reserve using four different supervised classification techniques: Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Networks (nonparametric methods), Mahalanobis Distance and Maximum Likelihood (parametric methods). The overall classification results have shown that remote sensing based vegetation mapping using IKONOS image can constitute a cost-effective approach for a continuous monitoring, characterization and assessment of these insular ecosystems.

Experimental results demonstrate that our approach has good classification accuracy while the training is significantly faster than other state of the art methods.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDMW.2012.76", "venue": "2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops", "journal": "2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2021516315", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["61828744", "8781657", "961425", "8952183", "44647074", "2443126", "14393104", "9246935", "44256108", "2445540", "122650121", "14727192", "14500006", "7199270", "1668136", "9016542", "12363494", "41156470"], "inbound_citations": ["16025957", "71147456", "7068485"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17316943"}

We propose a pattern recognition system with an incremental learning ensemble algorithm using support vector machines (SVM) tackling this problem employing multimodal MR images and a texture-based information strategy. The proposed system integrates anatomic, texture, and functional features. The data set was preprocessed using B-Spline interpolation, bias field correction and intensity standardization. First- and second-order angular independent statistical approaches and rotation invariant local phase quantization (RI-LPQ) were utilized to quantify texture information. An incremental learning ensemble SVM was implemented to suit working conditions in medical applications and to improve effectiveness and robustness of the system. The probability estimation of cancer structures was calculated using SVM and the corresponding optimization was carried out with a heuristic method together with a 3-fold cross-validation methodology. We achieved an average sensitivity of 0.844\u00b10.068 and a specificity of 0.780\u00b10.038, which yielded superior or similar performance to current state of the art using a total database of only 41 slices from twelve patients with histological confirmed information, including cancerous, unhealthy non-cancerous and healthy prostate tissue. Our results show the feasibility of an ensemble SVM being able to learn additional information from new data while preserving previously acquired knowledge and preventing unlearning. The use of texture descriptors provides more salient discriminative patterns than the functional information used. Furthermore, the system improves selection of information, efficiency and robustness of the classification.

As RSs provide a very large amount of data, the main challenge to an exhaustive analysis of the ice subsurface is the efficient extraction of useful information contained in radargrams. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose an automatic classification system of the main ice subsurface features visible in radargrams, i.e., ice layered area, bedrock scattering area and noise regions.

ELM has been widely used in the applications of pattern recognition and data mining for its extremely fast training speed and highly recognition rate. But in most of real-world applications, there are irregular distributions and outlier problems which lower the classification rate of ELM (kernel ELM). This is mainly because: (1) Overfitting caused by outliers and unreasonable selections of activation function and kernel function and (2) the labeled sample size is small and we do not making full use of the information of unlabeled data either. Against problem one, this paper proposes a robust activation function (RAF) based on analyzing several different activation functions in-depth. RAF keeps the output of activation function away from zero as much as possible and minimizes the impacts of outliers to the algorithm. Thus, it improves the performance of ELM (kernel ELM); simultaneously, RAF can be applied to other kernel methods and a neural network learning algorithm. Against problem two, we propose a semi-supervised kernel ELM (SK-ELM).

To solve this problem, we built a decoupling algorithm with different gas sensors using a machine learning algorithm. Commercially available semiconductor sensors were employed to detect CH4 and CO, and then support vector machine (SVM) applied as a supervised learning algorithm for gas classification. We also introduced a pairing plot scheme to more effectively classify gas type.

As counterfeiters have taken advantage of the innovation in print media technologies for reproducing fake monies, hence the need to design systems which can reassure and protect citizens of the authenticity of banknotes in circulation.

Computer-aided diagnosis is vital to improvements in medical analysis, as they facilitate the identification of findings that need treatment and assist the expert\u2019s workflow. Thus, this thesis is organized around three such problems related to Banknote Authentication and Medical Image Diagnosis. In our first research problem, we proposed a new banknote recognition approach that classifies the principal components of extracted HOG features. We further experimented on computing HOG descriptors from cells created from image patch vertices of SURF points and designed a feature reduction approach based on a high correlation and low variance filter. In our second research problem, we developed a mobile app for banknote identification and counterfeit detection using the Unity 3D software and evaluated its performance based on a Cascaded Ensemble approach. The algorithm was then extended to a client-server architecture using SIFT and SURF features reduced by Bag of Words and high correlation-based HOG vectors. In our third research problem, experiments were conducted on a pre-trained mobile app for medical image diagnosis using three convolutional layers with an Ensemble Classifier comprising PCA and bagging of five base learners. Also, we implemented a Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network to mitigate the effect of the Binary Cross Entropy loss based on a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network as the generator and encoder with Capsule Network as the discriminator while experimenting on images with random composition and translation inferences.

By knowing the position of thirteen landmarks points, labelled by an expert in EOS frontal radiography, we learn the displacement between salient points detected in the image and these thirteen landmarks. The learning step is carried out with a machine learning approach by exploring two methods: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Random Forest (RF). The automatic detection of the thirteen landmarks points in a new image is then obtained by averaging the positions of each one of these thirteen landmarks estimated from all the salient points in the new image. We respectively obtain for CNN and RF, an average prediction error (both mean and standard deviation in mm) of 29 \u00b118 and 30 \u00b1 21 for the thirteen landmarks points, indicating the approximate location of anatomical regions. On the other hand, the learning time is 9 days for CNN versus 80 minutes for RF. We provide a comparison of the results between the two machine learning approaches.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2295214", "venue": "Medical Imaging", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2790418083", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7326187", "9179163", "18379091", "17505106", "33177262", "4976943", "134242366", "42281583"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3612993"}

The microbiome, which is characterized by small samples, high dimensions and complicated relationships with hosts, refers to the species, genes and genomes of the microbiota, as well as the products of the microbiota and the host environment. In fact, many machine learning methods have been used to conduct Microbiome-Wide Association Studies which can link the microbiome with the phenotypes, such as the status of human health and diseases. However, existing methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have some limitations on deep representation learning with deep architectures which can promote the reuse of features and potentially lead to progressively more abstract features at higher layers of representations. Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a kind of deep learning models, are widely used for metagenomic data analysis and can perform well on representation learning. But they are considered as a black box and sufferring from criticisms due to theirs lacking of interpretability. Thus, it is interesting to explore other deep learning models for metagenomic data analysis. In this work, we introduce a deep learning model called Deep Forest to study the microbiome associations and we also present an ensemble method for feature selection.

Different from the grid data, each node in relational network has different numbers of neighbors nodes, and the arrangement among them is disordered. Thus, this paper adds the relationship of transaction entities to machine learning model, which can effectively connect the graph domain and attributes space. First, the relational network between the transaction entity and the attribute entity is extracted from the transaction record. It is essentially a heterogeneous non-connected sparse bipartite graph with characteristics on nodes. However, the heterogeneous information network can not be uniformly characterized, and we should find and utilize the hidden relationship among the transaction entities we focused. Thus, Node Shrinkage Homogenization Algorithm is proposed for homogenization. Based on this homogeneous network, we put forward the method of graph-based Neighborhood Information Aggregation Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (NIAGBDT), so that the transaction features are integrated from its neighbor through the relational network.

While several tools have been developed for assessing differential expression in sequence-based transcriptomics, the detection of statistical interactions between transcripts has received less attention in the area of RNA-seq analysis. We describe a new extension and assessment of Relief-F for feature selection in RNA-seq data. The ReliefSeq implementation adapts the number of nearest neighbors (k) for each gene to optimize the Relief-F test statistics (importance scores) for finding both main effects and interactions. We compare this gene-wise adaptive-k (gwak) Relief-F method with standard RNA-seq feature selection tools, such as DESeq and edgeR, and with the popular machine learning method Random Forests. We demonstrate performance on a panel of simulated data that have a range of distributional properties reflected in real mRNA-seq data including multiple transcripts with varying sizes of main effects and interaction effects. For simulated main effects, gwak-Relief-F feature selection performs comparably to standard tools DESeq and edgeR for ranking relevant transcripts. For gene-gene interactions, gwak-Relief-F outperforms all comparison methods at ranking relevant genes in all but the highest fold change/highest signal situations where it performs similarly. The gwak-Relief-F algorithm outperforms Random Forests for detecting relevant genes in all simulation experiments. In addition, Relief-F is comparable to the other methods based on computational time. We also apply ReliefSeq to an RNA-Seq study of smallpox vaccine to identify gene expression changes between vaccinia virus-stimulated and unstimulated samples.

The Random Forest machine learning algorithm, which showed best efficacy (92.9% SD: 0.06), was used to generate variable importance ranking of positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptoms, cognitive indexes, global assessment of function (GAF), and parental ages at birth for sorting participants into diagnostic categories. Symptoms were ranked most influential for separating cases from healthy controls, followed by cognition and maternal age. To separate schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder from bipolar/unipolar depression, GAF was most influential, followed by cognition and paternal age. For classifying schizophrenia from all other psychiatric disorders, low GAF and paternal age were similarly important, followed by cognition, psychopathology and maternal age. Controls misclassified as schizophrenia cases showed lower nonverbal abilities, mild negative and general psychopathology symptoms, and younger maternal or older paternal age. The importance of symptoms for classification of cases and lower GAF for diagnosing schizophrenia, notably more important and distinct from cognition and symptoms, concurs with current practices.

To improve Tor performance, we propose PredicTor, a path selection technique that uses a Random Forest classifier trained on recent measurements of Tor to predict the performance of a proposed path. If the path is predicted to be fast, then the client builds a circuit using those relays. We implemented PredicTor in the Tor source code and show through live Tor experiments and Shadow simulations that PredicTor improves Tor network performance by 11% to 23% compared to Vanilla Tor and by 7% to 13% compared to the previous state-of-the-art scheme. Our experiments show that PredicTor is the first path selection algorithm to dynamically avoid highly congested nodes during times of high congestion and avoid long-distance paths during times of low congestion. We evaluate the anonymity of PredicTor using standard entropy-based and time-to-first-compromise metrics, but these cannot capture the possibility of leakage due to the use of location in path selection. To better address this, we propose a new anonymity metric called CLASI: Client Autonomous System Inference. CLASI is the first anonymity metric in Tor that measures an adversary's ability to infer client Autonomous Systems (ASes) by fingerprinting circuits at the network, country, and relay level. We find that CLASI shows anonymity loss for location-aware path selection algorithms, where entropy-based metrics show little to no loss of anonymity. Additionally, CLASI indicates that PredicTor has similar sender AS leakage compared to the current Tor path selection algorithm due to PredicTor building circuits that are independent of client location.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1805.01977", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2964215640,2803090259,2951825844", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["208013276", "15853663", "5882122", "42642443", "14311125", "16222279", "8741367", "5954523", "29668418", "6941717", "10855726", "1413337", "9204847", "9204847", "7371655", "6162599", "166287621", "17994845", "10272388", "5954182", "16272181", "15095044", "2127416", "7672772", "13295394", "43103413", "120577348", "11478993", "14017565", "206556640", "2253628"], "inbound_citations": ["199546518"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26073129"}

Since then, Prosopis has hybridized and spread throughout the region. Prosopis has negative ecological impacts on biodiversity and socio-economic effects on livelihoods. Vachellia tortilis, on the other hand, is the dominant indigenous tree species in Baringo and is an important natural resource, mostly preferred for wood, fodder and charcoal production. High utilization due to anthropogenic pressure is affecting the Vachellia populations, whereas the well adapted Prosopis\u2014competing for nutrients and water\u2014has the potential to replace the native Vachellia vegetation. It is vital that both species are mapped in detail to inform stakeholders and for designing management strategies for controlling the Prosopis invasion. For the Baringo area, few remote sensing studies have been carried out. We propose a detailed and robust object-based Random Forest (RF) classification on high spatial resolution Sentinel-2 (ten meter) and Pleiades (two meter) data to detect Prosopis and Vachellia spp. for Marigat sub-county, Baringo, Kenya. In situ reference data were collected to train a RF classifier. Classification results were validated by comparing the outputs to independent reference data of test sites from the \u201cWoody Weeds\u201d project and the Out-Of-Bag (OOB) confusion matrix generated in RF. Our results indicate that both datasets are suitable for object-based Prosopis and Vachellia classification. Higher accuracies were obtained by using the higher spatial resolution Pleiades data (OOB accuracy 0.83 and independent reference accuracy 0.87\u20130.91) compared to the Sentinel-2 data (OOB accuracy 0.79 and independent reference accuracy 0.80\u20130.96). We conclude that it is possible to separate Prosopis and Vachellia with good accuracy using the Random Forest classifier. Given the cost of Pleiades, the free of charge Sentinel-2 data provide a viable alternative as the increased spectral resolution compensates for the lack of spatial resolution. With global revisit times of five days from next year onwards, Sentinel-2 based classifications can probably be further improved by using temporal information in addition to the spectral signatures.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs9010074", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2577871237", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["692160", "84279215", "20745955", "86754878", "84557347", "129430101", "131475396", "85945243", "4640165", "82096194", "202778412", "30044105", "53542597", "1694147", "132049849", "31915358", "4283358", "155058441", "6708431", "85070232", "129000904", "129556148", "6831560", "21605657", "7605532", "82164549", "131162541", "140135085", "13969842", "11485159", "2351640", "54741771", "23702320", "15299210", "691081", "2068350", "4639400", "17054335", "56098160", "96258129", "128773162", "133358670", "51903355", "52265890", "85267438", "128944071", "123042752", "57002970", "4637792", "13826115", "456914", "89141", "27545358", "17616037", "10507847", "3093707", "14864905", "60985554", "128818929", "120310027", "128481752", "6861827", "16560581", "129044498", "15471117", "62527324", "132396890", "132338651", "32282243", "7499898", "122668240"], "inbound_citations": ["57193401", "198231506", "92992106", "146187111", "6631176", "208036645", "127836293", "169035744", "210054995", "197672639", "215322925", "134285130", "41114542", "85496686", "198232831", "207913768", "52926128", "3816827", "4014155", "35959549"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10145035"}

The steps of a typical quality control (QC) of marker data include the elimination of markers with certain level of minor allele frequency (MAF) and missing marker values and the imputation of missing marker values. In this article, we evaluated how the prediction accuracy is influenced by the combination of 12 MAF values, 27 different percentages of missing marker values, and 2 imputation techniques (IT; na\u00efve and Random Forest (RF)). We constructed a response surface of prediction accuracy values for the two ITs as a function of MAF and percentage of missing marker values using soybean data from the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln Soybean Breeding Program. We found that both the genetic architecture of the trait and the IT affect the prediction accuracy implying that we have to be careful how we perform QC on the marker data. For the corresponding combinations MAF-percentage of missing values we observed that implementing the RF imputation increased the number of markers by 2 to 5 times than the simple na\u00efve imputation method that is based on the mean allele dosage of the non-missing values at each loci.

Network-based attacks make it difficult for legitimate users to access various network services by purposely occupying or sabotaging network resources and services. This can be done by sending large amounts of network traffic, exploiting well-known faults in networking services, and by overloading network hosts. Intrusion Detection attempts to detect computer attacks by examining various data records observed in processes on the network and it is split into two groups, anomaly detection systems and misuse detection systems. Anomaly detection is an attempt to search for malicious behavior that deviates from established normal patterns. Misuse detection is used to identify intrusions that match known attack scenarios. Our interest here is in anomaly detection and our proposed method is a scalable solution for detecting network-based anomalies. We use Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification. The SVM is one of the most successful classification algorithms in the data mining area, but its long training time limits its use. This paper presents a study for enhancing the training time of SVM, specifically when dealing with large data sets, using hierarchical clustering analysis. We use the Dynamically Growing Self-Organizing Tree (DGSOT) algorithm for clustering because it has proved to overcome the drawbacks of traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms (e.g., hierarchical agglomerative clustering). Clustering analysis helps find the boundary points, which are the most qualified data points to train SVM, between two classes. We present a new approach of combination of SVM and DGSOT, which starts with an initial training set and expands it gradually using the clustering structure produced by the DGSOT algorithm. We compare our approach with the Rocchio Bundling technique and random selection in terms of accuracy loss and training time gain using a single benchmark real data set. We show that our proposed variations contribute significantly in improving the training process of SVM with high generalization accuracy and outperform the Rocchio Bundling technique.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00778-006-0002-5", "venue": "The VLDB Journal", "journal": "The VLDB Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1995064042", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10205859", "14358985", "5786545", "63889176", "16299659", "16071977", "5509109", "10028835", "23485973", "7175720", "15756191", "5320604", "2318624", "18226230", "6345780", "14171428", "4493350", "207695643", "2157536", "15167208", "16330928", "164761", "13552398", "7138354", "13366813", "60039398", "1308698", "35579982", "17052489", "9016542", "1343506"], "inbound_citations": ["53418919", "67469751", "10213959", "85524149", "17965494", "14219023", "15893515", "6420582", "18490689", "45584553", "16288841", "6260272", "195818267", "3012953", "6484422", "1882619", "14883885", "21493024", "41342757", "11429465", "46968479", "85502898", "209544489", "198147197", "671684", "14363872", "16327693", "450178", "17002763", "18191106", "210712706", "20595406", "17880384", "15267934", "14455772", "11321436", "22057030", "14742668", "21723939", "29755477", "117325013", "59740121", "54434778", "39991700", "206259755", "21134033", "7553359", "13876326", "110427364", "26217158", "9958575", "29605054", "212649584", "39174364", "12252805", "16504858", "209899466", "15047316", "204954233", "24217264", "18870504", "17690567", "13784201", "42459080", "24063043", "21973782", "37421853", "21953917", "4895753", "61780658", "6945465", "13742663", "14757739", "16615974", "18615649", "204779350", "11249391", "16533889", "26768196", "4937576", "6755045", "2383392", "64143139", "61249628", "16932525", "14566460", "6950532", "704429", "18046965", "16341591", "55572720", "59554878", "18986050", "210920646", "47634042", "461343", "16804854", "206894264", "12386607", "201833700", "45243370", "199552000", "15136139", "207229649", "6836459", "211080881", "96049", "9838952", "34090282", "11501067", "6628916", "14583429", "66978035", "49416467", "26500517", "209456437", "36176167", "17899881", "17682469", "211242535", "44624409", "12818584", "14946715", "34037268", "62580301", "3436879", "17619693", "31840508", "174778933", "730561", "12667955", "3947660", "627373", "10678817", "5929011", "203583271", "13641757", "7675183", "125922533", "67875145", "115196801", "46802054", "11211443", "65340678", "6510065", "53681543", "39563709", "195878411", "9759278", "14370527", "18341905", "18773247", "14483844", "14483844", "8788674", "208880734", "15113966", "6498711", "18977370", "14880298", "12956748", "17834982", "209392652", "52914029"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2847306"}

The feedback from a customer in any of these situations is only 'bandit feedback' - that is, a partial feedback based on whether we chose to intervene or not. Typically randomized experiments are carried out to understand whether an intervention is overall better than no intervention. Here we present a feature learning algorithm to learn from a randomized experiment where the intervention in consideration is most effective and where it is least effective rather than only focusing on the overall impact, thus adding a context to our learning mechanism and extract more information. From the randomized experiment, we learn the feature representations which divide the population into subpopulations where we observe statistically significant difference in average customer feedback between those who were subjected to the intervention and those who were not, with a level of significance l, where l is a configurable parameter in our model. We use this information to derive the value of the intervention in consideration for each instance in the population. With experiments, we show that using this additional learning, in future interventions, the context for each instance could be leveraged to decide whether to intervene or not.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1808.07569", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2888208822", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["14135922", "1726300", "1240161", "7806620", "122155840", "8558103", "167518517", "17165746", "207178795", "744200", "49190930", "52832751", "842793", "7297845", "14868978", "6361251"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52076130"}

Using samples from Apollo and Luna landing sites, the method firstly establishes the spectral parameters that possess good non-linear correlations with lunar titanium abundance. Secondly, the method estimates lunar titanium abundance using a DT-SVM (Decision Tree Method C5.0-Support Vector Machine) method. Namely, according to the established spectral parameters, it uses the C5.0 algorithm to classify the titanium abundance into the 4 classes of very low, low, intermediate and high. Then, in terms of the spectral parameters and the corresponding classes, it employs the SVM to estimate the titanium abundance. The method makes good use of hyperspectral information, analyzes the nonlinear correlations between spectral characteristics of lunar soils and the composition parameter, and well determines the titanium abundance. Validated by the Apollo and Luna station samples, the RMSE (root mean square error) is 0.72wt% TiO2 and the correlation coefficient of the measured and predicted values is 97.29%. So, the method proposed in this paper has a good predictive capability for TiO2 abundance on the lunar surface.

Here, we present a comparison of the performance of seven different meta-classifiers for their ability to handle imbalanced datasets, whereby Random Forest is used as base-classifier. Four different datasets that are directly (cholestasis) or indirectly (via inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 and 1B3) related to liver toxicity were chosen for this purpose.

This paper describes a novel parameterisation of the CRF which ties the majority of clique potentials, while allowing individual potentials for a subset of the labellings. This has two beneficial effects: the parameter space of the model (and thus the propensity to over-fit) is reduced, and the time complexity of training and decoding becomes sub-quadratic. On a standard natural language task, we reduce CRF training time four-fold, with no loss in accuracy.

Although this feature is useful as a viewpoint of memory capacity, to keep all memories is intractable, in particular, for reservoir computing with many neurons. A reasonable approximation to the fractional-order neuron dynamics is therefore introduced, thereby deriving a model that exponentially decays past memories before threshold. This derivation is regarded as natural extension of reservoir computing with leaky integrator that has been used most commonly.

Aerial visible light (RGB) imagery acquired by consumer UAV-mounted digital camera is attracting more and more researchers' attention for crop remote sensing. Because of the suitability for different environmental conditions and convenience in data processing and analysis, active optical canopy sensors have been widely used for N-status monitoring. Accordingly, the system of UAV-based active sensor is expected to take both advantages of active sensors and U A V s. The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare RGB digital camera with active canopy sensor based on UA V platform for estimating rice N status; (2) to explore the method of multiple regression prediction (Random Forest) and the potential of combining data from UAV-based RGB imagery and active sensor for N status monitoring. Field experiment on rice involving 4 N rates (0, 135, 270 and 405 kg/ha), 2 transplanting ways and 2 varieties was conducted in 2017 at Lianyungang experiment station of Nanjing Agricultural University in Jiangsu Province. Plant sampling and sensing data collection (from aerial imagery and active sensor) were conducted at 4 key growth stages. LAI (leaf area index), LDM (leaf dry matter) and LNA (leaf area accumulation) were tested and calculated as the N-status indicators. Aerial images were acquired by a built-in RGB camera from a multi-rotor UA V named DJI Phantom 3 Professional. Spectral reflectance of red (670 nm), red-edge (730 nm) and near infrared (780 nm) wavebands were collected by a UA V -mounted active canopy sensor RapidSCAN CS-45. Vegetation indexes (VIs, calculated from active sensor reflectance) and color indexes (CI, calculated from digital number values of aerial images) were used to build predictive models for each N-status indicator respectively. Random forest estimator (RF) was used to explore the potential of multiple regression-based prediction and combining data from RGB imagery and active sensor together for rice leaf N -status monitoring. The results indicated great applicability of active canopy sensor on rice N -status monitoring compared to traditional RGB digital camera, and greater performance was shown by random forest estimator with mixed inputs of VIs and CIs together.

To address this paucity, we introduce GAN-TTS, a Generative Adversarial Network for Text-to-Speech.

To measure the performance of GAN-TTS, we employ both subjective human evaluation (MOS - Mean Opinion Score), as well as novel quantitative metrics (Frechet DeepSpeech Distance and Kernel DeepSpeech Distance), which we find to be well correlated with MOS. We show that GAN-TTS is capable of generating high-fidelity speech with naturalness comparable to the state-of-the-art models, and unlike autoregressive models, it is highly parallelisable thanks to an efficient feed-forward generator.

Here, high resolution data plays a particularly important role as many chromatin substructures such as Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) and chromatin loops cannot be adequately studied with low resolution contact maps. However, the high sequencing costs associated with the generation of high resolution Hi-C data has become an experimental barrier. Data driven machine learning models, which allow low resolution Hi-C data to be computationally enhanced, offer a promising avenue to address this challenge. Results By carefully examining the properties of Hi-C maps and integrating various recent advances in deep learning, we developed a Hi-C Super-Resolution (HiCSR) framework capable of accurately recovering the fine details, textures, and substructures found in high resolution contact maps. This was achieved using a novel loss function tailored to the Hi-C enhancement problem which optimizes for an adversarial loss from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), a feature reconstruction loss derived from the latent representation of a denoising autoencoder, and a pixel-wise loss. Not only can the resulting framework generate enhanced Hi-C maps visually more similar to the original high resolution maps, it also excels on a suite of reproducibility metrics produced by members of the ENCODE Consortium compared to existing approaches, including HiCPlus, HiCNN, hicGAN and DeepHiC. Finally, we demonstrate that HiCSR is capable of enhancing Hi-C data across sequencing depth, cell types, and species, recovering biologically significant contact domain boundaries.

We propose a new context-based concept fusion (CBCF) method for semantic concept detection. Our work includes two folds. (1) We model the inter-conceptual relationships by a conditional random field (CRF) that improves detection results from independent detectors by taking into account the inter-correlation among concepts. CRF directly models the posterior probability of concept labels and is more accurate for the discriminative concept detection than previous statistical inferencing techniques. The boosted CRF framework is incorporated to further enhance performance by combining the power of boosting with CRF.

Standard Support Vector methods for precise data formalize these statistical problems as optimization problems that can be based on various loss functions. In the case of Support Vector Regression (SVR), on which we focus here, the function that best describes the relationship between a response and some explanatory variables is derived as the solution of the minimization problem associated with the expectation of some function of the residual, which is called the risk functional. The key idea of SVR is that even when considering an infinite-dimensional space of arbitrary regression functions, given a finitedimensional data set, the function minimizing the risk can be represented as the finite weighted sum of kernel functions. This allows to practically determine the SVR estimate by solving a much simpler optimization problem, even in the case of nonlinear regression. In case that only interval-valued observations of the variables of interest are available, it has been suggested to minimize the minimal or maximal risk values that are compatible with the imprecise data, yielding precise SVR estimates on the basis of interval data. In this paper, we show that also in the case of an interval-valued response the optimal function can be represented as the finite weighted sum of kernel functions.

A common practice on this topic is the so-called Info-Kmeans, which performs K-means clustering with KL-divergence as the proximity function. While expert efforts on Info-Kmeans have shown promising results, a remaining challenge is to deal with high-dimensional sparse data such as text corpora. Indeed, it is possible that the centroids contain many zero-value features for high-dimensional text vectors, which leads to infinite KL-divergence values and creates a dilemma in assigning objects to centroids during the iteration process of Info-Kmeans. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we propose a Summation-bAsed Incremental Learning (SAIL) algorithm for Info-Kmeans clustering. Specifically, by using an equivalent objective function, SAIL replaces the computation of KL-divergence by the incremental computation of Shannon entropy. This can avoid the zero-feature dilemma caused by the use of KL-divergence. To improve the clustering quality, we further introduce the variable neighborhood search scheme and propose the V-SAIL algorithm, which is then accelerated by a multithreaded scheme in PV-SAIL. Our experimental results on various real-world text collections have shown that, with SAIL as a booster, the clustering performance of Info-Kmeans can be significantly improved.

Many of these diseases are hereditary and life expectancy of many sufferers is considerably reduced. Early detection and diagnosis of these diseases by clinical examination and laboratory tests is essential for their management as well as their prevention through prenatal diagnosis and genetic counselling. Such information is also useful in research which may lead to the understanding of the nature and eventual treatment of these diseases. Laboratory investigations include neurophysiological tests, nerve and muscle biopsies, biochemical analysis and more recently DNA analysis for the localization and identi\ufb01cation of genes. Electromyographic examination studies the electrical activity of the muscle and forms a valuable neurophysiological test for the assessment of neuromuscular disorders. The shapes and firing rates of the motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in an EMG signal provide an important source of information for the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders. In order to extract this information from the EMG signals recorded at low to moderate force levels, it is required to identify and classify the MUAPs composing the EMG signal. The identification of possible MUAPs is done by segmentation of EMG signal using threshold technique. The identified MUAPs are clustered using a statistical pattern recognition technique. After extraction of autoregressive (AR) features, MUAPs are classified using binary support vector machine (SVM) classifier. A total of 12 EMG signals obtained from 3 normal (NOR), 5 myopathic (MYO) and 4 motor neuron diseased (MND) subjects were analyzed. The classification accuracy of binary SVM with AR features is 100%.

Recently, an approach that uses only character p-grams as features has been proposed for the task of native language identification NLI. The approach obtained state-of-the-art results by combining several string kernels using multiple kernel learning. Despite the fact that the approach based on string kernels performs so well, several questions about this method remain unanswered. First, it is not clear why such a simple approach can compete with far more complex approaches that take words, lemmas, syntactic information, or even semantics into account. Second, although the approach is designed to be language independent, all experiments to date have been on English. This work is an extensive study that aims to systematically present the string kernel approach and to clarify the open questions mentioned above. ::: ::: A broad set of native language identification experiments were conducted to compare the string kernels approach with other state-of-the-art methods. The empirical results obtained in all of the experiments conducted in this work indicate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in NLI, reaching an accuracy that is 1.7% above the top scoring system of the 2013 NLI Shared Task. Furthermore, the results obtained on both the Arabic and the Norwegian corpora demonstrate that the proposed approach is language independent. In the Arabic native language identification task, string kernels show an increase of more than 17% over the best accuracy reported so far. The results of string kernels on Norwegian native language identification are also significantly better than the state-of-the-art approach. In addition, in a cross-corpus experiment, the proposed approach shows that it can also be topic independent, improving the state-of-the-art system by 32.3%. ::: ::: To gain additional insights about the string kernels approach, the features selected by the classifier as being more discriminating are analyzed in this work. The analysis also offers information about localized language transfer effects, since the features used by the proposed model are p-grams of various lengths. The features captured by the model typically include stems, function words, and word prefixes and suffixes, which have the potential to generalize over purely word-based features.

Of particular interest in this work are issues related to techniques for classification of potential breast tumours into benign and malignant. This is particularly important given the results from recent studies of the dielectric properties of breast and tumour tissue, which have found that strong similarities exist between the dielectric properties of malignant, benign and normal fibroglandular breast tissue. This creates a more challenging imaging scenario and motivates the development of enhanced signal processing techniques for UWB imaging systems. Tumour growth and development patterns are modelled using Gaussian Random Spheres, using four discrete sizes and four different shapes. Feature extraction methods including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), are used to extract the most relevant features from the detailed Radar Target Signatures of the tumours, which are then classified with a number of different classification techniques: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). In addition to these techniques, a number of different multi-stage classification architectures are considered. The feature extraction and classification algorithms are evaluated for both homogeneous and heterogeneous breast tissue models, for a range of different tumour sizes and shapes. Also, the first experimental results using a pre-clinical UWB prototype imaging system for tumour classification based on the shape of tumours.

Existing methods learn a common Mahalanobis distance metric by using the data collected from different cameras and then exploit the learned metric for identifying people in the images. However, the cameras in a camera network have different settings and the recorded images are seriously affected by variability in illumination conditions, camera viewing angles, and background clutter. Using a common metric to conduct person reidentification tasks on different camera pairs overlooks the differences in camera settings; however, it is very time-consuming to label people manually in images from surveillance videos. For example, in most existing person reidentification data sets, only one image of a person is collected from each of only two cameras; therefore, directly learning a unique Mahalanobis distance metric for each camera pair is susceptible to over-fitting by using insufficiently labeled data. In this paper, we reformulate person reidentification in a camera network as a multitask distance metric learning problem. The proposed method designs multiple Mahalanobis distance metrics to cope with the complicated conditions that exist in typical camera networks. We address the fact that these Mahalanobis distance metrics are different but related, and learned by adding joint regularization to alleviate over-fitting. Furthermore, by extending, we present a novel multitask maximally collapsing metric learning (MtMCML) model for person reidentification in a camera network. Experimental results demonstrate that formulating person reidentification over camera networks as multitask distance metric learning problem can improve performance, and our proposed MtMCML works substantially better than other current state-of-the-art person reidentification methods.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24956368", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2014.2331755", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2014764728", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10315527", "10872115", "6314204", "15288631", "1105408", "3961724", "7973738", "1661291", "425268", "10070153", "16193644", "1138597", "16631931", "8249939", "10886660", "982263", "10555588", "2054652", "11804469", "14953475", "9611427", "319656", "6485959", "3126911", "14438129", "14909631", "12799509", "6029875", "47325215", "541943", "4269137", "11319685", "893540", "43324315", "3264198", "14402639", "37925315", "124006681", "19901636", "205010266"], "inbound_citations": ["13262103", "12088157", "11783552", "36293481", "19936786", "15678547", "53081905", "3295351", "195354104", "7420230", "195441473", "3423672", "78092874", "204777581", "202402603", "204199911", "8246916", "52128312", "4872833", "480975", "53440612", "73685214", "208001471", "48359212", "17569238", "52089588", "52272792", "14297895", "18510270", "6827766", "57201650", "4554634", "25068035", "51876046", "6543895", "202750156", "9085386", "2940315", "157057809", "140119409", "52165521", "52967007", "212654957", "201660165", "16404696", "39105237", "4049613", "37492201", "9372251", "4402217", "125910031", "51902730", "6746533", "2705952", "73611195", "6882063", "5436982", "52987380", "11599494", "14124239", "52948589", "4773332", "12470642", "2449063", "54435931", "35569682", "13377293", "15352079", "14926665", "203951429", "3454450", "10891011", "3708495", "56718748", "11700056", "207323040", "145957153", "204819564", "7998337", "36242877", "8943954", "53082760", "53237606", "14390842", "52180262", "51611249", "51881836", "198172599", "23150581", "174802473", "28540413", "1221442", "10079228", "3041327", "6082175", "3391619", "53082739", "209519", "53106306", "195492859", "69527867", "52125804", "209331188", "209331188", "13570288", "5820988", "6177842", "69874194", "29449080", "212449064", "1259407", "3551557", "202540031", "3804840", "32343257", "210862661", "33834513", "49190222", "53628826", "10632692", "4857212", "88522997", "57364377", "28931639", "15192529", "207902600", "34982160", "20247355", "18289032", "53968165", "568909", "1950833", "3861408", "202412956", "16999377", "59233493", "2594254", "30127350", "2177856", "26889869"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9643263"}

Measuring toxicity is an important step in drug development. Nevertheless, the current experimental methods used to estimate the drug toxicity are expensive and time-consuming, indicating that they are not suitable for large-scale evaluation of drug toxicity in the early stage of drug development. Hence, there is a high demand to develop computational models that can predict the drug toxicity risks. In this study, we used a dataset that consists of 553 drugs that biotransformed in liver. The toxic effects were calculated for the current data, namely, mutagenic, tumorigenic, irritant and reproductive effect. Each drug is represented by 31 chemical descriptors (features). The proposed model consists of three phases. In the first phase, the most discriminative subset of features is selected using rough set-based methods to reduce the classification time while improving the classification performance. In the second phase, different sampling methods such as Random Under-Sampling, Random Over-Sampling and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), BorderLine SMOTE and Safe Level SMOTE are used to solve the problem of imbalanced dataset. In the third phase, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier is used to classify an unknown drug into toxic or non-toxic. SVM parameters such as the penalty parameter and kernel parameter have a great impact on the classification accuracy of the model. In this paper, Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) has been proposed to optimize the parameters of SVM, so that the classification error can be reduced. The experimental results proved that the proposed model achieved high sensitivity to all toxic effects.

However, these tests are typically expensive, time consuming, and tissue-destructive.MethodsIn this paper, we evaluate the ability of computer-extracted nuclear morphology features from routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images of 178 early stage ER+ breast cancer patients to predict corresponding risk categories derived using the Oncotype DX test. A total of 216 features corresponding to the nuclear shape and architecture categories from each of the pathologic images were extracted and four feature selection schemes: Ranksum, Principal Component Analysis with Variable Importance on Projection (PCA-VIP), Maximum-Relevance, Minimum Redundancy Mutual Information Difference (MRMR MID), and Maximum-Relevance, Minimum Redundancy - Mutual Information Quotient (MRMR MIQ), were employed to identify the most discriminating features. These features were employed to train 4 machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Linear Discriminant Analysis, via 3-fold cross validation.ResultsThe four sets of risk categories, and the top Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) machine classifier performances were: 1) Low ODx and Low mBR grade vs. High ODx and High mBR grade (Low-Low vs. High-High) (AUC = 0.83), 2) Low ODx vs. High ODx (AUC = 0.72), 3) Low ODx vs. Intermediate and High ODx (AUC = 0.58), and 4) Low and Intermediate ODx vs. High ODx (AUC = 0.65). Trained models were tested independent validation set of 53 cases which comprised of Low and High ODx risk, and demonstrated per-patient accuracies ranging from 75 to 86%.ConclusionOur results suggest that computerized image analysis of digitized H&E pathology images of early stage ER+ breast cancer might be able predict the corresponding Oncotype DX risk categories.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5977541", "pubmed_id": "29848291", "doi": "10.1186/s12885-018-4448-9", "venue": "BMC Cancer", "journal": "BMC Cancer", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2806634798", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["22620760", "577727", "29580633", "503714", "1688174", "6130123", "6242878", "205199372", "40274954", "4444960", "16261617", "2044592", "11635645", "17798295", "33096075", "3892869", "41454413", "9087366", "7843488", "4326043", "24163505", "24835447", "12977116", "27391290", "1799558", "1224932", "13672421", "7720049", "206764015", "1831347", "18600099", "14053104", "17622089", "2746680", "21672591", "58399515", "14392216", "4821964", "9318895", "17850843", "18159009", "17970582", "12789657", "2813353"], "inbound_citations": ["202573865", "202862863", "88492816", "164571491", "204758058", "199512113"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44136931"}

Nevertheless, dynamic point clouds are often perturbed by noise due to hardware, software or other causes. While a plethora of methods have been proposed for static point cloud denoising, few efforts are made for the denoising of dynamic point clouds with varying number of irregularly-sampled points in each frame. In this paper, we represent dynamic point clouds naturally on graphs and address the denoising problem by inferring the underlying graph via spatio-temporal graph learning, exploiting both the intra-frame similarity and inter-frame consistency. Firstly, assuming the availability of a relevant feature vector per node, we pose spatial-temporal graph learning as optimizing a Mahalanobis distance metric M, which is formulated as the minimization of graph Laplacian regularizer. Secondly, to ease the optimization of the symmetric and positive definite metric matrix M, we decompose it into M = R'*R and solve R instead via proximal gradient. Finally, based on the spatial-temporal graph learning, we formulate dynamic point cloud denoising as the joint optimization of the desired point cloud and underlying spatio-temporal graph, which leverages both intra-frame affinities and inter-frame consistency and is solved via alternating minimization. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms independent denoising of each frame from state-of-the-art static point cloud denoising approaches.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.08355", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3011949262", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["206849822", "67118433", "7929773", "18609676", "6668430", "53234691", "53245213", "7466051", "9184755", "4714526", "125987964", "4714526", "49558597", "198147302", "117765088", "17879082", "60624922", "5636982", "11206708", "1475121", "14922497", "854458", "8348890", "52104932", "9539186", "14308539"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212747690"}

Amongst these algorithms, Multiclass Support Vector Machines (MC-SVM) has gained popularity due to its relatively high classification accuracy, ability to classify multiple patterns and capability to handle noisy /incomplete data. However, its application is limited by the difficulty in determining the required kernel function and penalty parameters. To address this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid differential evolution -- particle swarm optimization (DE-PSO) algorithm to optimize the MC-SVM kernel function and penalty parameters. The differential algorithm (DE) obtains the search limit for the SVM parameters, while the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) determines the global optimum parameters for a given training data set. Since degrading machinery components display several degradation stages in their lifetime, the MC-SVM trained with optimum parameters are used to estimate the health states of a degrading machinery component, from which the remaining useful life (RUL) is predicted. This method improves the classification accuracy of MC-SVM in predicting the health states of a machinery component and consequently increases the accuracy of RUL predictions. The feasibility of the method is validated using bearing prognostic run-to-failure data obtained from NASA public data repository. A comparative study between MC-SVM with parameters obtained using simple grid search with n-fold cross validation and MCSVM with DE-PSO based on prognostic performance metrics reveals that the proposed method has better performance, with all the cases considered falling within a 10 \\% error margin.

Such awareness would be essential in keeping each individual learner to be a specialist and cooperative to other individual learners in the same ensemble learning system. In this paper, each individual learning machine gains awareness through adjusting learning directions and learning strength in learning each data by negative correlation learning with selection (NCLS). If the data had not been learned by the ensemble system, each individual learning module in the ensemble would adopt the common learning strategies in which the weight learning would lead the module's output to be close to the target output. However, if the data had been learned by the ensemble system, each individual learning module would tend to go to the opposite learning direction, or weaken the learning strength in order to learn to be different to the rest of the learning modules in the ensemble.

We propose a search process to select a subset of basis functions that maximize the margin without the requirement of being kernel functions. The sparsity of the model can be explicitly controlled.

To complicate the problem, there is the scarcity of public datasets for confidentiality issues, which does not allow researchers to verify the new strategies in many data contexts. Differently from the canonical state-of-the-art strategies, instead of defining a unique model based on the past transactions of the users, we follow a Divide and Conquer strategy, by defining multiple models (user behavioral patterns), which we exploit to evaluate a new transaction, in order to detect potential attempts of fraud. We can act on some parameters of this process, in order to adapt the models sensitivity to the operating environment. Considering that our models do not need to be trained with both the past legitimate and fraudulent transactions of a user, since they use only the legitimate ones, we can operate in a proactive manner, by detecting fraudulent transactions that have never occurred in the past.

It is an important issue how to select the best structure and parameters of the fuzzy model from given input-output data. To solve this problem, this thesis proposes the state-ofthe-art kernel machine as the fuzzy inference engine. The kernel machine contains two modules such as the machine learning and the kernel function. The machine learning is a learning algorithm. The kernel function projects input data into high dimensional feature space. In this thesis, an extended Support Vector Machine (SVM), an extended Feature Vector Selection (FVS) and an extended Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) as kernel machines are used. In the proposed fuzzy system, the number of fuzzy rules and the parameter values of membership functions are automatically generated using extended kernel machines such as an extended SVM, an extended FVS and an extended RVM. The structure and learning algorithm of the FIS using an extended SVM, an extended FVS and an extended RVM are presented, respectively. The learning algorithm of the extended FVS is faster than the extended SVM. The extended FVS consists of the linear transformation part of input variables and the kernel mapping part. The linear transformation of input variables is used to solve problem selecting the best shape of the Gaussian kernel function. The extended RVM generates the smaller number of fuzzy rules than the extended SVM. The extended RVM does not need the linear transformation of input variables because the basis function of the extended RVM is not restricted within the limitation of the kernel function. As the basic structure of the proposed fuzzy inference system, the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model is used. After the structure is selected, the parameter values in the consequent part of TS fuzzy model are determined by the least square estimation method. In particular, the number of fuzzy rules can be reduced by adjusting the linear transformation matrix or the parameter values of kernel functions using a gradient descent method. Some examples involving benchmark nonlinear systems are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2271969957", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124852315"}

In this paper, we propose a method that combines ensemble learning with ancillary environmental information for improved interpolation of soil properties (hereafter, EL-SP). First, we calculated the trend value for soil potassium contents at the Qinghai Lake region in China based on measured values. Then, based on soil types, geology types, land use types, and slope data, the remaining residual was simulated with the ensemble learning model. Next, the EL-SP method was applied to interpolate soil potassium contents at the study site. To evaluate the utility of the EL-SP method, we compared its performance with other interpolation methods including universal kriging, inverse distance weighting, ordinary kriging, and ordinary kriging combined geographic information. Results show that EL-SP had a lower mean absolute error and root mean square error than the data produced by the other models tested in this paper. Notably, the EL-SP maps can describe more locally detailed information and more accurate spatial patterns for soil potassium content than the other methods because of the combined use of different types of environmental information; these maps are capable of showing abrupt boundary information for soil potassium content. Furthermore, the EL-SP method not only reduces prediction errors, but it also compliments other environmental information, which makes the spatial interpolation of soil potassium content more reasonable and useful.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4415809", "pubmed_id": "25928138", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0124383", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1991426997", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13891704", "13928679", "20457382", "128752030", "129126002", "14346252", "15331965", "130119475", "133211980", "102077262", "54790450", "6939422", "3626971", "15245447", "2186063", "7290025", "17879431", "7432373", "2547613", "36724149", "8390420", "53650773", "19414856", "121769027"], "inbound_citations": ["29101497", "21527426"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13938978"}

Three nonparametric algorithms performed the wall-to-wall forest type classification. The forest type maps were assessed using unused test plots. Results shows that RF compared to the other two algorithms with overall accuracy of 70% and kappa coefficient of 0.63 could better classify the forest stand types, while the CART method had the lowest accuracy with overall accuracy of 60% and kappa coefficient of 0.51.

NARX neural network not only has excellent simulation performance but also has outstanding performance in prediction, so it can provide more accurate judgment on the future trends.

Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) would benefit from a BCI that is able to convey information about their basic thoughts and emotions. The possibility to discriminate between emotional states by pattern classification of BOLD signals has been demonstrated in both offline (Lee et al., 2010) and online (Sitaram et al., 2011) situations. A possible way to develop a BCI that can be used by AD patients is through the modulation of cerebral responses with a semantic classical conditioning paradigm (Furdea et al., 2011), moving away from the more common operant conditioning paradigm, which requires subjects to actively self-regulate their brain activation (Birbaumer, 2006). The aim of our study is to condition subjects to associate emotionally negative and positive stimuli as unconditioned stimuli (US) with incongruent and congruent word pairs (eliciting \"negative\" and \"affirmative\" thinking) as conditioned stimuli (CS), respectively. We investigated whether brain signals related to congruent and incongruent word pairs could be classified with more than chance accuracy, in view of an application for basic yes/no communication in AD patients. Methods: The paradigm consisted of six blocks comprising the different phases of conditioning (habituation, acquisition, extinction) (Fig.1). The US, drawn from the International Affective Digitized Sounds (Bradley & Lang, 1999), consisted of a scream and a baby laugh, representing a negative and a positive emotional sound respectively. The CS, presented aurally, were congruent (e.g. 'animal-dog') and incongruent (e.g. 'animal-chair) word pairs. The unconditioned and conditioned responses (UR and CR) were the changes in the BOLD signal related to the CS and US. In the first block, 50 US and 50 CS were presented randomly. In the second and third blocks, 25 congruent word pairs, followed by the baby laugh, and 25 incongruent word pairs, followed by the scream, were presented randomly. In the fourth and fifth blocks, respectively 40% and 20% of the CS were paired with the US. In the sixth block, only the CS was presented. Functional imaging was performed on 11 healthy subjects (6 females, 5 males, age 21-28) on a 3T scanner. To classify the signals corresponding to congruent and incongruent word pairs, both univariate (General Linear Model) and multivariate (Support Vector Machine, SVM) analyses were performed. Results: The data that emerges from the univariate analysis shows that the classical conditioning allows a differentiation of \"yes\" and \"no\" responses. Interestingly, the differential activations took place in brain areas such as insula, superior temporal gyrus and the superior frontal gyrus, which are recognized to be involved in emotional processing (Sitaram et al., 2011). Results from SVM analyses, performed after feature selection from the third, fourth and fifth image after each word pair (temporal-spatial voxel selection performed with a threshold of 7.5% for the percentage of univariately separable samples), indicate that it is possible, after classical conditioning, to discriminate between affirmative and negative responses with more than chance accuracy. Conclusions: The present results are encouraging and show that basic yes/no discrimination may be possible within an fMRI-BCI setting. This discrimination may be obtained using a \"passive\" procedure, such as classical conditioning, which does not require subjects to be actively involved in a task, and can be therefore used with patients with dementia. A further step, which is already in progress, is the testing of the paradigm with AD patients.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1941614419", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:143197730"}

Under industrial conditions, only the sliding distance is easily evaluated in friction processes, while the acquisition of other variables usually implies expensive costs for production centres, such as the integration of sensors in functioning machine-tools. Besides, appropriate datasets are usually very small, because the testing of different friction conditions is also expensive. These two restrictions, small datasets and very few inputs, make it very difficult to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to model the industrial problem. So, the use of the isotropy level of the surface structure is proposed, as another input that is easily evaluated prior to the friction process. In this example, the friction processes of a cubic sample of 102Cr6 (40 HRC) steel and a further element made of X210Cr12 (60 HRC) steel are considered. Different artificial intelligence techniques, such as artificial regression trees, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), radial basis networks (RBFs), and Random Forest, were tested considering the isotropy level as either a nominal or a numeric attribute, to evaluate improvements in the accuracy of surface roughness and loss-of-mass predictions. The results obtained with real datasets showed that RBFs and MLPs provided the most accurate models for loss of mass and surface roughness prediction, respectively. MLPs have slightly higher surface prediction accuracy than Random Forest, although MLP models are very sensitive to the tuning of their parameters (a small mismatch between the learning rate and the momentum in the MLP will drastically reduce the accuracy of the model). In contrast, Random Forest has no parameter to be tuned and its prediction is almost as good as MLPs for surface roughness, so Random Forest will be more suitable for industrial use where no expert in AI model tuning is available. Moreover, the inclusion of the isotropy level in the dataset, especially as a numeric attribute, greatly improved the accuracy of the models, in some cases, by up to 52% for MLPs, and by a smaller proportion of 16% in the Random Forest models in terms of Root Mean Square Error. Finally, Random Forest ensembles only trained with low and very high isotropy level experimental datasets generated reliable models for medium levels of isotropy, thereby offering a solution to reduce the size of training datasets.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rcim.2018.03.011", "venue": null, "journal": "Robotics and Computer-integrated Manufacturing", "mag_id": "2802415864", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["195785285", "215331913", "133608847"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115803572"}

An appropriate metric for data can well represent their distribution and further promote the performance of learning tasks. In this paper, to better describe the heterogeneous distributions of data, we propose a semi-supervised local-to-global metric learning framework from the geometric insight. Our contributions can be summarized as: Firstly, to enlarge the application scope of local metric learning, we introduce the unsupervised information as the regularization term into our smoothly glued nonlinear metric model. Secondly, we propose two different nonlinear semi-supervised metric learning models with two different loss terms, and find that the smooth loss performs better than the hinge loss by comparison results. Thirdly, we have established not only two metric learning models, but also a nonlinear metric learning framework based on local metrics, which includes supervised and semi-supervised as well as linear and nonlinear metric learning. Moreover, we present an intrinsic steepest descent algorithm on the positive definite manifold for implementation of our semi-supervised nonlinear metric learning models with smooth triplet constrain loss. Finally, we compare our approaches with several state-of-the-art methods on a variety of datasets.

BCI systems enable ICU patients to communicate using the electrical activity of their brains. For this purpose, we designed and developed a BCI system comprised of an Android tablet that allows patients to look at the screen to ask for what they need using their Electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded using a wireless wearable BCI. However, there are two main challenges associated with the BCI application. Due to the insufficient screen refresh rate of the mobile device, the flickering stimuli is imprecise. Hence, we introduce a partition-based feature extraction and fusion method using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Power Spectral Density Analysis (PSDA) to overcome this limitation. Also, BCI devices require a calibration stage in order to capture subject-specific information, which might be particularly troublesome for ICU patients. WE hypothesize that inducing subject related information in the model training and adaptation improves the overall SSVEP identification performance with minimal calibration requirements. As such, We propose a three stage Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based model training and subject adaptation: 1) we generate a subject independent universal GMM model, 2) we generate subject-dependent identification models using only a few collected SSVEP segments from each patient, and 3) we form a vector out of the subject-dependent GMMs and pass it to Support Vector Machine (SVM) for SSVEP target frequency identification.

To solve this problem, speeding prediction is recognized as a critical step in a pre-warning system. While previous studies have shown that speeding is affected by road environmental design, research in predicting speeding behavior through road environment features has not yet been conducted. Furthermore, there is a large discrepancy between actual and perceived road environmental information given that a driver\u2019s visual perception plays a crucial role as the dominant source of information in determining driver\u2019s behavior. Thus, this paper aims to establish a speeding prediction model based on quantifying the visual road environment to improve the design of pre-waring systems, which can predict whether drivers are going to speed and provide them with visual or/and audio warnings about their current driving speed and the speed limit prior to the occurrence of speeding behavior. Twenty input variables derived from three categories including visual road environment parameters, vehicle kinematic features, and driver characteristics were considered in the proposed speeding prediction model. Especially, the road environmental design factors consisting of the visual road geometry and visual roadside environment as perceived by the driver\u2019s eyes were quantified using a visual road environment model. Field experiments were conducted to collect naturalistic driving data concerning speeding behavior on the typical two-lane mountainous rural highways in five provinces of China. Random Forests, an ensemble learning method for regression and classification, were applied to build the speeding prediction model and variable importance was calculated. Additionally, logistic regression was used as a supplement to further investigate factors impacting on speeding behavior. A speeding criterion was defined with two levels in this study: a lower level (exceeding the posted speed limit) and a higher level (10% above the posted speed limit). Under both levels of the speeding criterion, the speeding prediction model performed well with high accuracy (over 85%). This model could use the value of the variables obtained from the current position to predict drivers\u2019 speeding behavior at the future position located a sighting distance away. This interval was sufficient for a pre-warning system to give a speeding warning that a driver with normal perception-reaction time (around 2.5 s) could respond to. Findings in this study can be used to effectively predict speeding in advance and help to reduce speeding-related traffic accidents.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31177040", "doi": "10.1016/j.aap.2019.05.011", "venue": "Accident; analysis and prevention", "journal": "Accident; analysis and prevention", "mag_id": "2950242191", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210160765"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:182951940"}

However, manual classification of the cause or events leading to injury found in large batches of narratives, such as workers compensation claims databases, can be prohibitive. In this study we compare the utility of four machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Single word and Bi-gram models, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression) for classifying narratives into Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Injury and Illness event leading to injury classifications for a large workers compensation database. These algorithms are known to do well classifying narrative text and are fairly easy to implement with off-the-shelf software packages such as Python. We propose human-machine learning ensemble approaches which maximize the power and accuracy of the algorithms for machine-assigned codes and allow for strategic filtering of rare, emerging or ambiguous narratives for manual review. We compare human-machine approaches based on filtering on the prediction strength of the classifier vs. agreement between algorithms. Regularized Logistic Regression (LR) was the best performing algorithm alone. Using this algorithm and filtering out the bottom 30% of predictions for manual review resulted in high accuracy (overall sensitivity/positive predictive value of 0.89) of the final machine-human coded dataset. The best pairings of algorithms included Naive Bayes with Support Vector Machine whereby the triple ensemble NB SW = NB BI-GRAM = SVM had very high performance (0.93 overall sensitivity/positive predictive value and high accuracy (i.e. high sensitivity and positive predictive values)) across both large and small categories leaving 41% of the narratives for manual review. Integrating LR into this ensemble mix improved performance only slightly. For large administrative datasets we propose incorporation of methods based on human-machine pairings such as we have done here, utilizing readily-available off-the-shelf machine learning techniques and resulting in only a fraction of narratives that require manual review.

Previous empirical analysis shows that those features can contain appropriate semantic information. Therefore, with a model trained on a large-scale benchmark data set (e.g., ImageNet), the extracted features can work well on other tasks. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon and demonstrate that deep features can be suboptimal due to the fact that they are learned by minimizing the empirical risk. When the data distribution of the target task is different from that of the benchmark data set, the performance of deep features can degrade. Hence, we propose a hierarchically robust optimization method to learn more generic features. Considering the example-level and concept-level robustness simultaneously, we formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization problem with Wasserstein ambiguity set constraints, and an efficient algorithm with the conventional training pipeline is proposed.

Raw EEG signal were segmented and averaged into the ERP signal according to the event stimulus occur. Discrete Wavelet Transform technique is preferred to decompose the ERP signal into different frequency band. ERP signal at alpha frequency is used because of alpha is the most prominent component of brain waves activity. The necessary features were extracted as an input for the Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Consequence indicated that the accuracy and mean performance results were significant in predicting either a child had working memory impairment or not. 7 years old have lower accuracy compared to other groups with 60% for LR and 86% for SVM. In conclusion, the study proposed that age-related changes and increasing level of visual stimuli affect working memory impaired.

In this paper, we focus on adapting Bagging and Adaboost to SVM. The framework of Bagging is extended by introducing the Class-wise expert classifiers, then we proposed the improved algorithm CeBag. The weighting rule of AdaBoost is modified to deal with the overfitting problem which may be even worse when boosting strong classifiers, and the strength of SVM is weakened by adaptively adjusting the kernel parameters, then we proposed the algorithm WwBoost.

The detection of smiling has many applications, for example, controlling camera shutter when a smile is detected and measuring the degree of satisfaction during a video conference. Many feature extraction methods have been proposed for detecting a smile in the unconstrained scenarios. However, the dimensions of most existing feature descriptors are too huge, which limits their real applications. Moreover, features should be more effective to distinguish between smile face and non-smile face. Motivated by the observation that the mouth shape can effectively reflect a person's smile state, we extracted a novel and snappy set of features that form a feature vector named Pair-wise Distance Vector, which is calculated only based on few points around a mouth. After that, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is adopted to classify smile based on these features.

In the detection step, the region of interest (sign area) is segmented using color based thresholding algorithm, post processed to filter the unwanted region. Next robust features vector named Distance to Borders (DtBs) of the segmented blob is formed to verify the shape of the traffic sign. Finally the recognition of the traffic sign is implemented using ANN classifier upon the training of hybrid features descriptor. The proposed system simulated on offline road scene images shows a high classification rate in the recognition stage. The performance of the ANN model is illustrated in terms of cross entropy, confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In addition, the performance of hybrid feature descriptor is compared with recognition based on HOG and SURF descriptor respectively. Also, performances of some classifier such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, Ensembles Learners (Adaboost) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier are assessed with ANN approach.

In effect, the information provided by the training signal for each task serves as a domain-specific inductive bias for the other tasks. Frequently the world gives us clusters of related tasks to learn. When it does not, it is often straightforward to create additional tasks. For many domains, acquiring inductive bias by collecting additional teaching signal may be more practical than the traditional approach of codifying domain-specific biases acquired from human expertise. We call this approach Multitask Learning (MTL). Since much of the power of an inductive learner follows directly from its inductive bias, multitask learning may yield more powerful learning.

In this paper, we propose to make full use of unpaired data, which are typically abundant, along with a single paired MRI-CT data to construct a one-shot generative adversarial model for automated MRI segmentation of CMF bony structures. Our model consists of a cross-modality image synthesis sub-network, which learns the mapping between CT and MRI, and an MRI segmentation sub-network. These two sub-networks are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, in the training phase, a neighbor-based anchoring method is proposed to reduce the ambiguity problem inherent in cross-modality synthesis, and a feature-matching-based semantic consistency constraint is proposed to encourage segmentation-oriented MRI synthesis.

The proposed method, named E-SLUPC (Ensemble SLUPC), uses SLUPC to search discriminative motifs from an extended labeled dataset that contains labeled data and unlabeled data with predicted labels. Strong discriminative and frequent motifs characterizing two out- come classes of hepatitis C virus treatment (sustained viral response and non-sustained viral response) were detected and analyzed.

Since the fluid flow can be strongly influenced by multiple flow control factors, including the connectivity of the fracture network, the spatial distribution of fractures (e.g. fracture intensity), and the contrast of flow properties between fractures and the matrix, the fluid flow behaviour of a fractured system, with respect to flow control factors, may show multiple distinctive modes. Clearly the existence of different modes indicates a need for a multi-modal approach to incorporating effective flow properties in the coarser-scale flow simulation. However, the intrinsic non-linearity of such relationships and the high dimensionality of the factors make it difficult to identify such relationships, let alone to distinguish the distinctive modes among them. In this work, a non-linear analysis, based on a machine learning method - Support Vector Machine (SVM), was considered for identifying the relationships. It was applied to two simple fractured systems in 2D, each of which was characterised by a set of distributional parameters and a stochastic fracture modelling procedure. For each system, equally-plausible fracture models were generated, and the single-phase steady-state fluid flow was simulated for each model. The relationships between the simulated fluid flow, in a form of upscaled permeability, and a number of flow control factors, were then analysed. The results showed the existence of complex and multi-modal relationships between the upscaled permeability and the control factors in each system, with distinctive features between the systems. The implications of not employing a multi-modal approach in a coarser-scale simulation are obvious: the upscaled flow properties can be significantly mis-estimated.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3997/2214-4609.201402545", "venue": "ECMOR X - 10th European Conference on the Mathematics of Oil Recovery", "journal": "ECMOR X - 10th European Conference on the Mathematics of Oil Recovery", "mag_id": "2612008758,2083515680", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67198422"}

In real applications, labeled data generally are difficult to obtain while unlabeled data are sufficient and helpful to improve the accuracy of classifier. Bipartition based clustering method is to generate better initial cluster centers and to preselect representative data samples from each cluster region with given area under clustering model. To attack the quantity and quality problems of training samples, we propose a Cluster-based Classification Algorithm (CCA) for remote sensing images, and different data samples selection methods are evaluated. Using this approach, the confident unlabeled data both cluster centroid and the ones nearest to the centroid are labeled as training data and extracted. SVM can subsequently be trained with the labeled dataset. The conducted experiments by clustering and classification on real remote sensing Images have validated the proposed approach.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656915", "venue": "IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS", "journal": "IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1983658098", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["28637672", "11081015", "11099627", "16721854", "8714672", "15126739", "63972956", "22400448", "46323653", "1383241", "2374498", "11257471"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15363862"}

Such models allow us to predict the area of landslide occurrence during an earthquake under similar conditions in the future. On April 14, 2010 a catastrophic earthquake with Mw 6.9 struck Yushu County, Qinghai Province, China. After this event, a total of 2036 landslides were interpreted from aerial photographs and satellite images, verified by field investigations, distributed in a rectangle area of 1455.3 km2. The aim of this study is to carry out spatial prediction modelling of landslides in this rectangle area using several types of kernel functions based on GIS and the support vector machine (SVM) model. A spatial database, including landslides and associated controlling factors which may have influence on the occurrence of landslides, was developed and analyzed using GIS technology. The 12 controlling factors, including elevation, slope angles, slope aspect, slope curvatures, slope positions, drainages, lithology, faults, roads, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), co-seismic surface ruptures, and peak ground acceleration (PGA) were selected as the prediction factors. The landslide spatial prediction mapping were produced by using several types of kernel functions such as linear function, polynomial function, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid function based on the SVM model. Then landslide hazard index maps, landslide hazard rank maps, and prediction result maps for the Yushu event were created separately. The success rates of the four types of kernel functions are 79.87%, 83.45%, 84.16%, and 64.62%, respectively. The results show that radial basis function (RBF) is the best kernel function among the four kernel functions for spatial prediction mapping of landslides by the Yushu earthquake. The training and discussion of the model were also carried out based on other three different groups of random distribution training samples and one group of regular distribution training samples.

NIRS has become the convenient technology for experimental brain purposes. The change of oxygenation changes (oxy-Hb) along task period depending on location of channel on the cortex has been studied: sustained activation in the motor cortex, transient activation during the initial segments in the somatosensory cortex, and accumulating activation in the frontal lobe (Gentili et al., 2010). Oxy-Hb concentration at the aforementioned sites in the brain can also be used as a predictive factor allows prediction of subject\u2019s investigation behavior with a considerable degree of precision (Shimokawa et al., 2009). In this paper, a study of recognition algorithm will be described for recognition whether one taps the left hand or the right hand. Data with noises and artifacts collected from a multi-channel system will be pre-processed using a Savitzky- Golay filter for getting more smoothly data. Characteristics of the filtered signals during left and right hand tapping process will be extracted using a polynomial regression algorithm. Coefficients of the polynomial, which correspond to Oxygen-Hemoglobin (Oxy- Hb) concentration, will be applied for the recognition models of hand tapping. Support Vector Machines (SVM) will be applied to validate the obtained coefficient data for hand tapping recognition. In addition, for the objective of comparison, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) was also applied to recognize hand tapping side with the same principle.

Accurate diagnosis of ovarian cancer from acquired images is dependent on the expertise and experience of ultrasonographers or physicians, and is therefore, associated with inter observer variabilities. Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) techniques use a number of different data mining techniques to automatically predict the presence or absence of cancer, and therefore, are more reliable and accurate. A review of published literature in the field of CAD based ovarian cancer detection indicates that many studies use ultrasound images as the base for analysis. The key objective of this work is to propose an effective adjunct CAD technique called GyneScan for ovarian tumor detection in ultrasound images. In our proposed data mining framework, we extract several texture features based on first order statistics, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix and run length matrix. The significant features selected using t-test are then used to train and test several supervised learning based classifiers such as Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Na\u00efve Bayes (NB). We evaluated the developed framework using 1300 benign and 1300 malignant images. Using 11 significant features in KNN/PNN classifiers, we were able to achieve 100% classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value in detecting ovarian tumor. Even though more validation using larger databases would better establish the robustness of our technique, the preliminary results are promising. This technique could be used as a reliable adjunct method to existing imaging modalities to provide a more confident second opinion on the presence/absence of ovarian tumor.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4527478", "pubmed_id": "24325128", "doi": "10.7785/tcrtexpress.2013.600273", "venue": null, "journal": "Technology in Cancer Research & Treatment", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1991113411", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["22772515", "14832615", "7444449", "34533907", "43431764", "13047546", "206536501", "8957614", "57158747", "39293108", "21469320", "44874924", "45837987", "27565636", "12750981", "26176929", "21450502", "34097087", "18012589", "37185906", "12371600", "14778245", "58452344", "7381025", "6508500", "27706674", "14168388", "14865254", "25642188", "19562744", "33615071", "206786900", "62642944", "7138354", "13252401", "120323383", "12946615", "15189518", "206764015", "21072740", "385221", "24943841", "21435078", "22311486", "35663201", "9928799"], "inbound_citations": ["5592904", "109929914", "53714519", "81629639", "16901767"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195684917"}

Next, gait features are extracted with the optimal ::: feature map by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and then a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) ::: is used as the one-against-all multiclass classifier. ::: Four gait compact images including Gait Energy Image (GEI), Gait Entropy Image (GEnI), Gait Gaussian ::: Image (GGI) and the novel gait images called Gait Gaussian Entropy Image (GGEnI) are used as basic ::: gait representations. Then three secondary gait representations are generated from these basic ::: representations. These include Gradient Histogram Gait Image (GHGI) and two novel gait ::: representations called Convolutional Gait Image (CGI) and Convolutional Gradient Histogram Gait ::: Image (CGHGI). All representations are tested with three main tasks. ::: When people walk, each body part does not have the same locomotion information, for example, ::: there is much more motion in the leg than shoulder motion when walking. Moreover, clothing and ::: carrying objects do not have the same level of affect to every part of the body, for example, a handbag ::: does not generally affect leg motion. This study divides the human body into fourteen different body ::: parts based on height. Body parts and gait representations are combined to solve the three main tasks. ::: Three combined parts techniques which use two different parts to solve the problem are created. The ::: fist is Part Scores Fusion (PSF) which uses the summation score of two models based on each part. The ::: highest summation score model is chosen as the result. The second is Part Image Fusion (PIF) which ::: concatenates two parts into a single image with a 1:1 ratio. The highest scoring model which is ::: generated from image fusion is selected as the result. The third is Multi Region Duplication (MRD) ::: which uses the same idea as PIF, however, the second part\u2019s ratio is increased to 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4. ::: These techniques are tested on the gait recognition by identical view. ::: In conclusion, the general framework is effectively for three main tasks. GHGI-GEI which is generated ::: from full silhouette is the most effective representation for gait recognition by identical view and cross ::: view recognition.

GANs were utilized to map a white noise input to a CT noise realization with correct CT noise correlations specific to a single local uniform ROI. To achieve this, a two-stage strategy was developed. In the pre-training stage, ensembles of 64x64 MBIR noise-only images of a quality assurance phantom were used as training samples to jointly train the generator and discriminator. They were fined-tuned using training samples from a single 101x101 ROI of an abdominal anthropomorphic phantom. Results from GANs and physical scans were compared in terms of its mean frequency and radial averaged NPS. This workflow was extended to a patient case where reference dose and 25% of reference dose CT scans were provided for fine-tuning. GANs generated noise-only image samples that are indistinguishable from physical measurement. The overall mean frequency discrepancy between NPS generated from GANs and those from physically acquired data was 0.2% for anthropomorphic phantom validation. The KL divergence for 1D radial averaged NPS profile of these two NPS acquisitions was 2.2\u00d710^(-3). Statistical test indicates trained GANs generated equivalent NPS to physical scans. In clinical patient-specific NPS studies, it showed a distinction between the reference dose case and 25% of reference dose case.

A proper cancer analysis demands the classification of several types of tumor. Investigations into microarray gene expressions seem to be a successful platform for revising genetic diseases.

To achieve a reasonable and efficient DNA microarray dataset information, there is a need to extend the level of interpretability and forecast approach while maintaining a great level of precision. In this work, a novel way of cancer classification based on based gene expression profiles is presented. This method is a combination of both Firefly algorithm and Mutual Information Method. First, the features are used to select the features before using the Firefly algorithm for feature reduction. Finally, the Support Vector Machine is used to classify cancer into types.

The proposed method employs dynamic feature extraction approach to capture most of the inherent dynamic fault information. This leads to an efficient fault detection with superior performance compared to independent component analysis (ICA) approach in both detection rate and number of false alarms. A new statistic measure has been introduced to enhance the monitoring capabilities of ICA and DICA. An approach based on cumulative percent variance (CPV) has been incorporated to mechanize the selection of required number of independent components in both ICA and DICA online monitoring methods. To choose the best time-lag order for each fault dynamic model in the DICA augmented data matrix, a multivariate auto regressive exogenous (ARX) model structure has been adopted by validating the minimum Akaike's information criterion (AIC) index. An online procedure based on a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel function, being set by sub-optimal width parameters, is employed to classify and isolate each fault. The SVM uses one against all (OAA) algorithm for fault classification and sequential minimization optimization (SMO) to solve the classification problem.

Topographic airborne laser scanning has become an established technique to characterize the Earth's surface: lidar provides 3D point clouds allowing for a fine reconstruction of the topography while preserving high frequencies of the relief. For flood hazard modeling, the key step, before going onto terrain modeling, is the discrimination of land and water areas within the delivered point clouds. Therefore, instantaneous shorelines, river banks, and inland waters can be extracted as a basis for more reliable DTM generation. This paper presents an automatic, efficient, and versatile workflow for land/water classification of airborne topographic lidar points, effective at large scales (> 300 km 2 ). For that purpose, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is used as a classification framework and it is embedded in a workflow designed for our specific goal. First, a restricted but carefully designed set of features, based only on 3D lidar point coordinates and flightline information, is defined as classifier input. Then, the SVM learning step is performed on small but well-targeted areas thanks to a semi-automatic region growing strategy. Finally, label probability output by SVM is merged with contextual knowledge during a probabilistic relaxation step in order to remove pixel-wise misclassification. Results show that a survey of hundreds of millions of points are labeled with high accuracy (> 95% in most cases for coastal areas, and > 90% for rivers) and that small natural and anthropic features of interest are still well classified even though we work at low point densities (0.5\u20134 pts/m 2 ).

Furthermore, the proposed approach has been compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with support vector machines (PSO-SVMs) and SVM using RBF kernel function.

Recently, it has been shown that if each data class is linearly spanned by a subspace of unknown dimensions and the data are noiseless, the lowest-rank representation (LRR) of a set of test vector samples with respect to a set of training vector samples has the nature of being both dense for within-class affinities and almost zero for between-class affinities. Consequently, the LRR exactly reveals the classification of the data, resulting into the so-called Low-Rank Representation-based Classification (LRRC). The performance of the LRRC is compared against three well-known classifiers, namely the Sparse Representations-based Classifier, Support Vector Machines, and Nearest Neighbor classifiers for music mood classification by conducting experiments on the MTV and the Soundtracks180 datasets.

Some basic ideas on the approach to the data level by using sampling-based approaches to handle this classification issue are under sampling and oversampling. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is one of oversampling methods to increase number of positive class using sample drawing techniques by randomly replicate the data in such way that the number of positive class is equal to the number of negative class.

Essentially, the adversarial process of TGAN takes place in a tensor space. First, we impose tensor structures for concise image representation, which is superior in capturing the pixel proximity information and the spatial patterns of elementary objects in images, over the vectorization preprocess in existing works. Secondly, we propose TGAN that integrates deep convolutional generative adversarial networks and tensor super-resolution in a cascading manner, to generate high-quality images from random distributions. More specifically, we design a tensor super-resolution process that consists of tensor dictionary learning and tensor coefficients learning.

The proposed approach is based on a hybrid generative-discriminative model. Firstly, a generative approach based on an Expectation-Maximization framework that incorporates a glioma growth model is used to segment the brain scans into tumor, as well as healthy tissue labels. Secondly, a gradient boosting multi-class classification scheme is used to refine tumor labels based on information from multiple patients. Lastly, a probabilistic Bayesian strategy is employed to further refine and finalize the tumor segmentation based on patient-specific intensity statistics from the multiple modalities. We evaluated our approach in 186 cases during the training phase of the BRAin Tumor Segmentation (BRATS) 2015 challenge and report promising results. During the testing phase, the algorithm was additionally evaluated in 53 unseen cases, achieving the best performance among the competing methods.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5513179", "pubmed_id": "28725877", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-30858-6_1", "venue": "Brainlesion : glioma, multiple sclerosis, stroke and traumatic brain injuries.

However, the questionnaire commonly used for personality prediction has some inherent limitations such as inefficiency and proneness to cheating. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on data mining to determine students' personality traits in particular the extraversion and introversion. Real data set comes from 79 undergraduate students at Chongqing University. We use the results of the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Short Scale for Chinese (EPQ-RSC) as class labels. Then, three classical classifiers are trained to infer the extraverts and introverts by the features which are extracted from web browsing history and consumption records of campus cards. The experimental results show that the linear SVM performs best with approximate accuracy of 72% and F-measure of 77%. According to our work, it's promising to predict students' extraversion-introversion traits using classification method based on campus data.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CW.2016.27", "venue": "2016 International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW)", "journal": "2016 International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2549902835", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["198338281", "150168703", "56161850", "214736935", "131777356"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21289871"}
