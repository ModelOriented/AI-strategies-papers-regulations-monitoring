In some agricultural production systems, optimized water table management represents a significant factor to improve crop yields and water use. Therefore, predicting water table depth (WTD) becomes an important means to enable real-time planning and management of groundwater resources. This study proposes a decision-tree-based modelling approach for WTD forecasting as a function of precipitation, previous WTD values and evapotranspiration with applications in groundwater resources management for cranberry farming. Firstly, two decision-tree-based models, namely Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were parameterized and compared to predict the WTD up to 48 -h ahead for a cranberry farm located in Quebec, Canada. Secondly, the importance of the predictor variables was analyzed to determine their influence on WTD simulation results. WTD measurements at three observation wells within a cranberry field, for the growing period from July 8, 2017 to August 30, 2017, were used for training and testing the models. Statistical parameters such as the mean squared error, coefficient of determination and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient were used to measure models performance. The results show that the XGB model outperformed the RF model for all predictions of WTD and was, accordingly, selected as the optimal model. Among the predictor variables, the antecedent WTD was the most important for water table depth simulation, followed by the precipitation. Based on the most important variables and optimal model, the prediction error for entire WTD range was within \u00b15 cm for 1-, 12-, 24-, 36- and 48 -h predictions.

Social media can be regarded as indicator for sentiments and sentiments are known to influence the stock market. Current models lack interpretation; it is difficult to determine what data is relevant for stock market prediction, since there is an abundance of social media data. A regression method that induces sparsity is thus required; data that is not useful is discarded automatically. The LASSO induces sparsity via L1-regularization; however, the covariance and confidence of the found regression coefficients cannot be derived easily, while this is important for interpretation. This thesis therefore reviews all known methods for approximating the covariance and confidence interval for the LASSO and determines their accuracy using numerical simulations. A new method is proposed based on the Unscented Transform, which outcompetes all methods in the underdetermined scenario, where there are more features than data points. Unfortunately, linear regression via the LASSO has limited use for stock markets as the achieved prediction accuracy is low. Nonlinear models are often applied for stock market prediction to achieve higher accuracies. Therefore a new feature selection method is proposed for the nonlinear Support Vector Regression (SVR) to select the correct data for stock market prediction using the SVR. This method yields accurate feature selection when the number of features to select from is low.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "133629798", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207828891"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53834968"}

Mexico Introduction We present the adaptation and computer implementation of a reading model for the recognition of cursive handwriting. We follow an analytic implicit approach based on the extraction of the singular part of the word (Simon, 1992). The system has been entirely built on neural networks with the following stages: feature extraction based on sigma-pi neural network detectors, string pre-recognition based on a convolutional neural network and word recognition based on an interactive activation network. The results obtained on an English check amount database are among the best results available in the literature for the same database. addition that it presents some practical advantages over other approaches. System Description Background Even when the global architecture of our system follows the classical approach (pre-processing, feature extraction, pre- recognition, and recognition), its implementation presents the following novel characteristics: the feature extraction stage extracts features presumably involved in human reading (line segments, closure), by using a feed-forward sigma-pi neural network, presenting a strong resemblance with the model of orientation selectivity (Hubel and Weasel, 1962); the string pre-recognition stage is performed by using a convolutional neural network; and the word recognition stage is performed by using an interactive activation network. Thus, this system is an extension McClelland and Rumelhart\u2019s model for the recognition of real cursive words. The human visual system (HVS) is, without doubt, the best word recognition system, so it is natural to take inspiration from studies about the human reading process and in general from studies about the function and architecture of the HVS to develop automatic reading systems. Nowadays, thanks to advances in neurosciences and experimental psychology as well as the availability of powerful computer resources, it is possible to simulate more elaborate models of the functions of the HVS. Unfortunately, only a few automatic word recognition systems have explored the perception oriented approach, e.g. systems based on reading models (verification model, interactive activation model, PDP models) and systems based on features presumably used during the recognition process (word shape, first letter, ascenders, descenders, loops, word-length). Mozer (1987) developed a system based on Parallel Distributed Processing models (PDP). The processing is strictly bottom-up, and the system is able to recognize many words simultaneously, and can explain some psychological effects, such as letter transpositions, incertitude in the position of letters and words, etc. The primitives utilized in this system are: vertical, horizontal and diagonal segments, and extreme points. LeColinet (1993) has developed a system based on top-down verification (backward- matching). Cote et al (1998) have developed a system based on the interactive activation model (IAM) and the verification mode. The key idea of our approach is to have a totally connectionist model, from feature extraction to recognition; incorporating the notion of receptive fields, the pre- recognition of letter strings and word recognition by means of an interactive activation network. This choice is mainly due to the fact that the interactive activation model is able to account for most psychological effects in reading, in Results The recognition rate, tested on the CENPARMI database of English check amounts, reached 90.54%, which is among the highest results for this database. Additionally, important effects of the lexical access, such as the word superiority effect and the outside-in effect are naturally included as part of the architecture of the system. A practical advantage is that the system can be applied to large vocabulary applications. References Cote, M., Lecolinet, E., Cheriet, M. & Suen, C.Y. (1998).

The automated testing goals were achieved by jointly optimizing two objective functions: maximizing differential behaviors from models under testing and maximizing neuron coverage. By observing differential behaviors from three pre-trained models during each testing iteration, the input image that triggered erroneous feedback was registered as a corner-case. The generated corner-cases can be used to examine the robustness of DNNs and consequently improve model accuracy. A project called DeepXplore was also used as a baseline model. After we fully implemented and optimized the baseline system, we explored its application as an augmenting training dataset with newly generated corner cases. With the GTRSB dataset, by retraining the model based on automated generated corner cases, the accuracy of three generic models increased by 259.2%, 53.6%, and 58.3%, respectively. Further, to extend the capability of automated testing, we explored other approaches based on differential behavior criteria to generate photo-realistic images for deep learning systems. One approach was to apply various transformations to the seed images for the deep learning framework. The other approach was to utilize the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technique, which was implemented on MNIST and Driving datasets. The style transferring capability has been observed very effective in adding additional visual effects, replacing image elements, and style-shifting (virtual image to real images).

We review the literature in order to provide a general overview by identifying the status-of-practice and the challenges ahead. Methods: The nine data mining steps proposed by Fayyad in 1996 [4] were used as the main themes of the review. MEDLINE was used as primary source and 84 papers were retained based on our inclusion criteria. Results: Clinical data mining has three objectives: understanding the clinical data, assist healthcare professionals, and develop a data analysis methodology suitable for medical data. Classification is the most frequently used data mining function with a predominance of the implementation of Bayesian classifiers, neural networks, and SVMs (Support Vector Machines). A myriad of quantitative performance measures were proposed with a predominance of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves. The latter are usually associated with qualitative evaluation. Conclusion: Clinical data mining respects its commitment to extracting new and previously unknown knowledge from clinical databases. More efforts are still needed to obtain a wider acceptance from the healthcare professionals and for generalization of the knowledge and reproducibility of its extraction process: better description of variables, systematic report of algorithm parameters including the method to obtain them, use of easy-to-understand models and comparisons of the efficiency of clinical data mining with traditional statistical analyses. More and more data will be available for data miners and they have to develop new methodologies and infrastructures to analyze the increasingly complex medical data.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "19855885", "doi": "10.1055/s-0038-1638651", "venue": "Yearbook of medical informatics", "journal": "Yearbook of medical informatics", "mag_id": "90732934", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207199275", "30980184", "22765262", "11008148", "52346782", "10845972", "214794734", "20605586", "44142050", "7106183", "1590323", "9269722", "1994248", "53634610", "3081642", "6975928", "9104517", "6862877", "56118538", "214912623", "55949362", "49584039", "52921058", "54861151", "17234287", "16023166", "14485320", "61181599", "215110616", "195179498", "30003628", "214945150", "208142488", "212538921", "13527075", "12739447", "25689055", "59585134", "202680361"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38001018"}

Sparse transfer learning is used to extract effective structural information of PD speech features from public datasets as source domain data, and the fast ADDM iteration is improved to enhance the information extraction performance. To implement the parallel optimization, the potential relationships between samples and features are considered to obtain high-quality combined features. First, features are extracted from a specific public speech dataset to construct a feature dataset as the source domain. Then, the PD target domain, including the training and test datasets, is encoded by convolution sparse coding, which can extract more in-depth information. Next, parallel optimization is implemented. To further improve the classification performance, a convolution kernel optimization mechanism is designed. Using two representative public datasets and one self-constructed dataset, the experiments compare over thirty relevant algorithms. The results show that when taking the Sakar dataset, MaxLittle dataset and DNSH dataset as target domains, the proposed algorithm achieves obvious improvements in classification accuracy.

Second, the bipolar regions are extracted by applying multi-scale circular harmonic filters. Third, the extracted bipolar regions are traced in consecutive MDI frames by Kalman filter as candidate EFRs. Fourth, the properties, such as positive and negative magnetic fluxes and distance between two polarities, are measured in each frame.

In this study we assessed the classification performance of TMS parameters in the differential diagnosis of common neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We performed a multicenter study enrolling patients referred to four dementia centers in Italy, in accordance with the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy. All patients underwent TMS assessment at recruitment (index test), with application of reference clinical criteria, to predict different neurodegenerative disorders. The investigators who performed the index test were masked to the results of the reference test and all other investigations. We trained and tested a Random Forests classifier using 5-fold cross validation. The primary outcome measures were the classification accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score of TMS in differentiating each neurodegenerative disorder. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: 694 participants were included, namely 273 patients diagnosed as AD, 67 as DLB, 207 as FTD, and 147 as healthy controls (HC). A series of 3 binary classifiers was employed, and the prediction model exhibited high classification accuracy (ranging from 0.89 to 0.92), high precision (0.86-0.92), high recall (0.93-0.98), and high F1 scores (0.89-0.95), in differentiating each neurodegenerative disorder. ::: ::: ::: INTERPRETATION ::: TMS is a non-invasive procedure which reliably and selectively distinguishes AD, DLB, FTD and HC, representing a useful additional screening tool to be used in clinical practice.

Conventional approaches for pose-invariant face recognition either perform face frontalization on, or learn a pose-invariant representation from, a non-frontal face image. We argue that it is more desirable to perform both tasks jointly to allow them to leverage each other. To this end, this paper proposes Disentangled Representation learning-Generative Adversarial Network (DR-GAN) with three distinct novelties. First, the encoder-decoder structure of the generator allows DR-GAN to learn a generative and discriminative representation, in addition to image synthesis.

This paper proposes a feature-selection method for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning. Like most feature-selection methods, the proposed method ranks all features in decreasing order of importance so that more relevant features can be identified. It uses a novel criterion based on the probabilistic outputs of SVM. This criterion, termed Feature-based Sensitivity of Posterior Probabilities (FSPP), evaluates the importance of a specific feature by computing the aggregate value, over the feature space, of the absolute difference of the probabilistic outputs of SVM with and without the feature. The exact form of this criterion is not easily computable and approximation is needed. Four approximations, FSPP1-FSPP4, are proposed for this purpose. The first two approximations evaluate the criterion by randomly permuting the values of the feature among samples of the training data. They differ in their choices of the mapping function from standard SVM output to its probabilistic output: FSPP1 uses a simple threshold function while FSPP2 uses a sigmoid function. The second two directly approximate the criterion but differ in the smoothness assumptions of criterion with respect to the features. The performance of these approximations, used in an overall feature-selection scheme, is then evaluated on various artificial problems and real-world problems, including datasets from the recent Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) feature selection competition. FSPP1-3 show good performance consistently with FSPP2 being the best overall by a slight margin. The performance of FSPP2 is competitive with some of the best performing feature-selection methods in the literature on the datasets that we have tested. Its associated computations are modest and hence it is suitable as a feature-selection method for SVM applications.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10994-007-5025-7", "venue": "Machine Learning", "journal": "Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2151208049", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["207165665", "5885974", "207738357", "89141", "961425", "14607075", "11402854", "9585527", "206787478", "60486887", "5292272", "379259", "61649919", "60626986", "18843838", "10097148", "9988056", "15943670", "1421150", "60287558", "6445796", "8473401", "8688051", "209099422", "56563878", "10142996", "3144723", "14260851", "7138354", "28637672", "1871891", "2860274", "2877073"], "inbound_citations": ["2720773", "18526012", "5688416", "12689297", "1750450", "18457854", "90579667", "2743830", "14159689", "69646316", "27681425", "9138762", "16519609", "4531101", "16910335", "22804298", "1467748", "7381587", "11990131", "14187971", "10013400", "215001588", "20237528", "204876071", "10504236", "15848575", "116141665", "17774650"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9051537"}

In this retrospective pilot study we explored whether serum metabolomic profile can discriminate the presence of human breast cancer irrespective of the cancer subtype. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Plasma samples were analyzed from healthy women (n = 20) and patients with breast cancer after diagnosis (n = 91) using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry platform. Multivariate statistics and a Random Forest (RF) classifier were used to create a metabolomics panel for the diagnosis of human breast cancer. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Metabolomics correctly distinguished between breast cancer patients and healthy control subjects. In the RF supervised class prediction analysis comparing breast cancer and healthy control groups, RF accurately classified 100% both samples of the breast cancer patients and healthy controls. So, the class error for both group in and the out-of-bag error were 0. We also found 1269 metabolites with different concentration in plasma from healthy controls and cancer patients; and basing on exact mass, retention time and isotopic distribution we identified 35 metabolites. These metabolites mostly support cell growth by providing energy and building stones for the synthesis of essential biomolecules, and function as signal transduction molecules. The collective results of RF, significance testing, and false discovery rate analysis identified several metabolites that were strongly associated with breast cancer. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: In breast cancer a metabolomics signature of cancer exists and can be detected in patient plasma irrespectively of the breast cancer type.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5386702", "pubmed_id": "28076849", "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.14521", "venue": "Oncotarget", "journal": "Oncotarget", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2570561340", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3783620", "13760895", "15611977", "527894", "16661576", "10264315", "41113478", "27402761", "205372483", "10677632", "9277390", "10880345", "2378937", "19806776", "15530144", "26053193", "8234811", "5101908", "10095058", "8128294", "24564292", "11685018", "11108784", "1177796", "16432872", "14818715", "25755559", "25465560", "17110052", "21429483", "1113966", "9619856", "19193143", "11086966", "37720021", "33042508", "207016009", "74161920", "10601820", "25568391", "7863753", "205181228", "27600869", "5241766"], "inbound_citations": ["214774540", "84842003", "201020350", "3486777", "53232358", "163166016", "215723877", "3295266"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18223763"}

Currently, neuropsychiatric categorization provides the ground truth for AD and MCI diagnosis. This can then be supported by biological data such as the results of imaging studies. Cerebral atrophy has been shown to correlate strongly with cognitive symptoms. Hence, Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of the brain are important resources for AD diagnosis. In the proposed method, we used three different types of features identified from structural MR images: Gabor, hippocampus morphometric, and Two Dimensional (2D) and Three Dimensional (3D) Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The experimental results, obtained using a 5-fold cross-validated Support Vector Machine (SVM) with 2DGLCM and 3DGLCM multi-feature fusion approaches, indicate that we achieved 81.05% \u00b11.34, 86.61% \u00b11.25 correct classification rate with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) falls between (80.75-81.35) and (86.33-86.89) respectively, 83.33%\u00b12.15, 84.21%\u00b11.42 sensitivity and 80.95%\u00b11.52, 85.00%\u00b11.24 specificity in our classification of AD against NC subjects, thus outperforming recent works found in the literature.

In order to reduce this computational effort the use of several kinds of solver surrogates has been proposed in the recent past. Proposals include the Response Surface Method (RSM), Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and several other methods developed in the burgeoning field of Statistical Learning (SL). Many of these techniques can be employed either for function approximation (regression approach) or for pattern recognition (classification approach). This paper concerns the use of these devices for discriminating samples into safe and failure classes using the classification approach, because it constitutes the core of Monte Carlo simulation as applied to reliability analysis as such. Due to the flexibility of most SL methods, a critical step in their use is the generation of the learning population, as it affects the generalization capacity of the surrogate. To this end it is first demonstrated that the optimal population from the information viewpoint lies around in the vicinity of the limit state function. Next, an optimization method assuring a small as well as highly informative learning population is proposed on this basis. It consists in generating a small initial quasi-random population using Sobol sequence for triggering a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) performed over an iteration-dependent cost function defined in terms of the limit state function. The method is evaluated using SVM classifiers, but it can be readily applied also to other statistical classification techniques because the distinctive feature of the SVM, i.e. the margin band, is not actively used in the algorithm. The results show that the method yields results for the probability of failure that are in very close agreement with Monte Carlo simulation performed on the original limit state function and requiring a small number of learning samples.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.probengmech.2009.05.006", "venue": null, "journal": "Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics", "mag_id": "1976835881", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["182255567", "209496025", "123156459", "116148220", "122329022", "11920340", "153312489", "195794739", "15434808"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:120230984"}

The basic concept involves the application of differential protection for the detection of any arcing within the switchgear. The new approach differs from the traditional differential concept in the fact that it employs higher order harmonic components of the line current as the input for the differential scheme. Actual arc generating test-benches have been set up in the Power System Simulation Laboratory at Energy Systems Research Center to represent both medium and low voltage levels. Hall-effect sensors in conjunction with Data Acquisition in LabVIEW are employed to record the line current data before, during and after the arcing phenomenon. The methodology is first put to test via simulation approach for medium voltage levels and then corroborated by actual hardware laboratory testing for low voltage levels. The plots provided from the data gathering and simulation process clearly underline the efficiency of this approach to detect switchgear arcing faults. Both magnitude and phase differential concepts seem to provide satisfactory results. Apart from the technical efficiency, the approach is financially feasible considering the fact that the differential protection is already being comprehensively employed worldwide. Developments spanning a major portion of the previous decade have witnessed the emergence of high/medium/low-voltage arcing fault as one of the more prominent issues confronting the power industry and associated researchers alike. Research over the past decade has been dedicated to the modeling, detection and/or monitoring of arcing faults at various voltage levels and power system apparatuses. Furthermore, the research presented in this dissertation presents and compares the performance of statistical methodologies utilized to classify the severity of low-voltage arcing in a motor coil. The approaches revolve around the utilization of statistical techniques such as Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Spectral Information Divergence (SID) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify the severity of the motor coil arcing fault. ::: Dedicated test-benches are utilized to simulate the arcing phenomenon of varying severity in a motor coil within laboratory environment. Hall-effect sensors in conjunction with the data acquisition module of LabVIEW provide an able means for data collection which is then subjected to off-line analysis. The conceptual approach preceding the classification process revolves around the extraction of pre-decided features associated with the current signal gathered during the arcing process. These features are associated with the higher order harmonic content of the current signal. Comparative analysis of the higher-order harmonic content in the arcing current as obtained from the test-bench and that from contemporary mathematical models for low-voltage arcing faults is presented to validate the choice of parameters for the spectral signature. The extracted features are utilized for classifying the severity of the motor coil arcing fault using the approaches mentioned above. ::: That apart, Support Vector Machines have gained tremendous popularity in the last decade or so in the field of pattern recognition, classification and regression applications. The dissertation also presents the approach, implementation and results associated with the utilization of one-class and multi-class SVM techniques for the classification of motor coil arcing fault severity levels. The data pre-processing, filtering and feature extraction process do remain the same as that utilized for SAM, SID and LDA techniques. However, the Gaussian Kernel function has been utilized to map non-linear scatter spread on to a higher dimension Euclidean space H. The training data is utilized to construct the SVM classifier the parameters of which, such as Lagrangian multipliers, the bias, the penaltyfactor and the number of support vector machines are utilized to test the accuracy of the SVM classification algorithm on the test data. Detailed elaboration on the technique, the implementation methodology and the results has been provided in relevant sections. ::: The performance of the classification approaches has been evaluated based on the accuracy of classification, robustness and feasibility of implementation of the approach. The classification results seem very promising in terms of accuracy and feasibility of approach for real-time implementation.

IAS are deployed in dynamic environments and connected with numerous devices of different types, and receive large sets of diverse data. They often receive new types of raw data that was not present in either training or testing data sets thus they are unknown to the learning models. In a dynamic environment, these unknown data objects cannot be ignored as anomalies. Hence the learning models should provide incremental guarantees to IAS for learning and adapting in the presence of unknown data. The model should support progressive enhancements when the environment behaves as expected or graceful degradations when it does not. In the case of graceful degradations, there are two alternatives for IAS: (1) weaken the acceptance test of data object (operating at a lower capacity) or (2) replace primary system with a replica or an alternate system that can pass the acceptance test. In this paper, we provide a combinatorial design\u2014MACROF configuration\u2014built with balanced incomplete block design to support graceful degradations in IAS and aid them to adapt in dynamic environments. The architecture provides stable and robust degradations in unpredictable operating environments with limited number of replicas. Since the replicas receive frequent updates from primary systems, they can take over primary system's functionality immediately after an adverse event. We also propose a Bayesian learning model to dynamically change the frequency of updates.

Finally, in order to realize the integration of the heterogeneous data for intelligent power distribution and utilization, the well-trained discriminator model of GANs is employed to check the restored data samples. The simulation experiments verified the validity and stability of the proposed heterogeneous data integration method, which provides a novel perspective for the further data quality management of power distribution systems.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/app8010093", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2783008719", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["207218223", "15118479", "14127292", "13680609", "8222444", "4429113", "24952330", "22889992", "61927461", "1495854", "14541551", "3243551", "8850586", "9494752", "8429835", "11758569", "1033682", "6230637"], "inbound_citations": ["115150222", "115150222"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3371423"}

This paper makes an initial attempt to propose a learning based generic modeling approach for user-central definition and automatic extraction of features on arbitrary shapes. Instead of purely resorting to certain local geometric extremes to simply formulate feature metrics, it enables the users to arbitrarily specify application-specific features on training shapes, so that similar features can be automatically extracted from other same-category shapes with isometric or near-isometric deformations. Our key originality is built upon an observation: the geodesic distance from one point to desired feature point on testing shape should be similar to the points on training shapes. To this end, we propose a novel regression model to bridge the massive random-sampled local properties and the desired feature points via incorporating their corresponding geodesic distances into the powerful random forest framework. On that basis, an effective voting strategy is proposed to estimate the locations of the user-specified features on new shapes. Our extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluations have demonstrated many attractive advantages of our method, including being fully-automatic, robust to noise and partial holes, invariant under isometric and near-isometric deformation, and also scale-invariant, which can well facilitate to many downstream geometry-processing applications such as semantic mesh segmentation, mesh skeleton extraction, etc.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cagd.2016.10.003", "venue": "Comput.

Moreover, to handle large-scale graphs, we propose stochastic variants of our kernels with provable approximation guarantees. We evaluate our methods on a wide range of real-world social networks.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to learn grasping patterns from images and data recorded from a dataglove, provided by the TUB Dataset. Our network retrains, a pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) known as AlexNet, to learn deep features from images that correspond to human grasps.

In this work, we assume instead the availability of a relevant feature vector $\\mathbf{f}_i$ per node $i$, from which we compute an optimal feature graph via optimization of a feature metric. Specifically, we alternately optimize the diagonal and off-diagonal entries of a Mahalanobis distance matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ by minimizing the graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) $\\mathbf{z}^{\\top} \\mathbf{L} \\mathbf{z}$, where edge weight is $w_{i,j} = \\exp\\{-(\\mathbf{f}_i - \\mathbf{f}_j)^{\\top} \\mathbf{M} (\\mathbf{f}_i - \\mathbf{f}_j) \\}$, given a single observation $\\mathbf{z}$. We optimize diagonal entries via proximal gradient (PG), where we constrain $\\mathbf{M}$ to be positive definite (PD) via linear inequalities derived from the Gershgorin circle theorem. To optimize off-diagonal entries, we design a block descent algorithm that iteratively optimizes one row and column of $\\mathbf{M}$.

Although similar classification tasks had been previously carried out using linear multivariate statistical data analysis methods, these are of limited efficacy when dealing with highly non-linear dynamics. In this work, we present two Deep Learning Tools for classification: using either supervised learning or un-supervised learning. For classification with supervised learning a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is trained on normalized training data. Since deep learning networks generally involve a large number of nodes and parameters an algorithm named Sequential Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (SLRPFP) is proposed for selecting the relevant inputs and for pruning the LSTM network such that the test accuracy at each step is maintained or even improved. For classification with unsupervised learning, main features from the input dataset are first extracted using an Autoencoder. Then a Multi-dimensional Support Vector Machines (MSVM) model is applied to the features identified by the autoencoder. The performance of the proposed supervised and unsupervised deep learning approaches are compared to an approach that combines linear Dynamic Principal Component Analysis (DPCA) and a MSVM based classification and conclusions are drawn on the relative advantages of the deep learning methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.06.121", "venue": null, "journal": "IFAC-PapersOnLine", "mag_id": "2956160228", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198314754"}

The idea of using the estimated distribution of the optimal solutions helps CEDA-SVM to avoid running the optimizer ( MOEA ) every time we need new alternatives solutions when the founded ones are not satisfactory.

This is mainly due to the explosion in popularity of social networking sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+ amongst others. In statistical relational learning, many techniques have been developed to address this problem, where we have a connected unweighted homogeneous/ heterogeneous graph that is partially labeled and the goal is to propagate the labels to the unlabeled nodes. In this paper, we provide a different perspective by enabling the effective use of graph transduction techniques for this problem. We thus exploit the strengths of this class of methods for relational learning problems. We accomplish this by providing a simple procedure for constructing a weight matrix that serves as input to a rich class of graph transduction techniques. Our procedure has multiple desirable properties. For example, the weights it assigns to edges between unlabeled nodes naturally relate to a measure of association commonly used in statistics, namely the Gamma test statistic. We further portray the efficacy of our approach on synthetic as well as real data, by comparing it with state-of-the-art relational learning algorithms, and graph transduction techniques with an adjacency matrix or a real valued weight matrix computed using available attributes as input.

However, there are still some open problems in anomalous behavior detection, such as the large and complicated model is difficult to train, the accuracy of anomalous behavior detection is not high enough and the speed is not fast enough. A spatiotemporal representation learning model is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the spatial-temporal features of the video are extracted by the constructed multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network. Then the scene background is modeled by the high-dimensional mixed Gaussian model and used for anomaly detection. Finally, the accurate position of anomalous behavior in the video data is achieved by calculating the position of the last output feature, that is, the position of the receptive field. The proposed model does not require specific training. Moreover, the proposed method has the advantages of high versatility, fast calculation speed and high detection accuracy.

Our motivation for this study is to investigate which option is well suited to tackle this significant challenge for bioinformatics data. Our literature survey shows that no previous work has conducted such an extensive study to examine whether ensemble learning or data sampling is best suited for imbalanced gene expression data. To this end, we carried out an extensive experimental study using five ensemble classification methods, four other classification methods with random under-sampling, three feature rankers along with four feature subset sizes across 15 highly imbalanced bioinformatics datasets. Our results along with statistical analysis confirm that ensemble learning methods in general outperform data sampling techniques in improving classification results. Furthermore, Select-Bagging with Naive Bayes (NB) followed by Random Forest are the top two performing ensemble techniques. Based on these results, we recommend either Select-Bagging with NB or Random Forest with 100 trees (RF100) for imbalanced datasets.

In contrast, an epigenetic interpretation of connectionist approaches to studying the mind is shown to offer an account of symbolic skills as an emergent, developmental phenomenon.

The image representations consist of clusters of random dot figures, generated by distorting prototypes. Any given label is associated with a cluster of random dot figures. The network model is tested on its ability to reproduce image representations given input labels alone (comprehension) and to identify labels given input images alone (production). The model implements several well-documented findings in the literature on early semantic development; the occurrence of over- and under-extension errors; a vocabulary spurt; a comprehension/production asymmetr...", "year": 1992, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/09540099208946620", "venue": null, "journal": "Connection Science", "mag_id": "2149492821", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10040238", "2424465", "1747956", "14927191", "15091278", "3941413", "16404079", "28356906", "16700982", "15842045", "6244400", "160009487", "5767676", "6842749", "1112564", "15343476", "18535719", "35754883", "18276448", "11349174", "112685", "28818374", "12701075", "17923874", "4609217", "46526818", "440636", "759471", "17688127", "5121848", "15689940", "17120683", "18802162", "18468365", "107505", "22318852", "15068708", "8216501", "18902847", "14863514", "6435015", "2009216", "1292815", "36994808", "14814699", "1824408", "55024638", "9747388", "15905139", "2281491", "3262559", "14637236", "55511275", "145367525", "52220035", "30028170", "26841707", "117918078", "18402417", "6896577", "8816171", "18524556", "72336002", "412794", "16107146", "59849792", "7281066", "54540385", "11899658", "37325680", "1687819", "15381431", "199603959", "49100215", "28690227", "1041774", "18540507", "40128425", "207735823", "17302834", "15998790", "12605350", "31134320", "203610528", "14498235", "46799014", "1344370", "10791314", "17945844", "7285644"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61206571"}

This study investigates the capability of multi-seasonal WorldView-2 imagery to map five dominant tree species at the individual tree crown level in a parkland landscape in central Burkina Faso. The Random Forest algorithm is used for object based tree species classification and for assessing the relative importance of WorldView-2 predictors. The classification accuracies from using wet season, dry season and multi-seasonal datasets are compared to gain insights about the optimal timing for image acquisition. The multi-seasonal dataset produced the most accurate classifications, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 83.4%. For classifications based on single date imagery, the dry season (OA = 78.4%) proved to be more suitable than the wet season (OA = 68.1%). The predictors that contributed most to the classification success were based on the red edge band and visible wavelengths, in particular green and yellow. It was therefore concluded that WorldView- 2, with its unique band configuration, represents a suitable data source for tree species mapping in West African parklands. These results are particularly promising when considering the recently launched WorldView-3, which provides data both at higher spatial and spectral resolution, including shortwave infrared bands.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2016.03.004", "venue": "Int.

Our framework is motivated by the fact that detecting lying poses is fundamentally more difficult than detecting pedestrians or localizing nondeformable objects such as cars, roads, and buildings due to the large number of poses, orientations, and scales that a human lying on the ground can take. An important problem with lying pose detection is the training dataset, which hardly accounts for each possible body configuration. As a solution, we propose a geometric expansion procedure that uses a virtual camera to increase the number of training images. We also use a Gibbs sampler to generate more training samples in the feature space on which the system can train its model. Once the training is completed, detection is performed on a multiscale and multirotational space.

In this paper, we show that two types of higher order potential, namely, object detection based potentials and superpixel based potentials, can be included in a CRF embedded within a deep network. We design these higher order potentials to allow inference with the efficient and differentiable mean-field algorithm, making it possible to implement our CRF model as a stack of layers in a deep network.

For this purpose, the moving window analysis is introduced to decompose the whole process sequence features into multiple time sub-sequences, and different types of kernel functions are combined together by using kernel method, which is mapped into a new feature space to form the multi-kernel function of SVM. Then each characteristic of the sub-sequences is regarded as a determined pattern to be recognized through the proposed model. We use the cross-validation method to search the optimized parameters of MK-SVM. Multiple sets of experiments are used to verify this method.

Patients enroll onto experimental clinical trials based on ER, PR, and HER2 status and, as receptor status is prognostic and defines treatment regimens, central receptor confirmation is critical for interpreting results from these trials. Patients enrolling onto experimental clinical trials in the metastatic setting often have limited available archival tissue that might better be used for comprehensive molecular profiling rather than slide-intensive reconfirmation of receptor status. We developed a Random Forests-based algorithm using a training set of 158 samples with centrally confirmed IHC status, and subsequently validated this algorithm on multiple test sets with known, locally determined IHC status. We observed a strong correlation between target mRNA expression and IHC assays for HER2 and ER, achieving an overall accuracy of 97 and 96 %, respectively. For determining PR status, which had the highest discordance between central and local IHC, incorporation of expression of co-regulated genes in a multivariate approach added predictive value, outperforming the single, target gene approach by a 10 % margin in overall accuracy. Our results suggest that multiplexed qRT-PCR profiling of ESR1, PGR, and ERBB2 mRNA, along with several other subtype associated genes, can effectively confirm breast cancer subtype, thereby conserving tumor sections and enabling additional biomarker data to be obtained from patients enrolled onto experimental clinical trials.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4223539", "pubmed_id": "25338319", "doi": "10.1007/s10549-014-3163-8", "venue": "Breast Cancer Research and Treatment", "journal": "Breast Cancer Research and Treatment", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1969507803", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["380127", "42666556", "31071825", "12451851", "1280204", "15549055", "17720396", "27583168", "15434235", "8020745", "30908944", "25864621", "18335743", "25912170", "45980607", "25065261", "89141", "2478905", "24153719", "15574491", "265746", "16445201", "207029786", "14462594"], "inbound_citations": ["53149731", "207933818", "4807663", "29573821", "53045098", "4253995", "53735100", "15895685", "7804940"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10478341"}

The present work explores the adversarial paradigm to train a deep neural network as a tool for scientific simulation, more specifically, simulation of High Energy Physics detectors. At the core of this approach lies the possibility to interpret the detector response as an image: the main challenges being represented by the large pixel intensity dynamic range (spanning over more than ten orders of magnitude) together with a high level of image sparsity. An initial prototype [1] simulated electrons travelling through an example electromagnetic calorimeter and depositing energy in its volume. It achieved very good results using an adversarial approach to reproduce a simplified physics use case. The present work extends the model to a more complex and realistic scenario: the conditioning approach is modified to include additional physics variables, the network architecture is adjusted to take into account larger image size and more complex pixel dynamic features, the cost function is re-designed in order to include physics based constraints. We ntroduce a multi-step training process based on transfer learning, by initially optimizing the network performance on a restricted particle energy range (therefore, a simplified pixel intensity distribution). Further training the network on the full energy range yields very good results, without the need of additional optimization. Beyond a qualitative visual inspection, the validation of GAN performance is based on a detailed comparison to standard Monte Carlo simulation in terms of several physics quantities: results show a remarkable agreement, ranging from a few percent up to 10% across a large particle energy range.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00014", "venue": "2019 18th IEEE International Conference On Machine Learning And Applications (ICMLA)", "journal": "2019 18th IEEE International Conference On Machine Learning And Applications (ICMLA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3008983283", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52191810", "119100442", "53655721", "121411973", "123113569", "9494295", "12209503", "1099052", "88514467", "41265836", "46946138", "69789704", "16489696", "15539264", "2904855", "207761262"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211227437"}

This paper outlines the development of a load disaggregation method that measures the aggregate electrical signals of a domestic environment and extracts features to identify each power consuming appliance. A single sensor is deployed at the main incoming power point, to sample the aggregate current signal. The method senses when an appliance switches ON or OFF and uses a two-step classification algorithm to identify which appliance has caused the event. Parameters from the current in the temporal and frequency domains are used as features to define each appliance. These parameters are the steady-state current harmonics and the rate of change of the transient signal. Each appliance\u2019s electrical characteristics are distinguishable using these parameters.

To evaluate the newly established KPCA SVM algorithms, we utilized it to the problem of image semantic classification, and the experimental results show that the proposed approach is more accurate in image semantic classification than PCA SVM algorithm.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/KAMW.2008.4810514", "venue": "2008 IEEE International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling Workshop", "journal": "2008 IEEE International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling Workshop", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2546106469", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["116987023", "56978844", "7314138", "61746669", "17877532", "31208221"], "inbound_citations": ["9000129", "18882469"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32479145"}
{"paper_id": "2654592", "title": "Data Mining the Harness Track and Predicting Outcomes", "authors": [{"first": "Robert", "middle": ["P."], "last": "Schumaker", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Racing, like many other domains including the stock market, trades on publicly available information (i.e. racing histories). Therefore all participants behaving in a rational manner should have an equal chance of success. However, information markets have inequalities through withheld information, a human tendency to discount certain information or weighting it incorrectly. These informational inequalities lead to arbitrage opportunities that can be unlocked using data mining techniques. LITERATURE REVIEW Predictive algorithms have been adopted successfully in racing sports, such as greyhound and thoroughbred racing. These systems use machine learning techniques to train the system on historical data then make predictions on previously unseen data. Highlights of several studies are presented below. The first is a study of greyhound races using ID3 (a decision-tree algorithm) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) on 100 races at Tucson Greyhound Park (Chen, Rinde, She, Sutjahjo, Sommer, & Neely, 1994). The authors limited themselves to ten race-related variables over a seven race history upon advice from greyhound domain experts: fastest time, win, place and show percentage, break average, finish average, the average finish time over the last three and seven races respectively, competitive grade of the race and a modifier if the horse is competing is a less competitive race. Their system made binary win/no-win decisions for each greyhound based on their historic race data. If a dog was predicted to win the system would make a $2 wager. The ID3 decision tree was accurate 34% of the time with a $69.20 payout ($0.69 excess return per dollar wagered) while the BPNN was 20% accurate with a $124.80 payout ($1.25 excess return per dollar wagered). This disparity in decreased accuracy and increased payout is justified by arguing that the BPNN was selecting longshot winners. As a result accuracy decreases and higher payouts are gained from the longer odds. When comparing their machine learning techniques to track experts, the experts managed a lower 18% accuracy and a payout loss of $67.60 ($0.68 excess loss per dollar wagered). It was speculated that Chen's machine learning system was taking advantage of information inequalities by successfully predicting longshot wagers more often than chance, however, given the black-box nature of BPNN and the difficulties of interrogating its decision-making process, it is hard to be certain. In a follow-up study that expanded the number of input variables to 18, Johansson and Sonstrod used a BPNN on 100 races at Gulf Greyhound Park and found 24.9% accuracy for Win with a $6.60 payout loss ($0.07 excess loss per dollar wagered) [2]. The improvement in accuracy had a corresponding decrease in payout and implies that either the additional variables or too few training cases (449 as compared to Chen's 1,600) confounded their ability to identify longshots. However, the exotic wagers performed better; Quiniela had 8.8% accuracy and $20.30 payout ($0.20 excess return per dollar wagered), while Exacta had 6.1% accuracy and $114.10 payout ($1.14 excess return per dollar wagered). In a third study that focused on using discrete numeric prediction rather than binary assignment, Schumaker and Johnson used Support Vector Regression (SVR) on the same 10 performance-related variables as Chen et. al. [3]. Their study of 1,953 greyhound races employed selective wagering where only the races with the predicted strongest competitors were wagered upon. Of the 505 races selected, their system produced a $0.95 excess return per dollar wagered for Win. In looking at prior research, we discovered a lack of study of machine learners versus the wisdom of crowds. Several studies offered insight between crowds and experts, but none could be found that explored how well a machine learning platform could perform versus crowd wisdom. \u2026", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of International Technology and Information Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "297099960", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1214494", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": ["126422020", "146094183", "168746875"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2654592"}

The Euclidean distance between the feature points in apex and neutral frame is determined and their difference in corresponding neutral and the apex frame is calculated to form the feature vector. The feature vectors thus formed for all the emotions and subjects are given to Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernels for classification.

The association of biological macromolecules is a fundamental biochemical phenomenon and an unsolved theoretical problem crucial for the understanding of complex living systems. The term protein-protein docking describes the computational prediction of the assembly of protein complexes from the individual subunits. Docking algorithms generally produce a large number of putative protein complexes. In most cases, some of these conformations resemble the native complex structure within an acceptable degree of structural similarity. A major challenge in the field of docking is to extract the near-native structure(s) out of this considerably large pool of solutions, the so called scoring or ranking problem. It has been the aim of this work to develop methods for the efficient and accurate detection of near-native conformations in the scoring or ranking process of docked protein-protein complexes. A series of structural, chemical, biological and physical properties are used in this work to score docked protein-protein complexes. These properties include specialised energy functions, evolutionary relationship, class specific residue interface propensities, gap volume, buried surface area, empiric pair potentials on residue and atom level as well as measures for the tightness of fit. Efficient comprehensive scoring functions have been developed using probabilistic Support Vector Machines in combination with this array of properties on the largest currently available protein-protein docking benchmark. The established scoring functions are shown to be specific for certain types of protein-protein complexes and are able to detect near-native complex conformations from large sets of decoys with high sensitivity. The specific complex classes are Enzyme-Inhibitor/Substrate complexes, Antibody-Antigen complexes and a third class denoted as \"Other\" complexes which holds all test cases not belonging to either of the two previous classes. The three complex class specific scoring functions were tested on the docking results of 99 complexes in their unbound form for the above mentioned categories. Defining success as scoring a 'true' result with a p-value of better than 0.1, the scoring schemes were found to be successful in 93%, 78% and 63% of the examined cases, respectively. The ranking of near-native structures can be drastically improved, leading to a significant enrichment of near-native complex conformations in the top ranks.

The usefulness of event cameras to generate high dynamic range (HDR) images even in extreme illumination conditions and also non blurred images under rapid motion is also shown. In addition, the possibility of generating very high frame rate videos is demonstrated, theoretically up to 1 million frames per second(FPS) since the temporal resolution of event cameras is about 1 microsecond.

Recently, there is a growing interest in learning graph-level representations for graph classification. Existing graph classification strategies based on graph neural networks broadly follow a single-task learning framework and manage to learn graph-level representations through aggregating node-level representations. However, they lack the efficient utilization of labels of nodes in a graph. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task representation learning architecture coupled with the task of supervised node classification for enhanced graph classification. Specifically, the node classification task enforces node-level representations to take full advantage of node labels available in the graph and the graph classification task allows for learning graph-level representations in an end-to-end manner.

System limitations: the simple and usually proprietary nature of neuromorphic and robotic platforms, have often been the fundamental barrier. Here we present an integration of a mature \u201cneuromimetic\u201d chip, SpiNNaker, with the humanoid iCub robot using a direct AER - address-event representation - interface that overcomes the need for complex proprietary protocols by sending information as UDP-encoded spikes over an Ethernet link. Using an existing neural model devised for visual object selection, we enable the robot to perform a real-world task: fixating attention upon a selected stimulus. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of interface and model in being able to control the robot towards stimulus-specific object selection. Using SpiNNaker as an embeddable neuromorphic device illustrates the importance of two design features in a prospective neurorobot: universal configurability that allows the chip to be conformed to the requirements of the robot rather than the other way \u2019round, and standard interfaces that eliminate difficult low-level issues of connectors, cabling, signal voltages, and protocols.

However, the practical determination of ligand affinities is very expensive, whereas unlabelled compounds are available in abundance. Additionally, many different vectorial representations for compounds (molecular fingerprints) exist that cover different sets of features. To this task we propose to apply a co-regularisation approach, which extracts information from unlabelled examples by ensuring that individual models trained on different fingerprints make similar predictions. We extend support vector regression similarly to the existing co-regularised least squares regression (CoRLSR) and obtain a co-regularised support vector regression (CoSVR).

The results of the new classification showed an overall accuracy ranging from 67% to 100%, depending on the sub-basin (80.0% for the entire UPRB).

In this paper, the aim is to automate the task of drug selection, by predicting the clinical outcome of using a particular drug on a combination of the patients gene, variant and cancer disease type. While the main idea behind precision cancer treatment is to identify drugs suitable to each patients unique case, it is justifiable for to assume that there exists a predictive pattern in these prescriptions. We propose to implement this prediction using three machine learning models, the Support Vector Machine, the Random Forest Classifier and the Deep Neural Network. The models yielded promising results of over 90% accuracy and over 95% ROC-AUC score. This positive outcome affirms the assumption that there exists a predictive pattern in precision treatments, that could be extrapolated to help automate such tasks. We further analyzed the data set and identified latent relations between drug, cancer disease, target gene and gene variant.

In the e-biz era, many companies gather customers' demographic and transactional information such as age, gender, purchasing date and product category. They use this information to predict customer's preferences or purchasing patterns so that they can provide more customized services to their customers. The previous Customer-Segmentation method provides customized services for each customer group. This method clusters a whole customer set into different groups based on their similarity and builds predictive models for the resulting groups. Thus, it can manage the number of predictive models and also provide more data for the customers who do not have enough data to build a good predictive model by using the data of other similar customers. However, this method often fails to provide highly personalized services to each customer, which is especially important to VIP customers. Furthermore, it clusters the customers who already have a considerable amount of data as well as the customers who only have small amount of data, which causes to increase computational cost unnecessarily without significant performance improvement. The other conventional method called 1-to-1 method provides more customized services than the Customer-Segmentation method for each individual customer since the predictive model are built using only the data for the individual customer. This method not only provides highly personalized services but also builds a relatively simple and less costly model that satisfies with each customer. However, the 1-to-1 method has a limitation that it does not produce a good predictive model when a customer has only a few numbers of data. In other words, if a customer has insufficient number of transactional data then the performance rate of this method deteriorate. In order to overcome the limitations of these two conventional methods, we suggested the new method called Intelligent Customer Segmentation method that provides adaptive personalized services according to the customer's purchasing index. The suggested method clusters customers according to their purchasing index, so that the prediction for the less purchasing customers are based on the data in more intensively clustered groups, and for the VIP customers, who already have a considerable amount of data, clustered to a much lesser extent or not clustered at all. The main idea of this method is that applying clustering technique when the number of transactional data of the target customer is less than the predefined criterion data size. In order to find this criterion number, we suggest the algorithm called sliding window correlation analysis in this study. The algorithm purposes to find the transactional data size that the performance of the 1-to-1 method is radically decreased due to the data sparity. After finding this criterion data size, we apply the conventional 1-to-1 method for the customers who have more data than the criterion and apply clustering technique who have less than this amount until they can use at least the predefined criterion amount of data for model building processes. We apply the two conventional methods and the newly suggested method to Neilsen's beverage purchasing data to predict the purchasing amounts of the customers and the purchasing categories. We use two data mining techniques (Support Vector Machine and Linear Regression) and two types of performance measures (MAE and RMSE) in order to predict two dependent variables as aforementioned.

Natural language processing is used to extract features from the input texts; these features are then used in the authors' machine-learning approaches. The authors used Conditional Random Fields for concept extraction, and Support Vector Machines for assertion and relation annotation. Depending on the task, the authors tested various combinations of rule-based and machine-learning methods. ::: ::: Results The authors'assertion annotation system obtained an F-measure of 0.931, ranking fifth out of 21 participants at the i2b2/VA 2010 challenge. The authors' relation annotation system ranked third out of 16 participants with a 0.709 F-measure. The 0.773 F-measure the authors obtained on concept extraction did not make it to the top 10. ::: ::: Conclusion On the one hand, the authors confirm that the use of only machine-learning methods is highly dependent on the annotated training data, and thus obtained better results for well-represented classes.

Materials and methods Sixty-seven pathologically confirmed cases, including 24 malignant HPCs and 43 AMs between May 2013 and September 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. In each case, 498 radiomic features, including 12 clinical features and 486 texture features from MRI sequences (T2-FLAIR, DWI and enhanced T1WI), were extracted. Three neuroradiologists independently made diagnoses by vision. Four Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were built, one based on clinical features and three based on texture features from three MRI sequences after feature selection. The diagnostic abilities of these classifiers and three neuroradiologists were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results Malignant HPCs were found to have larger sizes, slighter degrees of peritumoural oedema compared with AMs (P Conclusion Machine-learning models based on clinical features alone could not provide a better diagnostic performance than that of radiologists.

Classification of histopathology images of these meningioma is a time consuming and error prone task, and as such automatic methods aim to help reduce time spent and errors made. This work is concerned with classifying histopathology images into the above subtypes by extracting simple morphology features to represent each image subtype. Morphology features are identified based on the pathology of the meningioma subtypes and are used to classify each image into one of the four WHO Grade I subtypes. The morphology features correspond to visual changes in the appearance of cells, and the presence of psammoma bodies. Using morphological image processing these features can be extracted and the presence of each detected feature is used to build a vector for each meningioma image. These feature vectors are then classified using a Random Forest based classifier. A set of 80 images was used for experimentation with each subtype being represented by 20 images, and a ten-fold cross validation approach was used to obtain an overall classification accuracy. Using the above methodology a maximum classification accuracy of 91:25% is achieved across the four subtypes with coherent misclassification (e.g. no misclassification between fibroblastic and meningothelial).

However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of different gastroduodenal diseases caused by cagA-positive H. pylori infection remain unknown. Current studies are limited to the evaluation of the correlation between diseases and the number of Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motifs in the CagA strain. To further understand the relationship between CagA sequence and its virulence to gastric cancer, we proposed a systematic entropy-based approach to identify the cancer-related residues in the intervening regions of CagA and employed a supervised machine learning method for cancer and non-cancer cases classification. ::: Methodology ::: An entropy-based calculation was used to detect key residues of CagA intervening sequences as the gastric cancer biomarker. For each residue, both combinatorial entropy and background entropy were calculated, and the entropy difference was used as the criterion for feature residue selection. The feature values were then fed into Support Vector Machines (SVM) with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, and two parameters were tuned to obtain the optimal F value by using grid search. Two other popular sequence classification methods, the BLAST and HMMER, were also applied to the same data for comparison. ::: Conclusion ::: Our method achieved 76% and 71% classification accuracy for Western and East Asian subtypes, respectively, which performed significantly better than BLAST and HMMER. This research indicates that small variations of amino acids in those important residues might lead to the virulence variance of CagA strains resulting in different gastroduodenal diseases.

In order to cover all the possible syntactic realisations of a verb, our system combines their argument structure with a set of general semantic labelled diatheses models.

The pattern matching is performed between the syntactic-semantic patterns and the feature-structure tree representing the morphological, syntactical and semantic information of the analysed sentence.

While traditional automatic malware signature generation techniques rely on static or dynamic analysis of the malware\u2019s executable, our method overcomes the limitations associated with these techniques by producing signatures based on the presence of the malicious process in the volatile memory. Signatures generated using TrustSign well represent the real malware behavior during runtime. By leveraging the cloud\u2019s virtualization technology, TrustSign analyzes the malicious process in a trusted manner, since the malware is unaware and cannot interfere with the inspection procedure. Additionally, by removing the dependency on the malware\u2019s executable, our method is capable of signing fileless malware. Thus, we focus our research on in-browser cryptojacking attacks, which current antivirus solutions have difficulty to detect. However, TrustSign is not limited to cryptojacking attacks, as our evaluation included various ransomware samples. TrustSign\u2019s signature generation process does not require feature engineering or any additional model training, and it is done in a completely unsupervised manner, obviating the need for a human expert.

An unsupervised learning technique such as clustering can be used to automatically annotate sensor data. However, the lingering issue with clustering is the validation of generated clusters. In this paper, we adopted the k-means clustering algorithm for annotating unlabeled sensor data for the purpose of detecting sensitive location information of mobile crowd sensing users. Furthermore, we proposed a cluster validation index for the k-means algorithm, which is based on Multiple Pair-Frequency. Thereafter, we trained three classifiers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Na\u00efve Bayes) using cluster labels generated from the k-means clustering algorithm. The accuracy, precision, and recall of these classifiers were evaluated during the classification of \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d and \u201csensitive\u201d data from motion and location sensors. Very high accuracy scores were recorded from Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers while a fairly high accuracy score was recorded from the Na\u00efve Bayes classifier.

A few existing methods leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for this task. However, they have several defects when applied to a specific type of images, such as food photo. First, a large set of original-enhanced image pairs are required to train GANs that have millions of parameters. Such image pairs are expensive to acquire. Second, color distribution of enhanced images generated by previous methods is not consistent with the original ones, which is not expected.

Therefore, this paper innovatively puts forward an original hybrid model that predicts solar radiation through extreme learning machine (ELM) optimized by the bat algorithm (BA) based on wavelet transform (WT) and principal component analysis (PCA). First, choose the meteorological variables on the basis of Pearson coefficient test, and WT will decompose historical solar radiation into two time series, which are de-noised signal and noise signal. In the approximate series, the lag phase of historical radiation is obtained by partial autocorrelation function (PACF). After that, use PCA to reduce the dimensions of the influencing factors, including meteorological variables and historical radiation. Finally, ELM is established to predict daily solar radiation, whose input weight and deviation thresholds gained optimization by BA, thus it is called BA-ELM henceforth.

First, the structural features and image grey features, such as license plate outline and strokes orders are extracted; then, the principal component analysis fuses the two types of features, reduces the dimensions and removes redundancy. Finally, Support Vector Machine is applied to establish structural feature recognition model and grey feature recognition model and final recognition results are evaluated by high confidence discrimination rules.

While the CFD approach can capture the multidimensional behavior of CTH phenomena, its computational cost is high when modeling complex accident scenarios. To mitigate this expense, we propose reliance on coarse-grid CFD (CG-CFD). Coarsening the computational grid increases the grid-induced error thus requiring a novel approach that will produce a surrogate model predicting the distribution of the CG-CFD local error and correcting the fluid-flow variables. Given sufficiently fine-mesh simulations, a surrogate model can be trained to predict the CG-CFD local errors as a function of the coarse-grid local flow features. The surrogate model is constructed using Machine Learning (ML) regression algorithms. Two of the widely used ML regression algorithms were tested: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF). The proposed CG-CFD method is illustrated with a three-dimensional turbulent flow inside a lid-driven cavity. We studied a set of scenarios to investigate the capability of the surrogate model to interpolate and extrapolate outside the training data range. The proposed method has proven capable of correcting the coarse-grid results and obtaining reasonable predictions for new cases (of different Reynolds number, different grid sizes, or larger geometries). Based on the investigated cases, we found this novel method maximizes the benefit of the available data and shows potential for a good predictive capability.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.pnucene.2019.103140", "venue": null, "journal": "Progress in Nuclear Energy", "mag_id": "2974135165", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210165092", "210004525"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204203025"}

In this paper, we propose the domain adaptation metric learning (DAML), by introducing a data-dependent regularization to the conventional metric learning in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This data-dependent regularization resolves the distribution difference by minimizing the empirical maximum mean discrepancy between source and target domain data in RKHS. Theoretically, by using the empirical Rademacher complexity, we prove risk bounds for the nearest neighbor classifier that uses the metric learned by DAML. Practically, learning the metric in RKHS does not scale up well. Fortunately, we can prove that learning DAML in RKHS is equivalent to learning DAML in the space spanned by principal components of the kernel principle component analysis (KPCA). Thus, we can apply KPCA to select most important principal components to significantly reduce the time cost of DAML.

In this study, we propose and validate a new soft computing approach that is an integration of an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), named as PSO-ELM, for the spatial prediction of flash floods. The ELM is used to generate the initial flood model, whereas the PSO was employed to optimize the model. A high frequency tropical typhoon area at Northwest of Vietnam was selected as a case study. In this regard, a geospatial database for the study area was constructed with 654 flash flood locations and 12 influencing factors (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, toposhade, topographic wetness index, stream power index, stream density, NDVI, soil type, lithology, and rainfall). The model performance was validated using several evaluators such as kappa statistics, root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) and compared to three state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, including multilayer perceptron neural networks, support vector machine, and C4.5 decision tree. The results revealed that the PSO-ELM model has high prediction performance (kappa statistics = 0.801, RMSE = 0.281; MAE = 0.079, R2 = 0.829, AUC-ROC = 0.954) and successfully outperformed the three machine learning models.

The proposed approach requires that a reliable training set is available only for one of the images (i.e., the source domain) in the time series whereas it is not for another image to be classified (i.e., the target domain). Unlike other literature TL methods, no additional assumptions on either the similarity between class distributions or the presence of the same set of land-cover classes in the two domains are required. The proposed method aims at defining a reliable training set for the target domain, taking advantage of the already available knowledge on the source domain. This is done by applying an unsupervised-change-detection method to target and source domains and transferring class labels of detected unchanged training samples from the source to the target domain to initialize the target-domain training set. The training set is then optimized by a properly defined novel active learning (AL) procedure. At the early iterations of AL, priority in labeling is given to samples detected as being changed, whereas in the remaining ones, the most informative samples are selected from changed and unchanged unlabeled samples. Finally, the target image is classified. Experimental results show that transferring the class labels from the source domain to the target domain provides a reliable initial training set and that the priority rule for AL results in a fast convergence to the desired accuracy with respect to Standard AL.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2012.2195727", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1964669384", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["34244879", "2237091", "7984231", "14739721", "6107115", "17234861", "33117125", "740063", "12464345", "59566327", "9612466", "22733", "531946", "15122611", "6841707", "11949725", "8530796", "5714300", "19033801", "14495716", "6906514", "9968820", "61610448", "18683182", "3029952"], "inbound_citations": ["14498791", "36511709", "27371736", "102346110", "4566906", "37152614", "54444514", "55729771", "209843372", "21983064", "2282727", "56517392", "26919601", "3357914", "6584445", "14581240", "11854578", "46409796", "85498095", "133293858", "13984171", "9466011", "36160373", "44136968", "949777", "53233876", "10320406", "54450715", "43889035", "44627939", "134960065", "24463749", "41518495", "189971567", "189971567", "133605388", "27111030", "43486044", "2985926", "174809836", "30579671", "53226139", "69197609", "52932330", "195781252", "23735275", "57390792", "25041706", "3681160", "1289656", "22140723", "52159638", "16206716", "26461041", "15474911", "37787222", "204701904", "11842017", "39725297", "44229279", "211104382", "211140595", "27142436", "21595737", "85498588"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:575029"}

There is need to design Hand gesture recognition systems in order to help people adopt to nonverbal communication mainly sign language. However, there is no clue to understand the meaning of gesture through the computers directly. So this calls for definitions that generalize models in a computer. That is why the machine-learning approaches are implemented in recognition systems. There are generally two types of hand gestures recognition systems which researches have concentrated on. These include static and dynamic Hand gesture recognition systems. However, in building Hand gesture recognition systems, various machine learning approaches have been used. For implementing the proposed system, MS Kinect depth sensor was used as a hardware. The Kinect depth sensor is composed of an infrared camera. This is an advantage to the systems that are designed basing on the depth sensing because factors like color, clothing and background have less effect on the performance. So Kinect based depth sensor systems have a high accuracy and performance making them relevant and applicable in our daily lives. In this paper, we propose a static hand gesture recognition system in real time using two machine learning methods namely Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks. We use of the newly launched Microsoft Kinect sensor for image extraction. The sensor helps us to extract the hand images. We implement the system on a Matlab platform for reasons that Matlab is widely used by researchers in different fields and that can handle complex computations. In the training of the model, we collect a hundred depth-based Histogram of Oriented Gradient features per alphabet from the hand gesture images which we trained, tested and validated using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). From this dataset, we can generate the generalized gesture model for each alphabet image.

The purpose of this research is to develop a diagnostic method of diabetes based on standardized tongue image using support vector machine (SVM). Methods. Tongue images of 296 diabetic subjects and 531 nondiabetic subjects were collected by the TDA-1 digital tongue instrument. Tongue body and tongue coating were separated by the division-merging method and chrominance-threshold method. With extracted color and texture features of the tongue image as input variables, the diagnostic model of diabetes with SVM was trained. After optimizing the combination of SVM kernel parameters and input variables, the influences of the combinations on the model were analyzed. Results. After normalizing parameters of tongue images, the accuracy rate of diabetes predication was increased from 77.83% to 78.77%. The accuracy rate and area under curve (AUC) were not reduced after reducing the dimensions of tongue features with principal component analysis (PCA), while substantially saving the training time. During the training for selecting SVM parameters by genetic algorithm (GA), the accuracy rate of cross-validation was grown from 72% or so to 83.06%.

This decomposition shows to be an efficient fault-specific feature extractor, and a broken bar simulation is used to determinate the relationships between the decomposition products and the fault phenomena. The efficiency of the information extraction is evaluated by Kruskall-Wallis variance analyses and Support Vector Machines on experimental signals, where the fault occurrence is detected, and the fault severity, given by the number of broken bars, is also diagnosed. The experimental signals are obtained by measurements from induction machines operating with different torque levels and driven either directly by the grid or frequency inverters. The proposed diagnostic method does not depend on frequency analysis and spectral resolution and comprises the Orthogonal Component Decomposition and Support Vector Machines. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the information extraction since high diagnostic accuracy is achieved in low-torque situations and in a broad range of slip values. Additional analyses support that the proposed decomposition should be further investigated for many other applications on event detection.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2018.12.005", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "mag_id": "2902971333", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204701825"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115601450"}

This study aims to evaluate the potential of new Landsat-8 imageries (acquired in September and December 2013) for mapping fine-grained plant communities in coastal marshlands. Field-based vegetation maps were collected for 270 km of marshlands along the French Atlantic coast. In order to be identifiable on the satellite image, fine-grained vegetation units were aggregated into fewer plant community combinations. The classification accuracy was assessed by comparison with field-based vegetation data and compared between the supervised methods used, including Minimum Distance, Mahalanobis, Maximum Likelihood, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The best result was obtained with the Maximum Likelihood classifier and by combining the two Landsat-8 images (85.9 % accuracy overall). Three main habitat types dominated the coastal Atlantic marshlands: croplands, Trifolio maritimae-Oenantheto silaifoliae geosigmetum and Puccinellio maritimae-Arthrocnemeto fruticosi geosigmetum.

Five different algorithms and two sets of environmental predictors were compared to predict the geographic distribution of the blowfly Sarconesia chlorogaster (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae). This species has several occurrence points and a considerable amount of biological data available, which makes S. chlorogaster a good model system to compare environmental predictors. Two sets of environmental predictors (mainly derived from temperature and humidity) were built, and the set based on the influence of abiotic variables on the ecophysiology of S. chlorogaster showed better results than the principal component analysis (PCA) approach using 19 climatic variables. We also employed five modeling algorithms-Envelope Score, Mahalanobis Distance, GARP, Support Vector Machines, and Maxent-and the latter two showed the best performances. The results indicate that temperature is the main factor shaping geographic distribution of S. chlorogaster through its effect on fitness.

So the workload is particularly large and inefficient, and relevant staff need to own some experience. Recently, the automation of urine sediment analysis can be realized. However, due to the complexity of the urine sediment microscopic image, the accuracy and efficiency of the automatic recognition for the tangible components are still very low. To solve this problem, we investigate channel features to urine sediment detection which include diverse feature types like color channel features and gradient magnitude, etc. We propose aggregate channel features plus (ACF+) detector which is based on aggregate channel features (ACF) for urine sediment detection. We adopt improved Adaboost classifier. The input image does not require any preprocessing and the specific ingredients such as RBCs can be detected directly with a high precision and efficiency.

This paper briefly summarizes some popular learning structures and processes used in such networks. It outlines a range of potentially more powerful alternatives for pattern-directed inductive learning in such systems. It motivates and develops a class of new learning algorithms for massively parallel networks of simple computing elements. We call this class of learning processes generative for they offer a set of mechanisms for constructive and adaptive determination of the network architecture\u2014the number of processing elements and the connectivity among them\u2014as a function of experience. Generative learning algorithms attempt to overcome some of the limitations of some approaches to learning in networks that rely on modification of weights on the links within an otherwise fixed network topology, for example, rather slow learning and the need for an a priori choice of network architecture. Several alternative designs as well as a range of control structures and processes that can be used to regulate the form and content of internal representations learned by such networks are examined. Empirical results from the study of some generative learning algorithms are briefly summarized, and several extensions and refinements of such algorithms and directions for future research are outlined.", "year": 1989, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/0020-0255(93)90049-R", "venue": "Information Sciences", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2092859712", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17898420", "62572296", "62075251", "5915714", "208922511", "59882229", "62605382", "30443043", "57140259", "207056183", "23972128", "62252283", "62359231", "61054052", "12438987", "11572042", "5623112", "147172528", "17690372", "59732888", "62285311", "7840452", "11472844", "11139669", "14003471", "14105699", "8726829", "59774633", "59708769", "60120882", "141195840", "10546302", "7785881", "117916036", "10034376", "60768214", "63335153", "17651092", "42726726", "209809537", "4642944", "60553242", "31380905", "13252401", "59738611", "62245742", "820779", "59765035", "1817314", "144964393", "59712", "207975157", "1596189", "15356996", "60830585", "12707827"], "inbound_citations": ["18023270", "860255", "62144827", "14505282", "14505282", "18200358", "6023763", "17933834", "10741713", "12354650", "9544261", "14573175", "17891207", "18672911", "13489173", "1326012", "9463528", "12359185", "5937989", "2946051", "17409734", "15196175", "18171042", "16829136", "14602920", "11375312", "16448963", "5677690", "15568713", "54585725", "2598085", "9952955", "14928207", "14307560", "13534367", "14271013"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14658779"}

The shift to an image classification paradigm provided the advantage of using an existing Deep Neural Network (AlexNet) pre-trained on a very large number of images, and thus eliminating the need for a lengthy network training process. Two alternative multi-class SER systems, AlexNet-SVM and FTAlexNet, were investigated. Both systems were shown to achieve state-of-the-art results when tested on a popular Berlin Emotional Speech (EMO-DB) database. Transformation from speech to image classification was achieved by creating RGB images depicting speech spectrograms. The ALEXNet-SVM method passes the spectrogram images as inputs to a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (AlexNet) to provide features for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, whereas the FTAlexNet method simply applies the images to a fine tuned AlexNet to provide emotional class labels. The FTAlexNet offers slightly higher accuracy compared to the AlexNet-SVM, while the AlexNet-SVM requires a lower number of computations due to the elimination of the neural network training procedure.

The methodology was implemented at the wider plain area extending northwest of Farsala town, Thessaly, Greece, covering an area of approximately 145 Km2. In order to estimate the spatio-temporal trend concerning groundwater level the non-parametric Mann\u2013Kendall test and Sen\u2019s Slope estimator were applied, whereas a set of Synthetic Aperture Radar images, processed with the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry technique, were evaluated in order to estimate the spatial and temporal patterns of ground deformation. In a test site where ground deformation rate values derived by the analysis of SAR images, Support Vector Machines was utilized to predict the subsidence deformation rate based on three variables, namely: thickness of loose deposits, the Sen\u2019s Slope value of groundwater trend and the Compression Index of the formation covering the area of research. Based on the Support Vector Machine model, a land subsidence map was then produced for the entire research area. The outcomes of the study indicated a strong relation between the thickness of the loose deposits and the deformation subsidence rate and a clear trend between the subsidence deformation rate and the groundwater fluctuation. The r square value for the validation dataset within the test site was estimated to be 0.75. The land subsidence map produced by the Support Vector Machine model was validated by field surveys and measurements and showed good predictive performance.

Such publication subsequently stimulates academia and national policies; related research therefore becomes a hot spot. The idea of happiness research is dated back to 1972 when the king of Bhutan proposed using Gross National Happiness to replace traditional economic indices. The pursuit of well-being happiness gradually initiates the formation of new theories, for example, Satisfaction with Life Index, Quality-of-life Index, Happy Planet Index, and positive psychology. ::: ::: Although a great number of studies have been conducted in social science, there are still few papers accommodating the needs of technology. In view of this, the special issue particularly highlights happiness research on information technology. More specifically, this issue discusses how technology can be used for enhancement of positive emotions, not simply for detection and measurement. ::: ::: Five papers selected from the submission present a recent update and the advances of technologies in detection, measurement, and enhancement of happiness. The paper by Y. Chin et al. focused on kernel design for Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The authors used music classification as a case study to evaluate the proposed SVM. Their research helped users select music of interest based on emotions in the audio. C. Chuang et al. developed a digital learning system based on somatosensors. Such a system was capable of enhancing the learning performance of users by analyzing physical expressions and interactions. The work by C. Lin et al. investigated feature extraction for recognition of emotional speech. The recognition result could be further evaluated by medical doctors or psychologists and subsequently made into personal profiles. N. Jatupaiboon et al. proposed an emotion classification system based on real-time electroencephalograms (EEGs). The brain waves of subjects were elicited by pictures and sound and subsequently analyzed by the proposed spectral characterization. The authors also constructed a feedback system that allowed users to practice controlling emotions. Finally, P. Cipresso et al. created a multidimensional valence-arousal model to present emotional changing paths. Their model demonstrated another research direction in psychophysiology and affective computing. ::: ::: Through these papers, readers can obtain an overview of happiness research on information technology. Besides, readers can also understand several practical issues, including feature extraction, pattern recognition, and feedback analysis during processing audiovisual and biomedical signals. In the near future, we expect the happiness research on information technology will become a new subject, \u201cHappiness Informatics,\u201d and have an impact on society. ::: ::: ::: Jhing-Fa Wang ::: ::: Chung-Hsien Wu ::: ::: Shulan Hsieh ::: ::: Shyhnan Liou ::: ::: Bo-Wei Chen", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4054872", "pubmed_id": "24983005", "doi": "10.1155/2014/841206", "venue": "The Scientific World Journal", "journal": "The Scientific World Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2020570927", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44263098"}

Though experts are available in some areas, disease detection is performed by naked eye which causes inappropriate recognition sometimes. An automated system can minimize these problems. In this paper, an automated system is proposed for diagnosis three common paddy leaf diseases (Brown spot, Leaf blast, and Bacterial blight) and pesticides and/or fertilizers are advised according to the severity of the diseases. K-means clustering is used for separating affected part from paddy leaf image. Visual contents (color, texture, and shape) are used as features for classification of these diseases.

In this sense, the paper addresses the problem of class imbalance in the context of ordinal regression, proposing two novel contributions: (a) approaching the imbalance by binary pairwise ranking using a well-known label decomposition ensemble, and (b) introducing a regularization into this ensemble so that parallel decision boundaries are favored. These are two independent contributions that synergize well. Our model is tested using linear Support Vector Machines and our results are compared against state-of-the-art models. Both approaches show promising performance in ordinal class imbalance, with an overall 15% improvement relative to the state-of-the-art, as evaluated by a balanced metric.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10044-018-0705-4", "venue": "Pattern Analysis and Applications", "journal": "Pattern Analysis and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2795555658", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12886175", "1295499", "16309210", "12005005", "45528281", "28656961", "3106394", "12269265", "6003275", "15777237", "2090732", "14308512", "53306004", "3402703"], "inbound_citations": ["67788361", "204943336", "142503520"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4688527"}

In order to achieve better results, an optimization scheme based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to adjust the SVMs parameters. In the next phase, a fusion model, in which the attained accuracies and distances are considered as inputs, is constructed. The fusion model utilizes zSlices-based representation of general type-2 fuzzy logic systems to combine different SVMs. The proposed approach is then applied for bearing fault detection of an induction motor with inner and outer race defects.

Opportunities for and constraints to crop production can be assessed with crop growth simulation models. Most crop simulation models require daily weather data as input but such data are generally not available at a high spatial resolution. Several approaches have been developed to estimate yield potential (Yp) at locations without daily weather data (weather stations) but these have not been compared. We used two crop simulation models (WOFOST and LINTUL) to compute Yp for two crops for the entire world. A global weather database was divided into 856 training and 12,808 testing sites. We predicted Yp at the testing sites by using five main methods (eight methods if one considers within-method variants): (i) weather interpolation followed by simulation; (ii) nearest neighbor interpolation; (iii) thin plate spline interpolation, either with or without covariates; (iv) Random Forest-based metamodels with either climatic or bioclimatic variables; and (v) weather generation from either climate data or interpolated climate data, followed by simulation. The metamodel with bioclimatic variables performed best [average root mean square error (RMSE) = 667 \u00b1 111 kg ha \u20131 ], followed by weather generation from climate data, weather interpolation, and spatial interpolation of yield with climatic covariables. The most commonly used method, nearest neighbor interpolation, performed worst (RMSE = 1763 \u00b1 472 kg ha \u20131 ). The optimal method for a particular study will depend on the simulation model, the region, weather station density, and other variables but these results suggest that for estimating Yp, alternatives to nearest neighbor interpolation should be considered.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2134/agronj2017.11.0664", "venue": null, "journal": "Agronomy Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2892038686", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["84401484", "154992919", "89141", "59135186", "86460963", "82914172", "134866404", "4856737", "9229326", "154278726", "153373725", "89396662", "37865500", "124430659", "56168114", "10176673", "84055664", "17747414", "154846121", "30142361", "1798657", "140153094", "33579430", "24201452", "129814237", "4870805", "85353300", "85624588", "3692980", "54980062", "53075413", "129552688", "41640144", "32033845", "86241278", "54670507"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91256156"}

We previously developed a novel zero-velocity detection algorithm based on the variation in speed over a gait cycle, which can be used to correct positional errors. However, the accumulation of heading errors cannot be corrected and thus, the system suffers from considerable drift over time. In this paper, we propose a map-matching technique based on conditional random fields (CRFs). Observations are chosen as positions from the inertial navigation system (INS), with the length between two consecutive observations being the same. This is different from elsewhere in the literature where observations are chosen based on step length. Thus, only four states are used for each observation and only one feature function is employed based on the heading of the two positions. All these techniques can reduce the complexity of the algorithm. Finally, a feedback structure is employed in a sliding window to increase the accuracy of the algorithm.

Proximal Support Vector ::: based on Least Mean Square Algorithm classifiers is completely based on the theory of Proximal Support Vector Machine classifiers (PSVM). PSVM classifies binary pat- ::: terns by assigning them to the closest of two parallel planes that are pushed apart as far as possible. The training time for the classifier is found to be faster compared to their previous versions of Support Vector Machines. But due to the presence of slack variable or error vector the classification accuracy of the Proximal Support Vector Machine is less. So we have come with an idea to update the adjustable weight vectors at the training phase such that all the data points fall out-side the region of separation and falls on the correct side of the hyperplane and to enlarge the width of the separable region.To implement this idea, Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm is used to modify the adjustable weight vectors. Here, the error is represented by the minimum distance of data points from the margin of the region of separation of the data points that falls inside the region of separation or makes a misclassification and distance of data points from the separating hyperplane for the data points that falls on the wrong side of the hyperplane. This error is minimized using a modification of adjustable weight vectors. Therefore, as the number of iterations of the LMS algorithm increases, weight vector performs a random walk (Brownian motion) about the solution of optimal hy-perplane having a maximal margin that minimizes the error.

Wrong judgment would provide inefficient learning, and cause a lack of motivation. Test is widely used as an effective method evaluating learner\u2019s understanding level, and we often judge it based only on its score (accuracy rate). For easy system construction, many e-learning systems use a multiple-choice test, which often provides a right answer with no comprehension. Studies on estimating learner\u2019s understanding level by using learning history and test have been reported. One of them is construction of learner model based on accuracy rate and answer time in test (Sobue et al., 2004). However, it requires an enormous amount of data and consideration of learner\u2019s uncertain elements. Another solution is to use heuristicmodel. It is not appropriate to classify learners into at most two groups (either comprehend or not comprehend) due to effective instruction. Then, we add answer time as an objective criterion. Their combination can provide various understanding levels and more precise estimation. The problem that estimates leaner\u2019s understanding level based on objective information can be related to ambiguous classification. Heuristic model is effective for it. Many intelligent tutoring system (ITS) (Gunel, 2010; Nkambou & Bourdeau, 2008) has been developed in recent years. Constructing an accurate learner model is an important element in ITS.

Different immune cell types can have opposing functions (tumor suppressive or immune suppressive) and their density, location and activation state can have profound effects on tumor outcome. Routine immune-profiling methods based on sample homogenization or limited in situ detection capabilities may be insufficient to measure this diversity. To fully decipher tumor immune response and contribution of different cell types, there is urgent need to develop new imaging tools for in situ immune cell-typing and quantification. MultiOmyx\u00ae technology allows repeated staining, imaging and cell-level analysis of multiple biomarkers (at least 60) on the same FFPE tissue section. Together with epithelial and stromal cell analysis, the relative location and quantity of immune cells can be established, enabling regional assessment of immune infiltration and activation status. Using this workflow, 747 stage I-III colorectal cancer patient samples in TMA format were multiplexed for a total of 61 proteins, including CD3 (all T-cells), CD8 (cytotoxic T-cells), CD20 (B-cells), CD68 (macrophages) and pan-cytokeratin (epithelial tumor cells). All images were registered, auto-fluorescence subtracted and illumination corrected. Individual cells were segmented using automated image analysis workflow, consisting of nuclei segmentation, epithelium segmentation and stroma-epithelial cell nuclei classification. We applied a probabilistic multi-class, multi-label classification algorithms based on multi-parametric models to build statistical models of CD protein expression and classify immune cells. Using selected images, expert annotations of the following immune cells were made [CD20+ (n = 4282 (cells)), CD3+ (n = 5600), CD8+ (n = 5346), and CD68+ (n = 4261), and defects (n = 1739)]. Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used to derive a statistical model for cell classification. To objectively evaluate the cell classification accuracy, we performed 10-fold cross validation. The methods described performed well in classifying cell-types, yielding \u226597% accuracy, relative to expert user annotations, for all immune cell types. Classification accuracy was slightly higher for lymphocytes vs. macrophages, likely due to more diffuse localization of CD68. In line with previous reports, higher T-cell infiltration was significantly correlated with recurrence-free survival in the entire cohort. In summary, we have developed a highly accurate quantitation method for in situ analysis of immune cells in tumor and stroma. Using the same workflow, additional cell lineage and functional markers can be added for deeper phenotyping and identification of innate and adaptive immune cell lineages, generating new insights into role of immune response in tumor progression.

Most literature works consider only one font per text what results in low recognition accuracy. This paper tends to enhance the accuracy of AOCR (Arabic Optical Character Recognition) by considering an automatic Optical Font Recognition (OFR) stage before going ahead with the traditional OCR stages. This has been achieved using SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) descriptors. First, a comparative study of four most recent algorithms of primitive OCR has been performed to evaluate the different features and classifiers utilized in their systems. Accordingly, a combining of statistical features have been proposed as well as selecting Random Forest Tree classifier for classification stage.

Also, the Wind Turbine (WT) interactions largely affect the dynamic behaviour of the power system. This creates a great impact on the voltage stability of the power system. Thus, the power system loading margin is to be estimated with the incorporation of wind energy conversion system. But the loading margin estimated using the static CPF method may be inaccurate as the power system dynamic components are ignored. Although, the dynamic CPF method gives the accurate loading margin, it is a time consuming process which limits its applications for online. Several researchers have proposed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for the online voltage stability estimation under static conditions. Not much work has been carried out for ANN-based voltage security assessment of the wind integrated power system. The conventional Back Propagation (BP) learning algorithm may reach local minima converging slowly and has over-fitting problems, as it is a first order gradient method. It also involves too many parameters which are needed to be tuned randomly. The next phase of the research work proposes an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model for the online post-contingency loading margin estimation of the wind power integrated power system considering its dynamic characteristics. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a new and promising three-step tuning-free learning algorithm used for quick training of Single Layer FeedForward Neural Network (SLFNN). The real power demand and reactive power demand of the load buses and the wind velocity are applied as the input to the network. The post-contingency loading margins are obtained as the output of the ELM under specified single line outages.

Ensemble and bagging methods have been shown to work effectively in the process of gene selection and classification. Testament to that is random forest which combines random decision trees with bagging to improve overall feature selection and classification accuracy. Surprisingly, the adoption of these methods in support vector machines has only recently received attention but mostly on classification not gene selection. This paper introduces an ensemble SVM-Recursive Feature Elimination (ESVM-RFE) for gene selection that follows the concepts of ensemble and bagging used in random forest but adopts the backward elimination strategy which is the rationale of RFE algorithm. The rationale behind this is, building ensemble SVM models using randomly drawn bootstrap samples from the training set, will produce different feature rankings which will be subsequently aggregated as one feature ranking. As a result, the decision for elimination of features is based upon the ranking of multiple SVM models instead of choosing one particular model. Moreover, this approach will address the problem of imbalanced datasets by constructing a nearly balanced bootstrap sample. Our experiments show that ESVM-RFE for gene selection substantially increased the classification performance on five microarray datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on the childhood leukaemia dataset show that an average 9% better accuracy is achieved by ESVM-RFE over SVM-RFE, and 5% over random forest based approach. The selected genes by the ESVM-RFE algorithm were further explored with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) which reveals significant clusters with the selected data.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4909287", "pubmed_id": "27304923", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0157330", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2423455227", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["1913816", "12992845", "379259", "43257371", "207165665", "35149658", "7087225", "57961414", "3118756", "61649919", "89141", "18751686", "18301387", "7479553", "61568722", "9061359", "12929471", "2594300", "1135137", "15245447", "11625473", "18745711", "16549644"], "inbound_citations": ["27313234", "54437561", "3690298", "52129279", "53943095", "1123927", "789379"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18568711"}

To date, disease prediction has been based on a few environmental factors and/or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), while complex diseases are usually affected by many genetic and environmental factors with each factor contributing a small portion to the outcome. We hypothesized that the use of random forests classifiers to select SNPs would result in an improved predictive model of asthma exacerbations. We tested this hypothesis in a population of childhood asthmatics.MethodsIn this study, using emergency room visits or hospitalizations as the definition of a severe asthma exacerbation, we first identified a list of top Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) SNPs ranked by Random Forests (RF) importance score for the CAMP (Childhood Asthma Management Program) population of 127 exacerbation cases and 290 non-exacerbation controls. We predict severe asthma exacerbations using the top 10 to 320 SNPs together with age, sex, pre-bronchodilator FEV1 percentage predicted, and treatment group.ResultsTesting in an independent set of the CAMP population shows that severe asthma exacerbations can be predicted with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.66 with 160-320 SNPs in comparison to an AUC score of 0.57 with 10 SNPs. Using the clinical traits alone yielded AUC score of 0.54, suggesting the phenotype is affected by genetic as well as environmental factors.ConclusionsOur study shows that a random forests algorithm can effectively extract and use the information contained in a small number of samples.

Therefore, quantifying riparian quality is a fundamental step to identify river reaches for conservation and/or restoration purposes. Most of the existing methods assessing riparian quality concentrate on field surveys of a few hundreds of metres, which become very laborious when trying to evaluate whole catchments or long river corridors. Riparian quality assessment obtains higher scores when riparian vegetation consists of forested areas, while land-uses lacking woody vegetation typically represent physical and functional discontinuities along river corridors that undermine riparian quality. Thus, this study aimed to analyse the ability of riparian land-cover data for modelling riparian quality over large areas. Multiple linear regression and Random Forest techniques were performed using land-use datasets at three different spatial scales: 1:5000 (Cantabrian Riparian Cover map), 1:25,000 (Spanish Land Cover Information System) and 1:100,000 (Corine Land Cover). Riparian quality field data was obtained using the Riparian Quality Index. Hydromorphological pressures affecting riparian vegetation were also included in the analysis to determine their relative weight in controlling riparian quality. Linear regression showed better predictive ability than Random Forest, although this may be due to our relatively small dataset (approx. 150 cases). Forest coverage highly determined riparian quality, while hydromorphological pressures and land-use coverage related to human activities played a smaller role in the models. While acceptable results were obtained when using high-resolution datasets, the use of Corine Land Cover led to a poor predictive ability.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.02.008", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Indicators", "mag_id": "2091544853", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["29072167", "29590087", "16246093", "24697403", "50795410", "214854928"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86587719"}

In recent years, newly emerged deep learning techniques have achieved high accuracy and speed in attacking text-based CAPTCHAs. However, most of the existing attacks have various disadvantages, the attack process made high complexity or manually collecting and labeling a large number of samples to train a deep learning recognition model is time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach that greatly reduces the attack complexity and the cost of labeling samples, specifically, by pre-training the model with randomly generated samples and fine-tuning the pre-trained model with a small number of real-world samples. To evaluate our attack, we tested 25 online CAPTCHAs achieving success rates ranging from 36.3% to 96.9%. To further explore the effect of the training sample characteristics on the attack accuracy, we elaborately imitate some samples and apply a generative adversarial network to refine the samples, sequentially we use these two kinds of generated samples to pre-train the models, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the similarity between randomly generated samples and elaborately imitated samples has a negligible impact on the attack accuracy. Instead, transfer learning is the key factor; it reduces the cost of data preparation while preserving the model\u2019s attack accuracy.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982945", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3013161732", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8630366", "17801764", "13717976", "17725121", "8226971", "58017295", "53106794", "8229065", "6447277", "1091156", "1053619", "1303612", "14783783", "15887871", "12024381", "3161497", "14542261", "53076689", "4700850", "199010197", "206593880", "206597034", "6200260", "21701877", "8414337", "3362043", "4468961", "18986535"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:215723225"}

Mobile users usually store personal, official, and large amount of multimedia data. Security of such devices are mainly dependent on PIN (personal identification number), password, bio-metric data, or gestures/patterns. However, these mechanisms have a lot of security vulnerabilities and prone to various types of attacks such as shoulder surfing. The uniqueness of Electroencephalography (EEG) signal can be exploited to remove some of the drawbacks of the existing systems. Such signals can be recorded and transmitted through wireless medium for processing. In this paper, we propose a new framework to secure mobile devices using EEG signals along with existing pattern-based authentication. The pattern based authentication passwords are considered as identification tokens. We have investigated the use of EEG signals recorded during pattern drawing over the screen of the mobile device in the authentication phase. To accomplish this, we have collected EEG signals of 50 users while drawing different patterns. The robustness of the system has been evaluated against 2400 unauthorized attempts made by 30 unauthorized users who have tried to gain access of the device using known patterns of 20 genuine users. EEG signals are modeled using Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and using a binary classifier implemented with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to verify the authenticity of a test pattern. Verification performances are measured using three popular security matrices, namely Detection Error Trade-off (DET), Half Total Error Rate (HTER), and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.

For such sonar systems, substantial effort has been devoted to the development of automated detection and classification (D/C) algorithms. These have been spurred by several factors including (1) aids for operators to reduce work overload, (2) more optimal use of all available data, and (3) the introduction of unmanned minehunting systems. The environments where sea mines are typically laid (harbor areas, shipping lanes, and the littorals) give rise to many false alarms caused by natural, biologic, and man-made clutter. The objective of the automated D/C algorithms is to eliminate most of these false alarms while still maintaining a very high probability of mine detection and classification (PdPc). In recent years, the benefits of fusing the outputs of multiple D/C algorithms have been studied. We refer to this as Algorithm Fusion. The results have been remarkable, including reliable robustness to new environments. The Quadratic Penalty Function Support Vector Machine (QPFSVM) algorithm to aid in the automated detection and classification of sea mines is introduced in this paper. The QPFSVM algorithm is easy to train, simple to implement, and robust to feature space dimension.

The current paradigm distinguishes the two by using both the metric ejection fraction (EF) and a constraint for end-diastolic volume. About half of all HF patients exhibit preserved EF. In contrast, the classical type of HF shows a reduced EF. Common practice sets the cut-off point often at or near EF = 50%, thus defining a linear divider. However, a rationale for this safe choice is lacking, while the assumption regarding applicability of strict linearity has not been justified. Additionally, some studies opt for eliminating patients from consideration for HF if 40 < EF < 50% (gray zone). Thus, there is a need for documented classification guidelines, solving gray zone ambiguity and formulating crisp delineation of transitions between phenotypes. Methods Machine learning (ML) models are applied to classify HF subtypes within the ventricular volume domain, rather than by the single use of EF. Various ML models, both unsupervised and supervised, are employed to establish a foundation for classification. Data regarding 48 HF patients are employed as training set for subsequent classification of Monte Carlo\u2013generated surrogate HF patients (n = 403). Next, we map consequences when EF cut-off differs from 50% (as proposed for women) and analyze HF candidates not covered by current rules. Results The training set yields best results for the Support Vector Machine method (test error 4.06%), covers the gray zone, and other clinically relevant HF candidates. End-systolic volume (ESV) emerges as a logical discriminator rather than EF as in the prevailing paradigm. Conclusions Selected ML models offer promise for classifying HF patients (including the gray zone), when driven by ventricular volume data. ML analysis indicates that ESV has a role in the development of guidelines to parse HF subtypes. The documented curvilinear relationship between EF and ESV suggests that the assumption concerning a linear EF divider may not be of general utility over the complete clinically relevant range.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4441365", "pubmed_id": "26052231", "doi": "10.4137/CMC.S18746", "venue": null, "journal": "Clinical Medicine Insights: Cardiology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1952558958", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["9145837", "21169773", "5537137", "5400487", "23099142", "5640261", "198066868", "215619251", "10733201", "10987749", "27233362", "570157", "10109219", "53935745", "20541356", "20655002", "2835567", "36479362", "28551446", "36504277", "117571661", "18951573", "7405754", "14727192", "13861754", "140109802", "195837699", "40018752", "8675382", "3727706", "6278891", "4193919", "487044", "1536643", "44971656", "6596", "6370985", "667586", "36198911", "23561513", "16162198", "1527863", "91176244", "122665203"], "inbound_citations": ["23826930", "12963511", "9649359", "204248070", "214910570", "53102588", "46824343", "215428742", "8255235"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:270848"}

Despite much progress in side-chain prediction, performance is far from satisfactory.

Is further improvement more likely to come from better search methods, or from better energy functions? Given that exact minimization of the energy is NP hard, it is difficult to get a systematic answer to this question. ::: ::: In this paper, we present a novel search method and a novel method for learning energy functions from training data that are both based on Tree Reweighted Belief Propagation (TRBP). We find that TRBP can find the global optimum of the ROSETTA energy function in a few minutes of computation for approximately 85% of the proteins in a standard benchmark set. TRBP can also effectively bound the partition function which enables using the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) framework for learning. ::: ::: Interestingly, finding the global minimum does not significantly improve sidechain prediction for an energy function based on ROSETTA's default energy terms (less than 0.1%), while learning new weights gives a significant boost from 72% to 78%. Using a recently modified ROSETTA energy function with a softer Lennard-Jones repulsive term, the global optimum does improve prediction accuracy from 77% to 78%.

McClelland (jlm@cnbc.cmu.edu) Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition 115 Mellon Institute, 4400 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA Abstract While many researchers studying memory today subscribe to a multiple memory systems view of human memory, most existing models of memory do not explicitly embody multiple interacting memory systems in their accounts of human memory performance. The present work is aimed at developing a connectionist model of human memory which: (1) takes into account known principles about the neural basis of human learning and memory; and, (2) is an instantiation of a multiple components memory system along the lines of a components of processing framework of memory (Roediger, Buckner, & McDermott, 1999). The Hippocampal-Cortical Memory Model (Mc- Clelland, McNaughton & O\u2019Reilly, 1995) comprises two memory components: a hippocampal component which supports rapid learning, and a cortical component which learns more slowly in order to develop integrative representations of the statistical characteristics of the environment across many learning episodes. It provides a suitable starting point for our endeavor because it addresses two important aspects of human memory: (1) the ability of humans to rapidly learn new arbitrary associations; and (2) the fact that memory performance is affected by pre-existing knowledge. The memory phenomenon that we address here with the model is that of encoding specificity. An early statement of the encoding specificity principle (ESP) by Tulving & Thomson (1973) asserts that: \u201c\u2026specific encoding operations performed on what is perceived determine what is stored, and what is stored determines what retrieval cues are effective in providing access to what is stored\u201d. This principle was used to explain a pattern of results from a paired-associate memory task in which target words were studied with cues which were weak associates, and memory for the target words was subsequently tested either by cued recall using novel cues which were strong pre-existing associates of the target words, or by recognition. Two key aspects of the results accounted for by the ESP were: (1) the relative ineffectiveness of extralist cues (strong associates of the target words) compared to intralist cues (weak associates) in facilitating recall of the target words; and, (2) recognition failure of words that had been recalled to extralist cues. The crux of this explanation lies in a belief that successful recall and recognition depends on the episodic trace of the event being sufficiently similar to the properties of the retrieval information. We simulated the ESP experiments by presenting stimuli representing context, relation, cue and target words to our model in the form of patterns of activity. After the model had learnt the appropriate associations during a training phase, recall was simulated by presenting the model with cue and context patterns, with the network filling in the target word and relation patterns. Recognition was simulated by presenting the cue and target word patterns, with the network filling in the context and relation patterns. Our model was able to reproduce Tulving and Thomson\u2019s pattern of results in simulations. However, unlike their original explanation which places the burden of successful recall and recognition on an episodic memory system, successful performance of our model in this task relies on both pre-experimental knowledge of word associations in the cortical system and newly learnt associations in the hippocampal system. Hence, in line with a components of processing framework, encoding specificity can be understood as a phenomenon that is neither purely episodic nor semantic but relies on both forms of memory. Furthermore, as a mechanistic instantiation of the ESP, our model is able to make explicit what is meant by statements such as \u201cthe trace of the event is sufficiently similar to the properties of the retrieval information\u201d \u2013 in a connectionist framework, this is simply pattern completion on a suitable retrieval cue. This in turn provides inroads for further exploration of the parameters and mechanisms which make up a multiple components memory model, and ultimately for characterizing the roles played by different components of the memory system and their interactions, in subserving human memory performance. Further work with the model is being directed at these issues. References McClelland J.L., McNaughton B. & O\u2019Reilly R.C. (1995).

This results in a fixed model that lacks the flexibility to adapt to new learning tasks. In practical settings, learning tasks often arrive in a sequence and the models must continually learn to increment their previously acquired knowledge. Existing incremental learning approaches fall well below the state-of-the-art cumulative models that use all training classes at once. In this paper, we propose a random path selection algorithm, called Adaptive RPS-Net, that progressively chooses optimal paths for the new tasks while encouraging parameter sharing between tasks. We introduce a new network capacity measure that enables us to automatically switch paths if the already used resources are saturated. Since the proposed path-reuse strategy ensures forward knowledge transfer, our approach is efficient and has considerably less computation overhead.

In order to maintain an equilibrium between previous and newly acquired knowledge, we propose a simple controller to dynamically balance the model plasticity.

In this paper, we propose a HEterogeneous REpresentation learning model with structured Sparsity regularization (HERES) to learn from multiple types of heterogeneity. HERES aims to leverage two kinds of information to build a robust learning system. One is the rich correlations among heterogeneous data such as task relatedness, view consistency, and label correlation. The other is the prior knowledge of the data in the form of, e.g., the soft-clustering of the tasks. HERES is a generic framework for heterogeneous learning, which integrates multi-task, multi-view, and multi-label learning into a principled framework based on representation learning. The objective of HERES is to minimize the reconstruction loss of using the factor matrices to recover the input matrix for heterogeneous data, regularized by the structured sparsity constraint. The resulting optimization problem is challenging due to the non-smoothness and non-separability of structured sparsity. We develop an iterative updating method to solve the problem. Furthermore, we prove that the reformulation of structured sparsity is separable, which leads to a family of efficient and scalable algorithms for solving structured sparsity penalized problems.

In the medical field the evaluation of a patient's rehabilitation progress is typically performed by a medical professional through subjective techniques based on the professional's visual perception and experience. In this context, we are proposing an automatic system to detect the progress of patients undergoing rehabilitation therapy. Our approach is able to perform novelty detection for gait pattern classification based on One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVM). Using point-cloud and RGB-D data, we detect the lower limbs (waist, legs and feet) by using Weighted Kernel-Density Estimation and Weighted Least-Squares to segment the legs into several parts (thighs and shins), and by fitting 3D ellipsoids to model them. Feet are detected using k-means clustering and a Circular Hough Transform. A temporal analysis of the feet's depth is also performed to detect heel strike events. Spatiotemporal and kinematic features are extracted from the lower limbs\u2019 model and fed to a classifier based on the fusion of several OC-SVMs. Experiments with volunteers using the robotic walker platform ISR-AIWALKER, where the proposed system was deployed, revealed a lower limbs tracking accuracy of 3\u00b0 and that our novelty detection approach successfully identified novel gait patterns, evidencing an overall 97.89% sensitivity.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bbe.2017.08.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering", "mag_id": "2753998262", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125969369"}

This situation determines the necessity to eliminate irrelevant features as well as making a selection of the most appropriate among them, in order to improve the quality of the classification obtained. Methods The dataset used contains a total of 318 traced neurons, classified by human experts in 192 GABAergic interneurons and 126 pyramidal cells. The features were extracted by means of the L-measure software, which is one of the most used computational tools in neuroinformatics to quantify traced neurons. We review some current feature selection techniques as filter, wrapper, embedded and ensemble methods. The stability of the feature selection methods was measured. For the ensemble methods, several aggregation methods based on different metrics were applied to combine the subsets obtained during the feature selection process. Results The subsets obtained applying feature selection methods were evaluated using supervised classifiers, among which Random Forest, C4.5, SVM, Naive Bayes, Knn, Decision Table and the Logistic classifier were used as classification algorithms. Comparison with existing methods Feature selection methods of types filter, embedded, wrappers and ensembles were compared and the subsets returned were tested in classification tasks for different classification algorithms.

The proposed MOGA + DES incorporates a Generalized Renewal Process to account for imperfect repairs and it also indicates the optimal number of maintenance teams. For the operational phase, a hybridism between MOGA and Risk-Based Inspection is proposed for the elaboration of non-dominated inspection plans in terms of risk and cost that comply with local regulations.

Our observation model for regression is learnt in a semi-supervised fashion by using both labeled samples from previous frames and the unlabeled samples that are tracking candidates extracted from the current frame. We further divide the labeled samples into two categories: auxiliary samples collected from the very early frames and target samples from most recent frames. The auxiliary samples are dynamically re-weighted by the regression, and the final tracking result is determined by fusing decisions from two individual trackers, one derived from the auxiliary samples and the other from the target samples.

The proposed algorithm is evaluated by applying it on publicly available\u00c2 Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) dataset. 288 images of the database are used, including 208\u00c2 normal and 80 abnormal images. 47 images of the abnormal images showed benign lesion and 33 of them had malignant lesion.\u00c2 Results Applying the proposed algorithm on MIAS database indicates its advantage compared to previous methods. A major improvement occurred in the first classification stage. Specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of the first classifier are obtained as 100, 95.83, and 97.91, respectively. These values are calculated as 75 in the second stage\u00c2 \u00c2 Conclusion A hierarchical classification method for breast cancer detection is developed in this paper. Regarding the importance of separating normal and abnormal cases in screening systems, the first classifier is devoted to separate normal and tumorous cases. Experimental results on available database shown that the performance of this step is adequately high (100 specificity). The second layer is designed to detect tumor type.\u00c2 The accuracy in the second layer is obtained 75.\u00c2 \u00c2", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.22038/ijmp.2016.8453", "venue": null, "journal": "Iranian Journal of Medical Physics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2604097891", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["22338565", "111438926", "23738230", "206749474", "44060018", "13208853", "7122892", "9621074"], "inbound_citations": ["196527689", "210140513"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:39113637"}

In this study, we propound a data-driven and robust automatic sleep staging scheme that uses single channel EEG signal. Decomposing the EEG signal segments using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), we extract various statistical moment based features. The effectiveness of statistical features in the EMD domain is inspected. Statistical analysis is performed for feature selection. We then employ Adaptive Boosting and decision trees to perform classification. The performance of our feature extraction scheme is studied for various choices of classification models. Experimental outcomes manifest that the performance of the proposed sleep staging algorithm is better than that of the state-of-the-art ones.

Progress has been made on this topic, but many of the proposed interventions are complicated, computationally expensive, or both. In this work, we propose a simple and effective training stabilizer based on the notion of Consistency Regularization - a popular technique in the Semi-Supervised Learning literature. In particular, we augment data passing into the GAN discriminator and penalize the sensitivity of the ultimate layer of the discriminator to these augmentations. This regularization reduces memorization of the training data and demonstrably increases the robustness of the discriminator to input perturbations.

Immunogenicity is the ability to trigger an immune response. The accurate prediction of immunogenic T-cell epitopes is significant for designing useful vaccines and understanding the immune system. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: In this paper, we attempt to differentiate immunogenic epitopes from non-immunogenic epitopes based on their primary structures. First of all, we explore a variety of sequence-derived features, and analyze their relationship with epitope immunogenicity. To effectively utilize various features, a genetic algorithm (GA)-based ensemble method is proposed to determine the optimal feature subset and develop the high-accuracy ensemble model. In the GA optimization, a chromosome is to represent a feature subset in the search space. For each feature subset, the selected features are utilized to construct the base predictors, and an ensemble model is developed by taking the average of outputs from base predictors. The objective of GA is to search for the optimal feature subset, which leads to the ensemble model with the best cross validation AUC (area under ROC curve) on the training set. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Two datasets named 'IMMA2' and 'PAAQD' are adopted as the benchmark datasets.

Natural Language Processing and Information Extraction techniques have been employed to extract structured information from unstructured sources. However, given highly heterogeneous artifacts that cover a range of publication styles, stemming from different publication sources, and imperfect PDF processing tools, how accurate are metadata extraction methods in such real-world settings? This paper focuses on answering that question by investigating the use of Conditional Random Fields and Support Vector Machines on real-world data gathered from Mendeley and Linked-Data repositories.

Predicting WPREs in wind farms is of vital importance given that they can produce damages in the turbines, and, in any case, they suddenly affect the wind farm production. In contrast to previous binary definitions of the prediction problem (ramp vs non-ramp), a three-class prediction model is used in this paper, proposing a novel discretization function, able to detect the nature of WPREs: negative ramp, non-ramp and positive ramp events. Moreover, the natural order of these labels is exploited to obtain better results in the prediction of these events. The independent variables used for prediction include, in this case, past wind speed values and meteorological data obtained from physical models (reanalysis data). Reanalysis will be also used for recovering missing data from the measuring stations in the wind farm. The proposed prediction methodology is based on Reservoir Computing and an over-sampling process for alleviating the high degree of unbalance in the dataset (non-ramp events are much more frequent than ramps). Three elements are combined in the prediction method: a recurrent neural network layer, a nonlinear kernel mapping and an ordinal logistic regression,to exploit the information provided by the order of the classes). Preprocessing is based on a variation of the standard synthetic minority over-sampling technique, which is applied to the reservoir activations (since the direct application over the input variables would damage its temporal structure). The performance of the method is analysed by comparing it against other state-of-the-art classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines, nominal logistic regression, an autoregressive ordinal neural network, or the use of leaky integrator neurons instead of the standard sigmoidal units. From the results obtained, the benefits of the kernel mapping and the ordinal model are clear, and, in general, the performance obtained with the Reservoir Computing approach is shown to be very robust in the detection of ramps.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11063-018-9922-5", "venue": "Neural Processing Letters", "journal": "Neural Processing Letters", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2894884835", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["110052327", "9611736", "23266108", "12134110", "38640163", "52216515", "55208507", "55426159", "26828794", "55660406", "39674671", "29852866", "55419803", "113557013", "18691993", "6003275", "2811275", "18514743", "6001239", "18647348", "15134189", "16538082", "110122656", "15467150", "43160071", "877929", "46476", "14354369", "1554582", "9599011", "319654", "123221960", "35259898", "9417065", "118338183", "7585742", "214978046", "6440742", "17929109", "207165665", "52874011", "14561315", "62619302", "3356463"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52902641"}

However, in the traditional machine learning-based diagnosis methods, the fault features tend to be relatively simple and couldn\u2019t work well for different fault type once a specific feature extraction method is determined. Meanwhile, although deep learning techniques can adaptively extract more representative features from bearing fault data, they are generally computationally expensive with slow convergence speed. Even if some deep learning algorithms like Multi-Layer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) can get fast training speed by means of non-tuned training strategy, they are inevitably of randomness to some extents. To solve this problem, a new deep learning method called deep output kernel learning is proposed in this paper to conduct collaborative diagnosis of multiple bearing fault types. The initial motivation is using the structural domain information among multiple bearing fault types to improve the diagnosis model\u2019s generalization ability and robustness. By adopting ML-ELM as baseline algorithm, this paper firstly utilizes autoencoder to adaptively extract deep features, and then uses them to construct an objective function with output kernel regularizer. Finally, after solving this optimization problem, an output kernel matrix is obtained, and with this matrix, the final diagnosis model is built by fusing the multiple outputs of fault classifier. Experimental results on CWRU and IMS bearing data sets show that, compared to one state-of-the-art signal analysis method and eight typical machine learning-based diagnosis methods including four shallow learning algorithms and four deep learning algorithms, the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis in an acceptable time.

With the leakage of personal privacy information, targeted malicious email (TME) is becoming a prominent targeted cyber attack vector in today's Internet.

TME is effective to penetrate email defense system because it is fundamentally difficult for traditional email security method to distinguish legitimate emails from malicious emails. And TMEs often contain malicious URLs or malicious attachments, which are extremely aggressive and destructive. In order to effectively deal with this new type of malicious email attack, this paper proposes a dynamic detection method for malicious email. We simulate the recipient opening the email in the virtual machine (VM), accessing the URL and activating the attachment. And we use the virtual machine introspection (VMI) and memory forensics analysis (MFA) technology to obtain the dynamic features of the email by the out-of-VM.

Some studies show that a clustering-based MLC framework performs effectively compared to a nonclustering framework. In this paper, we explore the clustering-based MLC problem. Multilabel feature selection also plays an important role in classification learning because many redundant and irrelevant features can degrade performance and a good feature selection algorithm can reduce computational complexity and improve classification accuracy. In this study, we consider feature dependence and feature interaction simultaneously, and we propose a multilabel feature selection algorithm as a preprocessing stage before MLC. Typically, existing cluster-based MLC frameworks employ a hard cluster method. In practice, the instances of multilabel datasets are distinguished in a single cluster by such frameworks; however, the overlapping nature of multilabel instances is such that, in real-life applications, instances may not belong to only a single class. Therefore, we propose a MLC model that combines feature selection with an overlapping clustering algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that various clustering algorithms show different performance for MLC, and the proposed overlapping clustering-based MLC model may be more suitable.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2018/2814897", "venue": null, "journal": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2781924724", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["1847933", "12537831", "12306644", "14177392", "1224977", "8727032", "21460372", "12415435", "62538626", "8007640", "97681", "14886376", "14134274", "206764015", "31301487", "17568536", "16910335", "14747293", "19021594", "45097445", "14010709", "6010295", "9481781", "5822913", "16359351", "16113414", "190432", "126431489", "20140876", "29940141", "1976599", "9404152"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:73630436"}

CDP++ is able to simulate the reading aloud of mono- and disyllabic words and nonwords, and learns to assign stress in exactly the same way as it learns to associate graphemes with phonemes. CDP++ is able to simulate the monosyllabic benchmark effects its predecessor could, and therefore shows full backwards compatibility. CDP++ also accounts for a number of novel effects specific to disyllabic words, including the effects of stress regularity and syllable number. In terms of database performance, CDP++ accounts for over 49% of the reaction time variance on items selected from the English Lexicon Project, a very large database of several thousand of words.

Our work analysed land use/cover changes (LULCC) between 1985 and 2015 at 5 year intervals, to describe and understand the main processes and drivers of landscape change. LULCC were mapped using Landsat images and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), based on the Random Forests supervised algorithm. Over 30 years, we show a dichotomic trend for the two main land change trajectories: forest persistence and fast urban growth. We found only 8% of forest disturbance within the State Parks, while dense urban settlements grew 163% outside the park, mainly replacing rural uses. We estimate that all available land for human settlement may be occupied by 2030 as a result of this fast urban growth. Our study exemplifies a likely pattern of land use change for coastal regions, with fast urban growth driven by economic interests in transforming these regions into urban and touristic hubs, clashing with environmental policies for forest conservation and afforestation. The history of LULCC in the Northern Coast of Sao Paulo State has resulted in several land use conflicts in the present, especially when considering fast urban growth versus a very large proportion of areas where no human settlement is permitted.

The accurate decoding of MI-EEG signals is essential for effective BCI systems but also very challenging due to the lack of informative correlation between the signals and the brain activities. To improve the precision performance of a BCI system, accurate feature discrimination from input signals and proper classification are necessary. However, the traditional deep learning scheme is failed to generate spatio-temporal representation simultaneously and capture the dynamic correlation for an MI-EEG sequence. To address this problem, we propose a long short-term memory network combined with a spatial convolutional network that concurrently learns spatial information and temporal correlations from raw MI-EEG signals. In addition, spectral representations of EEG signals are obtained via a discrete wavelet transformation decomposition. In order to achieve even higher learning rates and less demanding initialization, we employ a batch normalization method before training and recognition. Various experiments have been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed deep learning architectures.

We propose to initialize the segmentation with SLICO super pixels because SLICO is able to produce accurate boundaries and offers control over size, shape and compactness of the super pixels.

We first introduce a new model based on the logical viewpoint of enzyme function. The proposed model logically represents causal relations between concentration changes of metabolites and enzyme activities. When we observe the concentration changes of metabolites, we can assume which enzyme reactions are accelerated under the model. This computation can be realized using inductive logic programming (ILP), which can find a hypothesis that accounts for given observations with a background theory. In this paper, we use CF-induction, which is an ILP technique and has a unique feature that can integrate inductive and abductive inferences. CF-induction can compute not only possible reaction states that can explain the observations, but also general rules that are missing in the current background theory. Then, we perform experiments with simple metabolic pathways, and confirm that CF-induction can both estimate states of reactions and discover new causal rules.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/WAINA.2008.205", "venue": "22nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Workshops (aina workshops 2008)", "journal": "22nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Workshops (aina workshops 2008)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2168753215", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["19729520", "14688911", "715721", "11399248", "23601261", "36237350", "12643399", "107242172", "6089663", "7096177"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:164088"}

The objective of this research was to explore whether the new Memory-Based Learning (MBL) method performs better than the other methods, namely: Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). For this purpose, we chose soil texture (contents of clay, silt and sand) as testing attributes. A selected set of soil samples, classified as Technosols, were collected from brown coal mining dumpsites in the Czech Republic (a total of 264 samples). Spectral readings were taken in the laboratory with a fiber optic ASD FieldSpec III Pro FR spectroradiometer. Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to optimize and validate the models. Comparisons were made in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2cv) and the Root Mean Square Error of Prediction of Cross-Validation (RMSEPcv). Predictions of the three soil properties by MBL outperformed the accuracy of the remaining algorithms. We found that the MBL performs better than the other three methods by about 10% (largest R2cv and smallest RMSEPcv), followed by the SVMR. It should be pointed out that the other methods (PLSR and BRT) still provided reliable results.

In structured prediction, this internal structure is used to predict multiple outputs simultaneously, leading to more accurate and coherent predictions. Structural support vector machines (SSVMs) are nonprobabilistic models that optimize a joint input-output function through margin-based learning. Because SSVMs generally disregard the interplay between unary and interaction factors during the training phase, final parameters are suboptimal. Moreover, its factors are often restricted to linear combinations of input features, limiting its generalization power. To improve prediction accuracy, this paper proposes: (i) joint inference and learning by integration of back-propagation and loss-augmented inference in SSVM subgradient descent; (ii) extending SSVM factors to neural networks that form highly nonlinear functions of input features. Image segmentation benchmark results demonstrate improvements over conventional SSVM training methods in terms of accuracy, highlighting the feasibility of end-to-end SSVM training with neural factors. HighlightsA novel structured prediction model is proposed and applied to image segmentation.SSVM factors are modeled by highly nonlinear functions through neural networks.Back-propagation and loss-augmented inference are integrated in subgradient descent.Segmentation benchmark accuracy results show benefits over standard SSVM methods.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1508.00451", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2016.03.014", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2267320693", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["51862717", "17671150", "847249", "18865663", "1996665", "206765110", "2472617", "351666", "15739771", "18366554", "2735928", "11266944", "14591934", "12429526", "15939599", "392527", "14593894", "370068", "2756368", "6361694", "14333751", "8823387", "15514452", "5575601", "14211670", "16199335", "9244858", "117481352", "2430892", "11054628", "1381587", "6076653", "11856692", "11657534", "10940950", "13975490", "242941", "15508056", "10385138", "1806278", "206764601", "5778312", "3014704", "2634600", "15601601", "17114901", "2735928", "4071727"], "inbound_citations": ["53288140"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14460680"}

Quantitative assessment of the liver is of clinical importance in various procedures such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring. Liver-shape classification is of clinical importance for corresponding intra-subject and inter-subject studies. In this research, we propose a novel technique for the liver-shape classification based on Spherical Harmonics (SH) coefficients. The proposed liver-shape classification algorithm consists of the following steps: (a) Preprocessing, including mesh generation and simplification, point-set matching, and surface to template alignment; (b) Liver-shape parameterization, including surface normalization, SH expansion followed by parameter space registration; (c) Feature selection and classification, including frequency based feature selection, feature space reduction by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and classification. The above multi-step approach is novel in the sense that registration and feature selection for liver-shape classification is proposed and implemented and validated for the normal and diseases liver in the SH domain. Various groups of SH features after applying conventional PCA and/or ordered by p-value PCA are employed in two classifiers including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) in the presence of 101 liver data sets. Results show that the proposed specific features combined with classifiers outperform existing liver-shape classification techniques that employ liver surface information in the spatial domain. In the available data sets, the proposed method can successful classify normal and diseased livers with a correct classification rate of above 90 %. The performed result in average is higher than conventional liver-shape classification method. Several standard metrics such as Leave-one-out cross-validation and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis are employed in the experiments and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed liver-shape classification with respect to conventional techniques.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24760223", "doi": "10.1007/s10916-014-0020-6", "venue": "Journal of Medical Systems", "journal": "Journal of Medical Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1995047622", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["25772016", "16664091", "11446640", "15408747", "18379425", "71339575", "12497134", "8885018", "6802677", "420054", "7321338", "7442835", "60461418", "7138354", "10006606"], "inbound_citations": ["210967594", "6681639", "212702779", "212703716", "214844398", "209516324", "5804878"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14462497"}

The OTI_DisTrad model was tested on two heterogeneous landscapes of the central Iowa, USA (watershed region) and Beijing, China (urban region). Statistical performance measures were used to compare OTI_DisTrad to other five classical approaches (M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5). Results revealed that OTI_DisTrad was more accurate than the three classical ones for the vegetated-dominated watershed region. The average Root mean square error (RMSE) and Mean absolute error (MAE) between disaggregated and reference LST is decreased from 1.83, 1.86 and 1.75 \u00b0C (M1, M2 and M3) to 1.59 \u00b0C (OTI_DisTrad) and from 1.32, 1.39 and 1.28 \u00b0C (M1, M2 and M3) to 1.10 \u00b0C (OTI_DisTrad), respectively. Statistical results also reported that OTI_DisTrad was slightly superior to other two classical methods for the urban regions, with the average RMSE and MAE between disaggregated and reference temperature decreased from 2.43 and 2.26 \u00b0C (M4 and M5) to 1.97 \u00b0C (OTI_DisTrad) and from 1.69 and 1.47 \u00b0C (M4 and M5) to 1.21 \u00b0C (OTI_DisTrad), respectively.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/EORSA.2016.7552758", "venue": "2016 4th International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications (EORSA)", "journal": "2016 4th International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications (EORSA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2514345819", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["53640313", "18538548", "21361285", "21617207", "5382245", "16208687", "130791635", "34714713", "207761262"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11378444"}

Therefore, many scholars propose various preprocessing methods such as whitening or normalizing the data to a sphere shape to remove the outliers and then call the routine SVM methods to build a more reasonable machine. However, since Euclidean distance is often sub-optimal especially in high dimension learning problem and might cause the learning machine fail due to the ill-conditioned Gram kernel, then it is necessary to find some more efficient and robust way to resolve the problem, which is the motivation of this chapter. The Mahalanobis distance is superior to Euclidean Distance in handling with outliers and is widely used in statistics and machine learning area. Currently there are some methods in building SVMs combined with Mahalanobis distances. Some of them use it in the kernel and replace common kernel by a Mahalanobis one in SVMs. Some of them use it in preprocessing phase to remove the outlier first and then build SVMs using common methods. Others use it in the postprocessing phase to extract key support vectors for speedup and efficiency. Most of them achieve superior performances compared with SVM counterpart. However, it should be pointed out that the complexity of the combined algorithm is the most concerned factor in building such an algorithm. As is known to us, none of them incorporates the Mahalanobis distance into models, which tradeoff the complexity and performance in the same algorithm meantime and make the algorithm more robust. The obvious feature of this new method is that there is no more necessary to remove the outlier first, since it is already considered and will be identified automatically in the model. It is also expected to improve and simplify the whole learning process efficiently. One Class Classification (OCC) (Scholkopf, 2001) now becomes an active topic in machine learning domain. One Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) is firstly proposed via constructing a hyperplane in kernel feature space which separates the mapped patterns from the origin with maximum margin. Support vector domain description (SVDD) (Tax, 1999) is another popular OCC method, which seeks the minimum hypersphere that encloses all the data of the target class in a feature space. In this way, it finds the descriptive area that 15", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/9390", "venue": "New Advances in Machine Learning", "journal": "New Advances in Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1499959217", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11975177", "209099422", "12601634", "7782687", "1465820", "64028298", "8803997", "2110475", "547095", "17005358", "14765286", "7394590", "19485901", "20552023", "40836849"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18876061"}

The actual ground based approaches for traffic data collection may be barely sufficient for everyday life, but they will fail in case of disasters and mass events. Therefore, a road traffic monitoring solution based on an airborne wide area camera system has been currently developed by DLR. ::: Here, we present a new image processing chain for real-time traffic data extraction from high resolution aerial image sequences with automatic methods. This processing chain is applied in a computer network as part of an operational sensor system for traffic monitoring onboard a DLR aircraft. It is capable of processing aerial images obtained with a frame rate of up to 3 Hz. The footprint area of the three viewing directions of an image exposure with three cameras is 4 x 1 km at a resolution of 20 cm (recorded at a flight height of 1500 m). The processing chain consists of a module for data readout from the cameras and for the synchronization of the images with the GPS/IMU navigation data (used for direct georeferencing) and a module for orthorectification of the images. Traffic data is extracted by a further module based on a priori knowledge from a road database of the approximate location of road axes in the georeferenced and orthorectified images. Vehicle detection is performed by a combination of Adaboost using Haar-like features for pixel wise classification and subsequent clustering by Support Vector Machine based on a set of statistical features of the classified pixel. In order to obtain velocities, vehicle tracking is applied to consecutive images after performing vehicle detection on the first ::: image of the burst. This is done by template matching along a search space aligned to road axes based on normalized cross correlation in RGB color space. With this processing chain we are able to obtain accurate traffic data with completeness and correctness both higher than 80% at high actuality for varying and complex image scenes. The proposed processing chain is evaluated on a huge number of images including inner city scenes of Cologne and Munich, demonstrating the robustness of our work in operational use.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2289442672", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["6129811", "128024403", "12712830", "109693201", "6644398", "14723701", "18899962", "32155453", "8862236", "15675245", "126521655", "11602303", "2329907", "122193885"], "inbound_citations": ["61038815", "26988315", "14394406", "41063950", "45133561", "53705606", "18051492", "55316498", "22016877", "203706538", "70348606", "6497126", "4878511"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15244669"}

Similar to comparison-based sorting algorithms, we propose to extract features from all frame pairs and aggregate them to predict the correct order.

Recently, several computational algorithms have been used for lithology identification to improve the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we evaluate five typical machine learning methods, namely the Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest and Gradient Tree Boosting, for formation lithology identification using data from the Daniudui gas field and the Hangjinqi gas field. The input to each model consists of features selected from different well log data samples. To determine the best model to classify the lithology type, this study used validation curve to determine the parameter search range and adopted the hyper-parameter optimization method to obtain the best parameter set for each model. The performance of each classifier is also evaluated using 5-fold cross validation. The results suggest that ensemble methods are good algorithm choices for supervised classification of lithology using well log data. The Gradient Tree Boosting classifier is robust to overfitting because it grows trees sequentially by adjusting the weight of the training data distribution to minimize a loss function. The random forest classifier is also a suitable option. An evaluation matrix showed that the Gradient Tree Boosting and Random Forest classifiers have lower prediction errors compared with the other three models. Although all the models have difficulties in distinguishing sandstone classes, the Gradient Tree Boosting performs well on this task compared with the other four methods. Moreover, the classification accuracy is remarkably similar across the lithology classes for both the Random Forest and Gradient Tree Boosting models.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.petrol.2017.10.028", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering", "mag_id": "2766259095", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["56173842", "125833013", "204886634", "155347463", "202147075", "211016993", "133965398", "52931554", "145966196"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:65305237"}

To efficiently utilize network resources and accomplish guaranteed Quality of Service, a novel Software-Defined Multilayered Admission Control model that embeds an intelligent Neurofuzzy Inference-based Admission Control service engine is proposed in this paper. Each node makes use of the Neurofuzzy Inference-based Admission Control service to learn, manage, prioritize, and admit data traffic according to user requirement. The service engine exploits fuzzy inference-based admission control process to assess node\u2019s current status using Quality of Service parameters, namely, bandwidth, queue load, and Received Signal Strength Indicator to evaluate the prediction index. The prediction index not only helps in determining the strongly connected neighbors during reliable path selection process but also solely decides whether the admission control session can be admitted or rejected. Moreover, the Neuro-Multilayered Learning process of the service engine helps to self-organize and make the complete network intelligent for instantaneous decision making. The proposed mechanism not only improves the session admission between nodes but also reduces the packet drops assuring successful session completion.

The traditional approach of building such models by analytical modeling is difficult in practice and requires a thorough understanding of the interaction between the GPU hardware and the sparse code. In this paper, we propose to use a machine learning approach to predict the performance of the SpMV kernel using several sparse formats (COO, CSR, ELL, and HYB) on GPU.

The research was conducted at two levels: (1) at the field level, on 11 and 15 individual infested wheat fields in 2006 and 2008, respectively, and (2) on a broader level, by analysing the entire 2006 and 2008 images. To evaluate the wild oat patches mapping at the field level, both pixel- and object-based image analyses were tested with six classification algorithms: Parallelepipeds (P), Mahalanobis Distance (MD), Maximum Likelihood (ML), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT). The results showed that weed patches could be accurately detected with both analyses obtaining global accuracies between 80% and 99% for most of the fields. The MD and SVM classifiers were the most accurate for both the pixel- and object-based images from 2006 and 2008, respectively. In the broad-scale analysis, all of the wheat fields were identified in the imagery using a multiresolution hierarchical segmentation based on two scales. The first segmentation scale was classified using the MD and ML algorithms to discriminate wheat fields from other land uses. Accuracies greater than 85% were obtained for MD and 88% for ML for both imagery. A hierarchical analysis was then performed with the second segmentation scale, increasing the accuracies to 93% and 91% for 2006 and 2008 imagery, respectively. Finally, based on the most accurate results obtained in the field-level study, pixel-based classifications using the MD, ML and SVM algorithms were applied to the wheat fields identified. The results of these broad-level analyses showed that wild oat patches were accurately discriminated in all the wheat fields present in the entire images with accuracies greater than 91% for all the classifiers tested.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eja.2014.05.009", "venue": null, "journal": "European Journal of Agronomy", "mag_id": "2058679530", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["215108855", "90620976", "32214015", "11233664", "54627895", "53050646", "85549106", "26171836", "11488132", "45688629", "19179352", "90194971", "209473693", "92109682", "23626693", "52891722", "53330806", "215488571", "184484844", "5435568", "54589315", "207767595", "215617151", "208000911", "11437435"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85424425"}

To that end, in this paper, we propose a novel Sparse Attributed Network Embedding (SANE) framework to learn the network structure and sparse attribute information simultaneously in a united approach. Specifically, we first embed the nodes and attributes into a low-dimensional vector space. Then we introduce the pairwise method to capture the interaction between nodes and sparse attributes, and aggregate the attribute information of neighbors to alleviate sparsity for obtaining a better vector representation of node embeddings, which will be used in following network representation learning task. Along this line, we maintain the network structure by maximizing the probability of predicting the center node according to surrounding context nodes. Different from previous work, we introduce an attention mechanism to adaptively weigh the strength of interactions between each context node and the center node, according to the node attribute similarity. Furthermore, we combine the attention network with CBOW model to learn the similarity of the network structure and node attributes simultaneously.

Hierarchical feature learning is at the crux to the problems of discovery and recognition. We present a multilayered convergent neural architecture for storing repeating spatially and temporally coincident patterns in data at multiple levels of abstraction. The bottom-up weights in each layer are learned to encode a hierarchy of over complete and sparse feature dictionaries from space- and time-varying sensory data by recursive layer-by-layer spherical clustering. This density-based clustering algorithm ignores outliers by the use of a unique adaptive threshold in each neuron's transfer function. The model scales to full-sized high-dimensional input data and also to an arbitrary number of layers, thereby possessing the capability to capture features at any level of abstraction. It is fully-learnable with only two manually tunable parameters.

Despite its popularity, SVM has a serious drawback, that is sensitivity to outliers in training samples. The penalty on misclassification is defined by a convex loss called the hinge loss, and the unboundedness of the convex loss causes the sensitivity to outliers. To deal with outliers, robust variants of SVM have been proposed, such as the robust outlier detection algorithm and an SVM with a bounded loss called the ramp loss. In this paper, we propose a robust variant of SVM and investigate its robustness in terms of the breakdown point. The breakdown point is a robustness measure that is the largest amount of contamination such that the estimated classifier still gives information about the non-contaminated data. The main contribution of this paper is to show an exact evaluation of the breakdown point for the robust SVM. For learning parameters such as the regularization parameter in our algorithm, we derive a simple formula that guarantees the robustness of the classifier. When the learning parameters are determined with a grid search using cross validation, our formula works to reduce the number of candidate search points. The robustness of the proposed method is confirmed in numerical experiments.

Most creatures that emit light are sea creatures, but some insects, plants, fungi etc, also emit light. The biotechnological application of bioluminescence has become routine and is considered essential for many medical and general technological advances. Identification of bioluminescent proteins is more challenging due to their poor similarity in sequence. So far, no specific method has been reported to identify bioluminescent proteins from primary sequence.ResultsIn this paper, we propose a novel predictive method that uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and physicochemical properties to predict bioluminescent proteins. BLProt was trained using a dataset consisting of 300 bioluminescent proteins and 300 non-bioluminescent proteins, and evaluated by an independent set of 141 bioluminescent proteins and 18202 non-bioluminescent proteins. To identify the most prominent features, we carried out feature selection with three different filter approaches, ReliefF, infogain, and mRMR. We selected five different feature subsets by decreasing the number of features, and the performance of each feature subset was evaluated.ConclusionBLProt achieves 80% accuracy from training (5 fold cross-validations) and 80.06% accuracy from testing.

The development of an anti-malware system that can counteract an unknown malware is a prolific activity that may benefit several sectors.

Using such models would enable the detection of newly-released malware through mathematical generalization. That is, finding the relationship between a given malware $x$ and its corresponding malware family $y$, $f: x \\mapsto y$. To accomplish this feat, we used the Malimg dataset (Nataraj et al., 2011) which consists of malware images that were processed from malware binaries, and then we trained the following DL models 1 to classify each malware family: CNN-SVM (Tang, 2013), GRU-SVM (Agarap, 2017), and MLP-SVM. Empirical evidence has shown that the GRU-SVM stands out among the DL models with a predictive accuracy of ~84.92%.

The objective of this report was to provide clinical information and an independent meta-analysis of divalproex sodium and suicidality events by analyzing data from 13 placebo-controlled studies and 1 low-dose controlled study.MethodsAdverse events considered to be possibly suicide related were identified using the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) methodology. Indications included epilepsy, bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, impulsive aggression, and dementia. Narratives were produced for every event, and suicidality event ratings were performed by a third party blinded to treatment assignment. Statistical analyses were conducted using methodology similar to that reported by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).ResultsSuicidality events were identified in 5 of the 13 placebo-controlled studies. Of the 1,327 (0.83%) subjects taking divalproex sodium, 11 had suicidality events: 2 suicide attempts and 9 suicidal ideation. Of 992 (0.91%) subjects taking placebo, 9 had suicidality events: 1 preparatory act toward suicide, 2 suicide attempts, and 6 suicidal ideation. Across placebo-controlled studies, the overall estimated odds ratio (OR) of suicidal behavior or ideation was 0.72 (95% CI 0.29 to 1.84). The OR for suicidal behavior was 0.37 (95% CI 0.04 to 2.58), and the OR for suicidal ideation was 0.90 (95% CI 0.31 to 2.79).ConclusionsIn this meta-analysis, divalproex sodium does not appear to increase the risk of suicide-related adverse events relative to placebo in the populations studied.

These interactions are in turn influenced by various biophysical properties of the amino acids. There are several examples of proteins that share the same fold but are very dissimilar at the sequence level. For proteins to share a common fold some crucial interactions should be maintained despite insignificant sequence similarity. Since the interactions are because of the biophysical properties of the amino acids, we should be able to detect descriptive patterns for folds at such a property level. In this line, the main focus of our research is to analyze such proteins and to characterize them in terms of their biophysical properties. Protein structures with sequence similarity lesser than 40% were selected for ten different subfolds from three different mainfolds (according to CATH classification) and were used for this analysis. We used the normalized values of the 49 physio-chemical, energetic and conformational properties of amino acids. We characterize the folds based on the average biophysical property values. We also observed a fold specific correlational behavior of biophysical properties despite a very low sequence similarity in our data. We further trained three different binary classification models (Naive Bayes-NB, Support Vector Machines-SVM and Bayesian Generalized Linear Model-BGLM) which could discriminate mainfold based on the biophysical properties.

The high demand for energy leads to higher cost per unit of energy, which, can impact on the running costs of commercial and residential dwellings. Hence, there is a need for more effective predictive techniques that can be used to measure and optimize energy usage of large arrays of connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices and control points that constitute modern built environments. In this paper, we propose a lightweight IoT framework for predicting energy usage at a localized level for optimal configuration of building-wide energy dissemination policies. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) as a statistical liner model could be used for this purpose; however, it is unable to model the dynamic nonlinear relationships in nonstationary fluctuating power consumption data. Therefore, we have developed an improved hybrid model based on the ARIMA, Support Vector Regression (SVRs) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to predict precision energy usage from supplied data. The proposed model is evaluated using power consumption data acquired from environmental actuator devices controlling a large functional space in a building. Results show that the proposed hybrid model out-performs other alternative techniques in forecasting power consumption. The approach is appropriate in building energy policy implementations due to its precise estimations of energy consumption and lightweight monitoring infrastructure which can lead to reducing the cost on energy consumption.

This paper proposes a recommendation method based on in-domain transfer learning (RiDoTA), which represents multi-type interactions of user-item as a multi-behavior network in the same domain, and can recommend target behavior by transferring knowledge from source behavior data. The method consists of three main steps: First, the node embedding is performed on each specific behavior network and a base network by using a multiplex network embedding strategy; Then, the attention mechanism is used to learn the weight distribution of embeddings from the above networks when transferring; Finally, a multi-layer perceptron is used to learn the nonlinear interaction model of the target behavior. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our model outperforms the baseline methods and three state-of-art related methods in the HR and NDCG indicators.

This technique has shown its efficiency in finding bizarre clusters, dealing with noise, and integrating clustering solutions from multiple distributed sources. Consensus clustering methods based on voting mechanism are widely used in literature. The idea behind majority voting is that the judgement of a group is superior to those of individuals. However, Voting-based consensus methods suffer from the problem of assigning the appropriate cluster label to data objects without majority vote. To deal with this ambiguity as well as clustering when datasets are too large or when new information can arrive dynamically at any time, we have proposed a new clustering approach based on two stage clustering technique where in the first stage a clustering ensemble method based on relabeling and voting process is used to cluster the data objects. Therefore, a new set of disjoint sub-clusters is generated based on majority vote, where each data object vote for the cluster in which it belongs and for its corresponding cluster in each other clustering results. data objects without majority vote are collected in new dataset. In the second stage, the new database as well as the set of previously obtained sub-clusters are processed using an incremental clustering algorithm. The used incremental clustering algorithm is initialized using the obtained sub-clusters and operate on the new dataset elements. The main advantage of incremental clustering methods is that the system can updates its assumptions based on recently available learning data without re-examining old data.

Transfer learning has been verified as reasonable in dealing with such problems with an acceptable loss value. We use the classic LeNet-5 model to classify pulmonary nodules of thoracic CT images, including benign and malignant pulmonary nodules, and different malignancies of the malignant nodules. The CT images are obtained from Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) where both pulmonary nodule scanning and nodule annotations are available. These images are labeled and stored in a medical images knowledge base (KB), which is designed and implemented in our previous work. We implement the 10-folder cross validation (CV) to testify the robustness of the classification model we trained. The result demonstrates that the transfer learning of the LeNet-5 is good for classifying pulmonary nodules of thoracic CT images, and the average values of Top-1 accuracy are 97.041% and 96.685% respectively.

To solve this problem, we present a new method, called locally shared features (LSFs), to model local dependence between pixels.

Given the polygenic basis of most phenotypic traits, quantitative genetic theory predicts that selection is expected to cause subtle allelic changes among covarying loci rather than pronounced changes at few loci of large effects. The goal of this study was to test for the occurrence of polygenic selection in both North Atlantic eels (European Eel, Anguilla anguilla and American Eel, A. rostrata), using a method that searches for covariation among loci that would discriminate eels from 'control' vs. 'polluted' environments and be associated with specific contaminants acting as putative selective agents. RAD-seq libraries resulted in 23 659 and 14 755 filtered loci for the European and American Eels, respectively. A total of 142 and 141 covarying markers discriminating European and American Eels from 'control' vs. 'polluted' sampling localities were obtained using the Random Forest algorithm. Distance-based redundancy analyses (db-RDAs) were used to assess the relationships between these covarying markers and concentration of 34 contaminants measured for each individual eel.

To overcome this, we propose a novel Transfer Learning-based Discriminative Correlation Filter (TLDCF), which extracts knowledge from multiple previous tracking tasks and applies the knowledge for a new tracking task through Instance-Transfer Learning (ITL) and Probability-Transfer Learning (PTL). ITL applies knowledge of Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) target representations and multi-channel filters learned in previous frames to directly train a new correlation filter. This improves the robustness of tracker for heavy occlusion and large appearance variations. Meanwhile, PTL encodes the spatio-temporal relationship predicted by Kalman Filter (KF) into a shared Gaussian prior to suppress huge location drift caused by similar targets. For optimization, we develop an efficient Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm to calculate CFs on each independent channel in real time. Extensive experiments on OTB-2013 and OTB-2015 datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The PPIs generated by biological experiment are both time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, many computational methods have been proposed to identify PPIs. However, most of these methods are limited as they are difficult to compute and rely on a large number of homologous proteins. Accordingly, it is urgent to develop effective computational methods to detect PPIs using only protein sequence information. The kernel parameter of relevance vector machine (RVM) is set by experience, which may not obtain the optimal solution, affecting the prediction performance of RVM. In this work, we presented a novel computational approach called GWORVM-BIG, which used Bi-gram (BIG) to represent protein sequences on a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and GWORVM classifier to perform classification for predicting PPIs. More specifically, the proposed GWORVM model can obtain the optimum solution of kernel parameters using gray wolf optimizer approach, which has the advantages of less control parameters, strong global optimization ability, and ease of implementation compared with other optimization algorithms. The experimental results on yeast and human data sets demonstrated the good accuracy and efficiency of the proposed GWORVM-BIG method. The results showed that the proposed GWORVM classifier can significantly improve the prediction performance compared with the RVM model using other optimizer algorithms including grid search (GS), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). In addition, the proposed method is also compared with other existing algorithms, and the experimental results further indicated that the proposed GWORVM-BIG model yields excellent prediction performance.

We propose using three vector representations of queries which, using support vector machines, allow past queries to be classified by user's intents.

To overcome restrictions of techniques based purely on coverage, we extend SBFL with code and change metrics that have been studied in the context of defect prediction, such as size, age and code churn. Using suspiciousness values from existing SBFL formulas and these source code metrics as features, we apply two learn-to-rank techniques, Genetic Programming (GP) and linear rank Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

However, individual trees are sensitive to the particular data sets used to train them, and an interpretation of a student model may be suspect if small changes in the training data have a large effect on it. In this context, access to outcomes from a teacher helps to stabilize the greedy splitting strategy by generating a much larger corpus of training examples than was originally available. We develop tests to ensure that enough examples are generated at each split so that the same splitting rule would be chosen with high probability were the tree to be re trained.

The need for continuous monitoring of health conditions inspires us to develop an automatic tongue diagnosis system based on built-in sensors of smartphones. However, tongue images taken by smartphone are quite different in color due to various lighting conditions, and it consequently affects the diagnosis especially when we use the appearance of tongue fur to infer health conditions. In this paper, we captured paired tongue images with and without flash, and the color difference between the paired images is used to estimate the lighting condition based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The color correction matrices for three kinds of common lights (i.e., fluorescent, halogen and incandescent) are pre-trained by using a ColorChecker-based method, and the corresponding pre-trained matrix for the estimated lighting is then applied to eliminate the effect of color distortion. We further use tongue fur detection as an example to discuss the effect of different model parameters and ColorCheckers for training the tongue color correction matrix under different lighting conditions. Finally, in order to demonstrate the potential use of our proposed system, we recruited 246 patients over a period of 2.5 years from a local hospital in Taiwan and examined the correlations between the captured tongue features and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are important bio-markers for liver diseases.

Precisely, the previously exposed properties of fuzzy classifiers make them more prone to the former condition.In this paper, we propose an extension of the distance-based combination strategy to overcome this non-competence problem. It is based on the truncation of the confidence degrees of the classes prior to the distance-based tuning. This allows taking advantage of the good classification abilities of Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems, while diminishing the adverse effect of the aforementioned non-competence. Experimental results, using FARC-HD with overlap functions as the fuzzy learning algorithm, show that this new adaptation of the Distance-based Relative Competence Weighting model outperforms both the OVO and standard distance-based approaches, and it is competitive with robust classifiers such as Support Vector Machines. The problem of non-competence for pairwise learning is addressed.A new methodology, based on truncation of the confidence degrees, is proposed.The properties of Fuzzy Rule Based Classification Systems are taken into account in the design of this novel model.A distance-based tuning is carried out to adapt the score-matrix of the One-vs-One procedure.Experimental results versus the state-of-the-art show the goodness of this approach.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ijar.2016.02.005", "venue": "Int.

To detect PD, various signals have been investigated, including EEG, gait and speech. Since approximately 90 percent of the people with PD suffer from speech disorders, speech analysis is considered as the most common technique for this aim. This paper proposes a new algorithm for diagnosing of Parkinson\u2019s disease based on voice analysis. In the first step, genetic algorithm (GA) is undertaken for selecting optimized features from all extracted features. Afterwards a network based on support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification between healthy and people with Parkinson. The dataset of this research is composed of a range of biomedical voice signals from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson\u2019s disease and 8 healthy people. The subjects were asked to pronounce letter \u201cA\u201d for 3 seconds. 22 linear and non-linear features were extracted from the signals that 14 features were based on F0 (fundamental frequency or pitch), jitter, shimmer and noise to harmonics ratio, which are main factors in voice signal. Because changing in these factors is noticeable for the people with PD, optimized features were selected among them. Of the various numbers of optimized features, the data classification was investigated. Results show that the classification accuracy percent of 94.50 per 4 optimized features, the accuracy percent of 93.66 per 7 optimized features and the accuracy percent of 94.22 per 9 optimized features, could be achieved. It can be observed that the best classification accuracy may be achieved using Fhi (Hz), Fho (Hz), jitter (RAP) and shimmer (APQ5).", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4236/jbise.2014.74019", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Biomedical Science and Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2069778984", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["2103272", "82253990", "146701256", "71064854", "3254490", "25431266", "25141632", "56063466", "2679272", "11226150", "60452768"], "inbound_citations": ["57363285", "39487017", "215181912", "167218615", "11734461", "53600510", "35829146", "60436703", "17731123", "13195811", "22816493", "7420840", "11859683", "27833181", "211021524", "86784475", "44118634", "9581371", "6964390", "203121740", "86512879", "68040340", "205710736", "96431446", "201814047", "211234060", "30334523", "11634634", "7030228", "15561595", "202758248", "53411731", "1896816", "86863875", "214916968", "44078546", "146803349", "32383385", "13881738", "86626478", "2450654"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28764600"}

Semantic segmentation and other pixel-level labelling tasks have made significant progress recently due to the deep learning paradigm. However, most state-of-the-art structured prediction methods also include a random field model with a hand-crafted Gaussian potential to model spatial priors, label consistencies and feature-based image conditioning. In this paper, we challenge this view by developing a new inference and learning framework which can learn pairwise CRF potentials restricted only by their dependence on the image pixel values and the size of the support. Both standard spatial and high-dimensional bilateral kernels are considered. Our framework is based on the observation that CRF inference can be achieved via projected gradient descent and consequently, can easily be integrated in deep neural networks to allow for end-to-end training. It is empirically demonstrated that such learned potentials can improve segmentation accuracy and that certain label class interactions are indeed better modelled by a non-Gaussian potential. In addition, we compare our inference method to the commonly used mean-field algorithm.

Raman spectra of rat long bone, rabbit long bone, and rabbit crania were collected and classified into their respective categories. The spectra were truncated to the range of 400 to 1800 wavenumbers. To train and validate the machine learning algorithms, the data were randomly split such that 80% (n = 499) of the data were used for training, and 20% (n = 125) were used for validation. Three approaches were taken to prepare the data for classification. The first approach utilized all Raman intensities between 400 and 1800 wavenumbers to perform the classification. The second approach reduced the dimensions of the dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) prior to performing classification. The third approach also reduced the dimensions of the dataset by extracting intensities of peaks that are of interest for bone analysis and using these peaks for classification. The peaks chosen were Amide I, Amide III, Proline, CH2 wag, and Carbonate. Raman spectra were classified using supervised learning techniques for each data preparation approach. The supervised methods include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forrest, and Na\u00efve Bayes.

We pose this as the problem of labeling image regions, where each region corresponds to a group of superpixels. To predict the label of each region, we train a kernel Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) for separating shadow and non-shadow regions. The parameters of the kernel and the classifier are jointly learned to minimize the leave-one-out cross validation error. Optimizing the leave-one-out cross validation error is typically difficult, but it can be done efficiently in our framework. Experiments on two challenging shadow datasets, UCF and UIUC, show that our region classifier outperforms more complex methods. We further enhance the performance of the region classifier by embedding it in a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework and adding pairwise contextual cues. This leads to a method that outperforms the state-of-the-art for shadow detection. In addition we propose a new method for shadow removal based on region relighting. For each shadow region we use a trained classifier to identify a neighboring lit region of the same material. Given a pair of lit-shadow regions we perform a region relighting transformation based on histogram matching of luminance values between the shadow region and the lit region. Once a shadow is detected, we demonstrate that our shadow removal approach produces results that outperform the state of the art by evaluating our method using a publicly available benchmark dataset.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28410096", "doi": "10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2691703", "venue": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "journal": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2605126331", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["1806278", "623918", "14607075", "691081", "3353774", "1800511", "6137921", "3201231", "659803", "6936837", "17295639", "37206", "14882677", "1296546", "15319364", "10124817", "6445796", "1775483", "56563878", "14664687", "18648233", "7099687", "198910286", "207579947", "1224727", "144198400", "7138354", "8172552", "3214795", "10784756", "1486613", "15765187"], "inbound_citations": ["35488672", "25120102", "208138930", "206186027", "70314581", "341037", "172136476", "203047375", "208138485", "208513157", "17623309", "92663959", "148573270", "58005462", "10125535", "2878708", "49304427"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3418579"}

However, their value can be realised only if accurate, quantitative data can be extracted from death certificates, an aim hampered by both the volume and variable nature of certificates written in natural language. This study aims to develop a set of machine learning and rule-based methods to automatically classify death certificates according to four high impact diseases of interest: diabetes, influenza, pneumonia and HIV. Two classification methods are presented: i) a machine learning approach, where detailed features (terms, term n-grams and SNOMED CT concepts) are extracted from death certificates and used to train a set of supervised machine learning models (Support Vector Machines); and ii) a set of keyword-matching rules. These methods were used to identify the presence of diabetes, influenza, pneumonia and HIV in a death certificate. An empirical evaluation was conducted using 340,142 death certificates, divided between training and test sets, covering deaths from 2000\u20132007 in New South Wales, Australia. Precision and recall (positive predictive value and sensitivity) were used as evaluation measures, with F-measure providing a single, overall measure of effectiveness. A detailed error analysis was performed on classification errors. Classification of diabetes, influenza, pneumonia and HIV was highly accurate (F-measure 0.96). More fine-grained ICD-10 classification effectiveness was more variable but still high (F-measure 0.80). The error analysis revealed that word variations as well as certain word combinations adversely affected classification. In addition, anomalies in the ground truth likely led to an underestimation of the effectiveness. The high accuracy and low cost of the classification methods allow for an effective means for automatic and real-time surveillance of diabetes, influenza, pneumonia and HIV deaths. In addition, the methods are generally applicable to other diseases of interest and to other sources of medical free-text besides death certificates.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4502908", "pubmed_id": "26174442", "doi": "10.1186/s12911-015-0174-2", "venue": "BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "journal": "BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1550668049,2407751037", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["205434670", "37483809", "26185286", "17463912", "30505371", "3017642", "37483809", "8028580", "6634070", "14857967", "40630802", "62022928", "11557872", "140109802"], "inbound_citations": ["92510237", "16521938", "125592", "34056429", "215590754", "93000637", "7245317", "204755094", "212690359"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:697557"}

In order to create a non-destructive method which can be used in the field, a system was developed to find and classify six types of vegetative structures on coffee branches: leaves, stems, flowers, unripe fruits, semi-ripe fruits, and ripe fruits. Videos were obtained from 12 coffee branches in field conditions, using the rear camera of a mobile device. Approximately 90 frames, those which had the most information from the scene, were selected from each video. Next, a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was generated using the Structure from Motion (SfM) and Patch-based Multi-view Stereo (PMVS) techniques for each branch. All acquired images were manually recorded, and a Ground Truth point cloud was generated for each branch. The generated point clouds were filtered using a statistical outliers filter, in order to eliminate noise generated in the 3D reconstruction process. The points that were located in the deepest part were considered to be the scene background, and were removed using a band-pass filter. Point clouds were sub-sampled using a VoxelGrid filter, to reduce the number of points to 50% and therefore reduce computation time of the processes that followed. Various two-dimensional (2D) and 3D features were taken from the point clouds: 11 based on RGB, Lab, Luv, YCbCr, and HSV color space, four based on curvatures, and the remaining two based on shape and curvedness indexes. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was trained with the previously mentioned features by using eight branches for the training stage, and four branches for the validation stage. Experimental results showed a precision of 0.82 and a recall of 0.79, when classifying said vegetative structures.

To fill this gap, we proposed a bacteria-based index of biotic integrity (Ba-IBI) by using bacterial community dataset collected from the Three Gorges Reservoir and its upper reaches. Stability analysis based on bacterial resistance (RS) and resilience (RL) to external disturbance was conducted to improve the performance of the index. Four core metrics, i.e. the ratio of Bacilli, Bacteroidetes and Clostridia to Alphaproteobacteria (BBC/A), Oxalobacteraceae, Methanotrophs and Thermophiles were selected after range, responsive and redundancy tests. The improved Ba-IBI, ranging from 1.04 to 4.10, was better at distinguishing sites with or without direct dam effects compared with the unimproved one. The index values maintained high in the riverine sites while reducing in the reservoir, demonstrating the negative influence of dam construction on bacterial integrity. Based on the assessment results, 23.1%, 46.2% and 30.8% sampling sites were large, moderately and little affected by damming, respectively. A Random Forest (RF) regression model was trained and tested, offering a valid prediction of the input Ba-IBI and environmental parameters. Sensitivity analysis revealed the significant contributions of flow velocity towards the predicting process performance, indicating the importance of hydrodynamic conditions on determining the spatial variability of bacterial communities.

Maximum Likelihood (ML), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used as pixel-based methods in addition to object-based image classifi cation (OBC). Post-classifi cation methods were applied to the output of pixel-based classifi cation to minimize the noise effects and heterogeneity within the agricultural parcels. In addition, processing-time performance of the algorithms was evaluated for the test sites and district scale classifi cation. OBC results provided comparatively the best performance for both parcel identifi cation and area estimation at 10 m and fi ner spatial resolution levels. SVM followed OBC at 2.5 m and 5 m resolutions but accuracies decreased dramatically with coarser resolutions. ML and SAM results were worse up to 30 m resolution for both crop type identifi cation and area estimation. In general, parcel identifi cation effi ciency was strongly correlated with spatial resolution while the classifi cation algorithm was a more effective factor than spatial resolution for area estimation accuracy.

One of the fatal disorders causing death is malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. The aim of the modern dermatology is the early detection of skin cancer, which usually results in reducing the mortality rate and less extensive treatment. This paper presents a study on classification of melanoma in the early stage of development using SVMs as a useful technique for data classification. Method. In this paper an automatic algorithm for the classification of melanomas in their early stage, with a diameter under 5 mm, has been presented. The system contains the following steps: image enhancement, lesion segmentation, feature calculation and selection, and classification stage using SVMs. Results. The algorithm has been tested on 200 images including 70 melanomas and 130 benign lesions. The SVM classifier achieved sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 96%. The results indicate that the proposed approach captured most of the malignant cases and could provide reliable information for effective skin mole examination. Conclusions. Micro-melanomas due to the small size and low advancement of development create enormous difficulties during the diagnosis even for experts.

Chapter 3 will handle productivity, Chapter 4 the systematicity of inference, Chapter 5 the systematicity of thought, and Chapter 6 the compositionality of representations. While the present approach differs from what has come to be standard in the literature, there is a respectable precedent. Fodor, (1987), introduces the productivity and systematicity arguments as a kind of in-house debate between Classicism and what we have here called Pure Atomism. These views share a commitment to Representationalism and the Computational Theory of the Attitudes (CTA), but differ in the structure they attribute to cognitive representations. This manner of setting up the debate is sustained in Fodor & Pylyshyn, (1988). There Fodor and Pylyshyn identify two Classical hypotheses. The first is that cognitive representations have combinatorial syntax and semantics and the second is that cognitive processes are sensitive to the combinatorial syntax and semantics of cognitive representations.2 By contrast, Connectionism is supposed to embody representations that are essentially syntactic and semantic atoms.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4615-0275-3_3", "venue": "The Systematicity Arguments", "journal": "The Systematicity Arguments", "mag_id": "13957947", "mag_field_of_study": ["Philosophy"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115781203"}

Transfer learning methods use a labeled source domain to boost the task in a target domain that may be unsupervised or semi-supervised.

In many real-world scenarios, this is not enough and these functions fail to capture the intrinsic geometry of the manifold that the data exists in. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning framework called Semi-Supervised Metric Transfer Learning with Relative Constraints (SSMTR), that uses distance metric learning with a set of relative distance constraints that capture the similarities and dissimilarities between the source and the target domains better. In SSMTR, instance weights are learned for different domains which are then used to reduce the domain shift while a Relative Distance metric is learned in parallel.

In fact, theoretical results show that second-order criteria are able, under some mild conditions, to guarantee the best solution in the sense of classical detection theories. Achieving a good generalisation performance with a receiver requires matching its complexity to the amount of available training data. This problem, known as the curse of dimensionality, has been studied theoretically by Vapnik and Chervonenkis. In this dissertation, we propose complexity control procedures in order to improve the performance of these receivers when few training data are available. Simulation results on real and synthetic data show clearly the competitiveness of our approach compared with other state of the art existing kernel methods like Support Vector Machines", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "370500509", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116966565"}

In order to achieve a more stable performance of machine learning, ensemble learning has been undertaken more popularly to produce a group of classifiers that can be complementary to each other. In this paper, we focus on advancing fuzzy classification through multi-level fusion of fuzzy classifiers in the setting of ensemble learning.

In order to effectively adopt the popular machine learning algorithms for the above-mentioned numerical prediction, in this paper, we propose a two-stage training approach that involves transforming a regression problem into a classification problem and then transforming it back to regression problem. In particular, unsupervised discretization of continuous attributes is adopted at the first stage to transform the target (numeric) attribute into a discrete (nominal) one with several intervals, such that popular machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the interval to which an instance belongs in the setting of a classification task. Furthermore, based on the classification result at the first stage, some of the instances within the predicted interval are selected for training at the second stage towards numerical prediction of the target attribute value of each instance. An experimental study is conducted to investigate in general the effectiveness of the popular learning algorithms in the numerical prediction task and also analyze how the increase of the number of training instances (selected at the second training stage) can impact on the final prediction performance.

Such imbalanced supervision is beyond the scope of most existing supervised codebooks [9,10,12-15,29].

The Graph Quantization step integrates patch labels to build codebook using Mean Shift. Both steps are co-optimized in an Expectation Maximization framework: the E-phase selects the best patches that minimize the semantic distortions in quantization to propagate image labels; while the M-phase groups similar patches with related labels (modeled by WordNet [18]), which minimizes the visual distortions in quantization.

Root complexity itself is ill defined, but indicators derived from images of the root system such as Fractal Dimension can be used as proxies. A disadvantage of using Fractal Dimension as a complexity indicator is that the complexity of the root as seen in the images is captured into a single parameter. This paper describes an alternative method, which translates a root image into a set of parameters. The method consists of computing the intercepts of circles drawn around the centre of the root image with the root branches. This led to characteristic curves from which parameters can be extracted using curve fitting. In addition to the parameters obtained by curve fitting, the density of the root images was included. All parameters were evaluated on their ability to classify the roots among their original genotypes using a method from the realm of Artificial Intelligence, the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results showed that whilst using merely three parameters originating from the characteristic curves, the SVM algorithm was capable of correctly classifying 99.95% of roots among 235 original genotypes.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compag.2009.06.013", "venue": null, "journal": "Computers and Electronics in Agriculture", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2125557175", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["84760695", "194951", "908200", "961425", "4403848", "14495980", "46243921", "84106730", "10039376", "207720429", "109410672", "84795343", "130441948", "201271407", "84266458", "86409832", "41189113", "2845602", "12038702", "122020084", "207579947", "9100829"], "inbound_citations": ["54658554", "214891416", "11008761", "202688533", "46822178", "56262847", "9154443", "12764472", "17939603", "11838132", "12114963", "5035554"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53380959"}

The hyperplane is determined by a subset of the points of the two classes, named support vectors, and has a number of interesting theoretical properties. The proposed method does not require feature extraction and performs recognition on images regarded as points of a space of high dimension.

Using neural networks stimulations, connectionism looks at the brain as a network of inter-connected nodes/units that substrate any intelligent ability or cognitive process through the propagation of activation. Neural networks, in connectionist models, acquire and learn diverse cognitive patterns through the strengthening and weakening of nodes associations. Drawing on this seminal framework, this paper is an attempt to account for interpreting and novice interpreters as neural networks. Throughout the matrix of argumentation, we suggest that the accumulation of a number of input units in novice interpreters\u2019 neural nodes, as micro agents for processing informational units, and the building of the necessary knowledge associations among such nodes, through the strengthening and weakening principles, are prerequisites for being an interpreter. The establishment of a huge network of knowledge nodes enables the network to interpret in a given velocity.

In this framework, neural networks (and in particular, multilayer perceptrons or MLPs) have been restricted to well-defined subtasks of the whole system, i.e., HMM emission probability estimation and feature extraction. The book describes a successful five year international collaboration between the authors. The lessons learned form a case study that demonstrates how hybrid systems can be developed to combine neural networks with more traditional statistical approaches. The book illustrates both the advantages and limitations of neural networks in the framework of a statistical system. Using standard databases and comparing with some conventional approaches, it is shown that MLP probability estimation can improve recognition performance. Other approaches are discussed, though there is no such unequivocal experimental result for these methods. Connectionist Speech Recognition: A Hybrid Approach is of use to anyone intending to use neural networks for speech recognition or within the framework provided by an existing successful statistical approach.

EDA establishes a probability model to describe the distribution of solution from the perspective of population macroscopically by statistical learning method, and then randomly samples the probability model to generate a new population. EDA can better solve multi-objective optimal problems (MOPs). However, the performance of EDA decreases in solving many-objective optimal problems (MaOPs), which contains more than three objectives. Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (RVEA), based on the EDA framework, can better solve MaOPs. In our paper, we use the framework of RVEA. However, we generate the new population by Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks-Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) instead of using crossover and mutation. WGAN-GP have advantages of fast convergence, good stability and high sample quality. WGAN-GP learn the mapping relationship from standard normal distribution to given data set distribution based on a given data set subject to the same distribution. It can quickly generate populations with high diversity and good convergence.

In the absence of suction in the left ventricle, as indicated by the suction detection subsystem, the proposed feedback controller automatically adjusts the pump motor current in order to meet the blood flow requirement of the patient's body at different physiological states. The performance of the feedback control system has been tested to show the ability to autonomously adjust the pump current, while sustaining required cardiac output and mean arterial pressure.

Methods This was a post-hoc analysis of data pooled from three randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (BIA-2093-301, -302, -304). After an 8-week baseline period, patients received placebo or adjunctive ESL 400 mg (studies 301 and 302 only), 800 mg, or 1200 mg once daily (QD) for 14 weeks (2-week titration period, 12-week maintenance period). Psychiatric and cognitive AEs were identified from individual patient data. Suicidality was also evaluated using the Columbia-Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA), or the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). P-values were obtained using the chi-square test of independence or Fisher's exact test, without correcting for multiplicity. Results The analysis population included 1447 patients (ESL, n = 1021; placebo, n = 426). Psychiatric treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurred in 10.8% of patients receiving ESL, and in a comparable proportion (10.3%) of patients receiving placebo (p = 0.802). However, the incidence of depression and suicidality-related TEAEs was significantly higher for ESL (7.4%) vs. placebo (3.8%) (p = 0.009). The occurrence of these TEAEs differed between treatment groups (p = 0.010), but there was no notable trend between increasing ESL dose and increasing incidence of depression and suicidality-related TEAEs. Aggression/hostility-related TEAEs occurred in Conclusions In phase III clinical trials of adjunctive ESL for treatment-refractory POS, psychiatric and cognitive TEAEs were reported infrequently with ESL and placebo.

Although a support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most powerful forecasting approaches that are widely used by the research community, it does not provide an interpretable model that violates the principle of Occam\u2019s razor. In classical regression problems, a penalized linear SVM model for the dimension reduction task has been investigated in the linear feature space under the assumption that the underlying true model is linear. In this paper, the penalized kernel SVM (PKSVM) model is proposed and investigated combining with a SVM information criterion (SVMIC) for the dimension reduction task in the nonlinear kernel space using radial basis function for prediction and model representation. Instead of pursuing sparsity in the original feature space of the SVM, dimension reduction is performed in the kernel feature space. Computationally, a fast and simple-to-implement algorithm is derived. Furthermore, both SVMIC and cross-validation are utilized to select the kernel and regularization parameters to guarantee the model consistency. Real data applications including microarray data analysis and global solar radiation forecasting are provided. The first application selected significant components in genetic study and the important data information is extracted for grid-connected photovoltaic installations in the second application.

For landcover classification, we distinguish between low and high vegetation, roads and buildings. Each pixel of the aerial image should be assigned to one of these classes or be marked as unlabeled. For generation of training data, we rely on labeled image regions: In OSM shape-files, buildings or croplands are represented by polygons, thus allowing to assign labels to huge areas of the data. Further classes, such as traffic infrastructure or trees, are mostly denoted by polygonal chains or points. In order to rasterize this data and to increase the number of labeled pixels, a graph-based segmentation algorithm is applied to the image and the OSM data are intersected with these segments.

Currently, machine learning for spam classification is an important research issue at present. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a new learning method and achieve substantial improvements over the currently preferred methods, and behave robustly whilst tackling a variety of different learning tasks. Due to its high dimensional input, fewer irrelevant features and high accuracy, the SVMs are more important to researchers for categorizing spam.

As a complementary way, the linear and/or nonlinear feature vectors are also extracted from HRV, a main index for cardiac disorder. The significance of the multiple feature vectors is tested with several machine learning methods, namely Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification based on Multiple Association Rule (CMAR), Decision tree induction and Bayesian classifier. As a result, multiple feature vectors extracted from both CAs and HRV (CA+HRV) showed higher accuracy than the separative feature vectors of CAs and HRV. Furthermore, the SVM and CMAR showed about 89.51% and 89.46%, respectively, in terms of diagnosing accuracy rate after evaluating the diagnosis or prediction methods using the finally chosen multiple feature vectors.

This paper proposes a novel scene classification method, which leverages several semantic codebooks learned in a multitask fashion for robust feature encoding, and designs a context-aware image representation for efficient feature pooling. Apart from conventional universal codebook learning approaches, the proposed method encodes each class of local features with a unique semantic codebook, which captures the distinct distribution of different semantic classes more effectively. Instead of learning each semantic codebook separately, we learn a compact global codebook, of which each semantic codebook is a sparse subset, with a two-stage iterative multitask learning algorithm. While minimizing the clustering divergence, the semantic codeword assignment is solved by submodular optimization simultaneously. Built upon the global and semantic codebooks, a context-aware image representation is further developed to encode both global and semantic features in image representation via contextual quantization, semantic response computation, and semantic pooling.

This article reviews open questions regarding connectionist models and concludes that social psychological contributions to such topics as cognition-motivation interactions may be important for the development of integrative connectionist model.", "year": 1996, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "8656338", "doi": "10.1037//0022-3514.70.5.893", "venue": "Journal of personality and social psychology", "journal": "Journal of personality and social psychology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["61326110", "197658004", "62578816", "148778086", "144264973", "13266884", "12996001", "10156808", "118127177", "142597825", "141490753", "58089855", "56588274", "17416002", "13141932", "62578244", "190151710", "33975027", "142297938", "61051459", "23632837", "17828723", "170343102", "29043627", "1355365", "20983528", "8194189", "11572042", "143691859", "197656578", "142860763", "141455243", "28993811", "144054606", "202927997", "198897585", "15375627", "7706059", "21025989", "26166298", "145647669", "55178473", "59779711", "2832081", "209396626", "50263509", "56940469", "61019113", "36672941", "150260867", "8895643", "59944208", "4642944", "62537074", "8869524", "843341", "12217058", "23789004", "170224286", "18556305", "61566132", "145573721", "43845738", "143364170", "140745533", "50263509", "12846268", "60905565", "2562349", "3728984", "2157189", "146236299", "12926318", "59881496", "144179852", "145081258", "140952703", "144143357", "145616859", "198823297", "533055", "208109848", "64053467", "1082017", "140394478", "56896379"], "inbound_citations": ["198819631", "198819631", "299495", "204979635", "22981502", "2520290", "9932633", "202284914", "214693027", "8549670", "51767185", "209492426", "36605176", "42371209", "115156846", "145625015", "42566229", "53376368", "54559884", "17451277", "53384720", "146554870", "210125276", "5011903", "43912028", "209485341", "155034", "10058338", "53445520", "148191193", "16289151", "18297644", "42324826", "148632566", "6067415", "54591116", "5802565", "14548597", "55672968", "16931494", "14126823", "82045", "30847637", "45683117", "146132715", "27395877", "145392224", "16679643", "45130308", "13666643", "53510750", "8024498", "207619592", "141734835", "53558483", "2037792", "6963991", "149384718", "189760600", "53402670", "33129563", "145493629", "12542619", "27551452", "37362361", "12321453", "6461863", "7101466", "5172210", "143985551", "155928406", "30582962", "18324937", "2034426", "147307186", "10970630", "43941410", "67847616", "7925260", "1413952", "22829321", "148319486", "25526886", "15911587", "10230159", "43978734", "9984624", "55150508", "15509747", "10247813", "514860", "49713151", "3778222", "30613604", "16740748", "53374932", "38960826", "16760286", "201709243", "10492760", "53628015", "2822943", "45601107", "33056342", "53132503"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:798249"}

Despite the rapid advances in face-related areas, it is still very difficult for existing methods to simultaneously achieve accurate facial feature preservation and reliable aging during aging modeling. Aiming to address this issue, we introduce a Disentangled Representation learning and Residual Generative Adversarial Network (DR-RGAN) that represents the facial features without age interference, which is achieved by explicitly disentangling the facial features and age variation. An encoder-decoder structured generator produces aging images from unstructured facial representations by using the age characteristics provided separately. It can thus take the disentangled representation to preserve personal identity for face verification. Considering that pixel-based errors may cause a loss of detail, a VGG based content loss is further equipped to preferably preserve facial features. The discriminator is trained to distinguish the real from generated faces, carry out identification prediction, and leverage an age estimator to boost the aging accuracy. It is beneficial for obtaining more photorealistic and desirable aging effects, as well as more consistent face verification results. Extensive experiments on the CACD and LFW datasets demonstrate that our DR-RGAN generates pleasing aging imageries and achieves a high accuracy of face verification.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2019.107097", "venue": null, "journal": "Pattern Recognition", "mag_id": "2981985314", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209945935"}

The exploration of the model design space is often made by a human expert, and optimized using a combination of grid search and search heuristics over a large space of possible choices. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a Reinforcement Learning approach that has been proposed to automate architecture design. NAS has been successfully applied to generate Neural Networks that rival the best human-designed architectures. However, NAS requires sampling, constructing, and training hundreds to thousands of models to achieve well-performing architectures. This procedure needs to be executed from scratch for each new task. The application of NAS to a wide set of tasks currently lacks a way to transfer generalizable knowledge across tasks. In this paper, we present the Multitask Neural Model Search (MNMS) controller. Our goal is to learn a generalizable framework that can condition model construction on successful model searches for previously seen tasks, thus significantly speeding up the search for new tasks. We demonstrate that MNMS can conduct an automated architecture search for multiple tasks simultaneously while still learning well-performing, specialized models for each task. We then show that pre-trained MNMS controllers can transfer learning to new tasks. By leveraging knowledge from previous searches, we find that pre-trained MNMS models start from a better location in the search space and reduce search time on unseen tasks, while still discovering models that outperform published human-designed models.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1710.10776", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2766611722", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["1740355", "29535948", "15700257", "3356163", "91185674", "64935799", "4704285", "1428702", "28695052", "6383532", "990233", "362467", "641039", "12713052"], "inbound_citations": ["202897165", "58901892"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9904397"}

Future predicted values of system reliability are highly sensitive to the choice of SVR parameters and the type of kernel SVR function. The dataset of a turbocharged diesel engine system was used as a case study. The Normalize Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) measure was used to evaluate the SVR model in predicting the reliability of the system. Many experimental attempts were done using the optimal SVR parameters and the proper kernel function. Results showed that Order 5 of the polynomial kernel outperformed both Gaussian and linear kernel functions in predicting the future reliability values with minimal NRMSE. Experimentally, choosing the proper parameters for the SVR is a hard process, and there are no guarantees that the good parameters and the best kernel function are used. Therefore, artificial intelligence must be used. A genetic algorithm (GA) was used as an AI search optimization method to optimize both the SVR parameters and the type of the kernel function by generating a GA-SVR model. The GA successfully optimized the SVR model to ensure accurate predictions. The adaptive GASVR model was used to overcome such problems as small size of the dataset, varying lifetimes of the system components, and odd behavior of the system because of external environmental causes.

Traditional approaches for video classification treat the entire video clip as one data instance. They extract visual features from video frames which are then quantized (e.g., K-means) and pooled (e.g., average pooling) to produce a single feature vector. Such holistic representations of videos are further used as inputs of a classifier. Despite of efficiency, global and aggregate feature representation unavoidably brings in redundant and noisy information from background and unrelated video frames that sometimes overwhelms targeted visual patterns. Besides, temporal correlations between consecutive video frames are also ignored in both training and testing, which may be the key indicator of an action or event. To this end, we propose Weakly Supervised Sequence Modeling (WSSM), a novel framework that combines multiple-instance learning (MIL) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) model seamlessly. Our model takes each entire video as a bag and one video segment as an instance. In our framework, the salient local patterns for different video categories are explored by MIL, and intrinsic temporal dependencies between instances are explicitly exploited using the powerful chain CRF model. In the training stage, we design a novel conditional likelihood formulation which only requires annotation on videos. Such likelihood can be maximized using an alternating optimization method. The training algorithm is guaranteed to converge and is very efficient. In the testing stage, videos are classified by the learned CRF model. The proposed WSSM algorithm outperforms other MIL-based approaches in both accuracy and efficiency on synthetic data and realistic videos for gesture and action classification.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cviu.2015.10.012", "venue": "Comput.

The predicted data produced by the support vector machines is then compared with the known measured data to determine the accuracy. Once the SVM has captured nonlinear relationship between fabrication processes and wafer yields, it can be used to predict wafer yield in other lots fabricated by the same silicon foundry. The advantage of using this approach is to save time due to probing hardware constraints, predict wafer yield across the same fabrication process and give an alternative method of device simulation. Our experiments show that the SVMs predict more accurate than classical device physics equations and in some cases SPICE simulation software in comparison with the actual measured electrical data.

As most of existing descriptors incorporate either color or spatial information; the proposed descriptor, called Grid-3CD, includes both information. This descriptor is based on color connected components (CC) extracted from a quantified image. It consists of a set of 6-tuples computed on a grid of pixels sampled from the color-quantified image. The 6-tuple of a given pixel describes the density, the mass center, the bounding box and the color of the CC that contains this pixel. The efficiency of this descriptor for identity document verification is shown using two strategies of pattern comparison. The first one is unsupervised and based on a distance measure whereas the second is supervised and based on one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimentation of the new descriptor on four datasets of identity documents totaling 3250 documents shows an average accuracy of about 90%, outperforming state-of-the-art descriptors.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/DAS.2018.74", "venue": "2018 13th IAPR International Workshop on Document Analysis Systems (DAS)", "journal": "2018 13th IAPR International Workshop on Document Analysis Systems (DAS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2810132916", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4977939", "17870623", "206590483", "5258236", "1092865", "6459076", "21804891", "2528485", "1399183", "9132178", "2021806", "15173374", "13898083", "4721779", "215215495"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49413050"}

This task, which is commonly called authorship discrimination, represents an important authorship classification application. It consists in checking whether two texts are written by the same author or not by using some AI (Artificial Intelligence) and TM (Text mining) techniques. In our case, two main investigations are conducted and presented: in the first one, the two books are analyzed in a global form; in the second investigation, the two books are segmented into 25 different text segments: 14 segments are extracted from the Quran and 11 ones are extracted from the Hadith. The different segments have more or less the same size, with approximately 2080 tokens per text segment.

To gain the discriminative power on unseen person images, we propose a deep representation learning procedure named part loss network, to minimize both the empirical classification risk on training person images and the representation learning risk on unseen person images. The representation learning risk is evaluated by the proposed part loss, which automatically detects human body parts and computes the person classification loss on each part separately.

Ticks have trespassed the limits of forests and grasslands to start inhabiting green spaces within metropolitan areas. Hence, the transmission of pathogens causing tick-borne diseases is an important threat to public health. Using volunteered tick bite reports collected by two Dutch initiatives, here we present a method to model tick bite risk using human exposure and tick hazard predictors. Our method represents a step forward in risk modelling, since we combine a well-known ensemble learning method, Random Forest, with four count data models of the (zero-inflated) Poisson family. This combination allows us to better model the disproportions inherent in the volunteered tick bite reports. Unlike canonical machine learning models, our method can capture the overdispersion or zero-inflation inherent in data, thus yielding tick bite risk predictions that resemble the original signal captured by volunteers. Mapping model predictions enables a visual inspection of the spatial patterns of tick bite risk in the Netherlands. The Veluwe national park and the Utrechtse Heuvelrug forest, which are large forest-urban interfaces with several cities, are areas with high tick bite risk. This is expected, since these are popular places for recreation and tick activity is high in forests. However, our model can also predict high risk in less-intensively visited recreational areas, such as the patchy forests in the northeast of the country, the natural areas along the coastline, or some of the Frisian Islands. Our model could help public health specialists to design mitigation strategies for tick-borne diseases, and to target risky areas with awareness and prevention campaigns.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6903726", "pubmed_id": "31821325", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0216511", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2995572205", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["89833876", "34910516", "15134384", "43613363", "214959289", "4906136", "29883190", "7495285", "51956814", "52297213", "8001145", "28137604", "5718538", "3916141", "88551429", "33297723", "3245834", "53015317", "14435082", "57764599", "207475120", "123572971", "89141", "41083249", "10868934", "83306208", "6890650", "14025447", "25867534", "8422093", "14507627", "22137354", "22345567", "215223325", "24396959", "12065599", "24329985", "27693719", "18864341", "9642724", "4886726", "11259771", "207738357", "206420153", "39321012", "206742563", "35733843", "52525412", "10659969", "63709930", "85564512"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209317235"}

However, it is very difficult to develop robust automated gait recognition systems, since gait may be affected by many covariate factors such as clothing, walking surface, walking speed, camera view angle, etc. Out of them, large view angle was deemed as the most challenging factor since it may alter the overall gait appearance substantially. Recently, some deep learning approaches (such as CNNs) have been employed to extract view-invariant features, and achieved encouraging results on small datasets. However, they do not scale well to large dataset, and the performance decreases significantly w.r.t. number of subjects, which is impractical to large-scale surveillance applications. To address this issue, in this work we propose a Discriminant Gait Generative Adversarial Network (DiGGAN) framework, which not only can learn view-invariant gait features for cross-view gait recognition tasks, but also can be used to reconstruct the gait templates in all views --- serving as important evidences for forensic applications. We evaluated our DiGGAN framework on the world's largest multi-view OU-MVLP dataset (which includes more than 10000 subjects), and our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms significantly on various cross-view gait identification scenarios (e.g., cooperative/uncooperative mode).

With an aim to detect crop diseases and pests with high confidence, we use convolutional neural networks (CNN) and boosting techniques on Corn leaf images in different health states. The queen of cereals, Corn, is a versatile crop that has adapted to various climatic conditions. It is one of the major food crops in India along with wheat and rice.

We have evaluated ensembles of CNN based image features, with a classifier and boosting in order to achieve plant disease classification. Using an ensemble of Adaptive Boosting cascaded with a decision tree based classifier trained on features from CNN, we have achieved an accuracy of 98% in classifying the Corn leaf images into four different categories viz. Healthy, Common Rust, Late Blight and Leaf Spot. This is about 8% improvement in classification performance when compared to CNN only.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5220/0007687608940899", "venue": "ICPRAM", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2922385286", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["89141", "2375110", "206787478", "206597351", "6644398", "15052063", "206594692", "12670695", "208104006", "10659969", "2930547", "6383532", "14124313", "206593880", "362467", "3960646"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88491287"}

In this paper, a comprehensive approach of complex load recognition and series arc detection is proposed on the basis of principal component analysis and support vector machine (PCA-SVM) combination model. Several typical loads were selected and analyzed, especially nonlinear and complex loads like power electronics load and multi-state load. Three time-domain parameters, maximum slip difference (MSD), zero current period (ZCP) and maximum Euclidean distance (MED), and nine frequency-domain harmonics information are collected to complex waveforms. To decrease the computation cost and further to enhance the response velocity, all the time-domain and frequency-domain information were blended and dimensionally reduced to three parameters by principal component analysis (PCA). Prior to the series arc detection, load recognition is trained and completed with the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. At last, the comprehensive model of load recognition and series arc detection is achieved based on a support vector machine (SVM).

We describe an algorithm named Structural Classification and Regression Trees (S-CART), which is capable of inducing first-order trees for both classification and regression problems, i.e., for the prediction of either discrete classes or numerical values. We arrive at this algorithm by a strategy called upgrading-we start from a propositional induction algorithm and turn it into a relational learner by devising suitable extensions of the representation language and the associated algorithms. In particular, we have upgraded CART, the classical method for learning classification and regression trees, to handle relational examples and background knowledge. The system constructs a tree containing a literal (an atomic formula or its negation) or a conjunction of literals in each node, and assigns either a discrete class or a numerical value to each leaf. In addition, we have extended the CART methodology by adding linear regression models to the leaves of the trees; this does not have a counter part in CART, but was inspired by its approach to pruning. The regression variant of S-CART is one of the few systems applicable to Relational Regression problems. Experiments in several real-world domains demonstrate that the approach is useful and competitive with existing methods, indicating that the advantage of relatively small and comprehensible models does not come at the expense of predictive accuracy.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-662-04599-2_6", "venue": "Relational Data Mining", "journal": "Relational Data Mining", "mag_id": "1490466294", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["14546274", "55146239", "5871816", "7429070", "1739688", "15812801", "9945488", "11123158", "1778045", "14172293", "3232818", "18177204", "9508356"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:118150382"}

Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) is one such manifold learning method for multivariate data clustering and visualization, defined within a probabilistic framework. In the original formulation, GTM is optimized by minimization of an error that is a function of Euclidean distances, making it vulnerable to the aforementioned errors, especially for datasets of convoluted geometry. Here, we modify GTM to penalize divergences between the Euclidean distances from the data points to the model prototypes and the corresponding geodesic distances along the manifold.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several, possibly competing, performance criteria.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1143997.1144249", "venue": "GECCO '06", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2032038941", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["271331", "194951", "523395", "961425", "12512548", "8332750", "14363287", "17984683", "1115550", "7367791", "209099422", "9760998", "17194652", "64543020", "18914582", "12633343", "21390567", "28637672", "118825644"], "inbound_citations": ["11805009", "17047715", "49563968", "16643544", "9422570", "1395489", "561715", "6718529", "214889026", "214949192", "29692919", "226008", "58044912", "36008312", "4862765", "11564199", "16185574", "207873312", "16159955", "8461540", "2814927", "681827", "15750512", "3851028", "6565691", "21345882", "6454513", "12962875", "172132434"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:105873"}

In more detail, it tries to predict the self-reported disease perception using the answers to related questionnaires and data from the disease history of the user(s). These predictions are also performed on data from single users, revealing individual connections to the target, e.g. correlation with concentration or mood. They also achieved accuracy of up to 99%, albeit with some important caveats. The generalized prediction yielded acceptable results with 79% (tinnitus, binary decision) and 68% (60% non-weighted, hearing loss, 4 classes) accuracy.
