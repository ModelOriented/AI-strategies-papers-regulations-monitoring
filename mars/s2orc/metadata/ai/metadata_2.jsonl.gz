Detection methods based on statistical and data mining techniques are widely deployed as anomaly-based detection ::: system (ADS). Although the statistical-based anomaly detection (SAD) method fascinates researchers, the low attack detection rates (also known as the detection of ::: true positive) that reflect the effectiveness of the detection system generally persist. Specifically, this is due to the packets affected by the outlier data points (i.e., the data points that have a huge dissimilarity with the common data points) and the defined threshold size that is usually performed without any further analysis on the observed packet. It provides a significant effect in the process to determine which packet is more likely attributes to the anomalous behaviour. In recent years, data mining based ::: anomaly detection (DMAD), particularly classification methods, have been incessantly enhanced in differentiating normal and attack behaviour. Unfortunately, in such methods the outcomes, i.e., true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative detections that directly influence the rates of accuracy, detection, and false alarms are not much improved and thus raise a persistent problem in the employment of such systems. The specific drawback that causes this is the failure to differentiate the packets ::: behaviour that resembles a similar behaviour more precisely, such as a normal behaviour having a similar anomalous content behaviour and vice versa. These ::: inaccurate outcomes can compromise the reliability of IDSs and cause them to overlook the attacks. As ADS can process massive volumes of packets, the amount of ::: processing time needed to discover the pattern of the packets is also increased accordingly and resulting in late detection of the attack packets. The main contributor for such a shortcoming is the need to re-compute every process for each packet despite ::: the attack behaviour having been examined. ::: This study aims to improve the detection of an anomalous behaviour by identifying the outlier data points in the packets more precisely, maximizes the detection of packets with similar behaviours more accurately while reducing the detection time. An Integrated Anomaly Detection Scheme ( IADS) is proposed to overcome the aforesaid drawbacks. The proposed scheme integrates an ADS and signature-based detection system (SDS) approach for better and rapid intrusion detection. Therefore, Statisticalbased Packet Header Anomaly Detection (SPHAD) and a hybridized Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifier (NB+RF) are considered for the ADS, and Signature-based ::: Packet Header Intrusion Detection (SPHID) is proposed as the SDS. In SPHAD,statistical analysis is used to construct a normal profile using statistical formula, ::: scoring the incoming packets, and computing the relationships between historic normal behaviour as a dependent variable against observable packet behaviours as the independent variable through linear regression. Then the threshold measurement (size) is defined based on R2 and Cohen\u2019s-d values in order to improve the attack detection rate by identifying a set of outlier data points which are present inside the packets more ::: precisely. Subsequently, NB+RF, a hybrid classification algorithm is used to distinguish similar and dissimilar content behaviours of a packet. The Naive Bayes ::: (NB) classifier is employed to construct the values of the posterior and the prior probability of a packet, then this information as well as the header values and statistical analysis information are fed to the Random Forest (RF) classifier to improve the detection of actual attacks and normal packets. SPHID then extracts the distinct behaviour of the packets which are verified as attacks by NB+RF and compute it as attack signatures for faster future detections, as the detection time will be reduced for the attack whose signature is already included in the signature database. ::: The effectiveness of the IADS has been evaluated under different detection capabilities (i.e., false positive, false negative, true positive, true negative, false alarm, accuracy,detection rate, attack data detection rate, normal data detection rate) and detection times ::: using the DARPA 1999 and ISCX 2012 intrusion detection benchmark datasets as well as with Live-data. Results from the experiments demonstrate that IADS could ::: effectively detect attacks and normal packets more precisely compared to previous work and the ADS which performs intrusion detections without employing the SPHID ::: method. In addition, the detection time of IADS is much improved as compared to ADS. Thus, IADS is a better solution for anomaly detection methods in detecting ::: untrustworthy behaviour and to define attack and normal behaviours more accurately.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2968339684", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201901460"}

As fundamental tools of IDSs, learning based classification methods have been widely employed. When it comes to detecting network intrusions in small sample sizes (e.g., emerging intrusions), the limited number and imbalanced proportion of training samples usually cause significant challenges in training supervised and semi-supervised classifiers. In this paper, we propose a general network intrusion detection framework to address the challenges of both \\emph{data scarcity} and \\emph{data imbalance}. The novelty of the proposed framework focuses on incorporating deep adversarial learning with statistical learning and exploiting learning based data augmentation. Given a small set of network intrusion samples, it first derives a Poisson-Gamma joint probabilistic generative model to generate synthesised intrusion data using Monte Carlo methods.

From the performance of the PDP reading model of Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, and Patterson (1996), it is inferred that the acoustic\u2013articulatory motor pattern associator that supports repetition provides the basis for phonological sequence knowledge. From the observation that many patients make phonemic paraphasic errors in language production, as in repetition, it is argued that there must be a direct link between distributed concept representations (lexical semantic knowledge) and this network representation of sequence knowledge. In this way, both lexical semantic and phonotactic constraints are brought to bear on language production. The literature on phonological function in normal subjects (slip-of-the-tongue corpora) and in patients with aphasia is critically reviewed from this perspective. The relationship between acoustic and articulatory motor representations in the process of phonetic perception is considered. Repetition and reproduction conduction aphasia are reviewed in detail and extended consideration is given to the representation of auditory verbal short-term memory in the model. Finally, the PDP model is reconciled with information processing models of phonological processing, including that of Lichtheim, and with current knowledge of the anatomic localization of phonological processing.

Methods/Statistical Analysis: Advocacy monitoring can be performed by extracting the social data related to women and children health. A keyword based search technique is used for this purpose. The children health details like the nutrition deficiencies, lack of vaccination, diseases like pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria that affect new born children and the women health data like maternal weight loss, maternal mortality rate, sanitation and antenatal care during maternity can be gathered from the social media using keyword based search technique. The extracted data are needed to be analyzed and classified into related data groups using Decision tree C4.5 and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Findings: Decision tree C4.5 algorithm classifies the data based on the concept of information entropy. The data are classified at each node of the tree after analyzing the attribute of the data. SVM analyzes the extracted data and uses the health parameters listed to group the related data. The approach is of two stages: training and testing. The training dataset is build using the health data representing the listed search words. This training set is used to classify the test data. The data are tested with the training set and only women and child health data are stored in classes that help in advocacy monitoring in an efficient way.

A connectionist model is made up of a large number of very simple processing units, richly interconnected and able to send signals to each other depending on their momentary activation levels. No individual processing unit represents a meaningful concept; instead, overall patterns of activation hold representational meaning. This article emphasizes the novel properties of connectionist representation that might appeal to theorists and researchers in social psychology, including their context sensitivity and flexibility, ability to represent prototypes and exemplars within a single network, and ability to determine whether a stimulus is familiar even before the stimulus can be identified or categorized. Virtually every theory in social psychology makes reference to mental representations, including beliefs, attitudes, stereotypes, person impressions, autobiographical memories, or the self-concept. Therefore, the assumed properties of mental representations fundamentally influence the predictions that will be made by our theories. Social psychologists have often unquestioningly adopted a standard set of assumptions about the nature of representations (such as associative network or schema models; Smith, 1998), assumptions that are pleasantly straightforward, familiar, and intuitive. This article describes an alternative, distributed connectionist models of representation, and discusses some of their less intuitive properties, with the goal of encouraging social psychologists to explore the implications of these models for their theories. As I will argue, connectionist models can explode misleading dichotomies, unify seemingly distinct types of processing, and naturally generate properties (such as the flexible, contextsensitive nature of representations) that are often found in social psychological research.

False positive reduction is not only a requirement for mass but also for calcification CAD systems which are currently deployed for clinical use. This paper tackles two problems related to reducing the number of false positives in the detection of all lesions and masses, respectively. Firstly, textural patterns of breast tissue have been analyzed using several multi-scale textural descriptors based on wavelet and gray level co-occurrence matrix. The second problem addressed in this paper is the parameter selection and performance optimization. For this, we adopt a model selection procedure based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for selecting the most discriminative textural features and for strengthening the generalization capacity of the supervised learning stage based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. For evaluating the proposed methods, two sets of suspicious mammogram regions have been used. The first one, obtained from Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM), contains 1494 regions (1000 normal and 494 abnormal samples). The second set of suspicious regions was obtained from database of Mammographic Image Analysis Society (mini-MIAS) and contains 315 (207 normal and 108 abnormal) samples. Results from both datasets demonstrate the efficiency of using PSO based model selection for optimizing both classifier hyper-parameters and parameters, respectively.

In the market, Bellota is considered to be a better class than the generic Iberico since products with the Bellota label are manufactured with high quality fat obtained from extensively reared pigs fed on acorns and pasture. Analyses of fatty acids and triacylglycerols were carried out by gas chromatography and a flame ion detector. A CP-SIL 88 column (highly substituted cyanopropyl phase; 50 m\u00d70.25 mm i.d., 0.2 \u00b5m film thickness) (Varian, Palo Alto, USA) was used for fatty acid analysis and a fused silica capillary DB-17HT column (50% phenyl\u201350% methylpolysiloxane; 30 m\u00d70.25 mm i.d., 0.15 \u00b5m film thickness) was used for triacylglycerols. Twelve fatty acids and 16 triacylglycerols were identified. Various discriminant models (linear quadratic discriminant analyses, logistic regression and support vector machines) were trained to predict the sample class (Bellota or Iberico). These models included fatty acids and triacylglycerols separately and combined fatty acid and triacylglycerol profiles. The number of correctly classified samples according to discriminant analyses can be considered low (lower than 65%). The greatest discriminant rate was obtained when triacylglycerol profiles were included in the model, whilst using a combination of fatty acid and triacylglycerol profiles did not improve the rate of correct assignation. The values that represent the reliability of prediction of the samples according to the label specification were higher for the Iberico class than for the Bellota class. In fact, quadratic and Support Vector Machine discriminate analyses were not able to assign the Bellota class (0%) when combined fatty acids and triacylglycerols were included in the model. The use of fatty acid and triacylglycerol profiles to discriminate Iberian dry-cured sausages in the market according to their labelling information is unclear.

Leaf reflectance measurements were acquired from plants grown in two separate greenhouse experiments conducted in 2014. Twelve normalized difference vegetation indices were derived from the reflectance measurements, including advanced, green, greenred, green-blue, and normalized difference vegetation indices, shortwave infrared water stress indices, normalized difference pigment and red edge indices, and structure insensitive pigment index. Using the twelve vegetation indices as input variables, the conditional inference version of random forest (cforest) readily distinguished soybean and velvetleaf from the two pigweeds (Palmer amaranth and redroot pigweed) and from each other with classification accuracies ranging from 93.3% to 100%. The greatest errors were observed between the two pigweed classes, with classification accuracies ranging from 70% to 93.3%.

As more and more heart diseases are caused by people\u2019s living pressure or habits, the diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases also require technical improvement.

In order to quickly and accurately judge the heart sound signal, the classification method based on Wavelet Fractal and twin support vector machine (TWSVM) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the original heart sound signal is decomposed by wavelet transform, and the wavelet decomposition coefficients of the signal are extracted. Then the two-norm eigenvectors of the heart sound signal are obtained by solving the two-norm values of the decomposition coefficients. In order to express the feature information more abundantly, the energy entropy of the decomposed wavelet coefficients is calculated, and then the energy entropy characteristics of the signal are obtained. In addition, based on the fractal dimension, the complexity of the signal is quantitatively described. The box dimension of the heart sound signal is solved by the binary box dimension method. So its fractal dimension characteristics can be obtained. The above eigenvectors are synthesized as the eigenvectors of the heart sound signal. Finally, the twin support vector machine (TWSVM) is applied to classify the heart sound signals. The proposed algorithm is verified on the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2016 heart sound database. The experimental results show that this proposed algorithm based on twin support vector machine (TWSVM) is superior to the algorithm based on support vector machine (SVM) in classification accuracy and speed.

In this paper, we have proposed to use binary patterns (LBP) as features to classify MRI brain images into tumorous and non-tumorous. The LBP computes the relationship between central pixel and neighboring pixels of the 3 \u00d7 3 window and assigns a label to each window.

To achieve this, a large amount of Genome Data Sets need to analysis and predict the diseases patterns with highest Classification Accuracy. It is noted that a single Gene is not responsible for many Human Diseases and instead, diseases occur by different or group of genomes interacting together and causes diseases. Hence it is need to analyse and associate the complete genome sequences to understand or predict various possible human diseases. This research work is identified three recently proposed popular Genome Cluster Classifiers namely Hierarchical-Random Forest based Clustering (HRF-Cluster), Genetic Algorithm-Gene Association Classifier and Weighted Common Neighbor Classifier (wCN). These Classifiers were implemented and studied thoroughly in terms of Prediction Accuracy, Memory Utilization, Memory Usage and Processing Time. For training and analysing the performances of these three genome classifiers, this research work considered a few human genome patterns and a few diseases patterns namely Cerebral Vascular Disease Pattern, Sugar Pattern, Cardiomyopathy Pattern, and Pericardial Disease Pattern. From our experimental results, it is noted that the performances of these three classifiers are purely depend on the patterns of genomes. That is for different genome patterns, the performances of these genome classifiers are different. From our Results, it is noted that the Hierarchical-Random Forest based Clustering (HRF-Cluster) is predicted a few human diseases like Cerebral Vascular Disease Pattern (11%) and Sugar (12%), but it fails to predict the existing patterns like Cardiomyopathy pattern and Pericardial Disease Pattern. The GA-Gene Association Classifier is predicting Human Diseases Patterns like Cardiomyopathy (29%), Pericardial Disease (3%) and Sugar (16%). Similarly, the Weighted Common Neighbor Classifier (wCN) predicts a few Human Diseases like Cerebral Vascular disease (13 %) and Sugar (20%). From the results obtained, it is established that GA-Gene Association Classifier is predicting genome patterns very well as compared with HRF-Cluster and wCN but however it is unable to predict the Cerebral Vascular Disease Pattern.

In order to improve the recognition performance, we develop three more Bayesian-based SVMs, including the one-versus-all method, the hierarchical agglomerative clustering-based method, and the adaptive clustering method.

In devel- oping the SHRUTI model we have pursued both these ap- proaches simultaneously in order to understand how net- works of neurons can perform complex cognitive tasks. In past work, we have demonstrated how such networks can make predictive and explanatory inferences with re- spect to a large body of causal knowledge. In this paper, we show how the SHRUTI architecture can be extended to represent and reason not only about beliefs but also about utilities, values and goals. The resulting model uses a single causal structure to seek explanations, make predictions, and identify expected utilities of world states and actions. The SHRUTI architecture First we present the basic elements of the SHRUTI archi- tecture. The model is described in considerably more detail in [Shastri, 1999, Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1993, Shastri and Wendelken, 2000]. SHRUTI is a neurally plausible (connectionist) model that demonstrates how a network of neuron-like elements could encode a large body of structured knowledge and perform a variety of inferences within a few hundred milliseconds. SHRUTI suggests that the encoding of relational information (frames, predicates, etc.) is mediated by neural circuits composed of focal clusters and that the dynamic rep- resentation and communication of relational instances involves the transient propagation of rhythmic activity across these clusters. A role-entity binding is represented in this rhythmic activity by the synchronous firing of ap- propriate cells. ?e ?v Person ?e Man John focal cluster Introduction ?v enabler buy(buyer,thing,seller) collector role node to +e:Money rule mediator to ?e:Object rule pay(payer,payee,payment) Figure 1: Diagram showing core elements of the SHRUTI model, including relational focal clusters, a fact, a rule, and a simple type hierarchy. A focal cluster is a collection of nodes with varying functionality all subserving a common representation. A relational focal cluster consists of a positive (+) and a negative (-) collector node, an enabler (?) node, and role nodes. The activity of the positive (negative) collector node reflects the amount of evidence collected in sup- port of belief (disbelief) in the given relation. Activity of the enabler (?) node reflects the strength with which information about the relation is being sought. A link from collector to enabler ensures that the system auto- matically seeks explanation for what it believes. Role bindings are represented by synchronous firing of rela- tional role nodes with nodes in a connectionist type hi- erarchy. A relational cluster with active role bindings represents a relational instance. Rules are encoded with links that enable the propagation of rhythmic activity from one relational focal cluster to the next. Specif- ically, a rule is formed by linking the antecedent col- lector to the consequent collector, the consequent en- abler to the antecedent enabler, and matching role nodes in both directions, through an intervening focal cluster", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4324/9781315782379-194", "venue": "IN PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE COGNITIVE SCIENCE SOCIETY", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1274680122", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14799428"], "inbound_citations": ["7241080", "14871602", "12646850", "10555126", "58841350", "9344732", "10879569"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10230186"}

Alternatively, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is considered to be safe and provides good visualization of the soft tissues, but the bony structures appear invisible from MRI. Therefore, the segmentation of bony structures from MRI is quite challenging. In this paper, we propose a cascaded generative adversarial network with deep-supervision discriminator (Deep-supGAN) for automatic bony structures segmentation. The first block in this architecture is used to generate a high-quality CT image from an MRI, and the second block is used to segment bony structures from MRI and the generated CT image. Different from traditional discriminators, the deep-supervision discriminator distinguishes the generated CT from the ground-truth at different levels of feature maps. For segmentation, the loss is not only concentrated on the voxel level but also on the higher abstract perceptual levels.

The vast spatial coverage of remote sensing data, coupled with the tough conditions in areas of interest has made remote sensing a particularly useful tool in the field of glaciology. Compared to optical images, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are hardly influenced by clouds. This is important because glacial areas are usually under cloud cover. The Dongkemadi glacier in the Qinghai\u2013Tibetan plateau was selected as the study area for this paper. We use polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image for classification on and around the glacier. The contrast between ice and wet snow is remarkable, but it is difficult to distinguish the ice from the ground on SAR images due to similar backscatter characteristics in former research. In our study, we found that this distinction can be achieved by target decomposition. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are performed to classify the glacier areas using the selected features. The glacial areas are classified into six parts: wet snow, ice, river outwash, soil land, rocky land and others. The PolSAR\u2013Target decomposition\u2013SVMs (PTS) method is proven to be efficient, with an overall classification accuracy of 91.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.875. Moreover, 86.63% of the bare ice and 96.76% of the wet snow are correctly classified.

Existing methods aim at fitting new clothes into a person can only transfer clothes on the fixed human pose, but still show unsatisfactory performances which often fail to preserve the identity, lose the texture details, and decrease the diversity of poses. In this paper, we make the first attempt towards multi-pose guided virtual try-on system, which enables transfer clothes on a person image under diverse poses. Given an input person image, a desired clothes image, and a desired pose, the proposed Multi-pose Guided Virtual Try-on Network (MG-VTON) can generate a new person image after fitting the desired clothes into the input image and manipulating human poses. Our MG-VTON is constructed in three stages: 1) a desired human parsing map of the target image is synthesized to match both the desired pose and the desired clothes shape; 2) a deep Warping Generative Adversarial Network (Warp-GAN) warps the desired clothes appearance into the synthesized human parsing map and alleviates the misalignment problem between the input human pose and desired human pose; 3) a refinement render utilizing multi-pose composition masks recovers the texture details of clothes and removes some artifacts.

However, their performance strongly depends on the settings of their hyperparameters, which has not been well studied. Moreover, unavailability of a clean training set that only comprises normal data in many real-life problems has given rise to the application of OCSVMs in an unsupervised manner. However, it has been shown that if the training set includes anomalies, the normal boundary created by OCSVMs is prone to skew toward the anomalies. This problem decreases the detection rate of anomalies and results in poor performance of the classifier. In this paper, we propose a new technique to set the hyperparameters and clean suspected anomalies from unlabelled training sets. The proposed method removes suspected anomalies based on a $K$ -nearest neighbors technique, which is then used to directly estimate the hyperparameters. We examine several benchmark data sets with diverse distributions and dimensionality. Our findings suggest that on the examined data sets, the proposed technique is roughly 70 times faster than supervised parameter estimation via grid-search and cross validation, and one to three orders of magnitude faster than broadly used semisupervised and unsupervised parameter estimation methods for OCSVMs. Moreover, our method statistically outperforms those semisupervised and unsupervised methods and its accuracy is comparable to supervised grid-search and cross validation.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29994608", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2785792", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2789857439", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["16128406", "207172599", "59941878", "15209254", "6787631", "207566367", "2110475", "17490415", "6604929", "62195333", "14712495", "206720046", "478431", "18226230", "10119411", "18382141", "15252489", "11860755", "10611065", "2431538", "14821168", "590725", "207320655", "206598354", "11491192", "46524231", "16932037", "11134230", "6550667", "7228119", "7381206", "1304550", "123874288", "2443126", "961425", "15023467", "12601634"], "inbound_citations": ["204509376", "58670545", "51612651", "208329302", "67856630", "208094841", "208617492", "210996260", "67872910", "116254800"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51613929"}

The problem of indeterminacy concerns the fact that, for a given input semantic representation, the grammar might allow for several (i.e. thousands) alternative surface realizations. While the traditional approach to dealing with this problem is to rank the generated strings using a surface-oriented n-gram language model (LM), this thesis develops a linguistically informed approach based on features that are keyed to the internal structure of the realizations. The approach extends on the methodology previously used for statistical parsing and statistical unification-based grammars, and adapts it to the context of generation. This allows us to train treebank-based discriminative realization rankers based on modeling frameworks such as Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The training data is based on the novel notion of a generation treebank, which we show how to automatically create on the basis of an existing parse-oriented treebank. For reference, we also develop an n-gram-based LM trained on a large corpus of raw text. Our experimental results show that the use of a discriminative model trained on just a few thousand items in a generation treebank, gives significantly better ranking performance than the use of a traditional surface-oriented LM. Moreover, we show that even better results can be obtained by combining the two modeling approaches. This is done by including the LM as an additional feature in the discriminative model. Evaluation scores are reported for several data sets and using a range of different automated metrics. We also include results for a manual evaluation carried out by a panel of external anonymous judges. The hybrid system for surface realization described in this thesis is currently integrated for target language generation in the Norwegian\u2013English machine translation (MT) system LOGON.

We find that, when the full state dynamics are available for training, RC outperforms BPTT approaches in terms of predictive performance and capturing of the long-term statistics, while at the same time requiring much less time for training.

These methods suffer from a major disadvantage, namely, that of the excessive computational burden encountered by processing all the data. In this paper, we suggest a recursive and computationally superior mechanism. Rather than process all the data using a PRS, we propose that the data be recursively subdivided into smaller subsets. This recursive subdivision can be arbitrary, and need not utilize any underlying clustering philosophy. The advantage of this is that the PRS processes subsets of data points that effectively sample the entire space to yield smaller subsets of prototypes. These prototypes are then, in turn, gathered and processed by the PRS to yield more refined prototypes. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed recursive mechansim yields classification comparable to the best reported prototype condensation schemes to-date, for both artificial data sets and for samples involving real-life data sets.

Battery health monitoring and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction are needed to prevent catastrophic failure of the battery. The aim of this research is to develop a data-driven method to monitor the batteries state of health and predict their RUL by using the battery capacity degradation data. This paper also investigated the effect of prediction starting point to the RUL prediction error. One of the data-driven method drawbacks is the need of a large amount of data to obtain accurate prediction. This paper proposed a method to generate a series of degradation data that follow the Gaussian distribution based on limited battery capacity degradation data. The prognostic model was constructed from the new data using least square support vector machine (LSSVM) regression. The remaining useful life prediction was carried out by extrapolating the model until reach the end of life threshold. The method was applied to three differences lithium-ion batteries capacity data. The results showed that the proposed method has good performance. The method can predict the lithium-ion batteries RUL with a small error, and the optimal RUL starting point was found at the point where the battery has experienced the highest capacity recovery due to the self-recharge phenomenon.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.929.93", "venue": null, "journal": "Materials Science Forum", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2889489870", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1833621", "2118545", "18541111", "18183207", "27144977", "19741915", "110184494", "108805285", "70728521", "32102641", "107033448", "18180962", "16390199", "110643788", "110124098", "18690183", "28844904", "18265156", "14903463"], "inbound_citations": ["116610304", "204734516"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:139548754"}

The techniques evaluated were Support Vector Machines, Boosting, Bayesian networks, neural networks and a weekly average method. All techniques were evaluated on seven day into the future forecasting of the Regional Reference (pool) Prices (RRP) for the New South Wales (NSW) region of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Due to highly volatile and non-repetitive nature of the NSW RRP, all complex machine learning methods provided inferior accuracy forecasts compared to a weekly average method. The weekly average method was computationally less expensive and more transparent to the user than any of the machine learning techniques. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) was chosen for its novel application to electricity price forecasting because it is considered to be the next generation to neural networks. The structured SVM training algorithm proved more consistent and reliable than the neural network algorithm. Bayesian networks offer the adaptability of a neural network with the advantage of providing a price forecast with confidence intervals for each half-hour determined from the actual data. The SVM and Bayesian techniques were found to provide acceptable forecasts for NSW demand. An investigation of international electricity markets found that each market was unique with different market structures, regulations, network topologies and ownership regimes. Price forecasting techniques and results cannot be universally applied without careful consideration of local conditions. For instance, price data for the Spanish and Californian electricity markets were investigated and found to have significantly lower price volatility than the NSW region of the NEM. An extensive examination of the NSW RRP showed that the price exhibited no consistent long-term trend. A stationary data set could not be extracted from the price data. Thus, making forecasting unsuited to techniques using large historical data sets. The strongest pattern found for NSW prices was the weekly cycle, so a weekly average method was developed to utilise this weekly cycle. Over 25 weeks of NSW RRP from February to July 2002, the seven day into the future price forecast mean absolute error (MAE) for the SVM technique was 27.8%. The weekly average method was more accurate with an MAE of 20.6% and with a simple linear price adjustment for demand, the error was reduced to 18.1%. The price spikes and uneven distribution of prices were unsuitable for the Boosting or Bayesian network techniques.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1578718544", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:153904884"}

We train and cascade two FCNs for a combined segmentation of the liver and its lesions. In the first step, we train a FCN to segment the liver as ROI input for a second FCN. The second FCN solely segments lesions from the predicted liver ROIs of step 1. We refine the segmentations of the CFCN using a dense 3D CRF that accounts for both spatial coherence and appearance.

Firstly, we propose to model articulated body on Riemannian manifold to describe the essence of human motion, which can reflect biometric signatures of the enrolled individuals. Then two spatia-temporal metric learning approaches are proposed, namely Spatio-Temporal Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (ST-LMNN) and Spatio-Temporal Multi-Metric Learning (STMM), to learn discriminant bilinear metrics which can encode the spatio-temporal structure of human motion. Specifically, the ST-LMNN algorithm extends the bilinear model into classical Large Margin Nearest Neighbor method, which learns a low-dimensional local linear embedding in the spatial and temporal domain, respectively. To further capture the unique motion pattern for each individual, the proposed STMM algorithm learns a set of individual-specific spatio-temporal metrics, which make the projected features of the same person closer to its class mean than that of different classes by a large margin. Beyond that, we present a new publicly available dataset for locomotion recognition to evaluate the influence of both internal and external covariant factors.

As a solution for this problem, this paper introduces a novel mechanism to build a self-learned classifier model that can automatically generate class labeled training data set for Knowledge/Information Extraction from domain independent unstructured text. Sri Lankan English newspapers (which comprise unstructured text in unconstrained domains) are the main data source for this study and a prototype was built to Professional Information Extraction with the semantic pattern Who holds/held What position, Where and When (Four words start with \u2018W\u2019, hence named \u2018QuadW\u2019). Methodology uses advanced machine learning techniques such as, a Random Forest with Adaboost ensemble algorithm to build a composite classification model. This classifier is called as self-learned since, it generates its own training data set automatically. This composite model has improved accuracy and avoided over fitting to data as well. The rule-based feature extraction algorithm and the hand-craft ontology developed, can also be considered as novel components of this study. Self-learned classifier has been extensively improved and tested to show higher accuracy with precision and recall close to one. Therefore, the classified output from the self-learned classifier can be used as a gold-standard data set for future research in Professional Information Extraction. The constructed ontology with approximately 400 facts, also can be effectively used in future researches. Further, introduced classifier can be used as a tool to extend the existing ontology as well. A novel usage of machine learning algorithms to text classification demonstrates that, this study goes with the state-of-the-art technologies.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICACCP.2019.8882996", "venue": "2019 Second International Conference on Advanced Computational and Communication Paradigms (ICACCP)", "journal": "2019 Second International Conference on Advanced Computational and Communication Paradigms (ICACCP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2982332369", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6755965", "10910955", "15015161", "15515902", "12808163", "1907120", "5319529", "1181640", "7478965", "57146809", "6397026", "3830451", "15220741", "49315358", "57146809"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204939396"}

To study the computational process underlying this type of \"representation learning,\" we propose a novel method of causal model comparison. Participants played a probabilistic learning task that required them to identify one relevant feature among several irrelevant ones. To compare between two models of this learning process, we ran each model alongside the participant during task performance, making predictions regarding the values underlying the participant's choices in real time. To test the validity of each model's predictions, we used the predicted values to try to perturb the participant's learning process: We crafted stimuli to either facilitate or hinder comparison between the most highly valued features. A model whose predictions coincide with the learned values in the participant's mind is expected to be effective in perturbing learning in this way, whereas a model whose predictions stray from the true learning process should not. Indeed, we show that in our task a reinforcement-learning model could help or hurt participants' learning, whereas a Bayesian ideal observer model could not.

The performances of the mk-SS were compared with the classification results of the Support Vector Machines (SVM) over five published multiclass microarray datasets. The results showed that the mk-SS method efficiently selects the informative gene biomarkers for proper classification of the biological groups of the tissue samples. This method competes favourably with SVM in terms of prediction accuracy while it outperforms the SVM in 80% of cases considered. The quality of the features selected by mk-SS algorithm was validated by hybridizing the feature selection scheme of the mk-SS into the standard SVM algorithm which significantly improves the predictive power of the standard SVM method.

Their success challenges the view of grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences (GPCs) as rules. By extension, however, this challenge is sometimes interpreted also as evidence against linguistic rules and variables. This inference tacitly assumes that the generalizations inherent in reading (specifically, GPCs) are similar in their scope to linguistic generalizations and that they are each reducible to token associations. I examine this assumption by comparing the scope of generalizations required for mapping graphemes to phonemes and several linguistic phonological generalizations. Marcus (1998b) distinguishes between two types of generalizations: those that fall within a model\u2019s training space and those that exceed it. The scope of generalizations is determined by the model\u2019s representational choices\u2014 specifically, the implementation of operations over mental variables. An analysis of GPCs suggests that such generalizations do not appeal to variables; hence, they may not exceed the training space. Likewise, certain phonological regularities, such as syllable phonotactic constraints and place assimilation, may be captured by an associative process. In contrast, other phonological processes appeal to variables; hence, such generalizations potentially exceed the training space. I discuss one such case, the obligatory contour principle. I demonstrate that speakers conform to this constraint and that their behavior is inexplicable by the statistical structure of the language. This analysis suggests that, unlike GPCs, phonological generalizations may exceed the training space. Thus, despite their success in modeling GPCs, eliminative connectionist models of phonology assembly may be unable to provide a complete account for phonology. To the extent that reading is subject to phonological constraints, its modeling may require implementing operations over variables.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "11848584", "doi": "10.3758/BF03196202", "venue": "Psychonomic bulletin & review", "journal": "Psychonomic bulletin & review", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1971533398", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["12834120", "61116538", "143978875", "39589497", "62728988", "1438951", "8473498", "563996", "7537081", "1575155", "144674580", "144502423", "4646833", "23550370", "60457972", "61138034", "58501384", "143761670", "140510420", "1825817", "2105042", "143637046", "29043627", "1706244", "170511627", "60923093", "62229372", "145262515", "1759467", "14215259", "18181267", "10301716", "254282", "59869815", "146248822", "143506839", "60848762", "27285738", "11961708", "10366367", "140423225", "9484437", "19787651", "142639115", "38287428", "61116538", "67103514", "12217058", "214765757", "557347", "210157400", "17126604", "62644289", "12440437", "9278593", "143290613", "28449084", "144894381", "35206449", "59683979", "18564256", "43412771", "30165868", "12732891", "145565964", "34525334", "15506290", "2904050", "143610354", "145332002", "23924444", "144705169", "57563232", "10034938", "31893766", "29546288", "145275555"], "inbound_citations": ["5663634", "318732"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5612649"}

The objectives include performing supervised classification using SVM and MLC in ENVI Software, analysing the performance of SVM and MLC in mapping geometric features using error matrix and a new template. The methodology used comprise Image acquisition, Image enhancement, Image Sub-setting, Extraction of Regions of Interests (ROIs) and its separability index analysis, supervised classification using SVMC and MLC, Post-Processing Accuracy Assessment, Statistical Analyses, and Preparation of maps. ENVI 5.1 software was used for image processing, masking, spatial data analysis and classification. Microsoft Excel, GraphPad Prism ver.7.0 and IBM SPSS ver.21 were used for statistical analysis. The result of image classification indicates that Nnewi-North L.G.A is having 13.52% of Built-up Areas, 24.23% of Vegetation, 22.05% of Water bodies, Farm lands is equal to 39.40% and open/bare surface is 0.81% using SVMC while MLC result shows that Built-up Areas is14.99%, Vegetation is 13.01%, Water bodies is 34.08%, Farm lands is 36.00% and open/bare surface is 1.32%. Error Matrix and Kappa Coefficient results revealed that SVMC is better than MLC as follows (SVMC overall Accuracy is 98.07% and Kappa Coefficient is 0.97 while MLC overall Accuracy is 82.50% and Kappa Coefficient is 0.76. Additional statistical testing with aggregate mean from SVM and MLC was used to determine the significance of the mean difference using the researcher\u2019s developed template called \u201cPost Confusion Matrix\u201d (PoCoMa). The result showed that the t-statistics is 0.670 with probability value of -0.476 which is greater than 0.05, thus, the null hypothesis was accepted with a deduction that using any of the algorithms (SVM and MLC) yields no significant difference in performance and efficiency of result of the map produced. The overall study revealed that both classifiers are efficient and accurate statistically, without any significant difference but using error matrix analysis, the research revealed that \u2018Support Vector Machine Classifier\u2019 is robust in extracting urban landscape from HRSI, especially Built-up areas and open/bare surfaces.

This paper reports the design and performance evaluation of an effective and efficient method to automatically detect sleep arousals using a single channel EEG. A detection model, based on a Curious Extreme Learning Machine (C-ELM), using a set of 22 features is proposed. The performance was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) and the Accuracy (ACC). The proposed C-ELM based model achieved an average AUC and ACC of 0.85 and 0.79 respectively. The best AUC from among the 50 datasets used was 0.88. In comparison, the average AUC and ACC of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based model were 0.69 and 0.67 respectively, and the best AUC from among the same 50 datasets used was 0.88. This indicates that the proposed CELM based model works well for the sleep arousal detection problem.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/WI-IAT.2015.240", "venue": "2015 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT)", "journal": "2015 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2284318546", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["22458372", "31952795", "145433402", "14727192", "32986856", "31388793", "30197508", "642375", "46279076", "24056395", "116858", "961425"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7824694"}

In this paper, we present a semi-synchronous version of LPA which aims to combine the advantages of both synchronous and asynchronous models. We prove that our models always converge to a stable labeling. Moreover, we experimentally investigate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy comparing its performance with the asynchronous model both in terms of quality, efficiency and stability.

Many papers have been published on Relation Extraction using supervised machine learning techniques. Most of these techniques rely on statistical methods, such as feature-based and tree-kernels-based methods. Such statistical learning techniques are usually based on a propositional hypothesis space for representing examples, i.e., they employ an attribute-value representation of features. This kind of representation has some drawbacks, particularly in the extraction of complex relations which demand more contextual information about the involving instances, i.e., it is not able to effectively capture structural information from parse trees without loss of information. In this work, we present OntoILPER, a logic-based relational learning approach to Relation Extraction that uses Inductive Logic Programming for generating extraction models in the form of symbolic extraction rules. OntoILPER takes profit of a rich relational representation of examples, which can alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks. The proposed relational approach seems to be more suitable for Relation Extraction than statistical ones for several reasons that we argue. Moreover, OntoILPER uses a domain ontology that guides the background knowledge generation process and is used for storing the extracted relation instances. The induced extraction rules were evaluated on three protein-protein interaction datasets from the biomedical domain. The performance of OntoILPER extraction models was compared with other state-of-the-art RE systems.

In this regard, we propose an intelligent churn prediction system for telecom by employing efficient feature extraction technique and ensemble method. We have used Random Forest, Rotation Forest, RotBoost and DECORATE ensembles in combination with minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (mRMR), Fisher's ratio and F-score methods to model the telecom churn prediction problem. We have observed that mRMR method returns most explanatory features compared to Fisher's ratio and F-score, which significantly reduces the computations and help ensembles in attaining improved performance. In comparison to Random Forest, Rotation Forest and DECORATE, RotBoost in combination with mRMR features attains better prediction performance on the standard telecom datasets. The better performance of RotBoost ensemble is largely attributed to the rotation of feature space, which enables the base classifier to learn different aspects of the churners and non-churners. Moreover, the Adaboosting process in RotBoost also contributes in achieving higher prediction accuracy by handling hard instances. The performance evaluation is conducted on standard telecom datasets using AUC, sensitivity and specificity based measures. Simulation results reveal that the proposed approach based on RotBoost in combination with mRMR features (CP-MRB) is effective in handling high dimensionality of the telecom datasets.

Employing Support Vector Machines with advanced sequence kernels, we achieve drastically higher prediction accuracies than state-of-the-art methods. Motivation: One of the most important features of genomic DNA are the protein-coding genes. While it is of great value to identify those genes and the encoded proteins, it is also crucial to understand how their transcription is regulated. To this end one has to identify the corresponding promoters and the contained transcription factor binding sites. TSS finders can be used to locate potential promoters. They may also be used in combination with other signal and content detectors to resolve entire gene structures. Results: We have developed a novel kernel based method \u2013 called ARTS \u2013 that accurately recognizes transcription start sites in human. The application of otherwise too computationally expensive Support Vector Machines was made possible due to the use of efficient training and evaluation techniques using suffix tries. In a carefully designed experimental study, we compare our TSS finder to state-of-the-art methods from the literature: McPromoter, Eponine and FirstEF. For given false positive rates within a reasonable range, we consistently achieve considerably higher true positive rates. For instance, ARTS finds about 35% true positives at a false positive rate of 1/1000, where the other methods find about a half (18%).

On the other hand, it has been shown that RELIEF could be seen as a distance learning algorithm in which a linear utility function with maximum margin was optimized. We first propose here a version of this algorithm for similarity learning, called RBS (for RELIEF-Based Similarity learning). As RELIEF, and unlike SiLA, RBS does not try to optimize the leave-one-out error or 0-1 loss, and does not perform very well in practice, as we illustrate on two UCI collections. We thus introduce a stricter version of RBS, called sRBS, aiming at relying on a cost function closer to the 0-1 loss.

The goal of a ranked retrieval system is to manage a large collection of text documents and to order documents for a user based on the estimated relevance of the documents to the user's information need (or query). The ordering enables the user to quickly find documents of interest. Ranked retrieval is a difficult problem because of the ambiguity of natural language, the large size of the collections, and because of the varying needs of users and varying collection characteristics. ::: We propose and empirically validate general adaptive methods which improve the ability of a large class of retrieval systems to rank documents effectively. Our main adaptive method is to numerically optimize free parameters in a retrieval system by minimizing a non-metric criterion function. The criterion measures how well the system is ranking documents relative to a target ordering, defined by a set of training queries which include the users' desired document orderings. Thus, the system learns parameter settings which better enable it to rank relevant documents before irrelevant. The non-metric approach is interesting because it is a general adaptive method, an alternative to supervised methods for training neural networks in domains in which rank order or prioritization is important. A second adaptive method is also examined, which is applicable to a restricted class of retrieval systems but which permits an analytic solution. ::: The adaptive methods are applied to a number of problems in text retrieval to validate their utility and practical efficiency. The applications include: A dimensionality reduction of vector-based document representations to a vector space in which inter-document similarity more accurately predicts semantic association; the estimation of a similarity measure which better predicts the relevance of documents to queries; and the estimation of a high-performance neural network combination of multiple retrieval systems into a single overall system.

Recently, non singular covariance matrices of pattern features which are elements of the space of Symmetric Definite Positive (SPD) matrices, have been proven to be very efficient descriptors in the field of pattern recognition. However, in the case of action recognition, singular covariance matrices cannot be avoided because the dimension of features could be higher than the number of samples. Such covariance matrices (non singular and singular) belong to the space of Symmetric Positive semi-Definite (SPsD) matrices. Thus, in order to classify actions, we propose to adapt kernel methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to the space of SPsD matrices by using a perturbed Log-Euclidean distance (Arsigny et al., 2006). The mathematical validity of this perturbed distance (called Modified Log-Euclidean distance) for SPsD is therefore studied. The offline experiments are conducted on three challenging benchmarks, namely MSRAction3D, UTKinect and Multiview3D datasets. A fair comparison demonstrates that our approach competes with state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational latency.

A common solution to this problem is to apply dimensionality reduction technologies to original data before the KISS metric learning, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). In this paper, to learn a discriminant and robust metric, we propose a novel two-stage metric learning via QR-Decomposition and KISS, named QRKISS. The first stage of QRKISS is to project original data into a lower dimensional space by QR decomposition. In this lower dimensional space, the trace of the covariance matrix of interpersonal differences can reach maximum. Based on KISS method, the second stage of QRKISS obtains a Mahalanobis matrix in the low-dimension space.

The subjective test scores for modified images are obtained with-out referring to their original images (called `No Reference').

So as to obtain the optimal labeling scores, the label propagation algorithm requires an inverse matrix which incurs the high computational cost of O(n3+cn2), where n and c are the numbers of data points and labels, respectively. This paper proposes an efficient label propagation algorithm that guarantees exactly the same labeling results as those yielded by optimal labeling scores.

The performance of the CBIR system can be further enhanced by proper selection of a classifier and fine tuning of model parameters to obtain improved classification accuracy. We extracted canonical set of feature vectors from biological images using a popular tool called Weighted Neighbor Distance using Compound Hierarchy of algorithms Representing Morphology (Wndchrm). We adopted a two step approach for the selection of features. The first step is to partition the canonical set of feature vectors into four distinct feature vector sets based on the methodology and algorithms for extraction of features. The second step is to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Fisher Score based selection of features from the partitioned set of feature vectors. The optimum set of feature vectors thus obtained is applied as training patterns to different classifier implementations such as Bayesian and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifiers. We used IICBU-2008 benchmark dataset [5, 7] of biological images for our experiments. We also compared the results with the results available for the wndchrm classifier.

Recently, the minimum toe clearance (MTC) has been employed in gait analysis as a sensitive gait variable for early detection of elderly people at risk of falling. In previous work, we successfully applied statistical and wavelet analysis methods with Support Vector Machines (SVM) to model the risk of tripping in the elderly. In this work, we propose to model the MTC time series as a wide based stationary random signal using the autoregressive (AR) process. Initially, it was found that a fourth order AR model constructed from 512 MTC samples per subject on 23 subjects completely modelled the balance impaired gait (pathological) from normal gait. However, when the number of MTC samples were reduced to 32, the two groups became inseparable. We then proposed a hybrid system consisting of a SVM classifier with AR model coefficients as input features to separate the two classes. It was found that SVMs with linear and Gaussian kernels produced 100% leave one out accuracies without the need for prior feature selection algorithms. In contrast, SVM models built previously from the best set of wavelet features produced only 86.95% leave one out accuracies. These results suggest that pathological gait is best modelled by the AR process if sufficient MTC data is available. In the case of shorter MTC data, the AR model still provides powerful and robust discriminative features which can be used by the SVM to detect elderly people at risk of falling.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4370976", "venue": "2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks", "journal": "2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2018583027", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["39899424", "110755134", "26869594", "145320799", "17094196", "23231007", "1066360", "14837964", "9069689", "18181838", "17156155", "2154620", "21631205", "116038231", "58747689", "127874659", "23513609", "7881900"], "inbound_citations": ["14656438", "14177709", "15414808", "42216143", "16478675", "7959134", "3630792"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18828316"}

With their increasing coverage and availability, airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, high resolution orthoimagery (HRO), and Google Street View (GSV) images are showing great potential for accurate land use classification. However, no study mapped land use in megacity using GSV-derived features or the three kinds of data together for land use classification. The main objectives of this study are (1) to test the performance of a parcel-based land use classification method using a Random Forest classifier with LiDAR data, HRO, and GSV images in a megacity, and (2) to explore the use of GSV in separating parcels of mixed residential & commercial buildings from other land use parcels. Two neighboring community districts in Brooklyn, New York, were selected as the study area. Thirteen automatically-derived parcel features, including nine common parcel features and four GSV-derived parcel features, were used in land use classification. The average overall classification accuracy was 77.5%, with producer's accuracies exceeding 92% for single-family housing. Comparing the results of classifications with and without GSV-derived parcel features shows that GSV-derived parcel features on average contribute to the classification accuracy of mixed residential & commercial buildings by 10 percentage points, improving it from 41.3% to 51.4%.

The drawbacks of the existing methods for diagnosing bottlenecks is that they either do not consider the severity of the bottleneck or they do not consider the existence of multiple bottlenecks. In the existing models for solving bottlenecks, the cost is not considered as an objective function and only shifting of bottlenecks is utilized to solve the bottleneck machine problem. This approach is not feasible if the maximum capacity of the workshop has been reached. In this paper, a Random Forest classification model is utilized to diagnose bottleneck machine with different severity where the severity of the machines on the shop floor can either be none, low, medium, or high. Due to the lack of historical data, the Random Forest algorithm is trained using bottleneck data generated by simulating several identical parallel machine Job-shop scheduling problems. The trained Random Forest algorithm is then used in conjunction with Genetic Algorithm for finding the optimal actions to be taken for the most severe bottlenecks machines in order to reduce the makespan and the additional cost by optimizing the number of additional parallel machines to be utilized and overtime hours for the most severe bottleneck machines. The two objectives, makespan and additional cost, are combined into a single objective value by the use of weight values. These weight values depend on severity of the most severe bottleneck machine. If the bottleneck severity is \u201chigh\u201d then makespan has a higher weight value than cost, if the severity is \u201cmedium\u201d then both cost and makespan are weighed equally, and if the severity is \u201clow\u201d then cost has a higher weight value than makespan. In order to show the validity of the proposed approach it is used for diagnosing and solving the bottleneck problems in three different identical parallel machine Job-shop scheduling case studies 1. 3 jobs with 6 machines 2. 5 jobs with 9 machines and 3. 5 jobs with 12 machines. By utilizing the proposed approach the makespan and cost were reduced by 19.0%, 24.5% and 25.4% in case studies 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The results show that the trained Random Forest algorithm was able to correctly diagnose the bottleneck machines and their severity and Genetic algorithm was able to find the optimal number of additional hours and additional machines for the most severe bottleneck machines on the shop floor.\u00a9 2016 ASME", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/MSEC2016-8586", "venue": "Volume 3: Joint MSEC-NAMRC Symposia", "journal": "Volume 3: Joint MSEC-NAMRC Symposia", "mag_id": "2526556186", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63122361"}

In the core of the proposed approach lies a more efficient feature extraction technique, based on the dynamic characteristics of data corresponding to those vehicles that are involved in incidents. This work observes how dynamic aspects of measured data can be exploited for extracting features that result in measurable improvement of the incident detection rate by the application of a Support Vector Machines classification approach. The latter is known to be one of the most precise solutions that have been widely applied up to now for dealing with relevant incident detection problems. In this paper the authors conduct appropriate experimental evaluation, including comparison to a set of well known techniques, for assessing the impact of the proposed feature selection technique on the accuracy of the detection rate.

Many algorithms and data processing methods have been applied to predict thermal comfort indices in different contexts. But few studies have systematically investigated how different algorithms and data processing methods can influence the prediction accuracy. In this study, we first summarized the recent literature from perspectives of predicted comfort indices, algorithms applied, input features, data sources, sample size, training proportion, predicting accuracy, etc. Then, we applied nine ML algorithms and three data sampling methods to predict the 3-point and 7-point thermal sensation vote (TSV) in ASHRAE Comfort Database II. The results show that with an accuracy of 66.3% and 61.1% for 3-point and 7-point TSV respectively, Random Forest (RF) has the best performance among the tested algorithms. Compared to the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model, ML TSV models generally have higher accuracy in TSV prediction. Based on feature importance analysis, the air temperature, humidity, clothing, air velocity, age, and metabolic rate are the top six important features for TSV prediction. The RF algorithm can achieve 63.6% overall accuracy in TSV prediction with the top three features, which is only 2.6% lower than involving 12 input features. Further, this paper addressed other common considerations in ML comfort model establishment such as tuning hyperparameters, splitting of training and testing data, and encoding methods.

For large programs, scalable pointer analysis is usually imprecise in analyzing their hard \"corner cases\", such as infeasible paths, recursion cycles, loops, arrays, and linked lists. Due to a sound over-approximation of the points-to information, a large number of spurious aliases will be reported conservatively, causing the corresponding typestate analysis to report a large number of false alarms. Thus, the usefulness of typestate analysis for heap-intensive clients, like UAF detection, becomes rather limited, in practice. We introduce Tac, a static UAF detector that bridges the gap between typestate and pointer analyses by machine learning. Tac learns the correlations between program features and UAF-related aliases by using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and applies this knowledge to further disambiguate the UAF-related aliases reported imprecisely by the pointer analysis so that only the ones validated by its SVM classifier are further investigated by the typestate analysis. Despite its unsoundness, Tac represents a practical typestate analysis approach for UAF detection. We have implemented Tac in LLVM-3.8.0 and evaluated it using a set of eight open-source C/C++ programs.

In this paper, a new classification methodology based on the spatial-spectral Label Propagation is proposed for semi-supervised classification of hyperspectral imagery. The spatial information was used in two aspects: on the one hand, the spatial features extracted by a 2-D Gabor filter were stacked with spectral features; on the other hand, the width of the Gaussian function, which was used to construct graph, was determined with an adaptive method. Subsequently, the unlabeled samples from the spatial neighbors of the labeled samples were selected and the spatial graph was constructed based on spatial smoothness.

In this study, an ensemble of four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) General Circulation Model (GCM) namely GISS-E2-H, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5, and NorESM1-M simulations was downscaled for the assessment of the spatiotemporal changes in precipitation in the data-scarce arid province (Balochistan) of Pakistan for four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The gauge-based gridded precipitation data of the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) having a spatial resolution of 0.5\u00b0 was used for this purpose. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used for the development of non-local model output statistics (MOS) downscaling models for each grid by linking the GPCC precipitation with the GCM simulated precipitation across a spatial domain (latitudes 03\u00b0\u201345\u00b0 N and longitudes 42\u00b0\u201392\u00b0 E). Then, Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to develop the multi-model ensemble (MME) of downscaled precipitation projections. The performances of the models were assessed in terms of normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), percentage of bias (PBIAS), and modified index of agreement (md). The results indicated that the non-local SVM-based MOS models coupled with RF MME can simulate historical precipitation over the region quite well. The MME of GCMs projected changes in the annual, monsoon, and winter precipitation in the range of \u2212 30% to 30% for different RCPs. Overall, the MME of GCMs indicated an increase in precipitation in the monsoon-dominated wetter regions in the east, while a decrease in winter precipitation dominated arid region in the west. A decrease in annual precipitation over the majority of the southeast, east, and northeastern arid regions was projected which may increase the aridity in the region.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00704-018-2672-5", "venue": "Theoretical and Applied Climatology", "journal": "Theoretical and Applied Climatology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2897201396", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["132824083", "126104479", "128689634", "128025433", "118578614", "104139263", "133828888", "55849325", "125165509", "129101456", "9176336", "55074320", "167388927", "128604717", "128418311", "54893824", "124949641", "89141", "131918754", "129784530", "129026537", "134009184", "135113064", "51997758", "155426530", "128892770", "162738033", "128629641", "53643687", "12829214", "125349801", "130385414", "125867062", "125508147", "118731151", "135108993", "129777682", "113405208", "126334547", "54838198", "2280714", "52260915", "14844671", "134072518", "158900806", "53482481", "130513107", "128673348", "12470154", "125305000", "120608833", "42422323", "125891316", "126083920", "128476439", "129204771", "134810038", "125443981", "158081194", "126198156", "120994440", "129898493", "38812654", "129228989", "158440443", "56328472", "128499314", "53866276", "129600584", "55534683", "130661487", "18058016", "128827959", "55096988", "128635855", "123416873", "135268912", "129792586", "133782045", "128670785", "129565755", "153748187"], "inbound_citations": ["164599799", "209473115", "146076738", "210139225", "208743805", "202762469", "133825363", "209319745", "203531287", "209923188", "201621828"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125785287"}

In this paper, a fusion model using flexible segmentation graph (FSG) is presented to explore multi-scale context for scene labeling problem. Given a family of segmentations, the representation of FSG is established based on the spatial relationship of these segmentations. In the scenario of FSG, the labeling inference process is formulated as a contextual fusion model, trained from the discriminative classifiers. Compared to previous approaches, which usually employ Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) or hierarchical models to explore contextual information, our FSG representation is flexible and efficient without hierarchical constraint, allowing us to capture a wide variety of visual context for the task of scene labeling. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on the MSRC dataset (21 classes) and the LHI dataset (15 classes), and near-record results on the SIFT Flow dataset (33 classes) and PASCAL VOC segmentation dataset (20 classes), while producing a 320?240 scene labeling in less than a second.

Methods: Linear and multi-resolution BSpline deformable registration were performed on Pre-Post-CRT CT/PET images of 20 patients with esophageal cancer. For both registration methods, we registered CT using Mean Square Error (MSE) metric, however to register PET we used transformation obtained using Mutual Information (MI) from the same CT due to being multi-modality. Similarity of Warped-CT/PET was quantitatively evaluated using Normalized Mutual Information and plausibility of DF was assessed using inverse consistency Error. To evaluate tumor response four groups of tumor features were examined: (1) Conventional PET/CT e.g. SUV, diameter (2) Clinical parameters e.g. TNM stage, histology (3)spatial-temporal PET features that describe intensity, texture and geometry of tumor (4)all features combined. Dominant features were identified using 10-fold cross-validation and Support Vector Machine (SVM) was deployed for tumor response prediction while the accuracy was evaluated by ROC Area Under Curve (AUC). Results: Average and standard deviation of Normalized mutual information for deformable registration using MSE was 0.2\u00b10.054 and for linear registration was 0.1\u00b10.026, showing higher NMI for deformable registration. Likewise for MI metric, deformable registration had 0.13\u00b10.035 comparing to linear counterpart with 0.12\u00b10.037. Inverse consistency error for deformable registration for MSE metric was 4.65\u00b12.49 and for linear was 1.32\u00b12.3 showing smaller value for linear registration. The same conclusion was obtained for MI in terms of inverse consistency error. AUC for both linear and deformable registration was 1 showing no absolute difference in terms of response evaluation. Conclusion: Deformable registration showed better NMI comparing to linear registration, however inverse consistency of transformation was lower in linear registration. We do not expect to see significant difference when warping PET images using deformable or linear registration.

Meanwhile, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which is proposed for labeling unsegmented sequences, makes it feasible to train an end-to-end speech recognition system instead of hybrid settings. However, RNNs are computationally expensive and sometimes difficult to train. In this paper, inspired by the advantages of both CNNs and the CTC approach, we propose an end-to-end speech framework for sequence labeling, by combining hierarchical CNNs with CTC directly without recurrent connections.

Citation screening is a time-consuming and critical step in systematic reviews. Typically, reviewers must evaluate thousands of citations to identify articles eligible for a given review. We explore the application of machine learning techniques to semi-automate citation screening, thereby reducing the reviewers' workload.ResultsWe present a novel online classification strategy for citation screening to automatically discriminate \"relevant\" from \"irrelevant\" citations. We use an ensemble of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) built over different feature-spaces (e.g., abstract and title text), and trained interactively by the reviewer(s).Semi-automating the citation screening process is difficult because any such strategy must identify all citations eligible for the systematic review. This requirement is made harder still due to class imbalance; there are far fewer \"relevant\" than \"irrelevant\" citations for any given systematic review. To address these challenges we employ a custom active-learning strategy developed specifically for imbalanced datasets. Further, we introduce a novel undersampling technique. We provide experimental results over three real-world systematic review datasets, and demonstrate that our algorithm is able to reduce the number of citations that must be screened manually by nearly half in two of these, and by around 40% in the third, without excluding any of the citations eligible for the systematic review.ConclusionsWe have developed a semi-automated citation screening algorithm for systematic reviews that has the potential to substantially reduce the number of citations reviewers have to manually screen, without compromising the quality and comprehensiveness of the review.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2824679", "pubmed_id": "20102628", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-11-55", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2043566294", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["27327619", "33532748", "32487476", "41930454", "9077510", "5118721", "18731796", "10689875", "9447174", "14265943", "1875861", "13431314", "915058", "62249525", "324600", "7138354", "2427083", "61730441", "14022622", "1479461", "14354369", "14406743", "28920310", "12299987", "207738357", "1676052", "961425", "12567481"], "inbound_citations": ["207879893", "211526271", "3527556", "13190589", "207536827", "16653864", "12521058", "29195919", "16064472", "4757762", "59945143", "202572687", "140064224", "16888019", "1459536", "23924343", "5597748", "12567481", "3378378", "1671806", "11539616", "10594844", "16337514", "215223318", "3610493", "2392355", "3530017", "215618158", "3703436", "58631620", "195065846", "17389026", "68150016", "215436637", "10350022", "11848702", "208020724", "18209049", "58943088", "747795", "54899192", "52054686", "206156070", "195347008", "1135103", "53502499", "51864220", "158046812", "18420001", "2521633", "214822769", "204897973", "96424905", "204895278", "207794518", "7698952", "24759704", "3573836", "2026426", "1021174", "3914125", "52157308", "6716746", "214590576", "67930726", "4474084", "146300204", "164044", "5626827", "208648802", "5257244", "73467121", "214768766", "17827808", "1584352", "18314564", "9036374", "44773968", "155100007", "36574083", "56493856", "7447912", "202757980", "3933785", "208639707", "16462791", "17245867", "44173102", "58605484", "121630725", "18851552", "3521764", "3756248", "33350230", "109792", "214593042", "139104086", "215094454", "155100096", "11093837", "49610165", "197928359", "202577483", "54650612", "16242497", "6257939", "3797442", "12128369", "20041101", "3767467", "4933316"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12567481"}

The extracted features of the image under test are associated with the features extracted from the database images to detect and predict the cancer tumor in the image.

Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of considering the public opinion of a company by employing sentiment analysis. Using a trained Word2Vec model, company specific hash-tagged posts from Twitter are classified as positive or negative. Our proposed ensemble model is then trained on a new dataset which combines the technical indicator data along with the aggregated number of positive/negative tweets of a company over time.

Most applications of machine learning (ML) algorithms to control chart pattern recognition (CCPR) have focused on pattern detection and identification, rather than obtaining more detailed information about the pattern, which is important for effective assignable cause analysis. If real control chart data is not available for training purposes, synthetic patterns must be generated. Furthermore, pattern recognition accuracies achieved by different CCPR systems are usually not comparable since these were developed with different training data. How to create a diverse range of patterns for designing CCPR systems that can be compared and that are able to recognise a greater variety of patterns is an issue that needs studying.This paper presents a scheme to generate training patterns that addresses this issue of diversity and comparability.

This hypothesis has received support in global studies and studies from regions highly affected by glaciations. Here, we test its applicability to Chinese endemic species, thereby testing it in a region that was relatively mildly affected by glaciations. ::: ::: ::: ::: Location ::: ::: China. ::: ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: ::: We tested for associations between endemic species richness and Quaternary climate change, current climate and topography. Changes in mean annual temperature (MAT) and annual precipitation (MAP) between the Last Glacial Maximum and present were used to describe Quaternary climate change. We used simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models to account for spatial autocorrelation in predictors, and Random Forest modelling to deal with non-linear relationships and better handle multicollinearity among predictor variables. To get a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved we also performed analyses based on growth-form (woody versus herbaceous plants) and species age (palaeo- and neoendemics). ::: ::: ::: ::: Results ::: ::: Single-predictor SAR models showed that glacial-interglacial MAT velocity always has higher explanatory power than current climate (with a pseudo r2 difference of 0.581\u20130.604 between the best palaeoclimate and current climate predictors for models for all endemic plants). Model selection on multivariate SAR models (based on Akaike weights) and Random Forest modelling (based on correlations between predicted and observed species richness) always included at least one variable representing Quaternary climate change as well as one or more current climate variables. Quaternary climate-change variables were generally of similar strength to the current climate predictors. Notably, the summed Akaike weight across all models in the relevant model set was always 1 for glacial-interglacial MAT velocity. There were no clear differences with respect to growth forms or species age in the estimated importance of Quaternary climate change. ::: ::: ::: ::: Main conclusions ::: ::: The consistent association between long-term climatic stability and high plant endemism in China provides strong evidence for the importance of Quaternary glacial-interglacial climate changes in shaping the distribution of endemic species, even in regions relatively mildly affected by glaciations. Hence, even moderate climate changes may have strong, long-term effects on species diversity patterns.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/jbi.12613", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Biogeography", "mag_id": "1907031007", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["59372840", "4649282", "25662547", "14953645", "211829187", "198416876", "20010088", "31242059", "3944240", "3961669", "25199346", "165147303", "215425075", "91056464", "215244166", "90843254", "90424718"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:84044344"}

Predictive modeling is an important component of an information system that makes the system intelligent. This special issue focuses on adaptive information systems that can adjust their behavior relying on additional mechanisms continuously monitoring the operational setting and/or the performance of predictive models. Adaptive information systems have become ubiquitous in various application areas including online businesses, personal information access, industry, medicine, education, defence, and in which predictive analytics is an important decision making or decision support component. In the real world data is often non stationary. In predictive analytics, machine learning and data mining the phenomenon of unexpected change in underlying data over time is known as concept drift. Changes in underlying data may occur due to changing personal interests, changes in population, adversary activities or they can be attributed to the complex nature of the environment. When data drifts, predictions may become less accurate as the time passes or opportunities to improve the accuracy may be missed. Thus, the learning models need to be able to adapt automatically to changes over time. The problem of concept drift is of increasing importance in machine learning and data mining since more and more data is organized in the form of data streams rather than static databases, and it is rather unusual that concepts and data distributions stay stable over long periods of time. It is not surprising that the problem of concept drift has been studied in several research communities including but not limited to machine learning and data mining, data streams, information retrieval, and recommender systems. Different approaches for detecting and handling concept drift have been proposed in the literature, and many of them have already proved their potential in a wide range of application domains, e.g. fraud detection, adaptive system control, user modeling, information retrieval, text mining, biomedicine. Moreover, a fast growing scope of applications that rely on data arriving in real time where very often the problem of data drift is observed and recognized to be important, helped to identify and shape a number of new important research challenges that have not been wellstudied in the research communities yet. This special issue includes selected contributions from the first and the second International Workshops on Handling Concept Drift in Adaptive Information Systems; HaCDAIS at ECMLPKDD 2010 and HaCDAIS at IEEE ICDM 2011. The papers address both methodological issues and practical challenges for handling concept drift, such as (a) label availability, (b) recurring concepts, (c) systematic handling of event detection, and (d) mining changes in customer profiling and medical anesthesia domains.

Specifically, we apply the isometric feature mapping (Isomap) to experimental video data of the wake past a circular cylinder from steady to turbulent flows. Without direct velocity measurements, we show that manifold topology is intrinsically related to flow regime and that Isomap global coordinates can unravel salient flow features.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3948738", "pubmed_id": "24614890", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0091131", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2164780252", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["4796810", "4399094", "6061423", "6961656", "123397139", "123274154", "13876931", "2745919", "120441470", "14628998", "120444900", "44462257", "31851007", "2833150", "22101357", "123441338", "120238251", "15256769", "123118533", "122798588", "124667240", "14255028", "122740332", "51991744", "118791400", "1536455", "16838242", "62531491", "16048085", "17362154", "24410444", "10728126", "124421219", "119621720", "121937182", "122698337", "120472931", "31795671", "17644744", "8177025", "8908088", "1596894", "17390605", "49549395", "9622684", "2003382", "9368603"], "inbound_citations": ["23341969", "215214444", "7858972", "9113421"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18471321"}

These methods require the use of data generated from physical trials. Transfer Learning (TL) allows for this data to come from a different, similar system. The goal of this work is to understand in which cases a simple, alignment-based transfer of data is beneficial. A scalar, linear, time invariant(LTI) transformation is applied to the output from a source system to align with the output from a target system. In a theoretic study, we have already shown that for linear, single-input, single-output systems, the upper bound of the transformation error depends on the dynamic properties of the source and target system, and is small for systems with similar response times. We now consider two nonlinear, unicycle robots. Based on our previous work, we derive analytic error bounds for the linearized robot models. We then provide simulations of the nonlinear robot models and experiments with a Pioneer 3-AT robot that confirm the theoretical findings.

This is particularly challenging for carbonate rocks. Machine learning (ML) and robust multivariate methods have been developed that have been used in many fields of study to make accurate estimators for variables of interest from both large and small datasets. ML has been criticized for utilizing approaches that are typically not interpretable. That is, it is not clear how the answers are arrived at and what aspects of input data may be resulting in inaccurate results. The current study uses a number of the mathematical algorithms that operate inside ML modules. It applies them to developing porosity-permeability transforms, with or without rock types, to two well-characterized data sets for carbonate reservoirs. One data set is from Jerry Lucia's 1995 study of carbonate rock types, and the other is from a study of the Seminole, West Texas, San Andres Unit. This study of statistical analysis of porosity-permeability transforms includes: transforming the data to normal distributions; performing cross-validation blind testing; and detecting heteroscedasticity by creating plots of residuals. Heteroscedastic data (populations with variable variance) may have an adverse impact on ML algorithms such as Random Forests (RF). We find that including lithofacies information does not greatly improve porosity-permeability transforms.

Social influence mining in social networks is therefore of critical importance in real-world applications such as friend suggestion and photo recommendation. Social media is inherently multimodal, including rich types of user contributed content and social link information. Most of the existing research suffers from two limitations: 1) only utilizing the textual information, and/or 2) only analyzing the generic influence but ignoring the more important topic-level influence. To address these limitations, in this paper we develop a novel Topic-Sensitive Influencer Mining (TSIM) framework in interest-based social media networks. Specifically, we take Flickr as the study platform. People in Flickr interact with each other through images. TSIM aims to find topical influential users and images. The influence estimation is determined with a hypergraph learning approach. In the hypergraph, the vertices represent users and images, and the hyperedges are utilized to capture multi-type relations including visual-textual content relations among images, and social links between users and images. Algorithmwise, TSIM first learns the topic distribution by leveraging user-contributed images, and then infers the influence strength under different topics for each node in the hypergraph. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of more than 50 K images and 70 K comment/favorite links from Flickr have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

It is achieved through essential steps of data acquisition, data pre-processing and prognostics modeling.

Practically, degrading machinery can have different levels (states) of degradation before failure, and prognostics can be quite complicated or even impossible when there is absence of prior knowledge about actual states of degrading machinery or FT. In this paper a novel approach is proposed to improve failure prognostics. In brief, the proposed prognostics model integrates two new algorithms, namely, a Summation Wavelet Extreme Learning Machine (SWELM) and Subtractive-Maximum Entropy Fuzzy Clustering (S-MEFC) to predict degrading behavior, automatically identify the states of degrading machinery, and to dynamically assign FT.

Decision making in connectionist modcls such as these is distributed and consists in selections made from sets of mutually inhibiting candidate items which are activated on the basis of input features. In these models, however, there is the problem, especially for generation, of obtaining sequential behavior from an essentially parallel process. The thrust of this paper is that sequencing can also be modelled as a process of competition between candidates activated on the basis of input features. In the case of sequencing, the competition concerns which of a set of pharse constituents will appear in a particular output position. This account allows output ordering to arise out of the interaction of syntactic with semantic and pragmatic factors, as seems to be the case for human language generation. The paper describes a localized connectionist model of language generation, focusing on the representation and use of sequencing information.

To extract the GC signals of a promoter region in a genome sequence, we adopt a scheme combining wavelet analysis and a support vector machine (SVM). In this scheme, we take a simplified way to quantize and extract chemo-physical properties of a DNA sequence. Four types of DNA are converted to binary form with respect to G and C or not. The sequences are expanded to two dimensional spaces, frequency and location, by discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). The fixed length of the promoter and randomly selected DNA segments are prepared as the positive and negative training data, respectively. The two types of data are converted by DWT and learned by a SVM.

The main goal of this paper is to conduct performance comparison among various machine learning methods. We choose seven machine learning techniques for this comparison such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

The algorithm the sentiment analysis system CUCsas adopts to perform this task includes three steps: (1) whether there is an \u201cexp\u201d (short for \u201cexpression having evaluation meaning\u201d) in the weibo message; (2) whether there is a semantic orientation relationship between the exp and topic; (3) the sentiment polarity classification of the exp. CUCsas completes step (1) based on the sentiment lexicon and sentiment value assignment rules, completes step (2) based on the topic extraction and sentiment polarity classification rule base, and completes step (3) based on the sentiment computing rules. Taking 20 given topics and a total of 19,469 weibo messages released by SIGHAN-2015 Bake-off as the test data, the overall F value of the rule-based system CUCsas is 0.69 in the unrestricted test. 1 Algorithm Description The locutionary subjectivity denotes the locutionary agent\u2019s self-expression of cognition, feeling or perception in the use of language (John Lyons, 1995). And the evaluation is one type of locutionary subjectivity. An evaluation discourse consists of four basic elements: E(s) = {sub, obj, exp, com}. Herein, \u201cE(s)\u201d represents an evaluation discourse, and \u201csub\u201d, \u201cobj\u201d, \u201cexp\u201d and \u201ccom\u201d refers to the subject of evaluation, the object of evaluation, an expression having evaluation meaning, and other discourse components respectively (Zhou Hongzhao et al., 2014). The study of this paper is under the condition of knowing obj (= the given topic) in the weibo message, enabling the system automatically recognize whether there is an exp in the same weibo message. If there is not, the system will output result [topic: 0]; if there is, the system will make a further identification that whether there is a semantic orientation relationship between the exp and the given topic. If there is not, the system will outputs result [topic 0]; if there is, the system will further classify the sentiment polarity of the exp. If it is positive, the system will output result [topic 1]; if it is negative, the system will output result [topic -1]; if it is neutral, the system will output result [topic 0]. Apparently, the algorithm is different from some widely used machine learning sentiment polarity classification algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Max Entropy, Boosted Trees and Random Forest (Amit Gupte et al., 2014).

The main idea of the PIL strategy is that the learning algorithm should not only adapt to the newly presented input-output training pattern by adjusting parameters, but also preserve the prior results. A general PIL algorithm for feedforward neural networks is accordingly presented as the first-order approximate solution to an optimization problem, where the performance index is the combination of proper measures of preservation and adaptation. The PIL algorithms for the multilayer perceptron (MLP) are subsequently derived.

Another advantage of this approach is that it is applicable to routine operating data that may lack any external excitation signals. Theoretical analysis of the proposed closed-loop identification is provided in this paper, showing that it can give a consistent parameter estimate for the process model even in the case where a priori knowledge about the true noise model structure is not available. A set of normal operation data with satisfactory performance is collected as the training data. We build SVM models based on process and noise model estimates from training data to predict the occurrence of MPM in the test data.

Network data, which are a priori data with a rich relational structure, provide an important context for applying MTL. In particular, the explicit relational structure implies that network data is not i.i.d. data. Network data also often comes with significant metadata (i.e., attributes) associated with each entity (node). Moreover, due to the diversity and variation in network data (e.g., multi-relational links or multi-category entities), various tasks can be performed and often a rich correlation exists between them. Learning algorithms should exploit all of these additional sources of information for better performance. In this work we take a metric-learning point of view for the MTL problem in the network context. Our approach builds on structure preserving metric learning (SPML). In particular SPML learns a Mahalanobis distance metric for node attributes using network structure as supervision, so that the learned distance function encodes the structure and can be used to predict link patterns from attributes. SPML is described for single-task learning on single network. Herein, we propose a multi-task version of SPML, abbreviated as MT-SPML, which is able to learn across multiple related tasks on multiple networks via shared intermediate parametrization. MT-SPML learns a specific metric for each task and a common metric for all tasks. The task correlation is carried through the common metric and the individual metrics encode task specific information. When combined together, they are structure-preserving with respect to individual tasks. MT-SPML works on general networks, thus is suitable for a wide variety of problems.

In the local perspective, the emphasis of all existing supervised metric learning algorithms is to shrink similar data points and to separate dissimilar ones in the local neighborhoods. This provides learning more appropriate distance metric in dealing with the within-class multi modal data. In this article, a new supervised local metric learning method named Self-Adaptive Local Metric Learning Method (SA-LM2) has been proposed. The contribution of this method is in five aspects. First, in this method, learning an appropriate metric and defining the radius of local neighborhood are integrated in a joint formulation. Second, unlike the traditional approaches, SA-LM2 learns the parameter of local neighborhood automatically thorough its formulation. As a result, it is a parameter free method, where it does not require any parameters that would need to be tuned. Third, SA-LM2 is formulated as a SemiDefinite Program (SDP) with a global convergence guarantee. Fourth, this method does not need the similar set S, the focus here is on local areas\u2019 data points and their separation from dissimilar ones. Finally, results of SA-LM2 are less influenced by noisy input data points than the other compared global and local algorithms. Results obtained from different experiments indicate the outperformance of this algorithm over its counterparts.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2019.106994", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.", "journal": "Pattern Recognit.", "mag_id": "2966838943", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201250869"}

The first algorithm splits the data samples based on a variation of the 12 Normalized Cuts (NCuts) clustering algorithm wherein the weights of adja13 cency matrix are modified to utilize class membership in the process. The 14 second algorithm also uses the NCuts clustering; however, it considers the in15 volved classes rather than the individual data samples. It uses the minimum 16 distances between the convex hulls of classes as a distance measure for deter17 mining the weights of the graph. Splits are determined for both algorithms 18 based on the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue of 19 a Laplacian matrix, and it is observed that the proposed algorithms generate 20 well-separated and well-balanced clusters.

As a first and key step in protein structure prediction, protein structural class prediction becomes an increasingly challenging task. Amongst most homological-based approaches, the accuracies of protein structural class prediction are sufficiently high for high similarity datasets, but still far from being satisfactory for low similarity datasets, i.e., below 40% in pairwise sequence similarity. Therefore, we present a novel method for accurate and reliable protein structural class prediction for both high and low similarity datasets. This method is based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) in conjunction with integrated features from position-specific score matrix (PSSM), PROFEAT and Gene Ontology (GO). A feature selection approach, SVM-RFE, is also used to rank the integrated feature vectors through recursively removing the feature with the lowest ranking score. The definitive top features selected by SVM-RFE are input into the SVM engines to predict the structural class of a query protein. To validate our method, jackknife tests were applied to seven widely used benchmark datasets, reaching overall accuracies between 84.61% and 99.79%, which are significantly higher than those achieved by state-of-the-art tools. These results suggest that our method could serve as an accurate and cost-effective alternative to existing methods in protein structural classification, especially for low similarity datasets.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3968047", "pubmed_id": "24675610", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0092863", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2155364865", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["205276763", "7211907", "40560667", "14474372", "3971444", "17157105", "11910221", "5122029", "23514943", "30625168", "17465367", "1816276", "43805576", "47386484", "44860352", "48335", "205318226", "226104", "33487033", "2090857", "1491989", "7335282", "18481993", "22946567", "25085218", "14358257", "45494671", "2074142", "25938920", "12091403", "9237190", "6291900", "5564894", "17815381", "28022401", "15501861", "15160262", "25165647", "44439300", "43826027"], "inbound_citations": ["11005861", "214985313", "18256877", "6952842", "201870283", "215212156", "18698849", "15120438", "10259951", "215462128", "18751638", "56481925", "201748354"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2244127"}

The canonical (projected) output classifiers and input training data variables are encoded globally through a multi-linear projection of CCA, to decrease the impacts of noisy input data and incorrect classifiers to a minimum degree in such a global view. Secondly, based on the projection, a sparse regression method is used to prune representative classifiers by combining classifier diversity measurement.

In the present work the emotions are detected using Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. EEG records the electrical activity within the neurons of the brain. The main advantage of using EEG signals is that it detects real emotions arising straight from our mind and ignores external features like facial expressions or gesture. Hence EEG can act as real indicator of the emotion depicted by the subject. We have employed Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Machine Learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify EEG signals into seven different emotions.

The splitting nodes assign a testing sample to either left or right child based on the learned splitting function. The final prediction is determined as the average of label probability distributions stored in all arrived leaf nodes. For ambiguous testing samples, which often lie near the splitting boundaries, the conventional splitting function, also referred to as hard split function, tends to make wrong assignments, hence leading to wrong predictions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel soft-split random forest SSRF framework to improve the reliability of node splitting and finally the accuracy of classification. Specifically, a soft split function is employed to assign a testing sample into both left and right child nodes with their certain probabilities, which can effectively reduce influence of the wrong node assignment on the prediction accuracy. As a result, each testing sample can arrive at multiple leaf nodes, and their respective results can be fused to obtain the final prediction according to the weights accumulated along the path from the root node to each leaf node. Besides, considering the importance of context information, we also adopt a Haar-features based context model to iteratively refine the classification map.

Consequently, the ability to learn accurate predictors from experience is crucial to creating intelligent robots. However, in order to make accurate predictions it is necessary to find appropriate data representations from which to learn. Finding such data representations or features is a fundamental challenge for machine learning. Often domain knowledge is employed to design useful features for specific problems, but learning representations in a domain independent manner is highly desirable. While many approaches for automatic feature extraction exist, they are often either computationally expensive or of marginal utility. On the other hand, methods such as Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) have recently gained popularity as efficient and accurate model learners by employing large collections of fixed, random features. The computational efficiency of these approaches becomes particularly relevant when learning is done fully online, such as is the case for robots learning via their interactions with the world. Selectionist methods, which replace features offering low utility with random replacements, have been shown to produce efficient feature learning in one class of ELM.

Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness. It is a disease in which fluid pressure in the eye increases gradually, damaging the optic nerve and causing vision loss. Robust mass screening may help to extend the symptom-free life for the affected patients. The retinal optic nerve fiber layer can be assessed using optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry (SLP), and Heidelberg Retina Tomography (HRT) scanning methods. These methods are expensive and hence a novel low cost automated glaucoma diagnosis system using digital fundus images is proposed. The paper discusses the system for the automated identification of normal and glaucoma classes using Higher Order Spectra (HOS) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features. The extracted features are fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with linear, polynomial order 1, 2, 3 and Radial Basis Function (RBF) to select the best kernel function for automated decision making. In this work, SVM classifier with kernel function of polynomial order 2 was able to identify the glaucoma and normal images automatically with an accuracy of 95%, sensitivity and specificity of 93.33% and 96.67% respectively. Finally, we have proposed a novel integrated index called Glaucoma Risk Index (GRI) which is made up of HOS and DWT features, to diagnose the unknown class using a single feature.

The performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are computed and analyzed for each classifier and it is inferred that the Support Vector Machine based classification of sleep apnea produces promising results.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30617508", "doi": "10.1007/s10916-018-1146-8", "venue": "Journal of Medical Systems", "journal": "Journal of Medical Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2909302325", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["25409611", "32986856", "11672489", "15453591", "35819440", "33850778", "30466749", "31136397", "37474356", "20486963", "16610123", "21453727", "206625960"], "inbound_citations": ["209269715", "204230515", "182487491"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57574303"}

Modern tracking schemes usually first apply person detection in subsequent image frames, perform an association of detections to tracked person and then update the state of the individual tracked persons. Therefore, the overall performance of the tracking strongly relies on correct assignments of observations (detections) to tracked persons. In order to improve identification among different images, visual appearance can be used to distinguish individuals. As individuals and their appearance are usually not known in advance, appearance has to be learned online, while the person is being tracked. In this thesis, an approach to online learning of person appearance will be implemented and evaluated. Online learning will be based on Random Forests\u00ae, a tree-based classifier that has proven to be suitable for real-time learning. In order to improve identification, several image features will be evaluated (e.g. RGB, HOG), based on published datasets, which are commonly used in the literature. For colour-based features, background-subtraction will be evaluated as a means of avoiding the common problem that backgroundrelated appearance information is often mistaken by the classifier for being related to a person.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2924647155", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108369567"}

The Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) algorithm has been used as an optimization technique for the mapping of tasks onto the cores of NoC platforms. However, it does not scale well in terms of latency and other relevant metrics when the size of the platform and the number of tasks are increased. In this work, we propose a new approach, that relies on the PBIL algorithm, for the mapping of tasks called Virtual Regions PBIL (VRPBIL-NoC). This strategy consists of dividing the platform into virtual regions in order to improve the search of quality solutions. We evaluate the performance of our technique by comparing it against a set of heuristic techniques available in the literature, using an extended version of a well-known state-of-the-art simulator called Noxim.

We propose an adaptivescale convolutional neural network (ASCNet), which introduces a 3-layer convolution structure in the end-to-end training, to adaptively learn an appropriate dilation rate for each pixel in the image. Such pixel-level dilation rates produce optimal receptive fields so that the information of objects with different sizes can be extracted at the corresponding scale. We compare the segmentation results using the classic CNN, the dilated CNN and the proposed ASCNet on two types of medical images (The Herlev dataset and SCD RBC dataset).

The computational efficiency of GMMN is also less desirable in comparison with GAN, partially due to its requirement for a rather large batch size during the training.

The multivariate relevance vector machine (MVRVM) is used to build a model that forecasts soil moisture states based upon current soil moisture and soil temperature conditions. The methodology combines the data at different depths from 5 cm to 50 cm, the largest of which corresponds to the depth at which the soil moisture sensors are generally operational, to produce soil moisture predictions at larger depths.

However, the conventional multilabel classification approaches are usually incapable of effectively exploring the intrinsic inter-label correlations as well as jointly modeling the interactions between inter-label correlations and multilabel classification. To address this issue, we propose a multilabel classification framework based on a joint learning approach called label graph learning (LGL) driven weighted Support Vector Machine (SVM). In principle, the joint learning approach explicitly models the inter-label correlations by LGL, which is jointly optimized with multilabel classification in a unified learning scheme. As a result, the learned label correlation graph well fits the multilabel classification task while effectively reflecting the underlying topological structures among labels.

These normal and abnormal tissues can be detected using segmentation of the brain MR image and are very important for surgical planning and in diagnosing neurological diseases. This paper presents a novel approach for the detection of normal and abnormal tissues. Anisotropic diffusion filtering is used as the preprocessing step. The part of the algorithm used to detect the healthy tissues WM, GM, and CSF is based on multilevel thresholding that selects the best threshold values using Electro-magnetism-Like algorithm. A Region-based Active Contour is used to detect the tumor. A trained Support Vector Machine with different kernels which can be treated as KSVM is used for the classification of the tumor. In the classification process, features are extracted from the tumor images using the single level decomposition of 2-D Daubechies DWT. The high dimensioned feature vector is reduced by using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The suggested method can identify the benign and malignant type of tumors.

This challenge is especially acute within the medical image domain, particularly when pathologies are involved, due to two factors: (1) limited number of cases, and (2) large variations in location, scale, and appearance. In this work, we investigate whether augmenting a dataset with artificially generated lung nodules can improve the robustness of the progressive holistically nested network (P-HNN) model for pathological lung segmentation of CT scans. To achieve this goal, we develop a 3D generative adversarial network (GAN) that effectively learns lung nodule property distributions in 3D space. In order to embed the nodules within their background context, we condition the GAN based on a volume of interest whose central part containing the nodule has been erased. To further improve realism and blending with the background, we propose a novel multi-mask reconstruction loss. We train our method on over 1000 nodules from the LIDC dataset. Qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-art. We then use our GAN to generate simulated training images where nodules lie on the lung border, which are cases where the published P-HNN model struggles. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that armed with these simulated images, the P-HNN model learns to better segment lung regions under these challenging situations. As a result, our system provides a promising means to help overcome the data paucity that commonly afflicts medical imaging.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1806.04051", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-00934-2_81", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2949839989,2806470514,2962878449", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["21883326", "13290575", "2164893", "1033682", "30765642", "6200260", "41343397", "56578030", "6628106", "12803511", "16628328", "2202933", "11758569", "8945673", "35639092"], "inbound_citations": ["102354372", "54459176", "195833737", "204743865", "88491040", "202775797", "119308710", "59236493", "52289143", "202539186", "201660427", "102352042", "210145596", "49882848", "62913361", "125970270", "90262412", "210920311", "57189532", "204836982", "210868261", "49876452", "140221061", "186206719", "202122360", "58028921", "209439913", "67856728", "212633517"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:47019328"}

These aforementioned tasks are similar in nature, yet they are often modeled individually. Knowledge transfer can be effective for closely related tasks. However, transferring all knowledge, some of which irrelevant for a target task, can lead to sub-optimal results due to \\textit{negative} transfer. Hence, this paper focuses on the transferability of both instances and parameters across natural language understanding tasks by proposing an ensemble-based transfer learning method. \\newline The primary contribution of this paper is the combination of both \\textit{Dropout} and \\textit{Bagging} for improved transferability in neural networks, referred to as \\textit{Dropping} herein. We present a straightforward yet novel approach for incorporating source \\textit{Dropping} Networks to a target task for few-shot learning that mitigates \\textit{negative} transfer. This is achieved by using a decaying parameter chosen according to the slope changes of a smoothed spline error curve at sub-intervals during training.

This requires both, the engineering of reliable features and a good methodology for their analysis. If traditionally, features were engineered based on the physics of the system, recent advances in machine learning demonstrated that features could be automatically learned and monitored. In particular, using Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machines (HELM), based on random features, very good results have already been achieved for health monitoring with training on healthy data only. ::: Yet, although very useful and mathematically sound, random features have little popularity as they contradict the intuition and seem to rely on luck. This tends to increase the \u201cblackbox\u201d effect often associated with Machine Learning. To mitigate this, in this paper, we propose to modify the traditional HELM architecture such that, while still relying on random features, only the most useful features among a large population will be selected. ::: Traditional HELM are made of stacked contractive autoencoders with `1- or `2-regularisation and of a classifier as last layer. To achieve our objective, we propose to opt for expanding auto-encoders instead, but trained with a strong Group-LASSO regularization. This Group-LASSO regularisation fosters the selection of as few features as possible, making the auto-encoder in reality (or in testing condition) contractive.

However, not all individuals with MCI develop dementia. Predicting whether individuals with MCI will decline (i.e. progressive MCI) or remain stable (i.e. stable MCI) is impeded by patient heterogeneity due to comorbidities that may lead to MCI diagnosis without progression to AD. Despite the importance of early diagnosis of AD for prognosis and personalised interventions, we still lack robust tools for predicting individual progression to dementia. Here, we propose a novel trajectory modelling approach based on metric learning (Generalised Metric Learning Vector Quantization) that mines multimodal data from MCI patients in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort to derive individualised prognostic scores of cognitive decline due to AD. We develop an integrated biomarker generation\u2013 using partial least squares regression\u2013 and classification methodology that extends beyond binary patient classification into discrete subgroups (i.e. stable vs. progressive MCI), determines individual profiles from baseline (i.e. cognitive or biological) data and predicts individual cognitive trajectories (i.e. change in memory scores from baseline). We demonstrate that a metric learning model trained on baseline cognitive data (memory, executive function, affective measurements) discriminates stable vs. progressive MCI individuals with high accuracy (81.4%), revealing an interaction between cognitive (memory, executive functions) and affective scores that may relate to MCI comorbidity (e.g. affective disturbance). Training the model to perform the same classification task on biological data (mean cortical \u03b2-amyloid burden, grey matter density, APOE 4) results in similar prediction accuracy (81.9%). However, training the model with biological (r=-0.68) rather than cognitive data (r=-0.4) shows significantly better performance in predicting individualised rate of future cognitive decline (i.e. change in memory scores from baseline).

The deep representation computed through the deep learning network captures the main relationship between the depth-based matching kernel and the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel.

Since experimental methods for measuring the solubility of n-alkanes in supercritical CO2 at different temperatures and pressures are not economical and usually take a long time, feasibility of applying intelligent tools in the solubility prediction of different n-alkanes in supercritical CO2 at pressures up to 45.9 MPa was conducted in this study.

These assessments may fail to reliably distinguish tumor and nontumor. This study aimed to classify enhancing and nonenhancing lesion areas into tumor-versus-nontumor components. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 140 MRI scans obtained from 32 patients with high-grade gliomas and 6 patients with brain metastases were included. Classification of lesion areas was performed using a support vector machine classifier trained on 4 components: enhancing and nonenhancing, tumor and nontumor, based on T1-weighted, FLAIR, and dynamic-contrast-enhancing MRI parameters. Classification results were evaluated by 2-fold cross-validation analysis of the training set and MR spectroscopy. Longitudinal changes of the component volumes were compared with Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria. RESULTS: Normalized T1-weighted values, FLAIR, plasma volume, volume transfer constant, and bolus-arrival-time parameters differentiated components. High sensitivity and specificity (100%) were obtained within the enhancing and nonenhancing areas. Longitudinal changes in component volumes correlated with the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria in 27 patients; 5 patients (16%) demonstrated an increase in tumor component volumes indicating tumor progression. These changes preceded Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology assessments by several months. Seven patients treated with bevacizumab showed a shift to an infiltrative pattern of progression. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes an automatic classification method: segmented Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria based on advanced imaging that reliably differentiates tumor and nontumor components in high-grade gliomas. The segmented Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria may improve therapy-response assessment and provide earlier indication of progression.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28385884", "doi": "10.3174/ajnr.A5127", "venue": "AJNR.

These systems are generally based on measuring the motor system disorders seen in PD patients by the help of non-invasive data collection tools. Vocal impairments one of the most commonly seen PD symptoms in the early stages of the disease, and building such telemonitoring systems based on detecting the level of vocal impairments results in reliable motor UPDRS tracking systems. In this paper, we aim to determine the optimal UPDRS threshold value that can be discriminated by the vocal features extracted from the sustained vowel phonations of PD patients. For this purpose, we used an online available PD telemonitoring dataset consisting of speech recordings of 42 PD patients. We converted the UPDRS prediction problem into a binary classification problem for various motor UPDRS threshold values, and fed the features to k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machines classifiers to discriminate the PD patients whose UPDRS is less than or greater than the specified threshold value. The results indicate that speech disorders are more significantly seen in the patients whose UPDRS exceeds the experimentally determined threshold value (15). Besides, considering that the motor UPDRS ranges from 0 to 108, relatively low UPDRS threshold of 15 validates that vocal impairments can be used as early indicators of the disease.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BIBE.2015.7367737", "venue": "2015 IEEE 15th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE)", "journal": "2015 IEEE 15th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2221238724", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["25501527", "11888834", "3366178", "9435872", "82253990", "7382779", "32433931", "4987682", "74286692", "3254490", "15874442", "9203634", "15273230"], "inbound_citations": ["13242541", "22489178"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26935340"}

However, existing deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture cannot fully exploit spatial\u2013spectral correlations in three-dimensional (3-D) hyperspectral images (HSIs) (directly extending 2-D DCNN into 3-D will significantly increase computational complexity); meantime, unlike 2-D images, there is an obstacle caused by the shortage of training data for HSIs. To meet those challenges, we present a novel, deep-learning framework for 3-D HSI denoising with the following contributions. First, inspired by the success of U-net in low-dose current-transformer denoising, we propose a novel approach of encoding rich multi-scale information of HSIs by a modified 3-D U-net. Second, we present a computationally efficient implementation of 3-D U-net based on the strategy of separable filtering. By decomposing 3-D filtering into 2-D spatial filtering and 1-D spectral filtering, we can achieve substantial savings on the number of network parameters to keep the computational complexity low. Third, we have developed a transfer learning approach of synthetically generating HSIs from RGB images as supplementary training data. The synthesized HSIs are used for the initial training of the modified 3-D U-net denoising network, which will be fine-tuned on real HSI images. Experimental results have shown that the proposed 3-D U-net denoising method significantly outperforms existing model-based HSI denoising methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCI.2019.2911881", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2984522085,2972754513,2937534233", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10913825", "6546550", "14545879", "6375799", "6888534", "1475121", "6329825", "16118053", "10297248", "24059259", "572928", "26277487", "11299782", "2974762", "1295558", "14201993", "37415409", "8674188", "11077553", "9021712", "195908774", "206594692", "18874645", "13271756", "9971732", "15799108", "996788", "687557", "3719281", "25672001", "690087", "3490992", "3884673", "6290703", "3858563", "7572570", "59233995", "44131640", "1923924", "206592218", "11699847", "1122604", "6070160", "206767788", "15278025", "1467489", "126879175", "6628106", "14092238", "26789744", "1033682", "14899087", "52015462", "1447466", "8347366", "8331894", "2225322", "13769911", "3310188", "37415409", "1295558", "8674188"], "inbound_citations": ["212644858"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:146116742"}

Previous studies describing land cover in the dry tropics are spatially or temporally constrained. This study presents the first long-term (1972\u20132016) nationwide land cover dynamics and forest connectivity analyses for Zambia. We employed 300 Landsat images and an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach with the Random Forests (RF) classifier to map nine land covers at six time steps (1972, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2008 and 2016). Post-classification change detection was used to understand the dynamics, while landscape metrics were derived to assess the forest structural connectivity. Overall accuracies ranging from 79 to 86% were achieved. In 1972, 48% of Zambia was covered by primary forest and 16% was covered by secondary forest. By 2016, 62.74% of Zambia had undergone changes, with primary forest decreasing by 32% and secondary forest increasing by 23%. Our results showed that forests have been recovering by 0.03 to 1.3% yr\u22121 (53, 000\u2013242, 000 ha yr-1); however, these rates are markedly lower than deforestation rates (- 0.54 to - 3.05% yr-1: 83, 000\u2013453, 000 ha yr-1). Annual rates of change varied by land cover, with irrigated crops having the largest increase (+ 3.19 yr-1) and primary forest having the greatest decrease (-2.48% yr-1). Forest connectivity declined by 22%, with primary forest having the greatest decline, while the connectivity for secondary and plantation forest increased. We showed here that land cover in Zambia is highly dynamic with high rates of change, low forest recovery and decline in forest connectivity.

Image segmentation plays a key role in GEOBIA workflows, allowing to partition images into homogenous and mutually exclusive regions. Nonetheless, segmentation techniques require a robust parameterization to achieve the best results. Frequently, inappropriate parameterization leads to sub-optimal results and difficulties in comparing distinct methods. Here, we present an approach based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) to optimize image segmentation parameters by using the performance scores from object-based classification, thus allowing to assess the adequacy of a segmented image in relation to the classification problem. This approach was implemented in a new R package called SegOptim , in which several segmentation algorithms are interfaced, mostly from open-source software ( GRASS GIS, Orfeo Toolbox, RSGISLib, SAGA GIS , TerraLib ), but also from proprietary software ( ESRI ArcGIS ). SegOptim also provides access to several machine-learning classification algorithms currently available in R, including Gradient Boosted Modelling, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest. We tested our approach using very-high to high spatial resolution images collected from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (0.03 \u2013 0.10 m), WorldView-2 (2 m), RapidEye (5 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 \u2013 20 m) in six different test sites located in northern Portugal with varying environmental conditions and for different purposes, including invasive species detection and land cover mapping. The results highlight the added value of our novel comparison of image segmentation and classification algorithms. Overall classification performances (assessed through cross-validation with the Kappa index) ranged from 0.85 to 1.00. Pilot-tests show that our GA-based approach is capable of providing sound results for optimizing the parameters of different segmentation algorithms, with benefits for classification accuracy and for comparison across techniques. We also verified that no particular combination of an image segmentation and a classification algorithm is suited for all the tasks/objectives. Consequently, it is crucial to compare and optimize available methods to understand which one is more suited for a certain objective. Our approach allows a closer integration between the segmentation and classification stages, which is of high importance for GEOBIA workflows. The results from our tests confirm that this integration has benefits for comparing and optimizing both processes.

The availability of easy to use malware toolkits and internet popularity has led to the increase in number of malware attacks. Currently signature based malware detection techniques are widely used. However, malware authors use packing techniques to create new variants of existing malwares which defeat signature based malware detection. So, it is very important to identify packed malware and unpack it before analysis. Dynamic unpacking runs the packed executable and provides an unpacked version based on the system. This technique requires dedicated hardware and is computationally expensive. As each individual packer uses its own unpacking algorithm it is important to have a prior knowledge about the packer used, in order to assist in reverse engineering. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for packer identification problem using Byte plot and Markov plot. First packed malware is converted to Byte plot and Markov plot. Later Gabor and wavelet based features are extracted from Byte plot and Markov plot. We used SVMs (Support Vector Machine) in our analysis. We performed our experiments on nine different packers and we obtained about 95 % accuracy for nine of the packers.

However, variability in the EMG signal due to between-subject differences can substantially degrade the machine-learning performance. This variation is usually due to the differences in both anatomical and physiological properties of the muscles, levels of muscle contraction, and inherent noises from the sensors. The aim of this study is to develop a subject-independent algorithm that can accurately classify different hand gestures. To minimize the between-subject differences, some selected time-domain EMG features are normalized to the area under the averaged root mean square curve (AUC-RMS). Five adult subjects with ages ranging 20\u201337 years performed three hand gestures including fist, wave-in, and wave-out for ten to twelve times each. Five machine-learning algorithms, including ?-nearest neighbor (KNN), discriminant analysis (DA), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used to classify the three different hand gestures. The results showed that the EMG features were moderately to strongly correlated with the AUC-RMS values. The SVM yielded maximum classification accuracy using the original EMG features (97.56%) which was significantly improved by using the normalized EMG features (98.73%) (p<0.05). The accuracy distribution of all classifiers were found to be closer to mean values when using the normalized EMG features compared to using the original EMG features.

The objective of this paper is to propose and implement a decoding algorithm with optimized small dimension feature matrix on identifying motor intention of finger movement using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. An experiment was designed and conducted, in which EEG was acquired from 10 healthy subjects during the left or the right index finger movement. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) topography was analyzed during motor tasks. A degree feature extraction algorithm was proposed based on the graph theory together with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify two kinds of index finger movement, which takes three factors into consideration: frequency bands, amplitude and range of ERD. The results showed that the algorithm can classify the finger movement effectively for 7 subjects based on a three-dimension optimized feature matrix, consisting of the maximum degree, average degree and clustering range.

The main problem associated with wind power production is the nature of the wind speed which is random and non linear. This is a reason why wind speed forecasting is a difficult but crucial task, since its accuracy plays a significant role in achieving reliable and autonomous power production and at the same time contributes in surpassing a series problems, of economic and technical nature. In this study real data is used and the performance of three different techniques for adaptive short term wind speed forecasting are evaluated. The first method combines the multimodel partitioning filter (MMPF) implementing extended Kalman filters (EKF) with Support Vector Machines (SVM), the second is a hybrid method of MMPF and Genetic Algorithms (G.A) and the last method implements an artificial multilayer layer feed-forward neural network (ANN). It should be noted that the first two techniques having the structure presented in this work, have never been tested before on short term wind speed prediction.

This paper presents a fully automated atlas- and learning-based method for segmenting three OARs (trachea, spinal cord, parotid glands) in multimodal head-and-neck MRI images. The proposed method consists of three main parts. First, a probabilistic atlas is generated. Then, a Random Forest classifier that incorporates the atlas as well as various image features of the multimodal images is applied globally and locally in order to handle local variations. The method was trained and tested on 30 multimodal MRI examinations including T2w, T1w and T1w fat saturated images. Manually defined contours were used as reference. The presented results show good correlation with the reference using DICE similarity measurements.

However, they usually do not use neuropsychological testing data in that analysis. The purpose of this work is to measure the advantages of using not only neuroimages as data source in CAD systems for dementia but also neuropsychological scores. To this aim, we compared the accuracy rates achieved by systems that use neuropsychological scores beside the imaging data in the classification step and systems that use only one of these data sources. In order to address the small sample size problem and facilitate the data combination, a dimensionality reduction step (implemented using three different algorithms) was also applied on the imaging data. After each image is summarized in a reduced set of image features, the data sources were combined and classified using three different data combination approaches and a Support Vector Machine classifier. That way, by testing different dimensionality reduction methods and several data combination approaches, we aim not only highlighting the advantages of using neuropsychological scores in the classification, but also implementing the most accurate computer system for early dementia detention.

Both the traditional and the Machine Learning (ML) approach were examined. In the traditional approach, every component of the propulsion plant was examined separately, while empirical or semi-empirical methods were used for the added resistance due to waves, wind and shallow water. Historical data were used for verification and tuning (where needed) during the development of the model. In the Machine Learning approach, the method of Support Vector Machines was used. Also, it was examined whether a vessel\u2019s performance model can be developed by combining the methods mentioned above. Thus, in total four models were developed. The data regarding the last year of operation of the vessel Schippersgracht were used (45000 data points) to test the models. It was found that with all the four models, 80 % of the examined dataset was calculated with an error of less than 10 %. The daily fuel consumption was calculated for the same dataset and for 90% of the days examined, the daily fuel consumption was calculated with an error of less than 10 %. The main conclusions about the developed performance models is that all the models resulted in more less the same accuracy. The model based on the traditional approach has the advantage that it offers more information and more outputs can be taken, compared to the ML approach which only provides the output of the fuel consumption. On the other hand, the model based on the ML approach is significantly faster and allows many iterations to be performed in a short time. Regarding the models which were developed by combining the approaches mentioned above, they did not result in additional advantages. Finally, two case studies were performed. In the first case study, it was presented how the model, developed following the traditional approach, can be used to examine how modifications in the propulsion system will influence the vessel\u2019s fuel consumption. The case of switching from fixed rpm (that is currently used) to a variable rpm system was examined, which is a real scenario that the company is considering. It was calculated that installing the variable rpm system and a frequency converter will result in annual savings of around 250,000 \u20ac while the investment\u2019s payback time is estimated to be around two years. In the second case study, a future voyage simulation algorithm was developed. This algorithm receives as inputs the voyage plan(route and speed) and performs a calculation for the voyage\u2019s fuel consumption by taking into account the weather predictions. The voyage simulation algorithm is making use of the ML model. A few cases were examined in order to examine how many days in advance the calculation is reliable (due to the uncertainty of the weather predictions) and about the time interval that should be used in the algorithm. However, clear conclusions were not derived, and further examination is suggested(by examining more voyages).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2991664292", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213232616"}

Thus, it is possible to identify the health states of MURC by using related fault knowledge contained in the data from MUL. To achieve this purpose, a transfer learning method named convolutional adaptation network (CAN) is proposed in this paper. The proposed method first uses domain-shared convolutional neural network to extract features from the collected data. Second, the distribution discrepancy between the learned features of the data from MUL and MURC is reduced by minimizing multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy. Finally, pseudo label learning is introduced to train domain-shared classifier by using unlabeled data from MURC. The proposed method is verified by a transfer learning case, in which the health states of locomotive bearings are identified by using the fault knowledge contained in the data from motor bearings used in a laboratory. The results show that CAN is able to effectively identify the health states of MURC with the help of the data from MUL.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/sdpc.2018.8664814", "venue": "2018 International Conference on Sensing,Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Control (SDPC)", "journal": "2018 International Conference on Sensing,Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Control (SDPC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2921939179", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12885213", "2380770", "7723009", "41928030", "125926579", "740063", "5522822", "56594323", "67182842", "10742222", "18507866", "122495665"], "inbound_citations": ["202729441", "209515640", "202577166"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:77394258"}

Although global surface water histories are now generated from 30 m Landsat data, for many locations they contain large temporal gaps particularly for longer periods (>10 years) due to revisit intervals and cloud cover. Daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) imagery has potential to fill such gaps, but its relatively coarse spatial resolution may not detect small water bodies, which can be of great ecological importance. To address this problem, this study proposes and tests options for estimating the surface water fraction from MODIS 16-day 500 m Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) corrected surface reflectance image composites. The spatial extent of two Landsat tiles over Spain were selected as test areas. We obtained a 500 m reference dataset on surface water fraction by spatially aggregating 30 m binary water masks obtained from the Landsat-derived C-version of Function of Mask (CFmask), which themselves were evaluated against high-resolution Google Earth imagery. Twelve regression tree models were developed with two approaches, Random Forest and Cubist, using spectral metrics derived from MODIS data and topographic parameters generated from a 30 m spatial resolution digital elevation model. Results showed that accuracies were higher when we included annual summary statistics of the spectral metrics as predictor variables. Models trained on a single Landsat tile were ineffective in mapping surface water in the other tile, but global models trained with environmental conditions from both tiles can provide accurate results for both study areas. We achieved the highest accuracy with Cubist global model ( R 2 = 0.91, RMSE = 11.05%, MAE = 7.67%). Our method was not only effective for mapping permanent water fraction, but also in accurately capturing temporal fluctuations of surface water. Based on this good performance, we produced surface water fraction maps at 16-day interval for the 2000\u20132015 MODIS archive. Our approach is promising for monitoring surface water fraction at high frequency time intervals over much larger regions provided that training data are collected across the spatial domain for which the model will be applied.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2017.11.007", "venue": "Int.

In addition, we would like the possibility of confidently selecting a source model even when the data it was trained on is not available, for example, due to privacy or copyright constraints. We propose to use the truncated source models as encoders for the target data. We then select a source model based on how well it clusters the target data in the latent encoding space, which we calculate using the Mean Silhouette Coefficient. We prove that if the encodings achieve a Mean Silhouette Coefficient of 1, optimal classification can be achieved using just the final layer of the target network.

One of the critical issues for a successful facial expression recognition system is to design a robust facial feature descriptor. Among the different existing methods, the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) has been proved to be a simple and effective one for facial expression representation. However, the LBP method thresholds P neighbors exactly at the value of the center pixel in a local neighborhood and encodes only the signs of the differences between the gray values. Thus, it loses some important texture information. In this paper, we present a robust facial feature descriptor constructed with the Compound Local Binary Pattern (CLBP) for person-independent facial expression recognition, which overcomes the limitations of LBP. The proposed CLBP operator combines extra P bits with the original LBP code in order to construct a robust feature descriptor that exploits both the sign and the magnitude information of the differences between the center and the neighbor gray values. The recognition performance of the proposed method is evaluated using the CohnKanade (CK) and the Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) database with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Experimental results with prototypic expressions show the superiority of the CLBP feature descriptor against some wellknown appearance-based feature representation methods.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Int.

There are several medical conditions that increase the risk for bone loss and falls which are recorded in the electronic medical record (EMR). Objectives We explored whether we could exploit data available in the EMR to estimate FRAX treatment thresholds to help passively identify patients who would benefit from further bone mineral density screening and management. Methods We studied 912 women and men, previously recruited for our bone health studies, in whom FRAX scores (with and without BMD) had been determined and comprehensive medical diagnoses were available through the medical linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. All diagnoses were categorized by the Clinical Classification Software (CCS) system whereby over 14,000 ICD-9-CM diagnoses are reduced to 568 clinically meaningful categories. If a subject had at least two diagnoses in a CCS category that were at least 30 days apart and within 5 years of their FRAX assessment, the subject was treated as having that CCS code. We used Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to create models that would predict the treatment thresholds for the FRAX 10-year risk for major osteoporotic (OP) fx (>20%) and hip fx (>3%), based on available diagnoses. Models were fit using age, sex and CCS category from 80% of the data, retaining 20% for validation. Results Of the 564 (62%) women and 348 (38%) men, the mean \u00b1 SD age was 61\u00b116 yrs. There were no significant differences in subject characteristics used for FRAX calculation or FRAX scores between the training and validation sets. The c-statistic for GBM models predicting treatment thresholds for FRAX, calculated with BMD, for major OP fx and hip fx were 0.95 and 0.96, respectively, for the training set, and 0.88 and 0.94 for the validation set. Similar results were observed for FRAX scores without BMD. Conclusions FRAX treatment thresholds may be reasonably estimated from data available in the EMR to help identify to the clinician those at highest risk for fracture who would warrant further evaluation. Further work to implement and validate these findings in the EMR system would be necessary.

The increase in the complexity and nonlinearity are due to more advanced component designs and more complex interactions between these components. Consequently, models must get more complex and nonlinear to be useful for design and development in the future. In particular, real-time models must capture all relevant nonlinearity and complexity with acceptable accuracy and execution time to be useful in important applications, such as control system development. For this purpose, several real-time modeling techniques, namely transfer function, piecewise linear, aero-thermodynamic, and surrogate models can be used. Among the real-time modeling techniques, surrogate models promise high computational speed in addition to capturing nonlinearity. However, this potential can only be realized in practice if a turbofan\u2019s state space is sampled sufficiently and efficiently. Because the state space has functional dependencies, typical space filling sampling techniques face problems, such as sampling a significant number of infeasible points and sampling the feasible state space sparsely or incompletely. To overcome the problem due to the functional dependencies in the state space, this paper proposes sampling a civilian turbofan\u2019s state space with Support Vector Machines (SVM) a nonlinear pattern classifier. Thus, the functional dependencies can be captured as a pattern and less infeasible points are sampled while capturing the feasible state space sufficiently and efficiently. SVM were initially trained with a relatively small set of feasible and infeasible points to estimate the boundary between feasible and infeasible regions in the state space. Thus, the remaining sampling points were chosen from the feasible state space to generate more accurate surrogate models for real-time applications without increasing the number of cases. For sampling and accuracy tests, a non-real-time civilian turbofan model with shaft dynamics was developed to be the truth model. The proposed sampling method was compared with space filling samplings which used 5% and 20% perturbations from the steady state at sea level static (SLS) condition. As a result, the reduction in the number of sampled infeasible points and better coverage of the feasible state space were shown. In this paper multilayer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer was chosen to demonstrate the accuracy of surrogate models created using the proposed sampling method because of its advantages over other surrogate modeling techniques and fair comparison with work in the literature. The MLPs trained on the data generated by the proposed sampling method were tested in capturing truth model\u2019s small and large signal behavior with step inputs at SLS.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2514/6.2013-4003", "venue": "49th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference", "journal": "49th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference", "mag_id": "2320609392", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["13765888"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:112018552"}

Male freezability was assessed by evaluating motility, membrane status and mitochondrial membrane potential of sperm after a freezing-thawing procedure. The SVM model was generated using sperm motility information captured by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) from thawed semen, belonging to six stags with marked differences on their freezability. A total of 1369 sperm tracks were recorded for seven kinematic parameters and assigned to four motility patterns based on them: weak motile, progressive, transitional and hyperactivated-like. Then, these data were split in two sets: the training set, used to train the SVM model, and the testing set, used to examine how the SVM method and three other unsupervised methods, a non-hierarchical, a hierarchical and a multistep clustering procedures, performed the sperm classification into subpopulations. The SVM was revealed as the most accurate method in the characterization of sperm subpopulations, showing all the sperm subpopulations obtained in this way high significant correlations with those sperm parameters used to characterize freezability of males. Given its superiority, the SVM method was used to characterize the sperm motile subpopulations in Iberian red deer. Sperm motile data from frozen-thawed semen belonging to 25 stags were recorded and loaded into the SVM model. The sperm population structure revealed that those males showing poor freezability were characterized by high percentages of sperm with a weak motility pattern. In opposite, males showing good freezability were characterized by higher percentages of sperm with a progressive and hyperactivated-like motility pattern and lower percentages of sperm with a weak motile pattern. We also identified a sperm subpopulation with a transitional motility pattern.

Thus, it is highly desirable to develop computational methods for identifying the structural classes of newly found proteins based on their primary sequence. In this study, according to the concept of Chou's pseudo amino acid composition (PseAA), eight PseAA vectors are used to represent protein samples. Each of the PseAA vectors is a 40-D (dimensional) vector, which is constructed by the conventional amino acid composition (AA) and a series of sequence-order correlation factors as original introduced by Chou. The difference among the eight PseAA representations is that different physicochemical properties are used to incorporate the sequence-order effects for the protein samples. Based on such a framework, a dual-layer fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) network is proposed to predict protein structural classes. In the first layer of the FSVM network, eight FSVM classifiers trained by different PseAA vectors are established. The 2nd layer FSVM classifier is applied to reclassify the outputs of the first layer.

The search for the coefficients of this polynomial is carried out using the fast, non-iterative training algorithm of the SGTM linear neural-like structure. The developed method provides high speed and increased generalization properties. The simulation of the developed method\u2019s work for solving the medical insurance costs prediction task showed a significant increase in accuracy compared with existing methods (common SGTM neural-like structure, multilayer perceptron, Support Vector Machine, adaptive boosting, linear regression). Given the above, the developed method can be used to process large amounts of data from a variety of industries (medicine, materials science, economics, etc.) to improve the accuracy and speed of their processing.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/data3040046", "venue": "Data", "journal": "Data", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2899015031", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["35873806", "202844459", "14130070", "38758845", "52929944", "13326773", "16718448", "42693154", "116739618", "12920367", "18069705", "49361244", "1358050", "38422928", "126184463", "15083365", "36377734", "9870834", "60504238", "14988266", "43779944", "29653731"], "inbound_citations": ["204861665", "207757407"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69921009"}

First of all, we prepared a geospatial database in the study area, including 79 landslide points that were divided into a training and validating dataset and 14 landslide conditioning factors. Second, the Support Vector Machines classifier (SVMC) approach was adapted to analyze the predictive capability of the landslide predisposing factors in each method. Then, a multicollinearity analysis using TOL and VIF parameters and Pearson's correlation coefficient methods were applied to verify the multicollinearity and correlation between these factors. Third, the LADT-Bagging and FPA-Bagging models were built by the integration of the LogitBoost alternating decision trees (LADT) with the Bagging ensemble and Forest by Penalizing Attributes (FPA) with the Bagging ensemble, respectively. Besides, heuristic tests were also applied to identify the appropriate values of each model's parameters in order to obtain the best programmer. Finally, for the training dataset, the results reveal that the LADT-Bagging model acquire the largest AUC value (0.980), smallest standard error (SE) (0.0134), narrowest 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.920\u20130.999), highest accuracy value (AV) (91.03%), highest specificity (94.44%), highest sensitivity (88.10%), highest F-measure (0.9115), lowest MAE (0.2016), lowest RMSE (0.2653), and highest Kappa (0.8205). About the result of validation dataset, it reveal that the LADT-Bagging model acquire the largest AUC value (0.781), the smallest SE (0.0539), the narrowest 95% CI (0.673\u20130.867), highest AV (71.19%), highest specificity (74.29%), highest sensitivity (69.77%), highest F-measure (0.7195), lowest MAE (0.3509), lowest RMSE (0.4335), and highest Kappa (0.4359). The results indicate that the LADT-Bagging model outperforms the FPA-Bagging, LADT and FPA models. Furthermore, the results of a Wilcoxon signed-rank test demonstrate that LADT-Bagging is significantly statistically different from other models.

It started with Echo State Networks (ESNs) and Liquid State Machines ten years ago where the reservoir was generated randomly and only linear readouts from it were trained.

First, these systems rely on supervised learning approaches to learn gesture features, which normally require a large-scale labeled dataset to address the overfitting problem. However, the acquisition of such dataset is time-consuming. Second, the radar signature of hand movement is often influenced by micromotion caused by other body parts, which leads to distorted motion features, resulting in poor identification accuracy. To overcome these problems, we propose an unsupervised hand gesture feature learning method using the deep convolutional auto-encoder network to analyze hand gesture signal collected by a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar sensor. First, via a convolutional encoder sub-network, input radar range profiles are transformed into lower dimensional representations.

Representation Learning techniques are general methods for automatic feature computation. Nevertheless, these techniques are regarded as uninterpretable \"black boxes\". In this paper, we propose a methodology to enhance the interpretability of automatically extracted machine learning features. The proposed system is composed of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine for unsupervised feature learning, and a Random Forest classifier, which are combined to jointly consider existing correlations between imaging data, features, and target variables. We define two levels of interpretation: global and local. The former is devoted to understanding if the system learned the relevant relations in the data correctly, while the later is focused on predictions performed on a voxel- and patient-level. In addition, we propose a novel feature importance strategy that considers both imaging data and target variables, and we demonstrate the ability of the approach to leverage the interpretability of the obtained representation for the task at hand. We evaluated the proposed methodology in brain tumor segmentation and penumbra estimation in ischemic stroke lesions. We show the ability of the proposed methodology to unveil information regarding relationships between imaging modalities and extracted features and their usefulness for the task at hand.

Boosting the performance of inverse computing imaging algorithms is the key to improving the reconstruction quality (RQ). Common regularization iteration imaging methods with analytical prior regularizers are less flexible in dealing with actual reconstruction tasks, leading to large reconstruction errors. To address the challenge, this study proposes a new imaging method, including reconstruction model and optimizer. The data-driven regularizer from a new ensemble learning model and the analytical prior regularizer with the focus on the sparsity of imaging objects are combined into a new optimization model for imaging. In the proposed ensemble learning model, the generalized low rank approximations of matrices (GLRAM) method is used to carry out the dimensionality reduction for decreasing the redundancy of the input data and improving the diversity, the extreme learning machine (ELM) serves as a base learner and the nuclear norm based matrix regression (NNMR) method is developed to aggregate the ensemble of solutions. The singular value thresholding method (SVTM) and the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) are inserted into the split Bregman method (SBM) to generate a powerful optimizer for the built computational model. Its comparison to other competing methods through numerical experiments on typical imaging targets demonstrates that the developed algorithm reduces reconstruction error and achieves much more improvement in imaging quality and robustness.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.apm.2020.01.063", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Mathematical Modelling", "mag_id": "3005925390", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214575312"}

Indeed, a compromise between several objectives is often required to obtain successful clinical drugs. The present manuscript details a multi-objective workflow that integrates the 4D-QSAR and molecular docking methods in the simultaneous modeling of the Rho Kinase inhibitory activity and acute toxicity of Benzamide derivatives. To this end, the pIC50/pLD50 ratio is considered as the response variable, permitting the concurrent modeling of both properties and representing a shift from classical step-by-step evaluations. The 4D-QSAR strategy is used to generate the Grid Cell Occupancy Descriptors (GCODs), and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods as the model fitting techniques. While the statistical parameters for the PLS model do not meet established criteria for acceptability, the SGB model yields satisfactory performance, with correlation coefficients r2=0.95 and r2pred=0.65 for the training and test set, respectively. Posteriorly, the structural interpretation of the most relevant GCODs according to the SGB model is performed, allowing for the proposal of 139 novel benzamide derivatives, which are then screened using the same model. Of these 9 compounds were predicted to possess pIC50/pLD50 ratio values higher than those for the employed dataset. Finally, in order to corroborate the results obtained with the SGB model, a docking simulation was formed to evaluate the binding affinity of the proposed molecules to the ROCK2 active site and 3 chemical structures (i. e. p6, p14 and p131) showed higher binding affinity than the most active compound in the training set, while the rest generally demonstrated comparable behavior. It may therefore be concluded that the consensus models that intertwine the 4D-QSAR and molecular docking methods contribute to more reliable virtual screening and compound optimization experiments. Additionally, the use of multi-objective modeling schemes permits the simultaneous evaluation of different chemical and biological profiles, which should contribute to the control a priori of causative factors for the high attrition rates in later drug discovery phases.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28876533", "doi": "10.1002/minf.201700080", "venue": "Molecular informatics", "journal": "Molecular informatics", "mag_id": "2752564268", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206257990"}

In this paper, a novel multiple graph label propagation integration framework for saliency object detection algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm is divided into four steps. First, an input image is segmented into superpixels which are represented as nodes in a graph and transformed from RGB color space into CIE L*a*b* color space. Second, combined by texture features, we measure the similarity of two adjacent superpixels for each feature, which is represented as an affinity matrix. Then, to generate the salient seeds, we adopt the color boosting Harris points as salient points to catch the corners or marginal points of visual salient region in color image. The saliency points provide us a coarse location of the salient areas. In the last step, the graphs are combined into label propagation framework to obtain the saliency maps. We propose efficient optimization algorithms for the proposed approach, which generate sparse weighted coefficients that allow identifying the graphs which are important or not for salient object detection easily.

The LULC mapping of this study was carried out in the context of the development of an evaluation approach for Zimbabwe\u2019s land reform program. Within the discourse about the success of this program, a lack of spatially explicit methods to produce objective data, such as on the extent of agricultural area, is apparent. We therefore assessed the suitability of moderate spatial and high temporal resolution imagery and phenological parameters to retrieve regional figures about the extent of cropland area in former freehold tenure in a series of 13 years from 2001\u20132013. Time-series data was processed with TIMESAT and was stratified according to agro-ecological potential zoning of Zimbabwe. Random Forest (RF) classifications were used to produce annual binary crop/non crop maps which were evaluated with high spatial resolution data from other satellite sensors. We assessed the cropland products in former freehold tenure in terms of classification accuracy, inter-annual comparability and heterogeneity. Although general LULC patterns were depicted in classification results and an overall accuracy of over 80% was achieved, user accuracies for rainfed agriculture were limited to below 65%. We conclude that phenological analysis has to be treated with caution when rainfed agriculture and grassland in semi-humid tropical regions have to be separated based on MODIS spectral data and phenological parameters. Because classification results significantly underestimate redistributed commercial farmland in Zimbabwe, we argue that the method cannot be used to produce spatial information on land-use which could be linked to tenure change. Hence capabilities of moderate resolution data are limited to assess Zimbabwe\u2019s land reform.

Many complications occur if diabetes remains untreated and unidentified. The tedious identifying process results in visiting of a patient to a diagnostic center and consulting doctor. But the rise in machine learning approaches solves this critical problem. The motive of this study is to design a model which can prognosticate the likelihood of diabetes in patients with maximum accuracy. Therefore three machine learning classification algorithms namely Decision Tree, SVM and Naive Bayes are used in this experiment to detect diabetes at an early stage. Experiments are performed on Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIDD) which is sourced from UCI machine learning repository.

The RE are mainly consisting of intermittent solar and wind generators, while the load demands are classified as base (uncontrollable) loads and flexible (controllable) loads. The base loads are priority loads and are served in real time, while flexible loads could be operated intelligently according to the availability of the supply. We integrate a day-ahead prediction mechanism for RE, so that we can schedule a day-ahead consumption accordingly. Practically, these predictions are attained with certain level of forecasting errors, causing imbalance in supply and demands at real-time. This imbalance also known as RE uncertainty, will make the power system unstable. To address the dynamic behavior of SDMG and to balance supply and demands, we propose a novel robust control strategy for controllable flexible demands. To simplify our system we make the generation and demands deterministic, by employing intelligence of Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm. We then incorporate SVM with novel Sliding Mode Control (SMC) for scheduling consumer's flexible loads to make DSM more efficient and accurate.

Solving this problem is crucial and practical in that online detection of abnormal patterns of people's collective behaviors may lead to rapid response to emergent affairs. In terms of technology, the task can be regarded as detection of abnormal particle movement patterns from a global point of view. In this study, we propose a solution to solve this problem. First, the traffic flows observed by more than 4000 sensors are organized as high-dimensional time series. Second, a widely used manifold learning technique referred to as locally linear embedding (LLE) is used to compute the K coefficients in fitting every data point with its K nearest neighbors in the high-dimensional s ce, which can be regarded as a K-dimensional local feature associated with every data point. Then, the local features of the data points within a time window are summarized by using principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain a global feature to represent the traffic data in every time window. Finally, outlier detection is performed on such PCALLE feature space.

In consideration of the sophistication in establishing the accurate and diagnosis-friendly model for PEMFC systems, data-driven fault diagnosis is the main focus in this thesis. ::: As a main branch of data-driven fault diagnosis, the methods based on pattern classification techniques are firstly studied. Taking individual fuel cell voltages as original diagnosis variables, fault detection and isolation (FDI) is achieved through a two-step procedure. The first step is for feature extraction, while the second one is for classification. According to this framework, several representative methodologies in each step are investigated and compared from the perspectives of diagnosis accuracy and computational cost. ::: Specific to the defects on novel class detection and online adaptation capability of conventional classification based diagnosis methods, a novel diagnosis strategy is proposed for PEMFC system diagnosis. A new classifier named Sphere-shaped Multi-class Support Vector Machine (SSM-SVM) and modified diagnostic rules are utilized to realize the novel fault recognition. While an incremental learning method is extended to achieve the online adaptation. ::: Apart from the pattern classification based diagnosis approach, a so-called partial model-based data-driven approach is introduced to handle PEMFC diagnosis in dynamic processes. With the aid of a subspace identification method (SIM), the model-based residual generation is designed directly from the normal and dynamic operating data. Then, fault detection and isolation are further realized by evaluating the generated residuals. ::: The proposed diagnosis strategies have been verified using the experimental data which cover a set of representative faults and different PEMFC stacks.

Previous works on acoustic modeling of speech signals such as Random Forests (RFs) of Phonetic Decision Trees (PDTs) has produced significant improvements in recognition accuracy. In this dissertation, several new approaches of using data sampling to construct an Ensemble of Acoustic Models (EAM) for speech recognition are proposed. A straightforward method of data sampling is Cross Validation (CV) data partition. In the direction of improving inter-model diversity within an EAM for speaker independent speech recognition, we propose Speaker Clustering (SC) based data sampling and develop two algorithms, including the Likelihood based Speaker Clustering (LSC) and speaker model Distance based Speaker Clustering (DSC). In the direction of improving base model quality as well as inter-model diversity, we further investigate the effects of several successful techniques of single model training in speech recognition on the proposed ensemble acoustic models, including Cross Validation Expectation Maximization (CVEM), Discriminative Training (DT), and Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP) features. We also propose using an ensemble of Multiple models with Different Mixture Sizes (MDMS) to improve EAM quality. We have evaluated the proposed methods on TIMIT speaker-independent phoneme recognition task as well as on a telemedicine automatic captioning task of speaker-dependent continuous speech recognition. The proposed EAMs have led to significant improvements in recognition accuracy over conventional Hidden Markov Model (HMM) baseline systems, and the integration of ensemble acoustic models with CVEM, DT and MLP has also significantly improved the accuracy performances of CVEM, DT, and MLP based single model systems. We further investigated the largely unstudied factor of inter-model diversity, and proposed several methods to explicit measure inter-model diversity. We demonstrate a positive relation between enlarging inter-model diversity and increasing EAM quality. ::: HMM-based acoustic models built from data sampling EAM are generally very large, especially when a large number of models or full covariance matrices are used for Gaussian densities. Therefore, compacting the acoustic model to a reasonable size for practical applications while maintaining a reasonable performance is needed. Toward this goal, in this dissertation, we discuss and investigate several distance measures and algorithms for clustering methods. The distance measures include Entropy, KL, Bhattacharyya, Chernoff and their weighted versions. For clustering algorithms, besides the conventional greedy agglomerative clustering, algorithms such as N-Best distance Refinement (NBR), K-step LookAhead (KLA), Breadth-First Search (BFS) are proposed. Experiments on the TIMIT task have shown that in comparison with the original EAM model, the compacted models using the clustering methods can maintain the model accuracy, while the size of the compacted model is largely decreased. Experiments in compacting EAM on a Pashto ASR task have shown that the proposed clustering methods can lead to better quality than the conventional clustering methods. ::: Unlike the implicit PDT based states tying that has been used in most ASR systems as well as in the recent RF based PDTs, explicit PDT (EPDT) state tying that allows Phoneme data Sharing (PS) is considered for its potential capability in capturing pronunciation variations. The ensemble approach of combining multiple acoustic models is applied to the EPDT, where a combination of explicit PDT and implicit PDT models has been investigated to reduce phone confusions.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.32469/10355/14395", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "641652987", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55584087"}

In this paper, we assume that visually similar concepts should share resembled detectors. Based on the assumption, Collaborative Learning is proposed, to incorporate cross-concept collaborations into the joint learning of similar detectors over related concepts. Besides the collaborations, different concepts should also perform discriminations for classifying each other. To benefit from different trade-offs between collaboration and discrimination, we propose Multi-Granularity Boosting strategy, where each granularity corresponds to a specific balance between collaboration and discrimination for Collaborative Learning.

GANs are a framework for learning a generative model using a system of two neural networks competing with each other. One network generates synthetic images from random input vectors, and the other discriminates between synthetic and real images. The motivation of this study is to create new fonts using the GAN framework while maintaining style consistency over all characters. In GlyphGAN, the input vector for the generator network consists of two vectors: character class vector and style vector.

Classification of motor imagery tasks for BMIs is the crucial part. Classification accuracy not only depends on how accurate and robust the classifier is; it is also about data.

If a feature provides large interclass difference for different classes, immunity to random noise and chaotic behavior of EEG signal is rationally conformed, which means the applied feature is suitable for classifying EEG signals.

In this sense, feature selection is a very important aspect of the analysis helping in the tasks of identifying relevant genes and also for maximizing predictive information.MethodsDue to its simplicity and speed, Stepwise Forward Selection (SFS) is a widely used feature selection technique. In this work, we carry a comparative study of SFS and Genetic Algorithms (GA) as general frameworks for the analysis of microarray data with the aim of identifying group of genes with high predictive capability and biological relevance. Six standard and machine learning-based techniques (Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), C-MANTEC Constructive Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Multilayer perceptron (MLP)) are used within both frameworks using six free-public datasets for the task of predicting cancer outcome.ResultsBetter cancer outcome prediction results were obtained using the GA framework noting that this approach, in comparison to the SFS one, leads to a larger selection set, uses a large number of comparison between genetic profiles and thus it is computationally more intensive. Also the GA framework permitted to obtain a set of genes that can be considered to be more biologically relevant. Regarding the different classifiers used standard feedforward neural networks (MLP), LDA and SVM lead to similar and best results, while C-MANTEC and k-NN followed closely but with a lower accuracy. Further, C-MANTEC, MLP and LDA permitted to obtain a more limited set of genes in comparison to SVM, NB and kNN, and in particular C-MANTEC resulted in the most robust classifier in terms of changes in the parameter settings.ConclusionsThis study shows that if prediction accuracy is the objective, the GA-based approach lead to better results respect to the SFS approach, independently of the classifier used. Regarding classifiers, even if C-MANTEC did not achieve the best overall results, the performance was competitive with a very robust behaviour in terms of the parameters of the algorithm, and thus it can be considered as a candidate technique for future studies.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4108856", "pubmed_id": "25077572", "doi": "10.1186/1742-4682-11-S1-S7", "venue": "Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling", "journal": "Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2167761375", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["22184619", "20471599", "13308907", "15403192", "30067953", "5722282", "14585308", "1774892", "16607126", "22681321", "35447605", "16674801", "42701428", "8173279", "17104906", "198489576", "206764015", "7997921", "16448508", "18280514", "17456775", "14527240", "7649812", "788417", "1955614", "20093929", "35232059", "23975664", "11340945", "22203106", "207726773", "10067693", "45359377", "7662476", "2914506", "17802209", "2698713", "14748656", "1701962", "29867198"], "inbound_citations": ["54203416", "595527", "54918887", "57765615"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10043122"}

Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the new kernel and show that it outperforms existing kernels when applied to classifying non-coding RNA sequences.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "18402042", "doi": "10.1504/IJDMB.2006.009921", "venue": "International journal of data mining and bioinformatics", "journal": "International journal of data mining and bioinformatics", "mag_id": "2076841418", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["286975", "53365207", "15321550", "30086777", "2016816", "14037841", "17396551", "15305914", "1224662", "24850886", "18855825", "6030279", "11435867", "15272547"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25435267"}

Previous research has demonstrated the benefit of incorporating social media data in identifying food establishments that may be in violation of food safety standards. This project focuses on the 2018 Yelp Dataset Challenge and food inspection data from Toronto's DineSafe program. These disparate data are merged and aggregated in an effort to offer new techniques for prioritizing the inspections that the DineSafe program administers. Following a detailed review of the existing literature, the paper follows the Cross Industry Standard Practice for Data Mining, focusing first on the business definition of the problem and an approach for merging and aggregating this kind of information. To extract features in downstream modeling, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is applied and extracts a number of topics through six variations of LDA models. The resulting 750 topics are narrowed down to a smaller set of features through a modified application of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) \u2013 or rather rounds of RFE. Random Forests are applied on each of the topic model sets and evaluated using an out-of-time test set. After exploring the issues with this approach, the business case is modified and a new round of improved models are generated and evaluated. Finally, the paper ends with one final set of models that combines all the features, which results in the best performing models. This thesis ends with a discussion of the lessons learned and provides some ideas for further research.%%%% ::: \"Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirement for the Degree of Master of Science in Data Mining.\"; Thesis advisor: Roger Bilisoly.; M.S.,Central Connecticut State University,2019;", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2969746491", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201877365"}

Since existing methods for estimation of class membership probability are designed for binary classification, in which only a single score outputted from a classifier can be used, an approach for multiclass classification requires both a decomposition of a multiclass classifier into binary classifiers and a combination of estimates obtained from each binary classifier to a target estimate. We propose a simple and general method for directly estimating class membership probability for any class in multiclass classification without decomposition and combination, using multiple scores not only for a predicted class but also for other proper classes. To make it possible to use multiple scores, we propose to modify or extend representative existing methods. As a non-parametric method, which refers to the idea of a binning method as proposed by Zadrozny et al., we create an \u201caccuracy table\u201d by a different method. Moreover we smooth accuracies on the table with methods such as the moving average to yield reliable probabilities (accuracies). As a parametric method, we extend Platt\u2019s method to apply a multiple logistic regression. On two different datasets (open-ended data from Japanese social surveys and the 20 Newsgroups) both with Support Vector Machines and naive Bayes classifiers, we empirically show that the use of multiple scores is effective in the estimation of class membership probabilities in multiclass classification in terms of cross entropy, the reliability diagram, the ROC curve and AUC (area under the ROC curve), and that the proposed smoothing method for the accuracy table works quite well. Finally, we show empirically that in terms of MSE (mean squared error), our best proposed method is superior to an expansion for multiclass classification of a PAV method proposed by Zadrozny et al., in both the 20 Newsgroups dataset and the Pendigits dataset, but is slightly worse than the state-of-the-art method, which is an expansion for multiclass classification of a combination of boosting and a PAV method, on the Pendigits dataset.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10115-008-0165-z", "venue": "Knowledge and Information Systems", "journal": "Knowledge and Information Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2005386510", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["59849738", "14738369", "207158152", "9510963", "6176762", "17787336", "6737131", "2427083", "207159138", "57961414", "30766228", "207158152", "1167373", "686980", "17079108", "7045906", "56563878", "13300374", "9680336", "120777430", "1713753", "41435595", "3045000", "28637672", "2367747", "9594071", "3094990", "9192680", "3349576"], "inbound_citations": ["1765386", "4590722", "59459651", "21323028", "3923374"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43033583"}

Since these two objectives are conflicting, a typical result stands in a set of Pareto-efficient subsets, each having a different cardinality and a corresponding discriminating power. However, this approach overlooks the fact that, for a given cardinality, there can be several subsets with similar information content. The study reported here addresses this problem, and introduces a novel multiobjective feature selection approach conceived to identify: 1) a subset that maximizes the performance of a given classifier and 2) a set of subsets that are quasi equally informative, i.e., have almost same classification performance, to the performance maximizing subset. The approach consists of a wrapper [Wrapper for Quasi Equally Informative Subset Selection (W-QEISS)] built on the formulation of a four-objective optimization problem, which is aimed at maximizing the accuracy of a classifier, minimizing the number of features, and optimizing two entropy-based measures of relevance and redundancy. This allows conducting the search in a larger space, thus enabling the wrapper to generate a large number of Pareto-efficient solutions. The algorithm is compared against the mRMR algorithm, a two-objective wrapper and a computationally efficient filter [Filter for Quasi Equally Informative Subset Selection (F-QEISS)] on 24 University of California, Irvine, (UCI) datasets including both binary and multiclass classification. Experimental results show that W-QEISS has the capability of evolving a rich and diverse set of Pareto-efficient solutions, and that their availability helps in: 1) studying the tradeoff between multiple measures of classification performance and 2) understanding the relative importance of each feature.

Then useful features containing leak severity information are extracted from multi-domain components of the acoustic signals. Moreover, for leak detection and severity classification, the Relief-F algorithm is applied to select the most discriminative features. Furthermore, selected features are used as the input of SVM classifiers to identify the leak severity of gas pipelines. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using laboratory experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy of 99.4% to determine the leak state and non-leak state by using the first three most discriminative features and 95.6% to classify the normal and several leak severity conditions by using the first five most discriminative features.

Each shape is represented by an analytic decision function obtained by training SVM, with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel so that the interior shape points are given higher values. This empowers support vector shape (SVS) with multifold advantages. First, the representation uses a sparse subset of feature points determined by the support vectors, which significantly improves the discriminative power against noise, fragmentation, and other artifacts that often come with the data. Second, the use of the RBF kernel provides scale, rotation, and translation invariant features, and allows any shape to be represented accurately regardless of its complexity.

Digital video forensic is used as an important tool to detect video forgery. Compression history of a video is analyzed to carry out temporal forensics of motion-compensated video such as MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.263, H.264. Wang and Farid demonstrated that double MPEG compression can detect temporal fingerprints of video forgery, by visually inspecting I-frame prediction error sequence (PES) in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) domain. This method is prone to human error and can be stressful while analyzing large number of videos. In order to overcome the drawback of this method, here we propose a novel technique to automatically detect video forgery using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and support vector machine (SVM). A new statistical parameter \u201c\u03b3\u201d related to the difference vector of first-level DWT coarse and detail sub-bands is used for the automatic detection of temporal attacks. Here, we use SVM, which is an effective and efficient classification tool to analyze/recognize data patterns.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are the defence molecules of the host gaining extensive attention worldwide as these are natural alternative to chemical antibiotics. Machine learning techniques have capabilities to analyse large biological data for detection of hidden pattern in understanding complex underlying biological problems. Presently, development of resistance to chemical antibiotics in cattle is unsolved and growing problem which needs immediate attention.

It was found that best SVM models in this case for C-terminus residues, N-terminus residues and full sequence were with kernels Radial Basis Function (RBF), Sigmoid and RBF with accuracy as 95%, 99% and 97%, respectively. These SVM models were implemented on web server and made available to users at http://cabin.iasri.res.in/amp/ for classification/prediction of novel AMPs of cattle.

The advancement of structural inspection technologies and tools has produced a huge amount of corrosion data. Unfortunately, available corrosion data are still under-utilized. Complicated assessment code, and manual analysis which is tedious and error prone has overburdened pipeline operators. Moreover, the current practices produce a negative corrosion growth data defying the nature of corrosion progress, and consuming a lot of computational time during the reliability assessment. Therefore, this research proposes a computational based automated pipeline corrosion data assessment that provides complete assessment in terms of statistical and computational. The purpose is to improve the quality of corrosion data as well as performance of reliability simulation. To accomplish this, .Net framework and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) language is used for an automated matching procedure. The alleviation of deterministic value in corrosion data is gained by using statistical analysis. The corrosion growth rate prediction and comparison is utilized using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. Artificial Chemical Reaction Optimization Algorithm (ACROA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Differential Evolution (DE) model is used to improve the reliability simulation based on the matched and predicted corrosion data. A computational based automated pipeline corrosion data assessment is successfully experimented using multiple In-Line Inspection (ILI) data from the same pipeline structure. The corrosion data sampling produced by the automated matching is consistent compared to manual sampling with the advantage of timeliness and elimination of tedious process. The computational corrosion growth prediction manages to reduce uncertainties and negative rate in corrosion data with SVM prediction is superior compared to A ^N . The performance value of reliability simulation by ACROA outperformed the PSO and DE models which show an applicability of computational optimization models in pipeline reliability assessment.

This work proposes an evolutionary multi-objective ensemble learning (EMOEL) technique which uses extreme learning machines (ELMs) as base predictors due to its highly recognized efficacy. EMOEL employs evolutionary multi-objective optimization to search for the optimal parameters of the model as well as the optimal features fed into the model subjected to two conflicting criteria, i.e., accuracy and diversity. It leads to a Pareto front composed of non-dominated optimal solutions where each solution depicts the number of hidden neurons in the ELM, the selected channels in the multivariate time series, the selected feature extraction methods and the selected time windows applied to the selected channels. The optimal solutions in the Pareto front stand for different end-to-end prediction models which may lead to different prediction results. To boost ultimate prediction accuracy, the models with respect to these optimal solutions are linearly combined with combination coefficients being optimized via an evolutionary algorithm.

In addition, for the first time a single state Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Galerkin Projection based reduced order model is combined with Dynamic Programming for its high accuracy and low computation cost. For a transient driving cycle, Dynamic Programming algorithm is utilized to generate the optimal working fluid pump speed. A total of eleven state-of-art machine learning algorithms are screened to predict this pump speed. Random Forest algorithm is then selected for its best pump speed prediction accuracy. A rule-based method is added to the Random Forest model to improve energy recovery. As one of the main discoveries in this study, in the rule extraction process, the Random Forest model reveals that the time delayed exhaust gas mass flow rate and exhaust temperature improve the rule extraction accuracy. This observation points out the difference between steady state and transient optimization and that the steady state optimization results do not necessarily hold true in transient conditions. Another key observation is that Random Forest \u2013 rule-based method retrieves 97.2% of the energy recovered by offline Dynamic Programming in a validation driving cycle.

If failure cannot be detected and eliminated in time and accurately, it can cause serious consequences. As diffusion mapping can keep manifold structure between data, it can be used to reduce the dimension of data. The diffusion distance is robust to noise as it is an average over all paths connecting two points. In view of the non-linear characteristics of the chemical process data and the noise interference in the process of data acquisition, diffusion mapping is investigated. The Gaussian kernel function is used in the diffusion maps to measure the similarity between the sample points. In order to measure the similarity between samples accurately, a metric learning method based on Mahalanobis distance is proposed. The goal of the algorithm is to learn a Mahalanobis matrix such that the distances of the point pairs with the same type are as small as possible, while those with the different type are as large as possible. Then a more accurate weight matrix is obtained to improve fault detection. Since SVM has the good generalization performance, and is specially good for treating the data of some nonlinearity.

To accelerate the training of SVM, a Sequential Minimal Optimization Method (SMO) is adopted. The results of using a kernel-PTSV for pedestrian tracking from real time video are shown at the end. Comparative experimental results showed that PTSV improves the reliability of tracking compared to that of traditional tracking method using optical flow.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "14663860", "doi": "10.1007/BF02839320", "venue": "Journal of Zhejiang University.

Currently, workload prediction has become a promising tool to facilitate automatic scaling of resource management, and thus reducing the cost and improving resource utilization in the cloud. Most current predication methods of workload are based on a single model. However, because the network traffics are usually mixed and inseparable, it is hard to get the satisfactory prediction performance by means of a single model. To solve this problem, an adaptive approach for work load prediction is proposed in this paper. This approach firstly categorizes the workloads into different classes which are automatically assigned for different prediction models according to workload features. Furthermore, the workload classification problem is transformed into a task assignment one by establishing a mixed 01 integer programming model, and an online solution is provided. We used Google Cluster trace to evaluate the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the platform cumulative relative prediction errors by 29.06%, 8.42% and 40.86% respectively in comparison with the time-series prediction methods (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Linear Regression (LR).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jnca.2016.12.017", "venue": "J.

In order to predict coal demand scientifically and accurately, firstly, the index system of influencing factors of coal demand was constructed, and the grey relational analysis method was used to select key indicators as input variables of the model. Then, the kernel function of SVM (support vector machine) was optimized by taking advantage of the fast convergence speed of GSA (gravitational search algorithm), and the memory function and boundary mutation strategy of PSO (particle swarm optimization) were introduced to improve the gravitational search algorithm, and the improved GSA (IGSA)\u2013SVM prediction model was obtained.

This research work proposes an efficient intelligent communication-based protection algorithm that implements different multi-functional protection principles supported by blocking schemes. The real-time organization of both the hardware architecture and communication infrastructure of the protection algorithm is illustrated in detail.

During feature extraction, Scale Invariant Feature Transform descriptors are computed from patches over detected face region.

The difficulty in training a face pattern classifier as face detector is due to the diversity and complexity of non face patterns compared with face patterns. In this paper, we propose a subspace method for downsizing the training space via template matching filtering. Two types of templates, eyes in whole and face itself from an average face of a set of mugshot photos, are used in template matching for coarse filtration. Only when both eyes in whole template matching and face template matching are over corresponding thresholds, a candidate window is regarded as in the subspace. In this template matching constrained subspace, a bootstrap method is used to collect non face samples for SVM training, which greatly reduces the complexity of training SVM. The face detector SVM is trained by John Platt's Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm. During the detection procedure, an image and its scaled images are scanned, each candidate window will first be evaluated by both eyes in whole template matching and face template matching, and when both are over corresponding thresholds that candidate will be passed to the SVM classifier for the final decision. The detection results over all scales are then merged into final face detection output by way of fusion that keeps only the maximum one when overlap happens. In this way the training becomes much easier and the speed is improved to be used in practical applications. Experimental results with very promising performance compared with some well known existing detectors on both test sets of our own and the CMU's test set demonstrate its effectiveness.", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Chinese Journal of Computers", "mag_id": "2386511883", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["18086191", "207944063", "16909692", "11004969", "1787258", "16044438", "62751833", "128416508", "25267686", "15781270", "15687723", "14464365", "3161790"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208021536"}

The core of this method is a novel measure of variable importance, which is an enhancement of the so-called \u201cconditional permutation importance\u201d (CPI). In CPI, the importance of an input variable is measured by the expected increase of a random forest (RF)\u2019s prediction error when such variable is randomly permuted within certain groups of observations. While CPI obtains these groups from the stochastic recursive partitions that the RF carries out on the input space, our measure relies on a new approach that groups observations by means of a special form of clustering, which optimally leverages the structure of dependences existing between input variables. We show that our measure can be effectively used to recursively eliminate both unimportant and redundant input variables.

In recent years, several works have adopted deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for building extraction, since they produce rich features that are invariant against lighting conditions, shadows, etc. Although several advances have been made, building extraction from aerial imagery still presents multiple challenges. Most of the deep learning segmentation methods optimize the per-pixel loss with respect to the ground truth without knowledge of the context. This often leads to imperfect outputs that may lead to missing or unrefined regions. In this work, we propose a novel loss function combining both adversarial and cross-entropy losses that learn to understand both local and global contexts for semantic segmentation. The newly proposed loss function deployed on the DeepLab v3+ network obtains state-of-the-art results on the Massachusetts buildings dataset. The loss function improves the structure and refines the edges of buildings without requiring any of the commonly used post-processing methods, such as Conditional Random Fields. We also perform ablation studies to understand the impact of the adversarial loss. Finally, the proposed method achieves a relaxed F1 score of 95.59% on the Massachusetts buildings dataset compared to the previous best F1 of 94.88%.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2001.04269", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3000070006", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["7275092", "15510652", "17942810", "56507745", "206597918", "3719281", "1033682", "15095719", "60470372", "52942558", "126799802", "51870338", "1743316", "16991836", "52161643", "3638670", "9433631", "5299559", "206594692", "5808102", "49213112"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210164514"}

In this study, we propose new features derived from speech spectrogram using image processing techniques for emotion recognition. For this purpose, variogram graphs are calculated from speech spectrogram. The significant Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of variogram are used as proposed features. The contribution of these features as a complementary for the widely used prosodic and spectral features is also investigated. The feature selection is performed using Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) filtering method. Finally, a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is employed. All results are achieved under the 10 fold cross-validation on the Berlin and PDREC speech databases. Our results show that combining the proposed features with prosodic and spectral features significantly improves the classification accuracy. For Berlin database, when the proposed features were added to the prosodic and spectral ones, the recognition rates were improved from 83.18% and 89.36% to 86.82% and 90.43% for females and males, respectively. Also, on the PDREC, combining the proposed features with the prosodic and spectral features improve the recognition rate of females and males by 3.72% and 0.27%, respectively.

Following a recent stream of works on formal robustness verification of (deep) neural networks, our approach relies on a sound abstract version of a given SVM classifier to be used for checking its robustness. This methodology is parametric on a given numerical abstraction of real values and, analogously to the case of neural networks, needs neither abstract least upper bounds nor widening operators on this abstraction. The standard interval domain provides a simple instantiation of our abstraction technique, which is enhanced with the domain of reduced affine forms, an efficient abstraction of the zonotope abstract domain. This robustness verification technique has been fully implemented and experimentally evaluated on SVMs based on linear and nonlinear (polynomial and radial basis function) kernels, which have been trained on the popular MNIST dataset of images and on the recent and more challenging Fashion-MNIST dataset. The experimental results of our prototype SVM robustness verifier appear to be encouraging: this automated verification is fast, scalable and shows significantly high percentages of provable robustness on the test set of MNIST, in particular compared to the analogous provable robustness of neural networks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1904.11803", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-32304-2_14", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2941105184,2981347768", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["127982021", "18666561", "2649314", "2893830", "961425", "207614632", "14727192", "1931807", "9641003", "206579396", "49404476", "6706414", "49430666", "18145624", "15874442", "11626373", "16290131", "516928", "9059612", "14542261", "33033789", "253329", "125129490", "51872670", "9046405", "10659969", "1679726", "15573213", "53960414", "57757287", "8752887", "59770487", "2431872", "39159893", "52100908", "13745458", "13750928", "579561", "702279", "3118889", "54569363", "3513418", "6637466"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135464475"}

This growing observational capacity has also highlighted the need for research efforts aimed at exploring the potential offered by data processing methods and algorithms, in order to exploit as much as possible this invaluable space-based data source. The work herein presented concerns an application study on the process of urban sprawl conducted with the use of satellite ASTER data. The selected test site is highly significant, being it a coastal zone (with the presence of sand and rocks) characterized by a fragmented ecosystem and small towns, with an increasing rate of urbanization and soil consumption. In order to produce synthetic maps of urban areas, ASTER images were classified using two automatic classifiers, Maximum Likelihood (MLC) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) applied by changing setting parameters, with the aim to compare their respective performances in terms of robustness, speed and accuracy. All process steps have been developed integrating Geographical Information System and Remote Sensing, and adopting free and open source software. Results pointed out that the SVM classifier with RBF kernel was generally the best choice (with accuracy higher than 90%) among all the configurations compared, and the use of multiple bands globally improves classification. One of the critical elements found in this case study is given by the presence of sand and sand mixed with rocks. The use of different configurations for the SVMs, i.e. different kernels and values of the setting parameters, allowed us to calibrate the classifier also to cope with a specific need, as in our case, to achieve a reliable discrimination of sand from urban area.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.05.005", "venue": "Ecol.

Results demonstrated that Thermal image-based NSSI (TI-NSSI) had the best correlations with all the measured crop biophysical parameters than the visible image (VI-NSSI). However, the r2 decreased with an increase in moisture stress. Among the different biophysical parameters tested in this study, TI-NSSI showed the highest significant negative correlation (\u22120.962***) with Radiation use efficiency (RUE).

Early IR theory considered both the presence or absence of all terms in the lexicon for ranking and needed to weight them all. Yet, as the size of lexicons grew and models became too complex, common weighting models preferred to aggregate only the weights of the query terms that are matched in candidate documents. Thus, unmatched term contribution in these models is only considered indirectly, such as in probability smoothing with corpus distribution, or in weight normalization by document length. In this work we propose a novel term weighting model that directly assesses the weights of unmatched terms, and show its benefits. Specifically, we propose a Learning To Rank framework, in which features corresponding to matched terms are also \"mirrored\" in similar features that account only for unmatched terms. The relative importance of each feature is learned via a click-through query log. As a test case, we consider vertical search in Community-based Question Answering(CQA) sites from Web queries. Queries that result in viewing CQA content often contain fine grained information needs and benefit more from unmatched term weighting. We assess our model both via manual evaluation and via automatic evaluation over a clickthrough log.

Such models provide a useful computational framework in which to explore the nature of normal and impaired cognitive processes. The current work extends the relevance of connectionist modeling in neuropsychology to address issues in cognitive rehabilitation: the degree and speed of recovery through retraining, the extent to which improvement on treated items generalizes to untreated items, and how treated items are selected to maximize this generalization. A network previously shown to model impairments in mapping orthography to semantics was retrained after damage. The degree of relearning and generalization depended on the location of the lesion and had interesting implications for understanding the nature and variability of recovery in patients. In a second simulation, retraining on words whose semantics are atypical of their category yielded more generalization than retraining on more typical words, suggesting a counterintuitive strategy for selecting items in patient therapy to maximize recovery.

Based on the results from training data, the authors developed a novel hybrid clinical entity extraction system, which integrated heuristic rule-based modules with the ML-base named entity recognition module. The authors applied the hybrid system to the concept extraction and assertion classification tasks in the challenge and evaluated its performance using a test data set with 477 annotated notes. ::: ::: Measurements Standard measures including precision, recall, and F-measure were calculated using the evaluation script provided by the Center of Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside/VA challenge organizers. The overall performance for all three types of clinical entities and all six types of assertions across 477 annotated notes were considered as the primary metric in the challenge. ::: ::: Results and discussion Systematic evaluation on the training set showed that Conditional Random Fields outperformed Support Vector Machines, and semantic information from existing natural-language-processing systems largely improved performance, although contributions from different types of features varied.

It is known that the performance of conventional ELM is not robust due to random weight selection in the hidden layer. Thus, we propose a Clustering-based WS-ELM (CWS-ELM) that deterministically assigns weights by utilising clustering algorithms i.e. k-means clustering and support vector clustering.

First, the randomly selected patches are measured and sorted by the meticulously designed patch-sorted strategy, which adopts instance-based prototypes learning. Then the sorted patches are delivered to a well-designed dual-sparse autoencoder to obtain desired weights in each layer. Convolutional neural network is followed to extract high-level spatial and structural features. At last, the features are fed to a linear support vector machine to generate predicted labels. The experimental results in three broad SAR images of different satellites confirm the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

This algorithm processes in four stages. First, Otsu image segmentation algorithm is initially applied on images. Next, morphological filtering by combining erosion and dilation operations is computed to eliminate unwanted noises such as light reflections on the insulator model. Afterwards, connected components on filtered image are labelled enabling the calculations of four important morphological indicators consisting in the number of the connected labeled components (\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd) and the number of pixels, the length and the width of the largest connected component region (\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, L and W respectively).

The hyperplane is determined by a subset of the points of the two classes, named support vectors, and has a number of interesting theoretical properties. In this paper, we use linear SVMs for 3D object recognition. We illustrate the potential of SVMs on a database of 7200 images of 100 different objects.

A two-stage DPVS capacity estimation approach based on support vector machine with customer net load curve features is proposed in this paper.

Second, a bootstrap-support vector regression (SVR) based DPVS capacity estimation (DPVSCE) model with the input features describing the difference of daily total PV power generation between DPVSs with different capacities is proposed to further estimate the specific capacity of the detected DPVS.

In this study, a method based on Hybrid Kernel Function-Support Vector Regression (HKF\u2013SVR) whose parameters are optimized by Krill Herd (KH) algorithm was introduced for bearing performance degradation prediction in this situation. First, multi-domain statistical features are extracted from the bearing vibration signals and then fused into sensitive features using Kernel Joint Approximate Diagonalization of Eigen-matrices (KJADE) algorithm which is developed recently by our group. Due to the nonlinear mapping capability of the kernel method and the blind source separation ability of the JADE algorithm, the KJADE could extract latent source features that accurately reflecting the performance degradation from the mixed vibration signal. Then, the between-class and within-class scatters (SS) of the health-stage data sample and the current monitored data sample is calculated as the performance degradation index. Second, the parameters of the HKF\u2013SVR are optimized by the KH (Krill Herd) algorithm to obtain the optimal performance degradation prediction model. Finally, the performance degradation trend of the bearing is predicted using the optimized HKF\u2013SVR.

However, nature inspired algorithms have to compute the fitness of individuals (candidate classification rules) over successive generations repeatedly. Each fitness computation requires scanning the training data. Since the database scan is computationally expensive operation, the execution time for nature inspired algorithms for discovering classification rules grows unreasonably faster for bulky datasets. This paper proposes a novel fitness computation framework for nature inspire algorithms by using a list structure. The indices of instances, covered by every possible attribute-value pair with respect to each class in the training data, are stored in the suggested list structure. The list is prepared only once in advance and stores all information to compute the fitness of any rule that may come up in the life time of the nature inspired algorithm. The existence of the pre-maintained list eliminates the need of scanning training data again and again for fitness computation. We have conducted experiments on 12 datasets from UCI machine learning repository. The results show that the suggested fitness computational framework brings significant speed gain without compromising predictive accuracy.

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate performances of forecasting stock markets by data from Google Trends, historical trading data (HTD), and hybrid data. The keywords employed for Google Trends are collected from three different ways including users' definitions (GTU), trending searches of Google Trends (GTTS), and tweets (GTT) correspondingly. The hybrid data include Internet search trends from Google Trends and historical trading data. In addition, the correlation-based feature selection (CFS) technique is used to select independent variables, and one-step ahead policy is adopted by the least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) for predicting stock markets. Numerical experiments indicate that using hybrid data can provide more accurate forecasting results than using single historical trading data or data from Google Trends.

ILP has been used in both industrial and scientific complex and relevant problems. ILP aims at a formal framework as well as practical algorithms for inductive learning of relational descriptions in the form of logic programs. ILP inherits the sound theoretical basis from Logic Programming and the experimental approach and operation towards practical algorithms from Machine Learning. ILP is an exciting field of research, still showing a good margin for progress. There is a wide range of lines of research to overcome current shortcomings of existing ILP systems. It is common practise that when researching on a new technique the researcher has to develop his own system or spend a considerable amount of time studying the implementation details of an existing system in order to evaluate his new techniques. Since the initial conceptual proposal of Inductive Logic Programming many ILP systems have been developed. Around 100 ILP systems have been developed to date. Thus, it is natural to find the many techniques that have been proposed to improve the efficiency of ILP systems scattered among many systems. Having an integrated framework, containing the most interesting techniques of ILP in a modular architecture should be interesting for the progress on the area, by providing practitioners and curious users with an easier way to experiment on the area and to test new techniques in a relatively straightforward way. The work reported in this document aims to propose a tool to include all major relevant techniques for the development of ILP systems. The tool is based on a modular architecture of the system and permits the assemblage of new ILP systems by just combining modules. By choosing different sets of modules the user may construct different types of ILP systems. We have also developed and implemented in the tool a new parallel algorithm.

Some of the audio features that were analyzed include Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC).

Additionally, statistical features were extracted from the audio samples to generate the proposed HAR model.

A desirable feature of this process is the automation, avoiding the user dependence and the inter-rater variability. This work aims to find an effective segmentation method that allows the IMT measurement in an automatic way. Following this idea, this paper proposes an effective approach based on learning machines.

Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation is essential to a spacecraft as the battery is a critical part and determines the lifetime and reliability. The Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is a data-driven algorithm used to estimate a battery\u2019s RUL due to its sparse feature and uncertainty management capability. Especially, some of the regressive cases indicate that the RVM can obtain a better short-term prediction performance rather than long-term prediction. As a nonlinear kernel learning algorithm, the coefficient matrix and relevance vectors are fixed once the RVM training is conducted. Moreover, the RVM can be simply influenced by the noise with the training data. Thus, this work proposes an iterative updated approach to improve the long-term prediction performance for a battery\u2019s RUL prediction. Firstly, when a new estimator is output by the RVM, the Kalman filter is applied to optimize this estimator with a physical degradation model. Then, this optimized estimator is added into the training set as an on-line sample, the RVM model is re-trained, and the coefficient matrix and relevance vectors can be dynamically adjusted to make next iterative prediction.

Inductive logic programming techniques are typically more expressive but also less efficient. Therefore, the data sets handled by current inductive logic programming systems are small according to general standards within the data mining community. The main source of inefficiency lies in the assumption that several examples may be related to each other, so they cannot be handled independently. ::: Within the learning from interpretations framework for inductive logic programming this assumption is unnecessary, which allows to scale up existing ILP algorithms. In this paper we explain this learning setting in the context of relational databases. We relate the setting to propositional data mining and to the classical ILP setting, and show that learning from interpretations corresponds to learning from multiple relations and thus extends the expressiveness of propositional learning, while maintaining its efficiency to a large extent (which is not the case in the classical ILP setting). ::: As a case study, we present two alternative implementations of the ILP system Tilde (Top-down Induction of Logical DEcision trees): Tilde-classic, which loads all data in main memory, and Tilde-LDS, which loads the examples one by one. We experimentally compare the implementations, showing Tilde-LDS can handle large data sets (in the order of 100,000 examples or 100 MB) and indeed scales up linearly in the number of examples.", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": "cs/0011044", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1023/A:1009867806624", "venue": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 3(1), pp. 59-93, 1999", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1501498539,2953272728", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["36095119", "957873", "1341209", "13227504", "61139322", "15572728", "60993494", "214979", "16334652", "17552456", "45461462", "62691124", "2352573", "18145925", "7398727", "2527609", "12395063", "60157394", "18718011", "14132514", "11777681", "18381501", "5446282", "9380408", "8268690", "1613369", "12643399", "16762143", "27884159", "13252401", "62688491", "16455032", "1915028", "15544052", "43313320", "8439889", "15960428"], "inbound_citations": ["17390832", "32239295", "18092333", "13479168", "121181935", "153314697", "2639925", "12279074", "8271388", "14356458", "700775", "12615546", "15088135", "207057116", "2450094", "17614743", "77394554", "56297574", "54742795", "14166466", "15916665", "9589771", "73611514", "9394000", "7048228", "19154821", "661617", "5328978", "15100363", "40159517", "14592642", "4770363", "9590385", "18329777", "13457869", "5106153", "15487382", "3557158", "55108561", "15139976", "10305007", "629935", "2426458", "52224448", "6846966", "2534946", "920137", "6604755", "8969134", "13946943", "7572680", "15654174", "19007235", "7872969", "7255871", "15615156", "14196496", "5655619", "14984537", "11833703", "2750365", "10307315", "5647990"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3205873"}

A large volume of natural language texts is being generated by users in various forms, such as search queries, documents, and social media posts. As the unstructured text corpus is usually noisy and messy, it becomes imperative to correctly identify and accurately annotate structured information in order to obtain meaningful insights or better understand unstructured texts. On the other hand, the existing structured information, which embodies our knowledge such as entity or concept relations, often suffers from incompleteness or quality-related issues. Given a gigantic collection of texts which offers rich semantic information, it is also important to harness the massiveness of the unannotated text corpus to expand and refine existing structured knowledge with fewer annotation efforts. ::: In this dissertation, I will introduce principles, models, and algorithms for effective structured knowledge discovery from the massive text corpus. We are generally interested in obtaining insights and better understanding unstructured texts with the help of structured annotations or by structure-aware modeling. Also, given the existing structured knowledge, we are interested in expanding its scale and improving its quality harnessing the massiveness of the text corpus.

We preset a novel intelligent visual sensor for tracking-by-detection with simultaneous pose estimation. Essentially, we adapt an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to work not only with the detections of the vehicles but also with their estimated coarse viewpoints, directly obtained with the vision sensor. We show that enhancing the tracking with observations of the vehicle pose, results in a better estimation of the vehicles trajectories. For the simultaneous object detection and viewpoint estimation task, we present and evaluate two independent solutions. One is based on a fast GPU implementation of a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) detector with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). For the second, we adequately modify and train the Faster R-CNN deep learning model, in order to recover from it not only the object localization but also an estimation of its pose. Finally, we publicly release a challenging dataset, the GRAM Road Traffic Monitoring (GRAM-RTM), which has been especially designed for evaluating multi-vehicle tracking approaches within the context of traffic monitoring applications. It comprises more than 700 unique vehicles annotated across more than 40.300 frames of three videos. We expect the GRAM-RTM becomes a benchmark in vehicle detection and tracking, providing the computer vision and intelligent transportation systems communities with a standard set of images, annotations and evaluation procedures for multi-vehicle tracking. We present a thorough experimental evaluation of our approaches with the GRAM-RTM, which will be useful for establishing further comparisons.

This paper proposes a combination of Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) for ECG beat classification. We have used MIT-BIH arrhythmia database for data collection and prepared three different datasets. Features, such as R peak sample number and QRS complex, are extracted using Pan-Tompkins algorithm.

From the experimental data, 25 kinematic features were extracted with the aim of generating a classifier that is able to discriminate not only between Controls and PD patients, but also between the PD cognitive subgroups.

This paper presents a novel framework, called Riemannian manifold learning (RML), based on the assumption that the input high-dimensional data lie on an intrinsically low-dimensional Riemannian manifold. The main idea is to formulate the dimensionality reduction problem as a classical problem in Riemannian geometry, that is, how to construct coordinate charts for a given Riemannian manifold? We implement the Riemannian normal coordinate chart, which has been the most widely used in Riemannian geometry, for a set of unorganized data points.

However, existing gait recognition methods mainly focus on the regular gait cycles, which ignore the irregular situation. In real-world surveillance, human gait is almost irregular, which contains arbitrary dynamic characteristics (e.g., duration, speed, and phase) and varied viewpoints. In this paper, we propose the attentive spatial\u2013temporal summary networks to learn salient spatial\u2013temporal and view-independence features for irregular gait recognition. First of all, we design the gate mechanism with attentive spatial\u2013temporal summary to extract the discriminative sequence-level features for representing the periodic motion cues of irregular gait sequences. The designed general attention and residual attention components can concentrate on the discriminative identity-related semantic regions from the spatial feature maps. The proposed attentive temporal summary component can automatically assign adaptive attention to enhance the discriminative gait timesteps and suppress the redundant ones. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of cross-view gait recognition, we combine the Siamese structure and Null Foley\u2013Sammon transform to obtain the view-invariant gait features from irregular gait sequences. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate the impact of the irregular gait and viewpoint interval between matching pairs on gait recognition accuracy.

It may also be useful to predict and avoid birth defects since there have been many instances where stress related complications have been known leading to cognitive disorders in the child. The goal of this study is to design and develop a prediction model for stress-based complications during pregnancy, based on the Physical, Social, Environmental and Biological factors. For this the dataset was generated using personalized interview-based survey administered to women who have undergone pregnancy and delivery in the past. The questions were based on the factors mentioned above.

Introduction In 2004, Sante publique France, the French Public Health Agency set up a reactive all-cause mortality surveillance based on the administrative part of the death certificate, in the final objectives 1/ to detect unexpected or usual variations in mortality and 2/ to provide a first evaluation of mortality impact of events. In 2007, an Electronic Death Registration System (EDRS) was implemented, enabling electronic transmission of the medical causes of death to the agency in real-time. To date, 12% of the mortality is registered electronically. A pilot study demonstrated that these data were valuable for a reactive mortality surveillance system based on causes of death [1]. A strategy has thus been developed for the analysis in routine of the medical causes of death with the objectives of early detection of expected and unexpected outbreaks and reactive evaluation of their impact. This system will allow approaching the cause accountability when an excess death will be observed. Methods Mortality syndromic groups (MSG) were defined as clusters of medical causes of death (pathologies, syndromes or symptoms) that meet the objectives of the surveillance system. The causes of death are available reactively in free-text (words, terms, expressions) and with a delay of 6 to 24 months in ICD10 codes format. We explored multiple biomedical classifications such as the Mesh, SNOMED, UMLS or ICD10 to learn from their various ways to classify diseases. Based on ICD10, we defined MSGs by a list of ICD10 codes, each codes belonging to a unique MSGs. Each MSG definition was then discussed in working group including medical and epidemiological experts. Additionally, we used a dictionary (provided by the Epidemiology Center on Causes of Death (Inserm-CepiDc)) of each term/expression found in the death certificates since the early 2000 to enrich variety of expression of each MSG. We classified causes of death into MSGs from E-death certificates from 2012 to 2016: 1/ using the ICD10 codes assigned by Inserm-CepiDc based on rules defined by WHO in order to produce the national mortality statistics and 2/ using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) method to classify free-text causes of death. Then we compared the fluctuations of the weekly numbers of each MSG built by using both classification methods (ICD10 codes and the SVM classification) [2]. Results A list of a hundred MSGs was defined, divided into 20 topics (Respiratory conditions, Digestive conditions, Infectious conditions, Cardio and Cerebrovascular conditions, General symptoms\u2026). 60 MSGs were dedicated to alert and detection of both expected seasonal epidemics (12 MSGs) and unexpected events (42 MSGs). They contain unspecific or acute pathologies and symptoms. 40 MSG included medical causes of death related to chronic diseases and medical history. The list of established MSGs was composed of: - MSGs for detection of expected seasonal events such as: \u201cInfluenza\u201d, \u201cLow acute respiratory infection\u201d, \u201cGastroenteritis\u201d, \u201cChikungunya\u201d, \u201cHeat related death\u201d, \u201cDehydration\u201d\u2026 - MSGs for detection of the impact of unexpected events such as: \u201cEpilepsy\u201d, \u201cChoc\u201d, \u201cComa\u201d, \u201cUnspecified fever\u201d, \u201cHeadache\u201d, \u201cSuicide\u201d, \u201cDrugs/opioids poisoning\u201d\u2026 - MSGs for Chronic diseases and Medical history: \u201cChronic digestive diseases\u201d, \u201cChronic endocrine diseases\u201d, \u201cGenitourinary chronic diseases\u201d, \u201cHistory of diseases\u201d\u2026 The weekly number of MSGs built using SVM classification was close and highly correlated to the weekly number of MSGs built using ICD10 codes (Figure 1). Seasonality and peaks were visible using both classifications. For instance, the increase of the MSG \u201cInfluenza\u201d occurred during winter months which are known to be the circulating months of the influenza virus (Figure 1, left) [3]. For unusual and rare events such as death due to burns, we observed that the weekly numbers of MSG \u201cBurns\u201d were also similar using both methods. We observed (Figure 1, right) that the outbreak that occurred in September 2016 related to a major bus accident was found using ICD10 codes or SVM classification. Conclusions The use of free-text causes of death for reactive mortality surveillance requires the development of a strategy for the analysis of these data. Defining MSGs was essential for the implementation of automatic classification methods of the death certificates in routine. The dynamic of MSGs using ICD10 codes or SVM classification were comparable. However, the use of ICD10 codes for reactive mortality surveillance is not an option due to the delay of availability of the codes. The uses of machine learning methods, thus, enable to harness free-text causes of death for the reactive mortality surveillance with an objective of detection and early impact assessment.

The ISS representation is based on the relative intensity self similarity within a pedestrian region of interest (ROI) hypothesis. Our system consists of two components. The first component generates pedestrian ROI hypothesis by exploiting the specific characteristics of FIR images, where pedestrian shapes may vary in large scale, but heads appear usually as light regions. Pedestrian ROI are detected, with high recall rate, due to a Hierarchical Codebook (HC) of Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) located in light head regions. The second component consists of pedestrian hypothesis validation, by using a pedestrian full-body classification based on the ISS representation, with Support Vector Machine (SVM). For classification, we retained two feature descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor and the original ISS feature representation that we proposed for FIR images. The early fusion of these two features enhances significantly the system precision, attaining an F-measure for the pedestrian class of 97.7%.

Alternatively, self-supervised learning-based depth estimators can learn the latent transformation from monocular or binocular video sequences by minimizing the photometric warp error between consecutive frames, but they suffer from the scale ambiguity problem or have difficulty in estimating precise pose changes between frames. In this paper, we propose a joint self-supervised deep learning pipeline for depth and ego-motion estimation by employing the advantages of adversarial learning and joint optimization with spatial-temporal geometrical constraints. The stereo reconstruction error provides the spatial geometric constraint to estimate the absolute scale depth. Meanwhile, the depth map with an absolute scale and a pre-trained pose network serves as a good starting point for direct visual odometry (DVO). DVO optimization based on spatial geometric constraints can result in a fine-grained ego-motion estimation with the additional backpropagation signals provided to the depth estimation network. Finally, the spatial and temporal domain-based reconstructed views are concatenated, and the iterative coupling optimization process is implemented in combination with the adversarial learning for accurate depth and precise ego-motion estimation.

In India, majority of the deposits are lying deep in earth, and it throws challenges to mining, engineers, and geologist to extract them safely and economically without compromising the environment. Ore grade estimation is one of the vital stages of each and every mining project. It plays the dominant role in the decision-making process for investment and development of various mining projects and hence become an important and crucial stage. The thesis focuses on the development of machine learning (ML) based non-linear regression models and pattern based multipoint stochastic (MPS) simulation algorithm for uncertainty assessment in ore grade estimation. In this thesis ML-based estimators and pattern based MPS simulation were developed and subsequently applied to two case study mines (a limestone and an iron ore deposit) in the Indian scenario. Distinct ML based nonlinear regression architectures such as Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP NN), General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) are developed to improve the grade estimation. The multiple lithological units are incorporated as auxiliary information with spatial coordinates into the ML-based models. These models do not require any preliminary geological study and are free from any statistical assumption on the raw data. For iron ore deposit, set of input variable consists of three-dimensional (3-D) spatial coordinates and their ten underlying lithologies, and an iron grade is the only output variable. However, for limestone deposit 3-D spatial coordinates with four distinct lithology form the set of input variables. The set of output variables consists of four constituents of limestone deposit as calcium oxide (CaO), alumina (AI2O3), ferrous oxide (Fe2O3), and silica (SiO2). The ML architectures with appropriate training capture the inherent spatial variability of assay values and their underlying rock types. The best design with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and the highest correlation coefficient (R) is selected for the construction of grade map. The GRNN network was found to be more suitable as compared to all other models regarding generalization capability for both limestone and iron ore deposit. The dissertation also aims at developing pattern based multipoint stochastic simulation algorithm using contourlet transformation named as contoursim for uncertainty assessment in grade estimation. The idea of contoursim is motivated by the wavesim existing in the recent literatures. ::: The algorithm is developed for the simulation of spatially correlated variables such as ore grade and their underlying lithology. The major steps involved in the contoursim is same as that of other MPS based scheme, but the use of separable filter bank structure allows them to identify the complex structure such as curve linearity present in the geological deposit. The CT with their separated filter bank structure capture the complex spatial interaction among several attributes with sparse coefficients. In this thesis, dimension reduction of the pattern database is achieved by contourlet decomposition of each pattern with appropriate scale. The reduced pattern database is further classified into several clusters by coarsest scale coefficients. The algorithm captures the existing trend and continuity of the ore deposit and thus reproduced the available intrinsic patterns of the training image into their several realizations. Multiple realizations of the iron and limestone allow for an assessment of spatial uncertainty in grade estimation. Further ensemble map of ten different realizations have been obtained. The histogram of the training image and their realizations also confirms the capability of contourlet transform to capture the spatial heterogeneity and anisotropy inherent in the complex geological phenomena. The algorithm is verified by two dimensional unconditional simulation using categorical binary channel training image and continuous mineralization of CaO. The sensitivity analysis of the algorithm with respect to its several influential parameters is explored. The study revealed that the algorithm is sensitive to the number of clusters, number of contourlet coefficients, and number of directional sub-bands from coarser to fine level of decomposition.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2962691314", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199590146"}

The residual multiscale dense block is presented in the generator, where the multiscale, dense concatenation, and residual learning can boost the performance, render more details, and utilize previous features, respectively. And the discriminator employs computationally light spectral normalization to stabilize the training of the discriminator.

Technical aspects related to the codec and the video play an important role besides the delivery of the video content in a timely and error-free manner. If the streamed video frames do not arrive in time, temporal artifacts may become observable during the video playback. This has potentially an adverse effect on the user experience. The study of temporal artifacts during the video playback is the area of concern for Quality of Delivery. The licentiate work investigates the Quality of Delivery for Variable Bit Rate video sent over wireless technologies. The ability of the network to deliver data to the video\u2019s jitter buffer before its playout deadline is studied. Jitter buffer exhaustions are of particular interest as they tell something about the Quality of Delivery. A number of experiments are conducted where a set of videos with different bit-rates are streamed to a mobile device over a wireless LAN and a W-CDMA network. The video streams are recorded and analyzed based on specific Quality of Service parameters and are related to the states of the jitter buffer. The statistical tools Support Vector Machines and the Mahalanobis distance are applied to the parameters to obtain a model that can classify the jitter buffer states. The performance evaluation indicates that the Mahalanobis distance can classify the jitter buffer state marginally better than the Support Vector Machines. However, the Support Vector Machines can produce more reliable predictions compared to the Mahalanobis distance. It is also observed that the perceived Quality of Delivery is not only affected by the behavior of the wireless networks but also by the behavior of the streaming server. Finally, the ability of the Quality of Service parameters to describe the Quality of Delivery is studied. The results indicate that metrics based on the packet arrival-rate and packet inter-arrival time are most suitable in this particular case.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2159134523", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62097997"}

Clustering, sparse feature extraction, and non-linear pooling are combined to improve Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification when a limited training set does not comprehensively characterize data variations. Our approach first learns two layers of dictionaries by clustering packet reception data. These dictionaries are used to perform sparse feature extraction, which expresses link state vectors first in terms of a few prominent local patterns, or features, and then in terms of co-occurring features along the flight path. In order to tolerate artifacts like small positional shifts in field-collected data, we pool large magnitude features among overlapping shifted patches within windows. Together, these techniques transform raw link measurements into stable feature vectors that capture environmental effects driven by radio range limitations, antenna pattern variations, line-of-sight occlusions, etc. Link outage prediction is implemented by an SVM that assigns a common label to feature vectors immediately preceding gaps of successive packet losses, predictions are then fed to an adaptive link layer protocol that adjusts forward error correction rates, or queues packets during outages to prevent TCP timeout. In our harsh target environment, links are unstable and temporary outages common, so baseline TCP connections achieve only minimal throughput. However, connections under our predictive protocol temporarily hold packets that would otherwise be lost on unavailable links, and react quickly when the UAV link is restored, increasing overall channel utilization.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/MILCOM.2013.156", "venue": "MILCOM 2013 - 2013 IEEE Military Communications Conference", "journal": "MILCOM 2013 - 2013 IEEE Military Communications Conference", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2127955201", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9044310", "62344203", "38468788", "11767880", "60534820", "14969757", "15351863", "260426", "16513805", "4284337", "12008458", "877639", "14208692", "260426", "2959735", "618769", "59198061", "5955557", "16796144", "47049888", "16236821"], "inbound_citations": ["517096"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2501188"}

Four datasets were used herein which were obtained from flume experiments done by different researchers. In order to investigate the effects of different parameters on the friction factor, numerous models consisting of various parameters were utilized to predict the friction factor using the ELM approach. The modeling procedure was established in two stages; the first stage aimed to model the overland flow friction factor and investigate the effect of the different parameters on the friction factor using non-linear separation via the ELM approach. In the second stage, the friction factor was linearly separated into different types of friction factors and then the separate components were estimated. Sensitivity analysis results confirmed the key role of Froude number ( Fr ) values for most of the models.

A key requirement however is obtaining meaningful insights from high dimensional, sparse and complex clinical data. Data science approaches typically address this challenge by performing feature learning in order to build more reliable and informative feature representations from clinical data followed by supervised learning. In this paper, we propose a predictive modeling approach based on deep learning based feature representations and word embedding techniques. Our method uses different deep architectures (stacked sparse autoencoders, deep belief network, adversarial autoencoders and variational autoencoders) for feature representation in higher-level abstraction to obtain effective and robust features from EHRs, and then build prediction models on top of them. Our approach is particularly useful when the unlabeled data is abundant whereas labeled data is scarce. We investigate the performance of representation learning through a supervised learning approach. Our focus is to present a comparative study to evaluate the performance of different deep architectures through supervised learning and provide insights in the choice of deep feature representation techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that for small data sets, stacked sparse autoencoder demonstrates a superior generality performance in prediction due to sparsity regularization whereas variational autoencoders outperform the competing approaches for large data sets due to its capability of learning the representation distribution", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1908.09174", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2969657649", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["293897", "393948", "14201947", "4472141", "12698054", "31457108", "5842463", "17891422", "148572985", "10510670", "1033682", "2309950", "10974198", "15128842", "215018143", "8842042", "2088679", "13481287", "4404566", "2740197", "82741", "12162263", "1957433", "46962892", "18121764", "3519414", "3519414", "14623032", "1536455", "16162039", "13737133", "17804904", "29667097", "17500448", "48361766", "11202038", "17336655", "5121527", "3826268", "58005587", "34985998", "5730904"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201666555"}

Objective: The study was intended to assess the predictive potential of eConsulta messages through different combinations of vector representation of text and machine learning algorithms and to evaluate their performance. Methodology: Twenty machine learning algorithms (based on five types of algorithms and four text representation techniques) were trained using a sample of 3559 messages (169,102 words) corresponding to 2268 teleconsultations (1.57 messages per teleconsultation) in order to predict the three variables of interest (avoiding the need for a face-to-face visit, increased demand and type of use of the teleconsultation).

Of course, the algorithm also has some room for improvement, according to the random forest algorithm to deal with unbalanced data set when running low efficiency, this paper puts forward approaches to the problem are not a new balance at the same time as the calculation process, showing the growth of the index value, how to improve the prediction speed and shorten the running time, according to the characteristics of the random forest algorithm in the construction process is put forward Based on the domestic and foreign literatures, this paper mainly studies the optimization of random forest from two aspects. Random forest algorithm is an ensemble learning method in the field of machine learning. It is integrated with the classification results of multiple decision trees to form a global classifier. The random forest algorithm compared with other classification algorithms have many advantages, the classified effect advantage is reflected in the classification accuracy and the generalization error is small and has the ability to deal with high dimensional data, the training process of the advantages of learning algorithm of quick and easy parallelization. Based on these two advantages, random forest algorithm has been widely used, and it has become one of the priorities to deal with classification problem. However, when the data type of the unbalanced distribution of the situation, that is the number one category of samples is far less than other types of samples, random forest algorithm will appear ineffective, the generalization error of variable classification problem and a series of. So far, there is not much research on the problem of unbalanced data for random forest classification, and there is no direct and effective method. Some just combine the general processing methods of unbalanced data, such as sampling technique or cost sensitive method. So it is a significant research problem to improve the classification effect of unbalanced data from the random forest algorithm level. Based on this research, this paper analyzes the key steps in the analysis of the effect of random forest classification, and designs a solution to deal with unbalanced data. In this paper, we propose an improved random forest algorithm to deal with the problem of imbalanced data classification by studying the classification method of unbalanced data and the random forest algorithm. Mainly from two aspects of the sub space selection and model integration of random forest. In this paper, the influence of the balanced sampling on the algorithm is also combined with the experimental results. Finally, verify the improved random forest algorithm in unbalanced classification results on public data sets, compared to the original random forest algorithm, in most indicators (cross validation accuracy, AUC index, Kappa coefficient and F1-Measure index) have obvious improvement. The importance of subspace selection and model optimization for random forest algorithm is demonstrated.

They consist of two main components: hash codes learning for training data and hash functions learning for new data points. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to designing novel methods for these two components, i.e., supervised and unsupervised methods for learning hash codes, and different models for inferring hashing functions. However, there is little work integrating supervised and unsupervised hash codes learning into a single framework. Moreover, the hash function learning component is usually based on hand-crafted visual features extracted from the training images. The performance of a content-based image retrieval system crucially depends on the feature representation and such hand-crafted visual features may degrade the accuracy of the hash functions. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning hashing (DLH) method for fast multimedia retrieval.

Small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) are a compound class that includes marketed drugs and compounds in various stages of drug development. While effective, many SMKIs have been associated with toxicity including chromosomal damage. Screening for kinase-mediated toxicity as early as possible is crucial, as is a better understanding of how off-target kinase inhibition may give rise to chromosomal damage. To that end, we employed a competitive binding assay and an analytical method to predict the toxicity of SMKIs. Specifically, we developed a model based on the binding affinity of SMKIs to a panel of kinases to predict whether a compound tests positive for chromosome damage. As training data, we used the binding affinity of 113 SMKIs against a representative subset of all kinases (290 kinases), yielding a 113x290 data matrix. Additionally, these 113 SMKIs were tested for genotoxicity in an in vitro micronucleus test (MNT). Among a variety of models from our analytical toolbox, we selected using cross-validation a combination of feature selection and pattern recognition techniques: Kolmogorov-Smirnov/T-test hybrid as a univariate filter, followed by Random Forests for feature selection and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for pattern recognition. Feature selection identified 21 kinases predictive of MNT. Using the corresponding binding affinities, the SVM could accurately predict MNT results with 85% accuracy (68% sensitivity, 91% specificity). This indicates that kinase inhibition profiles are predictive of SMKI genotoxicity. While in vitro testing is required for regulatory review, our analysis identified a fast and cost-efficient method for screening out compounds earlier in drug development.

To solve this challenging problem, we firstly analyze why simple skip connections are not enough to help accurately locate indistinct boundaries and argue that it is due to the fuzzy information in the skip connection provided in the encoder layers. Then we propose a semantic-guided encoder feature learning strategy to learn both high resolution and rich semantic encoder features so that we can more accurately locate the blurry boundaries, which can also enhance the network by selectively learning discriminative features. Besides, we further propose a soft contour constraint mechanism to model the blurry boundary detection.

In Iran, like most places, legacy soil data constitutes genetic horizon soil information recorded from excavated soil profiles. Describing and sampling from each genetic horizon is assumed to be heterogeneous from site to site. Digital soil mapping (DSM) using observed data is valuable because it provides a means to exploit the available information together with leveraging commonly available information by way of environmental covariates. It creates a much more detailed view of soil at the landscape scale. The purpose of this paper is to model and map the spatial distribution of nitrogen, phosphorous and boron at four standardized depths: 0\u201315, 15\u201330, 30\u201360, 60\u2013100 cm, in an area of 7300 ha in the north west of Iran, and compare different model types. To circumvent the issue of heterogeneous soil depth observations from site to site, mass-preserving soil depth function splines were used to harmonise the soil profile observed data to the aforementioned standard depths. This facilitated the spatial modelling of each of the target variables for each standard depth with the aim of creating digital soil maps. Twenty-three covariates were extracted from a publically available digital elevation model (DEM) as well as freely available Landsat 8 ETM+ imagery. The DEM-derivative covariates used in this study were divided into three main categories: i) Morphometry; ii) hydrology; and iii) lighting visibility.

We present two design optimizations, fixed-width multiply-add and non-uniform look-up table (LUT) for exponent function to minimize power consumption and hardware complexity while retaining the classification performance. A novel non-uniform quantization scheme is proposed for implementing the exponent function which reduces the size of the look-up table by 50%. The proposed non-uniform look-up table reduces the power consumption by 35% using 10-bit quantization. The proposed architecture is programmable and can evaluate three different kernels (linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF)).

Due to recent increases in the amount of genomic information available and the development of DNA sequencing technologies, the applicability of using DNA sequences to identify species (commonly referred to as \u201cDNA barcoding\u201d) is being tested in many areas. Several methods have been suggested to identify species using DNA sequences, including similarity scores, analysis of phylogenetic and population genetic information, and detection of species-specific sequence patterns. Although these methods have demonstrated good performance under a range of circumstances, they also have limitations, as they are subject to loss of information, require intensive computation and are sensitive to model mis-specification, and can be difficult to evaluate in terms of the significance of identification. Here, we suggest a new DNA barcoding method in which support vector machine (SVM) procedures are adopted. Our new method is nonparametric and thus is expected to be robust for a wide range of evolutionary scenarios as well as multilocus analyses. Furthermore, we describe bootstrap procedures that can be used to test the significances of species identifications. We implemented a novel conversion technique for transforming sequence data to real-valued vectors, and therefore, bootstrap procedures can be easily combined with our SVM approach.

In this paper, an accurate classification approach for high resolution remote sensing imagery based on the improved FCN model is proposed. Firstly, we improve the density of output class maps by introducing Atrous convolution, and secondly, we design a multi-scale network architecture by adding a skip-layer structure to make it capable for multi-resolution image classification. Finally, we further refine the output class map using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) post-processing. Our classification model is trained on 70 GF-2 true color images, and tested on the other 4 GF-2 images and 3 IKONOS true color images. We also employ object-oriented classification, patch-based CNN classification, and the FCN-8s approach on the same images for comparison. The experiments show that compared with the existing approaches, our approach has an obvious improvement in accuracy. The average precision, recall, and Kappa coefficient of our approach are 0.81, 0.78, and 0.83, respectively. The experiments also prove that our approach has strong applicability for multi-resolution image classification.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs9050498", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2616755213", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6278891", "62543430", "57231127", "14495716", "2357415", "4853672", "54631652", "17445225", "16808522", "59971129", "14842224", "6433677", "2309950", "195908774", "2161592", "62711222", "108969445", "13079847", "15929726", "15100295", "56507745", "1996665", "1318262", "5165390", "202960210", "40166772", "23216142", "14124313", "1718856", "5574079", "7881621", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["53235766", "211206563", "73567928", "13718957", "211097186", "207823235", "210701060", "55943205", "53521816", "91187268", "102332793", "40804218", "215478588", "210970691", "34645347", "202912577", "55676911", "54452864", "209350736", "135263791", "208039657", "144208119", "159121599", "134902523", "198190235", "52059553", "207827447", "203593791", "68116342", "29520077", "85499691", "51957241", "210899216", "53943888", "57755931", "56568045", "49641809", "145833328", "199654985", "164221371", "196699762", "52926060", "117942794", "44380893", "19093382", "51957711", "56481862", "52021258", "13888361", "3789921", "126161342", "60442867", "199100824", "155543068", "208000922", "195357122", "60442767", "3819190", "53392438", "85500782", "201890661", "213307610", "197580096", "56481843", "214694094", "174797861", "59489923", "369089", "85504573", "52299643"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38953733"}

However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1609.05473", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null,

The implementation of R4F allows for the simultaneous or parallel growth of all the branches of all the trees in the ensemble in an efficient shared, but still single-threaded way.

Another weakness of the SVM is that it only estimates sign[p(x) - 1/2], while the probability p(x) is often of interest itself, where p(x) = P(Y = 1|X = x) is the conditional probability of a point being in class 1 given X = x. We propose a new approach for classification, called the import vector machine, which is built on kernel logistic regression (KLR). We show on some examples that the IVM performs as well as the SVM in binary classification. The IVM can naturally be generalized to the multi-class case. Furthermore, the IVM provides an estimate of the underlying class probabilities. Similar to the \"support points\" of the SVM, the IVM model uses only a fraction of the training data to index kernel basis functions, typically a much smaller fraction than the SVM. This can give the IVM a computational advantage over the SVM, especially when the size of the training data set is large.

However, generally, the number of events is overwhelmingly large, far exceeding the SOC\u2019s budget to handle them. There is a great need for a machine learning system to assist for the accurate detection of malicious events. Traditional supervised learning algorithms cannot be directly applied to this problem because there are only a very small percentage of events that are verified and labelled malicious events (called positively labelled) by SOC analysts and vast majority of events are unlabeled as they are not even investigated.

To be exact, the paper aims to highlight the efficacy of the simplified shock graph (SSG) derived as a result of pruning from the original shock graph as revealed in [7]. We believe our SSG provides a compact, unique and simple way of representing human shape. In doing so, we have chosen to test the feature vectors of the SSG with three different multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier models. In this study, there are three different method of SVM classifier will be used, namely the one-against-all (OAA), one-against-one (OAO) and the bias support vector machines (BSVM). In addition, Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) was opted as kernel for all three techniques with the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) solver applied for training SVM of the two-class problem for both OAA and OAO methods along with Nearest Point Algorithm (NPA) solver used to train the multi class BSVM. The training time, regularization parameter, C values together with other parameters such as the number of support vectors, testing time and classification rate will be evaluated. Initial results demonstrated that perfect classification rate is attained for all three SVM models with the BSVM approach contributed the least number of support vectors.

By relaxing the non-parametric assumption on the discriminator in the classic GAN, the regularized GANs have better generalization ability to produce new samples drawn from the real distribution. It is well known that the real data like natural images are not uniformly distributed over the whole data space. Instead, they are often restricted to a low-dimensional manifold of the ambient space. Such a manifold assumption suggests the distance over the manifold should be a better measure to characterize the distinct between real and fake samples. Thus, we define a pullback operator to map samples back to their data manifold, and a manifold margin is defined as the distance between the pullback representations to distinguish between real and fake samples and learn the optimal generators.

Hence, four contributions are proposed in this paper. They aim at providing a comparison basis for the future development of computer vision algorithms applied to the automation of the land cover reconstruction from monochromatic historical aerial images. First, a new multi-scale multi-date dataset composed of 4.9 million non-overlapping annotated patches of the France territory between 1970 and 1990 has been created with the help of geography experts. This dataset has been named HistAerial. Second, an extensive comparison study of the state-of-the-art texture features extraction and classification algorithms, including deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), has been performed. It is presented in the form of an evaluation. Third, a novel low-dimensional local texture filter named rotated-corner local binary pattern (R-CRLBP) is presented as a simplification of the binary gradient contours filter through the use of an orthogonal combination representation. Finally, a novel combination of low-dimensional texture descriptors, including the R-CRLBP filter, is introduced as a light combination of local binary patterns (LCoLBPs).

On the other hand, it is known that for forest canopies the variation of reflectance with the sun-view-geometry is significant. The study examines different approaches to extract spectro-directional information from airborne imagery and explores its use in forest type classification. The images were acquired in a standard aerial survey. They were taken with a common forward and side overlap with the result that each point on the ground is observed from several view directions. To obtain directional information that might be useful in forest type classification, two widely used semi-empirical models of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) were tested, i.e., the Rahman\u2013Pinty\u2013Verstraete model (RPV; with 3 and 4 parameters) (Rahman et al., 1993) and the RossThick-LiSparse model (RTLS; with 3 and 5 parameters) (Wanner et al., 1995). For each sample plot, observations from at least 10 view directions were available. The models were inverted against the observations applying a look-up table approach. The estimated model parameters were used 1) directly as explanatory variables in the classification, and 2) to estimate the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) for selected sun-view-geometries, referred to as modeled BRFs. The BRFs also served as explanatory variables in the classification. For the classification the Random Forests classifier was used. Both models proved to provide information that can be successfully used in forest type classification outperforming conventional (single-angle) multi-spectral data. The 3-parameter version of the RPV model was found most effective. Compared to the conventional dataset, the overall classification accuracy increased from 72% (kappa: 0.64) to 85% (kappa: 0.81), when the parameters of this model were used as explanatory variables. The 4-parameter version of RPV and the 5-parameter version of RTLS fitted the observed data more accurately than the corresponding 3-parameter versions. However, the classification accuracies obtained with the estimated model parameters were significantly lower than those obtained with the 3-parameter models. All tested models yielded higher classification accuracies with the modeled BRFs than with the model parameters. Again, the highest classification accuracy was obtained with the RPV-3P model (overall accuracy: 92%; kappa: 0.89). The classification accuracy varied with the sun-view-geometry.

As for image retrieval, while off-the-shelf CNN features from models trained for classification task are demonstrated promising, it remains a challenge to learn specific features oriented for instance retrieval. Witnessing the great success of low-level SIFT feature in image retrieval and its complementary nature to the semantic-aware CNN feature, in this paper, we propose to embed the SIFT feature into the CNN feature with a Siamese structure in a learning-based paradigm. The learning objective consists of two kinds of loss, i.e., similarity loss and fidelity loss. The first loss embeds the image-level nearest neighborhood structure with the SIFT feature into CNN feature learning, while the second loss imposes that the CNN feature with the updated CNN model preserves the fidelity of that from the original CNN model solely trained for classification. After the learning, the generated CNN feature inherits the property of the SIFT feature, which is well oriented for image retrieval.

Despite the success made so far, the problems of intra-class diversity and inter-class similarity still remain two major challenges. To explore a possible solution to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach, termed duplex metric learning (DML), for image set classification. The proposed DML consists of two progressive metric learning stages with different objectives used for feature learning and image classification, respectively. The metric learning regularization is not only used to learn powerful feature representations but also well explored to train an effective classifier. At the first stage, we first train a discriminative stacked autoencoder (DSAE) by layer-wisely imposing a metric learning regularization term on the neurons in the hidden layers and meanwhile minimizing the reconstruction error to obtain new feature mappings in which similar samples are mapped closely to each other and dissimilar samples are mapped farther apart. At the second stage, we discriminatively train a classifier and simultaneously fine-tune the DSAE by optimizing a new objective function, which consists of a classification error term and a metric learning regularization term. Finally, two simple voting strategies are devised for image set classification based on the learnt classifier. In the experiments, we extensively evaluate the proposed framework for the tasks of face recognition, object recognition, and face verification on several commonly-used data sets and state-of-the-art results are achieved in comparison with existing methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28991740", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2017.2760512", "venue": "IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society", "journal": "IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society", "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207895256", "53093188", "69723750", "215492879", "145883535", "4270461", "29158004", "5085777", "211691869", "81991330", "53099248", "86401142", "199490540", "57376871", "204848556", "69947164", "208299937"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195667790"}
