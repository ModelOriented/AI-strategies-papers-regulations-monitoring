In one of its most common forms, it utilizes an artificial palate with 62 silver electrodes embedded in its tongue-facing surface. At small regular time intervals it is recorded whether a specific electrode is contacted or not by the tongue, leading to tongue-palate contact patterns. EPG is nowadays a relatively well-estabilshed tool in phonetic research, in the clinical treatment of people with articulation difficulties or cleft palate, and also in the teaching of second languages. Still, the derivation of EPG data is a rather expensive and difficult process. What is suggested herein is that a means of estimating EPG patterns directly from the acoustic speech signal with no need of any special equipment would be of great value to speech pathologists and phoneticians alike. This paper presents work towards finding a mapping between acoustic parameters, namely the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, derived directly from the speech signal, and the corresponding EPG patterns. It may be regarded as a special case of a more general problem called acoustic-toarticulatory inversion, or speech inversion, which refers to finding mappings between the speech signal and some kind of articulatory parameters. One of the main motives for this research field is that the additional articulatory information could be used to improve the performance of current speech recognition systems. EPG patterns could also be used in such a context. For a solution of the problem described, we investigate the utilization of Support Vector Machines, a relatively new and very promising supervised learning technique, of which not many applications have yet appeared in the speech processing field. The source of the data we use is the MOCHA database, which is well documented and publicly available via the Web, thus allowing for comparisons of other researcher\u2019s results to ours.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "179016051", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["961425", "2443126", "8851816", "15140283", "28637672", "5909190"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2870668"}

To further investigate such a very interesting area, this research is mainly focused on advanced imaging and pattern recognition technologies in both medical and food safety applications, which include 1) noise reduction of ultra-low-dose multi-slice helical CT imaging for early lung cancer screening, and 2) automated discrimination between walnut shell and meat under hyperspectral florescence imaging. In the medical imaging and diagnosis area, because X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been applied to screen large populations for early lung cancer detection during the last decade, more and more attentions have been paid to studying low-dose, even ultra-low-dose X-ray CTs. However, reducing CT radiation exposure inevitably increases the noise level in the sinogram, thereby degrading the quality of reconstructed CT images. Thus, how to reduce the noise levels in the low-dose CT images becomes a meaningful topic. In this research, a nonparametric smoothing method with block based thin plate smoothing splines and the roughness penalty was introduced to restore the ultra-low-dose helical CT raw data, which was acquired under 120 kVp / 10 mAs protocol. The objective thorax image quality evaluation was first conducted to assess the image quality and noise level of proposed method. A web-based subjective evaluation system was also built for the total of 23 radiologists to compare proposed approach with traditional sinogram restoration method. Both objective and subjective evaluation studies showed the effectiveness of proposed thinplate based nonparametric regression method in sinogram restoration of multi-slice helical ultra-low-dose CT. In food quality inspection area, automated discrimination between walnut shell and meat has become an imperative task in the walnut postharvest processing industry in the U.S. This research developed two hyperspectral fluorescence imaging based approaches, which were capable of differentiating walnut small shell fragments from meat. Firstly, a principal component analysis (PCA) and Gaussian mixture model (PCA-GMM)-based Bayesian classification method was introduced. PCA was used to extract features, and then the optimal number of components in PCA was selected by a cross-validation technique. The PCA-GMM-based Bayesian classifier was further applied to differentiate the walnut shell and meat according to the class-conditional probability and the prior estimated by the Gaussian mixture model. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of this PCA-GMM approach, and an overall 98.2% recognition rate was achieved. Secondly, Gaussian-kernel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) was presented for the walnut shell and meat discrimination in the hyperspectral florescence imagery. SVM was applied to seek an optimal low to high dimensional mapping such that the nonlinear separable input data in the original input data space became separable on the mapped high dimensional space, and hence fulfilled the classification between walnut shell and meat. An overall recognition rate of 98.7% was achieved by this method. Although the hyperspectral fluorescence imaging is capable of differentiating between walnut shell and meat, one persistent problem is how to deal with huge amount of data acquired by the hyperspectral imaging system, and hence improve the efficiency of application system. To solve this problem, an Independent Component Analysis with k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (ICA-kNN) approach was presented in this research to reduce the data redundancy while not sacrifice the classification performance too much. An overall 90.6% detection rate was achieved given 10 optimal wavelengths, which constituted only 13% of the total acquired hyperspectral image data. In order to further evaluate the proposed method, the classification results of the ICA-kNN approach were also compared to the kNN classifier method alone. The experimental results showed that the ICA-kNN method with fewer wavelengths had the same performance as the kNN classifier alone using information from all 79 wavelengths. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed ICA-kNN method for the hyperspectral band selection in the walnut shell and meat classification.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1888769411", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17788099"}

Opening and closing of the cardiac valves were detected from peaks in the high frequency component of the DUS signal decomposed by wavelet analysis. It was previously proposed to automatically identify the valve motion by hybrid SVM-HMM [1] based on the amplitude and timing of the peaks. However, in the present study, six patterns were identified for the DUS components which were actually variable on a beat-to-beat basis and found to be different for the early gestation (16\u201332 weeks), compared to the late gestation fetuses (36\u201341 weeks). The amplitude of the peaks linked to the valve motion was different across the six patterns and this affected the precision of valve motion identification by the previous hybrid SVM-HMM method. Therefore in the present study, clustering of the DUS components based on K-means was proposed and the hybrid SVM-HMM was trained for each cluster separately. The valve motion events were consequently identified more efficiently by beat-to-beat attribution of the DUS component peaks. Applying this method, more than 98.6% of valve motion events were beat-to-beat identified with average precision and recall of 83.4% and 84.2% respectively.

We present SEGCloud, an end-to-end framework to obtain 3D point-level segmentation that combines the advantages of NNs, trilinear interpolation(TI) and fully connected Conditional Random Fields (FC-CRF). Coarse voxel predictions from a 3D Fully Convolutional NN are transferred back to the raw 3D points via trilinear interpolation.

Its extension the Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRF) uses hidden state variables in order to capture intermediate structures. The number of hidden states in an HCRF must be specified a priori. This number is often not known in advance. A non-parametric extension to the HCRF, with the number of hidden states automatically inferred from data, is proposed here. This is a significant advantage over the classical HCRF since it avoids ad hoc model selection procedures. Further, the training and inference procedure is fully Bayesian eliminating the over fitting problem associated with frequentist methods. In particular, our construction is based on scale mixtures of Gaussians as priors over the HCRF parameters and makes use of Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) and Laplace distribution. The proposed inference procedure uses elliptical slice sampling, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, in order to sample optimal and sparse posterior HCRF parameters.

A previous study showed significant efficiency improvement using STOS-CELM with sine activation. However, sine activation is periodic. Its periodicity repeatedly maps multiple values of its input to the same output values. Within the context of STOS-CELM, input of the activation is a non-negative real value corresponding to the closeness of the data to CELM kernels. Mapping this non-negative real value to a limited range with a periodic nature causes loss of inherent information. That could restrain the STOS-CELM from reaching its full potential.

So statistical measurements that correctly maps these changes are used to classify the dataset. For classification, a nonlinear support vector machine is used on two sets of dataset combination. Performance of detecting epileptic signal even in the interictal state is promising for use in medical applications.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICASERT.2019.8934478", "venue": "2019 1st International Conference on Advances in Science, Engineering and Robotics Technology (ICASERT)", "journal": "2019 1st International Conference on Advances in Science, Engineering and Robotics Technology (ICASERT)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2994628871", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5306369", "20935128", "10385189", "206791236", "11308803", "14221686", "215641450", "8582357", "385358", "12191706", "121098363", "60996340"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209460376"}

This study examined two popular deep learning architectures, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to extract concepts from clinical texts.

In all cases, however, the user is required to take some action, such as clicking on a desired Uniform Resource Locator (URL). In order to identify these malicious sites, the web security community has developed blacklisting services. These blacklists are in turn constructed by an array of techniques including manual reporting, honeypots, and web crawlers combined with site analysis heuristics. Inevitably, many malicious sites are not blacklisted either because they are too recent or were never or incorrectly evaluated. In this paper, we address the detection of malicious URLs as a binary classification problem and study the performance of several well-known classifiers, namely Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Decision Trees, Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors. Furthermore, we adopted a public dataset comprising 2.4 million URLs (instances) and 3.2 million features.

In this work ::: we explore the use of texture transfer learning to surpass these problems for two applications: ::: colonic polyp classification and iris super-resolution. ::: The leading cause of deaths related to intestinal tract is the development of cancer cells ::: (polyps) in its many parts. An early detection (when the cancer is still at an early stage) can ::: reduce the risk of mortality among these patients.

Robustness against image noises and reducing data dimensionality can be achieved by using Radon Transformation, as well as capturing variations of Mean Gait Energy Images (MGEIs) over their centers. Feature extraction is done by applying Zernike moments to RTMGEIs.

Resources, and services can be scheduled around predicted failure and limit the impact. Such strategies are especially important for multi-computer systems, such as compute clusters, that experience a higher rate of failure due to the large number of components. However providing accurate predictions with sufficient lead time remains a challenging problem. ::: ::: This research uses a new spectrum-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach to predict failure events based on system log files. These files contain messages that represent a change of system state. While a single message in the file may not be sufficient for predicting failure, a sequence or pattern of messages may be. This approach uses a sliding window (sub-sequence) of messages to predict the likelihood of failure. Then, a frequency representation of the message sub-sequences observed are used as input to the SVM. The SVM associates the messages to a class of failed or non-failed system. Experimental results using actual system log files from a Linux-based compute cluster indicate the proposed spectrum-kernel SVM approach can predict hard disk failure with an accuracy of 80% about one day in advance.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "LISA", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "262522773", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60463560", "17405859", "13617529", "279767", "9725578", "14466898", "40059985", "15827348", "17484973", "1177820", "198854197", "7828831", "6308532", "140109802"], "inbound_citations": ["198331897", "7026954", "49653737", "4711551", "49233496", "19032755", "58534956"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15323083"}

However, in some situations these heuristics force the planner to perform inefficiently or obtain solutions of poor quality. Learning from experience can help to identify the particular situations for which the domain-independent heuristics need to be overridden. Most of the past learning approaches are fully deductive and eagerly acquire correct control knowledge from a necessarily complete domain theory and a few examples to focus their scope. These learning strategies are hard to generalize in the case of nonlinear planning, where it is difficult to capture correct explanations of the interactions among goals, multiple planning operator choices, and situational data. In this article, we present a lazy learning method that combines a deductive and an inductive strategy to efficiently learn control knowledge incrementally with experience. We present hamlet, a system we developed that learns control knowledge to improve both search efficiency and the quality of the solutions generated by a nonlinear planner, namely prodigy4.0. We have identified three lazy aspects of our approach from which we believe hamlet greatly benefits: lazy explanation of successes, incremental refinement of acquired knowledge, and lazy learning to override only the default behavior of the problem solver. We show empirical results that support the effectiveness of this overall lazy learning approach, in terms of improving the efficiency of the problem solver and the quality of the solutions produced.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1023/A:1006549800144", "venue": "Artificial Intelligence Review", "journal": "Artificial Intelligence Review", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2107766840", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207670313", "61907774", "59887283", "9175791", "58245404", "3342031", "1763149", "59942216", "56666031", "6158532", "14361569", "16454474", "2586130", "60577486", "33454878", "8904006", "62304460", "59944670", "435128", "38770477", "58815652", "189902310", "60734142", "35312999", "2734116", "36541978", "58794078", "5289112", "16624499", "5589353", "5746047", "59712", "2607367", "318794", "525371", "1522597", "31967854", "62910550", "4594227"], "inbound_citations": ["9491506", "16600347", "9253679", "9078470", "8491460", "15376481", "16906333", "18448276", "16990226", "28545", "17793788", "7523955", "205864783", "609296", "2822292", "5997647", "19030750", "17865786", "15225171", "14553191", "5460281", "63123464", "14902472", "1525420", "204844065", "801608", "8999075", "6989351", "3712781", "6371397", "11531638", "14094709", "282722", "3173426", "9922363", "19310", "19310", "13980239", "2338254", "31283561", "13910858", "15605365", "14526964", "3843972", "14868917", "22840", "63563796", "1081090", "8650886", "10321677", "30774893", "11921437", "8705709", "17827658", "14191527", "1992478", "2545159", "12653269", "18992058", "8527311", "9192701", "9414403", "15221020", "2792860"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15324272"}

Procurement is done by issuing purchase orders to impaneled vendors and invoices submitted by vendors are paid after they go through a rigorous validation process. Agents orchestrating P2P process often encounter the problem of matching a product or service descriptions in the invoice to those in purchase order and verify if the ordered items are what have been supplied or serviced. For example, the description in the invoice and purchase order could be TRES 739mL CD KER Smooth and TRES 0.739L CD KER Smth which look different at word level but refer to the same item. In a typical P2P process, agents are asked to manually select the products which are similar before invoices are posted for payment. This step in the business process is manual, repetitive, cumbersome, and costly. Since descriptions are not well-formed sentences, we cannot apply existing semantic and syntactic text similarity approaches directly. In this paper, we present two approaches to solve the above problem using various types of available agent's recorded feedback data. If the agent's feedback is in the form of a relative ranking between descriptions, we use similarity ranking algorithm. If the agent's feedback is absolute such as match or no-match, we use classification similarity algorithm. We also present the threats to the validity of our approach and present a possible remedy making use of product taxonomy and catalog.

An organism-wise cross-validation was performed to define confidence estimates, resulting in an average precision of 80% for 74% of all test sequences. The validation results show that the prediction performance was organism-independent and could reproduce the annotation of other automated systems as well as high-quality manual annotations. We applied our trained classification system to Xenopus laevis sequences, yielding functional annotation for more than half of the known expressed genome. Compared to the currently available annotation, we provided more than twice the number of contigs with good quality annotation, and additionally we assigned a confidence value to each predicted GO term.ConclusionsWe present a complete automated annotation system that overcomes many of the usual problems by applying a controlled vocabulary of Gene Ontology and an established classification method on large and well-described sequence data sets. In a case study, the function for Xenopus laevis contig sequences was predicted and the results are publicly available at ftp://genome.dkfz-heidelberg.de/pub/agd/gene_association.agd_Xenopus.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC517617", "pubmed_id": "15333146", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-5-116", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2171674404", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1026506", "12952915", "34102431", "9593149", "20375264", "36278256", "16234199", "23409226", "15067941", "42920536", "21131165", "815355", "10258714", "16654742", "32281509", "1088806", "45746", "18385834"], "inbound_citations": ["1590129", "13941081", "14882570", "12808000", "15235995", "197409940", "32882973", "8818473", "18827233", "18226", "56058652", "14878377", "2320041", "7465061", "11539370", "14417259", "15286724", "14891511", "11524773", "10072567", "27744970", "1572654", "16440363", "44205983", "7009982", "7511191", "10958316", "18499284", "16888013", "15385056", "15013748", "18272904", "18828817", "15820846", "10112842", "11949693", "11949693", "10214140", "2938102", "16902816", "1049980", "13187668", "788449", "25069765", "17581926", "2023898", "17172759", "2219661", "564169", "8735122", "16423577", "1400758", "15672718", "1760651"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6095087"}

In this paper, we propose robust versions of the RVM regression that can handle outliers in the training dataset. We decompose the noise term in the RVM formulation into a (sparse) outlier noise term and a Gaussian noise term. We then estimate the outlier noise along with the model parameters. We present two approaches for solving this estimation problem: 1) a Bayesian approach, which essentially follows the RVM framework and 2) an optimization approach based on Basis Pursuit Denoising. In the Bayesian approach, the robust RVM problem essentially becomes a bigger RVM problem with the advantage that it can be solved efficiently by a fast algorithm.

On the one hand, multiclass classification problems require the prediction of class labels: given observations of objects that belong to certain classes, can we predict to which class a new object belongs? On the other hand, the regularized regression problem is a variation of the common regression problem, which measures how changes in independent variables influence an observed outcome. In regularized regression, constraints are placed on the coefficients of the regression model to enforce certain properties in the solution, such as sparsity or limited size. ::: ::: In this dissertation several new algorithms are presented for both multiclass classification and regularized regression problems. For multiclass classification the GenSVM method is presented. This method extends the binary support vector machine to multiclass classification problems in a way that is both flexible and general, while maintaining competitive performance and training time. In a different chapter, accurate estimates of the Bayes error are applied to both meta-learning and the construction of so-called classification hierarchies: structures in which a multiclass classification problem is decomposed into several binary classification problems. ::: ::: For regularized regression problems a new algorithm is presented in two parts: first for the sparse regression problem and second as a general algorithm for regularized regression where the regularization function is a measure of the size of the coefficients. In the proposed algorithm graduated nonconvexity is used to slowly introduce the nonconvexity in the problem while iterating towards a solution.

Existing transfer learning research is relatively well-progressed, but only in situations where the feature spaces of the domains are homogeneous and the target domain contains at least a few labeled instances. However, transfer learning has not been well-studied in heterogeneous settings with an unlabeled target domain. To contribute to the research in this emerging field, this paper presents: (1) an unsupervised knowledge transfer theorem that prevents negative transfer; and (2) a principal angle-based metric to measure the distance between two pairs of domains. The metric shows the extent to which homogeneous representations have preserved the information in original source and target domains. The unsupervised knowledge transfer theorem sets out the transfer conditions necessary to prevent negative transfer. Linear monotonic maps meet the transfer conditions of the theorem and, hence, are used to construct homogeneous representations of the heterogeneous domains, which in principle prevents negative transfer. The metric and the theorem have been implemented in an innovative transfer model, called a Grassmann-LMM-geodesic flow kernel (GLG), that is specifically designed for knowledge transfer across heterogeneous domains. The GLG model learns homogeneous representations of heterogeneous domains by minimizing the proposed metric. Knowledge is transferred through these learned representations via a geodesic flow kernel.

As standard classifiers will be biased toward the majority class there exist a need for specific methods than can overcome this single-class dominance. Most of works concentrated on binary problems, where majority and minority class can be distinguished. But a more challenging problem arises when imbalance is present within multi-class datasets, as relations between classes tend to complicate. One class can be a minority class for some, while a majority for others. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for handling such scenarios that combines the problem decomposition with ensemble learning. According to divide-and-conquer rule, we decompose our multi-class data into a number of binary subproblems using one-versus-one approach. To each simplified task we delegate a ensemble of classifiers dedicated to binary imbalanced problems. Then using a dedicated classifier fusion approach, we reconstruct the original multi-class problem.

Forecasting is done for the six metropolitan areas of Bangladesh i.e. DMP (Dhaka Metropolitan Area), CMP (Chittagong Metropolitan Area), KMP (Khulna Metropolitan Area), RMP (Rajshahi Metropolitan Area), BMP (Barisal Metropolitan Area), and SMP (Sylhet Metropolitan Area). Here, Random Forest Regression is applied to predict the number of road accidents and their casualties. Firstly, the regression model is trained on the training dataset and then the prediction is done on the test data. After forecasting, the predicted results are compared with the actual results which indicate that the random forest regression is good enough to forecast in this context.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCCNT45670.2019.8944500", "venue": "2019 10th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)", "journal": "2019 10th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2996802830", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17700080", "6928397", "33659975", "40619203", "86490866", "70001306", "108781906"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209695973"}

Feedback for an advertisement or a service is essential for its improvement which is often taken from the user through forms. Instead of asking to fill up forms, here facial expression analysis can be used to generate the feedback without having the user intervention. For the purpose of emotion detection, a Support Vector Machine has been employed to detect six types of emotions namely - happy,sad,anger,surprise,disgust and neutral. First the face is detected and 68 facial landmarks co-ordinates are located on the face that correspond to eyes, mouth, nose and jaw. With this landmarks, a total of 15 real valued parameters are calculated taking into account the neutral face of the user. These real valued parameters are computed as ratios of different distant metrics corresponding to the actual face and neutral face. Experimental results show that an accuracy of 90.60 \u00b1 1.65% has been achieved in recognizing the six emotions by using 20% of dataset for testing. An average accuracy of 88.06% is obtained in 10-fold cross validation testing. This information is used to generate a visual feedback to the advertiser.

It has attracted extensive research interests recently due to its effectiveness in a wide range of applications. The general idea of the existing methods is to utilize the common latent structure shared across domains as the bridge for knowledge transfer. These methods usually model the common latent structure by using either the marginal distribution or the conditional distribution. However, without exploring the duality between these two distributions, these single bridge methods may not achieve optimal capability of knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Dual Transfer Learning (DTL), which simultaneously learns the marginal and conditional distributions, and exploits the duality between them in a principled way. The key idea behind DTL is that learning one distribution can help to learn the other. This duality property leads to mutual reinforcement when adapting both distributions across domains to transfer knowledge. The proposed method is formulated as an optimization problem based on joint nonnegative matrix trifactorizations (NMTF). The two distributions are learned from the decomposed latent factors that exhibit the duality property. An efficient alternating minimization algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem with convergence guarantee. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DTL is more effective than alternative transfer", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1137/1.9781611972825.47", "venue": "In Proceedings of the 12th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, SDM", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2398879410", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16902615", "15978939", "37925315", "1913495", "2190789", "7518182", "8153773", "165018", "17429744", "15052554", "15036406", "14591650", "5176875", "1668344", "5984940", "59566327", "740063", "2164347", "13833463", "8110626", "239305", "1221204", "27591975"], "inbound_citations": ["204783303", "3762587", "37164853", "7467441", "3036406", "13077640", "2138787", "13540908", "13888866", "7671529", "1174489", "1990988", "14797344", "107350", "54918085", "204402822", "203638807", "18280856", "207847753", "15978018", "6615440", "206784313", "9685377", "15354840", "3831892", "12308197"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13902032"}

Thus, an attempt has been made that deals with the development of a methodological framework to recover or explore the historical reservoir operation database to derive the reservoir operators\u2019 knowledge as operational rules. The developed methodological framework utilizes the strength and capability of recently developed predictive datamining algorithms to recover the knowledge from large historical database. Predictive data-mining algorithms such as a) classifier: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and b) regression: Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been used for single reservoir operation data-mining (SROD) modelling framework to explore the temporal dependence between different variables of reservoir operation. The rules of operation or knowledge learned from the training database have been used as guiding rules for predicting the future reservoir operators\u2019 decision on operating the reservoir for the given condition on the inflow, initial storage, and demand requirements. The developed SROD model was found to be efficient in exploring the hidden relationships that exist in a single reservoir system.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11269-016-1351-5", "venue": "Water Resources Management", "journal": "Water Resources Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2401486020", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["5301875", "109532286", "67789605", "120478183", "58042335", "14630018", "5375660", "441296", "62579104", "55368388", "95951540", "13861754", "196013314", "111292730", "130684438", "25740136", "110105366", "60855197", "110748952", "62195212", "129612834", "111219090", "154342690", "128542657", "17794081", "6798225", "1664705", "128515108", "140109802", "129783470"], "inbound_citations": ["203085352"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114374251"}

Thanks to the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the progress of unsupervised learning, unsupervised style transfer GANs have been successfully used to generate realistic, clinically meaningful and interpretable images. The large size of high resolution Whole Slide Images (WSIs) presents an additional computational challenge. This makes tilewise processing necessary during training and inference of deep learning networks. Instance normalization has a substantial positive effect in style transfer GAN applications but with tilewise inference, it has the tendency to cause a tiling artifact in reconstructed WSIs. In this paper we propose a novel perceptual embedding consistency (PEC) loss forcing the network to learn color, contrast and brightness invariant features in the latent space and hence substantially reducing the aforementioned tiling artifact. Our approach results in more seamless reconstruction of the virtual WSIs. We validate our method quantitatively by comparing the virtually generated images to their corresponding consecutive real stained images.We compare our results to state-of-the-art unsupervised style transfer methods and to the measures obtained from consecutive real stained tissue slide images. We demonstrate our hypothesis about the effect of the PEC loss by comparing model robustness to color, contrast and brightness perturbations and visualizing bottleneck embeddings. We validate the robustness of the bottleneck feature maps by measuring their sensitivity to the different perturbations and using them in a tumor segmentation task.

In this paper, we investigated thirty wrapper-based feature selection methods to remove irrelevant and redundant software metrics used for building defect predictors. In this study, these thirty wrappers vary based on the choice of search method (Best First or Greedy Stepwise), leaner (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression), and performance metric (Overall Accuracy, Area Under ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve, Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve, Best Geometric Mean, and Best Arithmetic Mean) used in the defect prediction model evaluation process. The models are trained using the three learners and evaluated using the five performance metrics. The case study is based on software metrics and defect data collected from a real world software project. The results demonstrate that Best Arithmetic Mean is the best performance metric used within the wrapper. Naive Bayes performed significantly better than Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine as a wrapper learner on slightly and less imbalanced datasets.

In this paper, we construct an approximately symmetric deep neural network with two sides containing the same number of coupled layers to transform the two images into the same feature space. The two images are connected with the two sides and transformed into the same feature space, in which their features are more discriminative and the difference image can be generated by comparing paired features pixel by pixel. The network is first built by stacked restricted Boltzmann machines, and then, the parameters are updated in a special way based on clustering. The special way, motivated by that two heterogeneous images share the same reality in unchanged areas and retain respective properties in changed areas, shrinks the distance between paired features transformed from unchanged positions, and enlarges the distance between paired features extracted from changed positions. It is achieved through introducing two types of labels and updating parameters by adaptively changed learning rate. This is different from the existing methods based on deep learning that just do operations on positions predicted to be unchanged and extract only one type of labels. The whole process is completely unsupervised without any priori knowledge. Besides, the method can also be applied to homogeneous images.

We analyzed dynamic Eucalypt/ Sclerophyll public forests in south eastern Australia which have been impacted by a series of disturbances including fire and logging over the last 30 years. We first prepared annual satellite composites and fitted spectral time series trajectories on a per-pixel basis using the LandTrendr algorithm, from which we derived a range of spatial disturbance and recovery metrics. We then simultaneously modeled disturbance and consequent recovery levels using the Random Forest classifier. Using derived change information and a one-off forest cover dataset, we estimated change in forest extent throughout the time series. Disturbance and consequent recovery were simultaneously detected with an overall accuracy of 80.2%, while the model of change levels classification obtained an overall accuracy of 76.5%. Over the 30 year period, approximately 49.5% of the study area was disturbed, 92% of which has fully recovered.

Recent HTR solutions based on artificial neural networks exhibit remarkable solutions in referenced databases. These deep learning neural networks are composed of both convolutional (CNN) and long short-term memory recurrent units (LSTM). In addition, connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is the key to avoid segmentation at character level, greatly facilitating the labeling task. One of the main drawbacks of the CNNLSTM-CTC (CLC) solutions is that they need a considerable part of the text to be transcribed for every type of calligraphy, typically in the order of a few thousands of lines. Furthermore, in some scenarios the text to transcribe is not that long, e.g. in the Washington database. The CLC typically overfits for this reduced number of training samples. Our proposal is based on the transfer learning (TL) from the parameters learned with a bigger database. We first investigate, for a reduced and fixed number of training samples, 350 lines, how the learning from a large database, the IAM, can be transferred to the learning of the CLC of a reduced database, Washington. We focus on which layers of the network could be not re-trained. We conclude that the best solution is to re-train the whole CLC parameters initialized to the values obtained after the training of the CLC from the larger database. We also investigate results when the training size is further reduced. The differences in the CER are more remarkable when training with just 350 lines, a CER of 3.3% is achieved with TL while we have a CER of 18.2% when training from scratch. As a byproduct, the learning times are quite reduced.

The saliency of the given image is then measured in terms of the mean of predicted saliency value by the ensembles members.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1610.06449", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2017.03.018", "venue": "Neurocomputing 244 (2017) 10-18", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2533058588", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11094579", "10854275", "978192", "14474281", "13308232", "6193293", "11664336", "1073705", "48287", "10177743", "17436176", "42578464", "1154218", "62357435", "11028969", "13564221", "44906824", "17425052", "15118122", "29075200", "14681986", "17325946", "2909986", "13450936", "36218345", "18383066", "27700210", "32537523", "11195910", "62656574", "53115578", "1302508", "17274346", "7141467", "16799016", "207190218", "353246", "5875815", "16750736", "3108956", "12365906", "8705321", "11010048", "8534821", "16762376", "23522797", "24770282", "18236666", "14327909", "16781703", "8945924", "15611611", "16493916", "206739997", "20114012", "1211881", "350786", "2938669", "8641131", "629401", "123355102", "14820910", "16964349", "641747", "8736399", "16445820", "172023", "264788", "12897896", "1948756", "14249712", "16408631", "14124313", "745024", "7676247", "317467", "877732", "206593051", "17237792", "2713780", "61610957", "1713804", "15589402", "145400229", "5971386", "2028925", "4984532", "11982950"], "inbound_citations": ["19158922", "186996374", "51895520", "104292369", "4979757", "195798916", "208989841", "32429255", "108291625", "53787247", "52269784", "14214879", "202687387", "22324198", "16173261", "52947943", "149492634", "210711872", "25578249", "14033535", "1985114", "15645058", "14666269", "52187709", "67077990"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1406512"}

The purpose of this study is classifying multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in the four clinical forms as de\u25a1ned by the McDonald criteria using machine learning algorithms trained on clinical data combined with lesion loads and magnetic resonance metabolic features. Materials and Methods. Eighty-seven MS patients (12 Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS), 30 Relapse Remitting (RR), 17 Primary Progressive (PP) and 28 Secondary Progressive (SP)) and eighteen healthy controls were included in this study. Longitudinal data available for each MS patient included clinical (e.g. age, disease duration, Expanded Disability Status Scale), conventional magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopic imaging. We extract N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), Choline (Cho), and Creatine (Cre) concentrations, and we compute three features for each spectroscopic grid by averaging metabolite ratios (NAA/Cho, NAA/Cre, Cho/Cre) over good quality voxels. We built linear mixed-e\u25a1ects models to test for statistically signi\u25a1cant di\u25a1erences between MS forms. We test nine binary classi\u25a1cation tasks on clinical data, lesion loads, and metabolic features, using a leaveone- patient-out cross-validation method based on 100 random patient-based bootstrap selections. We compute F1-scores and BAR values after tuning Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines with gaussian kernel (SVM-rbf), and Random Forests. Results. Statistically signi\u25a1cant di\u25a1erences were found between the disease starting points of each MS form using four di\u25a1erent response variables: Lesion Load, NAA/Cre, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cre ratios. Training SVM-rbf on clinical and lesion loads yields F1-scores of 71-72% for CIS vs. RR and CIS vs. RR+SP, respectively. For RR vs. PP we obtained good classi\u25a1cation results (maximum F1- score of 85%) after training LDA on clinical and metabolic features, while for RR vs. SP we obtained slightly higher classi\u25a1cation results (maximum F1-score of 87%) after training LDA and SVM-rbf on clinical, lesion loads and metabolic features. Conclusions. Our results suggest that metabolic features are better at di\u25a1erentiating between relapsing-remitting and primary progressive forms, while lesion loads are better at di\u25a1erentiating between relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive forms. Therefore, combining clinical data with magnetic resonance lesion loads and metabolic features can improve the discrimination between relapsing-remitting and progressive forms.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5504183", "pubmed_id": "28744195", "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2017.00398", "venue": "Front.

An apparent ex-ante answer is: intelligent enough to perform the bootstrap operation necessary for the task\u2014to somehow arrive at prices that are needed to generate those very prices. Constructing a path to such equilibrium through rational behavior has remained beyond what we know of human cognitive abilities. Yet, laboratory experiments report that profit motivated human traders are able to aggregate information in some, but not all, market environments (Plott and Sunder 1988, Forsythe and Lundholm 1990). Algorithmic agents have the potential to yield insights into how simple individual behavior may perform this complex market function as an emergent phenomenon. We report on a computational experiment with markets populated by algorithmic traders who follow cognitively simple heuristics humans are known to use. These markets, too, converge to rational expectations equilibria in environments in which human markets converge, albeit slowly and noisily.

However, their network structure and interconnectivity have not been formally analysed.Bayesian network (BN) inference algorithms have demonstrated promise in the analysis of genomics data to recover fragments of biological pathways due to their ability to capture many types of relationships between variables and to handle noisy data.An inference score (4), normalized to be between -1 and 1, is a measure of the strength of the interaction (either positive or negative) between different nodes in the recovered network. Materials and methods: This computational study uses BN methodology to elucidate any possible network structure and refine a gene expression signature distinguishing responders from non-responders groups to letrozole treatment. It has been applied to 205 covariables (69 baseline expression, 45 day 14 expression and 91 changes in expression with treatment), identified via Random Forests as being differentially expressed between 37 tumours responding to neoadjuvant letrozole and 15 non-responders. The number of false positive relationships was limited by considering 4 different sub-sets of the original data 1) all 205 variables, but allowing for limited connectivity between them; 2) only the baseline variables 3) only the change variables with treatment and 4) only day 14 post-treatment variables. It was conjectured that the variables linking significantly to response status would appear in the overlap between lists 1) and 2), lists 1) and 3) and lists 1) and 4). Results: The analysis of the overall dataset highlighted the importance and the interconnectivity of ribosomal proteins. More specifically, the BN algorithm found two connected networks of 20 genes each with 13 and 14 ribosomal proteins and an average inference score of 0.65. In addition, BN links patient type (responder vs. non-responder) directly to genes that have been implicated in the natural history of breast cancer such as BCL-2 and KIAA0101 with inference scores of 0.4 and 0.45, respectively. The inferred network also contained a link with inference score of 0.4 between patient type and phosphatidylinositol glycan, whose oncogenic role has been suggested by others. The preliminary network analysis of the baseline covariables did not yield any meaningful pattern that differentiates the two patient types, except for the involvement of the cyclin E2 pathway with a \u201ccomposite\u201d inference score of 0.33. Conclusions: With initial encouraging results , further refinement of the BN analysis, as well as enrichment of the data should facilitate the discovery of a predictive baseline gene expression pattern.

This involves in creating a model from a training set of data instances which are already labeled, possibly being this model also used to define the class of data instances which are not classified already. A successful way of performing the classification process is provided by the algorithm Random Forests (RF), which is itself a type of Ensemble-based Classifier. An ensemble-based classifier increases the accuracy of the class label assigned to a data instance by using a set of classifiers that are modeled on different, but possibly overlapping, instance sets, and then combining the so-obtained intermediate classification results. To this end, RF particularly makes use of a number of decision trees to classify an instance, then taking the majority of votes from these trees as the final classifier. The latter one is a critical task of algorithm RF, which heavily impacts on the accuracy of the final classifier. In this paper, we propose a variation of algorithm RF, namely adjusting one of the two parameters that RF takes, the number of decision trees, dependant on a meaningful relation between the dataset predictive power rating and the number of trees itself, with the goal of improving accuracy and performance of the algorithm.

Current methods of assessing muscle function impairment due to microgravity exposure include techniques such as maximum voluntary contraction assessments using force measurements. Such techniques involve impractical long-feedback loops for applications involving rehabilitation or otherwise detecting physiological changes. Recent studies have made use of the discrete wavelet transform in combination with machine learning methods to classify hand gestures and detect pathologies. In this paper, we demonstrate models capable of discriminating between the before and after bed rest states by extracting features from surface electromyography measurements. Methods: A previously conducted and studied bed rest experiment is examined by discrete wavelet transform for tractable feature sets for the purpose of k-nearest neighbor and Support Vector Machine classification. Forward feature selection is used with k-nearest neighbor or Support Vector Machine selection criteria. Classifiers are evaluated on non-wavelet-derived features for sake of comparison. Results: Wavelet-derived features perform well for both classifiers with classification accuracies as high as 95%. Models without wavelet-derived features do not perform as well overall. Conclusion: These high-accuracy results are promising for future efforts in neuromuscular monitoring and further investigations with larger sample sizes.

In this paper, in order to enhance the performance of the text classification, some solutions are proposed to some of the problems with Naive Bayes classifiers. Based on the original Naive Bayes algorithm, we take feature weight into account and make it a factor and combine KL-divergence (relative entropy) between the words to improve Naive Bayes classifier.

{"paper_id": "111514537", "title": "Dynamic rating for improved operational performance", "authors": [{"first": "Rui", "middle": [], "last": "Huang", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Many power transmission systems are under pressure from increasing load demand as well as changes in power flows due to the evolution of the power market and the integration of renewable energy generations. At the same time, limited finance for installing new cables and the difficulties in reinforcement of existing circuits in urban areas incentivize transmission operators around the world to find ways to maximize the flexibility and usage of their existing transmission network. As a result, it is crucial to adopt new current rating methods which are able to optimize asset utilization, minimize risk and reduce the constraint costs incurred by transmission system operators. Historically, most cable thermal ratings are continuous ratings, with fixed seasonal values for a certain cable circuit. They are based on worst-case assumptions and are not able to consider the real-time environmental conditions. The ignorance of the real-time change in environmental conditions, which control the rate of heat dissipation from the cable, makes continuous ratings generally conservative. However, the rating values can also be optimistic for some extreme situations such as thermal runaway in the soil around the cables, which might cause overheating. Several dynamic rating systems have been applied to the existing underground cable in practice by using online monitoring data. Some worst case assumptions used in conventional cable rating standards have been removed. Such systems have been reported to deliver increases of 5-20% in cable current capacity. However, most existing dynamic rating systems can only determine a short-term rating at the current time step. It would be valuable for transmission operators to know the short-term rating in advance to assist in day-ahead planning. To solve this problem, a predicted rating system, which is capable of providing network operators with accurate short term current ratings at the day ahead stage, has been developed in this work. This novel cable rating concept integrates a day-ahead load forecasting system into the dynamic rating system to provide the time-limited short-term rating calculated forward from any point within the next 24 hours. Some shortcomings of existing rating methods for different kind of insulated cable installations have been detected and overcome. More suitable models have been built, compromising between accuracy and solution speed to fit them into the predicted rating system. A day-ahead load forecasting system has been built by using the Support Vector Regression (SVR) method. Dynamic thermal models are used to translate the load prediction into thermal prediction 24 hours ahead. Thus, the time-limited short-term ratings can then be calculated 24hrs ahead, based on the predicted load data and cable temperature data. In addition, an error estimation system has been integrated to estimate the predicted conductor temperature error quickly, thus increases the reliability of the predicted rating system. Utilizing this predicted rating system has the double benefit of reducing variations in dynamic ratings (which makes them difficult to plan with), while reducing the risk of thermally overloading the cable, thus prematurely ageing the dielectric. For a large scale transmission network, the dynamic rating and predicted rating systems for all the cable circuits might require huge amounts of computation and very long solution times, which make their application impractical and infeasible. The idea of using a machine learning method, such as Support Vector Regression, has been shown to dramatically reduce the solution time for dynamic rating calculations.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2281554151", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111514537"}

However, the optimal efficacy of commercial NMES systems\u2019 application is inhibited by the imprecision in muscle force/torque production and rapid muscle fatigue. Evidence suggests that the application of a muscle mechanical response (force/torque) as a feedback to modulate the administration of NMES could optimize the efficacy of the technology by enabling muscle force regulation, and delaying the onset of muscle fatigue. Currently, a direct muscle force measurement is impractical and there is also lack of a reliable, electrical stimulus artifact-free and non-invasive proxy of muscle force to drive the NMES systems for enhanced controllability and clinical use. Attempts on the application of evoked-electromyography for this purpose remain debatable and clinically limited. As a viable alternative, this thesis proposes a non-invasive muscle force/torque measurement technique based on the mechanical activity of contracting muscles (Mechanomyography or MMG). This investigation was motivated by the knowledge that mechanomyography is immune from certain limitations of evoked-electromyography and provides direct information on muscle\u2019s mechanical responses to the electrical stimulation. Systematic literature survey revealed a lack of clear understanding of the relationship between mechanomyography and NMES-evoked torque production in a paralyzed muscle. Therefore, the present research introduces mechanomyography as a proxy of NMES-evoked torque in persons with SCI. At the outset, a hybrid procedure was developed to establish mechanomyography as a proxy of muscle force/torque in healthy volunteers and persons with SCI. This was used to investigate the pattern of incremental torque production and subsequently facilitated the estimation of the torque from mechanomyography using a computational intelligent technique based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) modelling. This thesis also demonstrated, in a clinical setting, the validity of the mechanomyography as a relevant parameter for studying muscle fatigue during critical knee buckling stress i.e. standing-to-failure challenge in persons with SCI. Due to the peculiarity of the study participants/target population and the intended clinical application of NMES-supported standing, the quadriceps muscle group, widely reported for its relevance in studying the knee torque dynamics, was selected as the study site. Findings from these studies revealed that the mechanomyographic amplitude is highly correlated (r> 0.95; P 0.05) of the mechanomyography during force production might be useful to evaluate the recovery or deterioration of motor unit activities following NMES supported exercise and as an alternative technique for monitoring the NMES-evoked muscle activity for practical control applications. Together, this thesis lays a foundation for the future implementation of MMG-driven NMES technologies.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2641958601", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113786692"}

Here we applied machine learning to detect expertise from the oculomotor behavior of novice and expert billiard players during free viewing of a filmed billiard match with no specific task, and in a dynamic trajectory prediction task involving ad-hoc, occluded billiard shots. We have adopted a ground framework for feature space fusion and a Bayesian sparse classifier, namely, a Relevance Vector Machine. By testing different combinations of simple oculomotor features (gaze shifts amplitude and direction, and fixation duration), we could classify on an individual basis which group - novice or expert - the observers belonged to with an accuracy of 82% and 87%, respectively for the match and the shots. These results provide evidence that, at least in the particular domain of billiard sport, a signature of expertise is hidden in very basic aspects of oculomotor behavior, and that expertise can be detected at the individual level both with ad-hoc testing conditions and under naturalistic conditions - and suitable data mining.

In many problems of com-puter-aided medical diagnosis and treatment a program must be capable of learning from previously accumulated past patients data records, and extrapolating to make diagnosis for new patient by considering their symptoms. Many machine learning and statisitical techniques have been developed to help in clinical decision making. Among them decision trees, the Bayesian techniques, dicriminant analysis, neural networks and many others. These techniques usually deal with conventional, small-scale, low-dimensional problems, and the application of these techniques to modern high-dimensional data sets with many thousand attributes (symptoms) usually leads to serious computational problems. Several new techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been developed to tackle the problem of dimensionality by transferring the problem into high-dimensional space, and solving it in that space. They based on so-called kernal methods and can very often solve some high-dimensional problems. These techniques perform very well with good accuracy. However, a typical drawback of techniques such as the SVM is that they usually do not provide any useful measure of confidence of new, unclassified examples (new pattients). Recently a new set of techniques, called Conformal Predictors, have been developed that allows to make predictions with valid measures of confidence. The approach is based on approximations to the universal measures of confidence given by the algorithmic theory of randomness and allows us to compute diagnostic classes and estimate confidence of the diagnostics for high-dimensional data. The talk will present Conformal Predictors and their applications in medicine.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-16239-8_2", "venue": "AIAI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1525980546", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35361766"}

Additionally, we have recently seen a focus on gathering data from non-expert human teachers (i.e., domain experts but not robotics experts). In this book, we provide an introduction to the field with a focus on the unique technical challenges associated with designing robots that learn from naive human teachers. We begin, in the introduction, with a unification of the various terminology seen in the literature as well as an outline of the design choices one has in designing an LfD system. Chapter 2 gives a brief survey of the psychology literature that provides insights from human social learning that are relevant to designing robotic social learners. Chapter 3 walks through an LfD interaction, surveying the design choices one makes and state of the art approaches in prior work. First, is the choice of input, how the human teacher interacts with the robot to provide demonstrations. Next, is the choice of modeling technique. Currently, there is a dichotomy in the field between approaches that model low-level motor skills and those that model high-level tasks composed of primitive actions. We devote a chapter to each of these. Chapter 7 is devoted to interactive and active learning approaches that allow the robot to refine an existing task model.

In the present study, we investigated the distribution pattern of Chromolaena odorata and Mikania micrantha and factors governing their spread in the grassland of Manas National Park. We carried out extensive field sampling and modeled the distribution of invasives using a suite of algorithms. Model predictions differed with respect to AUC, sensitivity, specificity and TSS range, largely in classification performance. Final risk maps were produced averaging the model outputs of Random Forest and MaxEnt for both the species. Subsequently, we also emphasized that the niche/SDM modelling studies should instigate by testing a suite of algorithms for predictive ability under the specific conditions of the study since no single optimization approach would be best under all circumstances. Proximity to the road and human settlement, elevation, fire occurrence and precipitation of driest quarter were the key predictors for both the invasive.

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical long short-term memory (H-LSTM) model with attention, where the first layer encodes local-temporal correlations between EEG time-samples in local epochs and the second layer encodes the temporal correlations between epochs in a sequence.

The program is intended as an il lustration of one approach to programming when the behavior to be learned involves discrimination training. A learning program or a part of a pro gram is usually designed to carry out specific be havioral processes, e. g. , acquisition of a response or discrimination of stimuli. Most available pro grams consist of a rather difficult to describe com bination of such basic behavioral processes. For the purpose of research in programming, it seems fruitful to isolate the separate functions of pro grammed sequences so that they can be subjected to individual study and so that the several functions can be most efficiently combined. Investigations of this kind, i. e., the study of programming techniques relevant to particular learning processes, are required for the transla tion of behavioral principles into instructional pro cedures. Program writing will be improved to the extent that the program writer can use a working knowledge of the behavioral principles involved. This paper is an attempt to show how one such basic principle, discrimination training, was applied in a rather \"pure\" form to the construction of a pro gram. The application of the discriminative training paradigm to human learning programs rests on simple assumptions and permits a clear specifica tion of the procedure to be followed. In bringing a bout discriminative control, it is simply required that the desired response be elicited in the presence of the stimulus which is to acquire discriminative properties, and that reinforcement be contingent upon such an occurrence. It must be assumed at the beginning of discrimination training that the re sponse over which control is sought exists at some strength in the repertoire of the organism. If the response is weak or improbable, it can be elicited in the presence of the discriminative stimulus by presenting, in addition, some stimulus which pre", "year": 1962, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/00220671.1962.10882861", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Educational Research", "mag_id": "2055376550", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["55825669", "60250526", "55995992"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:144484594"}

The Router throttling is a popular method to response against DDoS attacks. Currently, coordinated team learning (CTL) has adopted tile coding for continuous state representation and strategy learning. It is suitable for this distributed challenge but lacks robustness. Our first contribution is that we adapt deep network as function approximation for continuous state representation, as a deep reinforcement learning approach is robust in many different Atari games with a little modification of the learning architecture. Furthermore, current multiagent router throttling methods only consider traffic-reading information. Therefore, for a homogeneous team scenario, all agents can share parameters with the same deep network. However, for heterogeneous team scenarios, if all agents still share one deep network, the learning policy may not be sufficiently ideal. Our second contribution is that we add team structure information so that all agents can still share one deep network. However, deep reinforcement learning is a considerably time-consuming task. Transfer learning is an appropriate method because learning policy in a simple scenario allows us to transfer the policy to other different and even complex scenarios. For transfer learning regarding the DDoS control problem, we propose a progressive transfer learning approach, which is our third contribution. Therefore, we can learn a better policy with less time consumption. Moreover, with progressive transfer learning, we can promote our method in a more complex environment.

As not all frames may characterize the underlying action---many are common across multiple actions---pooling schemes that impose equal importance on all frames might be unfavorable. In an attempt to tackle this problem, we propose discriminative pooling, based on the notion that among the deep features generated on all short clips, there is at least one that characterizes the action. To identify these useful features, we resort to a negative bag consisting of features that are known to be irrelevant, for example, they are sampled either from datasets that are unrelated to our actions of interest or are CNN features produced via random noise as input. With the features from the video as a positive bag and the irrelevant features as the negative bag, we cast an objective to learn a (nonlinear) hyperplane that separates the unknown useful features from the rest in a multiple instance learning formulation within a support vector machine setup. We use the parameters of this separating hyperplane as a descriptor for the full video segment. Since these parameters are directly related to the support vectors in a max-margin framework, they can be treated as a weighted average pooling of the features from the bags, with zero weights given to non-support vectors. Our pooling scheme is end-to-end trainable within a deep learning framework.

In addition, Random Forest (RF) classification methods were performed to classify the main agricultural cover type over the study area for the 2017/2018 cropping season. The results demonstrated the ability of fitted NDVI data and RF classification to identify the main agricultural systems, which are: 1) irrigated annual crop, 2) irrigated perennial crop, 3) rainfed areas and 4) fallow. Analysis of trend patterns based on fitted NDVI values shows high variability over the farming systems. Irrigated annual and perennial crops present high improvement of biomass activity with a small inter-variability with significant trend. For the Rainfed area and fallow, these classes show a non-significant trend with low degradation of productivity.

High quality treatment plans maximally radiate the targets while minimally radiating healthy organs at risk.

If the targets or organs at risk are mislabelled, or the segmentations are of poor quality, the safety of the radiation doses will be erroneously reviewed and an unsafe plan could proceed. We propose a technique to automatically label groups of segmentations of different structures from a radiation therapy plan for the joint purposes of providing quality assurance and data mining. Given one or more segmentations and an associated image we seek to assign medically meaningful labels to each segmentation and report the confidence of that label. Our method uses random forests to learn joint distributions over the training features, and then exploits a set of learned potential group configurations to build a conditional random field (CRF) that ensures the assignment of labels is consistent across the group of segmentations. The CRF is then solved via a constrained assignment problem. We validate our method on 1574 plans, consisting of 17 579 segmentations, demonstrating an overall classification accuracy of 91.58%.

Despite well-designed controllers, robots often fail due to unexpected events. Robots under a sense-plan-act paradigm do not have an additional loop to check their actions. In this work, we present a principled methodology to bootstrap online robot introspection for contact tasks. In effect, we seek to enable the robot to recognize and expect its behavior, else detect anomalies. We postulated that noisy wrench data inherently contains patterns that can be effectively represented by a vocabulary. The vocabulary is obtained by segmenting and encoding data. And when wrench information represents a sequence of sub-tasks, the vocabulary represents a set of words or sentence and provides a unique identifier. The grammar, which can also include unexpected events, was classified both offline and online for simulated and real robot experiments. Multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used offline, while online probabilistic SVMs were used to give temporal confidence to the introspection result. Our work's contribution is the presentation of a generalizable online semantic scheme that enables a robot to understand its high-level state whether nominal or anomalous. It is shown to work in offline and online scenarios for a particularly challenging contact task: snap assemblies. We perform the snap assembly in one-arm simulated and real one-arm experiments and a simulated two-arm experiment. The data set itself is also fully available online and provides a valuable resource by itself for this type of contact task.

This kind of method redistributes the position of grid points in accordance with the movement of the computational domain without changing their connectivity relations. In this paper, we regard the dynamic mesh problem as a nonlinear distribution problem, and present an efficient parallel mesh deformation method based on the support vector regression (SVR). In each time step, the proposed method first trains three SVRs using the coordinates of the boundary points and their known displacements in each direction as training data, and then predicts the displacements of the internal points of the mesh using the SVRs. After deforming the mesh, a dual-time step flow solver is used to solve the governing equations. Two kinds of parallel strategies are applied for different types of movement. For pre-known moving boundary cases, only a special CPU process is assigned to train the SVRs one time step earlier than the flow computing, so that the training cost will be hidden. For unpredictable moving boundary case, to ensure the consistency of the method running in parallel, the training part of the method is executed with all global boundary points in each decomposed domain. Therefore, each CPU needs to maintain a copy of the entire boundary points via a point-to-point communication. The internal evaluation of the method is predicted separately in each decomposed domain without any data dependency.

More accessible albeit reliable tools for testing of HIV-1 tropism are needed in view of the prompt introduction of CCR5 antagonists in clinical practice. Bioinformatics tools based on V3 sequences might help to predict HIV-1 tropism; however, most of these methods have been designed by taking only genetic information derived from HIV-1 subtype B into consideration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of several genotypic tools to predict HIV-1 tropism in non-B subtypes, as data on this issue are scarce. Plasma samples were tested using a new phenotypic tropism assay (Phenoscript-tropism; Eurofins), and results were compared with estimates of coreceptor usage using eight different genotypic predictor softwares (Support Vector Machine [SVM], C4.5, C4.5 with positions 8 to 12 only, PART, Charge Rule, geno2pheno coreceptor, Position-Specific Scoring Matrix X4R5 [PSSMX4R5], and PSSMsinsi). A total of 150 samples were tested, with 115 belonging to patients infected with non-B subtypes and 35 drawn from subtype B-infected patients, which were taken as controls. When non-B subtypes were tested, the concordances between the results obtained using the phenotypic assay and distinct genotypic tools were as follows: 78.8% for SVM, 77.5% for C4.5, 82.5% for C4.5 with positions 8 to 12 only, 82.5% for PART, 82.5% for Charge Rule, 82.5% for PSSMX4R5, 83.8% for PSSMsinsi, and 71.3% for geno2pheno. When clade B viruses were tested, the best concordances were seen for PSSMX4R5 (91.4%), PSSMsinsi (88.6%), and geno2pheno (88.6%). The sensitivity for detecting X4 variants was lower for non-B than for B viruses, especially in the case of PSSMsinsi (38.4% versus 100%, respectively), SVMwetcat (46% versus 100%, respectively), and PART (30% versus 90%, respectively).

Unfortunately, the shallow layer models cannot capture or utilize high-order nonlinear features in ad data.

These dynamics are characterized by changes in temporal phases (onset-apex-offset) and intensity of emotion/AUs, the appearance of which vary considerably among subjects, making the recognition/detection task very challenging. While state-of-the-art Latent Conditional Random Fields (LCRF) allow one to efficiently encode these dynamics via modeling of structural information (e.g., temporal consistency and ordinal constraints), their latent states are restricted to either unordered (nominal) or fully ordered (ordinal). However, such an approach is often too restrictive since, for instance, in the case of AU detection, the sequences of an active AU may better be described using ordinal latent states (corresponding to the AU intensity levels), while the sequences of this AU not being active may better be described using unordered (nominal) latent states. To this end, we propose the Variable-state LCRF model that automatically selects the optimal latent states (nominal or ordinal) for each sequence from each target class. This unsupervised adaptation of the model to individual sequence or subject contexts opens the possibility for improved model fitting and, subsequently, enhanced predictive performance.

Such attacks are difficult to detect with standard intrusion detection sensors when they are carried out by insiders who have the knowledge of the system. One approach to detect masquerading attacks is to build user profiles and monitor for significant changes in user\u2019s behavior at runtime. Intrusion detectors based on this principle typically have used user command line data to build such profiles. This data does not represent user\u2019s complete behavior in a graphical user interface (GUI)-based system and hence is not sufficient to quickly and accurately detect masquerade attacks. In this chapter, we present a new empirically driven framework for creating a unique feature set for user behavior monitoring on GUI-based systems. For proof-of-concept demonstration, we use a small set of real user behavior data from live systems and extract parameters to construct these feature vectors. The feature vectors contain user information such as mouse speed, distance, angles, and amount of clicks, and keystroke dynamics during a user session. We then formulate our technique of user identification and masquerade detection as a binary classification problem and use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to learn and classify user actions as intrusive or benign. We show that our technique based on these feature vectors can provide detection rates of up to 96% with low false positive rates. We have tested our technique with various feature vector parameters and concluded that these feature vectors can provide unique and comprehensive user behavior information and are powerful enough to detect masqueraders.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-444-53859-8.00014-X", "venue": null, "journal": "Handbook of Statistics", "mag_id": "24286040", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52963507", "15011026", "15959476"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59633661"}

The Microcystis aeruginosa complex (MAC) is ubiquitous worldwide. Their large colony size and relatively low numerical abundance imply that MAC abundance and presence are usually underestimated in traditional phytoplankton quantifications, which are based on samples of small volume. The objective of this work was twofold: (a) evaluate four sampling strategies of increasing sampling size to detect MAC organisms and (b) asses the predictability of MAC presence using easy-to-measure environmental variables. Sampling strategies were (I) 5\u201325 mL sedimented water samples inspected under inverted light microscope; (II) 20 L of water samples inspected by on-board naked-eye; (III) samples collected by towing a 25 \u03bcm pore size net inspected under light microscope; (IV) naked-eye inspection of 1000\u20137000 L concentrated water samples collected using a 115 \u03bcm-pore plankton net. We evaluated these objectives in a large environmental gradient (800 km) from freshwater to marine water (salinity range = 0\u201333) covering a wide range of temperatures (10\u201333 \u00b0C), underwater turbidity (0\u2013158 NTU) and wind intensity (0\u20138 ms \u22121 ). Classification Random Forest models (presence/absence of MAC organisms) were constructed and evaluated for each strategy by randomly partitioning data into training (2/3) and test (1/3) sets. A systematic increase in average accuracy (from 51 to 90%) and sensitivity (from 45 to 94%) towards methods with larger sampling size was found ( i.e. I\u2013IV). The best obtained model showed a high accuracy (90%) and sensitivity (94%) to detect MAC presence. These results suggest that the presence of MAC organisms can be accurately predicted using easy-to-measure environmental variables once sampling size is adequate.

Such scenarios can contribute to poor BCI performance, and real-world applications for imagined speech-based BCIs cannot assume homogeneity in user data. Transfer Learning (TL) is a common approach used to improve generalizability in machine learning models through transfer of knowledge from a source domain to a target task. In this study, two distinct TL methodologies are employed to classify EEG data corresponding to imagined speech production of vowels, using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Both TL approaches involved conditional training of the CNN on all subjects, excluding the target subject. A subset of the target subject data was then used to fine-tune either the input or output layers of the CNN. Results were compared with a standard benchmark using a within-subject approach.

As the immunogenicity of peptide epitopes is dependent on their binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, the prediction of binding affinity is a prerequisite to the reliable prediction of epitopes. Existing computational prediction approaches can be roughly classified into two distinct types, one categorizes peptides as \"strong binders\" and \"weak binders\", namely qualitative predictions. And the other makes predictions about the precise binding affinities, namely, quantitative prediction. Recently, the modeling of MHC-peptide binding has come to emphasize quantitative predictions. We proposed a relevance vector machine (RVM) based approach, named RVMMHC for quantitative modeling. Our approach adopted the same encoding scheme as used in SVRMHC but chose relevance vector machine to build the predicting models. When applied to the MHC-peptide binding systems of three mouse class I MHC alleles, the RVMMHC models produced more accurate predictions than those produced by linear models which had represented a significant advance in existing methods such as SYFPEITHI, BIMAS and RANKPER. Further analyses showed that SVRMHC gained slightly better performance than RVMMHC, while RVMMHC had better sparsity and some other advantages.

The aim of this study was to evaluate classification algorithms based on ASOCT measurements for the detection of gonioscopic angle closure. Design Cross-sectional study. Participants We included 2047 subjects aged \u226550 years. Methods Participants underwent gonioscopy and ASOCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Customized software (Zhongshan Angle Assessment Program, Guangzhou, China) was used to measure ASOCT parameters in horizontal ASOCT scans. Six classification algorithms were considered (stepwise logistic regression with Akaike information criterion, Random Forest, multivariate adaptive regression splines, support vector machine, naive Bayes' classification, and recursive partitioning). The ASOCT-derived parameters were incorporated to generate point and interval estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curves for these algorithms using 10-fold cross-validation as well as 50:50 training and validation.

However, due to the boundary uncertainty problem in manual annotations, pixel-to-pixel matching based loss functions are too restrictive for simultaneous gland detection and boundary detection. State-of-the-art approaches adopted multi-model schemes, resulting in unnecessarily high model complexity and difficulties in the training process. In this paper, we propose to use one single deep learning model for accurate gland instance segmentation. To address the boundary uncertainty problem, instead of pixel-to-pixel matching, we propose a segment-level shape similarity measure to calculate the curve similarity between each annotated boundary segment and the corresponding detected boundary segment within a fixed searching range. As the segment-level measure allows location variations within a fixed range for shape similarity calculation, it has better tolerance to boundary uncertainty and is more effective for boundary detection. Furthermore, by adjusting the radius of the searching range, the segment-level shape similarity measure is able to deal with different levels of boundary uncertainty. Therefore, in our framework, images of different scales are down-sampled and integrated to provide both global and local contextual information for training, which is helpful in segmenting gland instances of different sizes. To reduce the variations of multi-scale training images, by referring to adversarial domain adaptation, we propose a pseudo domain adaptation framework for feature alignment. By constructing loss functions based on the segment-level shape similarity measure, combining with the adversarial loss function, the proposed shape-aware adversarial learning framework enables one single deep learning model for gland instance segmentation. Experimental results on the 2015 MICCAI Gland Challenge dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with one single deep learning model.

As the services gain more popularity, more experts are needed to keep up with a growing demand. Alternatively, automated question answering module can help shorten the question-answering cycle. When the system receives a new user submitted question, the similarity of the user's request and the existing questions in the archive can be compared. If the appropriate match is found, the system then uses the associated answer to response to such request. Since a question is relatively short and two questions might contain very few words in common, the challenge is how to effectively identify the similarity of questions. In this paper, we focus on the problem of identifying questions that convey the similar information need. That is, our goal is to find paraphrases of the original questions. To achieve this, we propose a hybrid approach that combines semantic, syntactic, and question category to judge question similarity.

Decision Forest was used to train ER \u03b2 binding prediction model based on a large set of compounds obtained from EADB. Model performance was estimated through 1000 iterations of 5-fold cross validations. Prediction confidence was analyzed using predictions from the cross validations. Informative chemical features for ER \u03b2 binding were identified through analysis of the frequency data of chemical descriptors used in the models in the 5-fold cross validations. 1000 permutations were conducted to assess the chance correlation. The average accuracy of 5-fold cross validations was 93.14% with a standard deviation of 0.64%. Prediction confidence analysis indicated that the higher the prediction confidence the more accurate the predictions. Permutation testing results revealed that the prediction model is unlikely generated by chance. Eighteen informative descriptors were identified to be important to ER \u03b2 binding prediction. Application of the prediction model to the data from ToxCast project yielded very high sensitivity of 90-92%. Our results demonstrated ER \u03b2 binding of chemicals could be accurately predicted using the developed model. Coupling with our previously developed ER \u03b1 prediction model, this model could be expected to facilitate drug development through identification of chemicals that specifically bind ER \u03b2 or ER \u03b1 .", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5696238", "pubmed_id": "29190972", "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.21723", "venue": "Oncotarget", "journal": "Oncotarget", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2761600385", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["4617644"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23528612"}

Optical remote sensing, although not the most suitable technique for the direct estimation of stand biomass, offers the advantage of providing large temporal and spatial datasets. In particular, information on canopy structure is encompassed in stand reflectance time series. This study focused on the example of Eucalyptus forest plantations, which have recently attracted much attention as a result of their high expansion rate in many tropical countries. Stand scale time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were obtained from MODIS satellite data after a procedure involving un-mixing and interpolation, on about 15,000 ha of plantations in southern Brazil. The comparison of the planting date of the current rotation (and therefore the age of the stands) estimated from these time series with real values provided by the company showed that the root mean square error was 35.5 days. Age alone explained more than 82% of stand wood volume variability and 87% of stand dominant height variability. Age variables were combined with other variables derived from the NDVI time series and simple bioclimatic data by means of linear (Stepwise) or nonlinear (Random Forest) regressions. The nonlinear regressions gave r-square values of 0.90 for volume and 0.92 for dominant height, and an accuracy of about 25 m 3 /ha for volume (15% of the volume average value) and about 1.6 m for dominant height (8% of the height average value). The improvement including NDVI and bioclimatic data comes from the fact that the cumulative NDVI since planting date integrates the interannual variability of leaf area index (LAI), light interception by the foliage and growth due for example to variations of seasonal water stress. The accuracy of biomass and height predictions was strongly improved by using the NDVI integrated over the two first years after planting, which are critical for stand establishment.

The scope of this research is to assess benthoscape discrimination by airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR) bathymetry (ALB) on the basis of statistical parameters derived from the LIDAR waveforms, textural information, and local spatial statistics. Analysis of the underwater camera stations allowed clustering of the stations into groups on the basis of their habitat composition (b-diversity). Twelve descriptive statistics describing the shape of the bottom part of the waveform, also called 12 benthic parameters, were used for discriminating four benthic habitats. A K-means classification and a supervised method based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied to this dataset, and overall accuracies of 67.7% and 89.9% were obtained, respectively. Geostatistical analyses, using 11 textural measures, defined by the gray-level occurrence matrix (GLOM) and the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and three local spatial statistics were then applied to the 12 benthic parameters to enhance the SVM classification performance. The assessment of the contribution of geostatistics into benthic class segmentation was achieved by computation of separability distance. Mean (from the GLOM), mean (from the GLCM) and the local Getis-Ord statistic yielded the best rates of discrimination. These added metrics, integrated with bands related to the 12 benthic parameters, showed that the rate of correct (supervised) classification was thereby improved and increased by 5.3%.

Recent years have witnessed an increasing trend in research on such systems. These systems usually use high dimension feature vectors and therefore involve high complexity. However, there is a general belief that many of the features used in such systems are irrelevant and redundant. So far, many methods for feature dimension reduction in these systems have been proposed, most of which are wrapper-based and thus computationally expensive since system performance is used for feature subset evaluation. This involves system training and performance evaluation for each feature subset, which is a time consuming task. In this paper, we propose a feature selection approach based on Relieff algorithm for ASV systems using support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. This method is wrapper-based but makes use of Relieff weights in order to have a lower using of system performance.

Unfortunately, 40% of patients have a poor or absent response and novel predictive biomarkers are demanding. For the first time, we apply a novel peptidomic methodology and analysis in rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy.

Although fluidised beds are well known systems and are widespread throughout several industrial domains, the implementation of appropriate process control procedures is still extremely difficult. Fluidised bed processes are governed by the hydrodynamic behaviour of the suspended powders. The solution of the hydrodynamic laws in closed form is often not realisable because they are complicated or require large amounts of computational time. In contrast, empirical or simplified analytical models as well as learning machine techniques are often used for the control and automation of fluidised bed processes. Therefore, the current study proposes modelling an EFB coating process using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). SVMs were determined to appropriately match the experimental coating thicknesses and demonstrate good prediction capability.

An encoder-decoder type CNN model is designed for pixel-wise segmentation of the tumor along three anatomical planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) at the slice level. These are then combined, by incorporating a consensus fusion strategy with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) based post-refinement, to produce the final volumetric segmentation of the tumor and its constituent sub-regions. Concepts, such as spatial-pooling and unpooling are used to preserve the spatial locations of the edge pixels, for reducing segmentation error around the boundaries. A new aggregated loss function is also developed for effectively handling data imbalance. The MPS-CNN is trained and validated on the recent Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2018 dataset.

This process is time consuming and the chances of being cheated by the seller are more as there is nobody to guide as to where the buyer can get authentic product and with proper cost. But now-a-days a good number of persons depend upon the on-line market for buying their required products. This is because the information about the products is available from multiple sources; thus it is comparatively cheap and also has the facility of home delivery. Again, before going through the process of placing order for any product, customers very often refer to the comments or reviews of the present users of the product, which help them take decision about the quality of the product as well as the service provided by the seller. Similar to placing order for products, it is observed that there are quite a few specialists in the field of movies, who go though the movie and then finally give a comment about the quality of the movie, i.e., to watch the movie or not or in five-star rating. These reviews are mainly in the text format and sometimes tough to understand. Thus, these reports need to be processed appropriately to obtain some meaningful information. Classification of these reviews is one of the approaches to extract knowledge about the reviews. In this thesis, different machine learning techniques are used to classify the reviews. Simulation and experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed classification methods. It is observed that a good number of researchers have often considered two different review datasets for sentiment classification namely aclIMDb and Polarity dataset. The IMDb dataset is divided into training and testing data. Thus, training data are used for training the machine learning algorithms and testing data are used to test the data based on the training information. On the other hand, polarity dataset does not have separate data for training and testing. Thus, k-fold cross validation technique is used to classify the reviews. Four different machine learning techniques (MLTs) viz., Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) are used for the classification of these movie reviews. Different performance evaluation parameters are used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning techniques.

A failure in either case can have grave implications for patients being treated and practitioners using the system. In this research, we propose the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Time Series (TS) anomaly detection to the problem of confidentiality and availability attacks on EMR systems. The results presented in this paper indicate that confidentiality incident detection is fully achievable using ML, with Support Vector Machines obtaining the highest accuracy, precision and recall of a number of models tested. Results from the availability prototype show that the detection of a message surge is possible within 10 seconds, by using an Exponential Moving Average implementation to identify anomalies in message flow. This finding paves the way for an automated surge defence to be developed, presenting a significant advance over the manual method used today. The feasibility and practicality of implementing these detection systems in a clinical setting are also discussed with consideration of parameter tuning, skill-sets, and data protection.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.smhl.2018.05.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Smart Health", "mag_id": "2799556348", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67319818"}

For pathological study, the images of these microbes are captured using microscopes and image processing is done for further analysis. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends to view at least 300 Field-of-Views (FOV) manually, for diagnosing and reporting the level of infection. These operation involved for analysis requires skilled technician for error free results. When the number of images for diagnosis increases, it becomes cumbersome for the technicians as there is a chance of ambiguity in results, which hampers the sensitivity of the study. In this work, a Cybernetic Microbial Detection System (CMDS) has been proposed. As in the first stage, all field of views are acquired from the specimen using a programmable microscopic stage coupled with an acquisition system. Herein, the user defines a scanning pattern for the microscopic stage movement, which facilitates the data acquisition during specimen screening. In the second stage microbial recognition system is proposed, wherein a transfer learning technique is implemented by customizing Visual Geometry Group (VGG16/19) layered convolution neural network coupled to the Support Vector Machine (SVM). These modified stack layers (VGG + SVM) has been trained/tested with microscopy images of ZN stained Tuberculosis (TB) specimem obtained from a open source database [3] and also acquired microscopy images from several patients sputum smear specimen. The accuracy obtained from the TB recognition system is 83.404 and 86.6% for VGG16-SVM, VGG19-SVM respectively. Thus the proposed screening process reduces the reliance on skilled technicians and facilitates the humanitarian nursing. Hence, the proposed cybernetic system might be useful to human community in remote regions for rapid diagnosis and detection of infectious diseases.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11042-018-6356-z", "venue": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "journal": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": ["49644501", "67420821", "308656", "2078144", "14727192", "25598745", "120540807", "665101", "35555125", "61776378", "16625085", "207763512", "18774207", "2896734", "901444", "206592191", "17089109", "11852371", "15916230", "5804374", "4071727", "25015756", "14124313", "6844431"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49864661"}

In this case the predictive performance of a classifier can be assessed by well-known Performance Measures (PMs) used in flat MC such as precision and recall. The fact that these PMs treat all class labels as independent labels, in contrast to hierarchically structured taxonomies, is a problem. As an alternative, special hierarchical PMs can be used that utilize hierarchy knowledge and apply this knowledge to the extracted hierarchy. This type of hierarchical PM has only recently been mentioned in literature. The aim of this study is first to verify whether HMC measures do significantly improve quality assessment in this setting. In addition, we seek to find a proper measure that reflects the potential quality of extracted hierarchies in the best possible way.

It is being widely used for illegal purposes. Voice disguising can have negative impact on many fields that use speaker recognition techniques which includes the field of Forensics, Security systems, etc. The main challenge of speaker recognition is the risk of fraudsters using voice recordings of legitimate speakers. So it is important to be able to identify whether a suspected voice has been impersonated or not. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to identify disguised voices. The Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is one of the most important feature extraction technique, which is required among various kinds of speech applications. Voice disguising modifies the frequency spectrum of a speech signal and MFCC-based features can be used to describe frequency spectral properties. The identification system uses mean values and correlation coefficients of MFCC and its regression coefficients as the acoustic features. Then Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are used to classify original and disguise voices based on the extracted features. Accurate detection of voices that are disguised by various methods was obtained and the performance of the algorithm is", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2186867770", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["19016145"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17883410"}

For statistical reporting, this text data needs to be mapped to pre-defined codes. Existing research in this field uses the Naive Bayes probabilistic method to build classifiers for mapping. In this paper, we focus on providing guidance on the selection of a classification method. We build a number of classifiers belonging to different classification families such as decision tree, probabilistic, neural networks, and instance-based, ensemble-based and kernel-based linear classifiers. An extensive pre-processing is carried out to ensure the quality of data and, in hence, the quality classification outcome. The records with a null entry in injury description are removed. The misspelling correction process is carried out by finding and replacing the misspelt word with a soundlike word. Meaningful phrases have been identified and kept, instead of removing the part of phrase as a stop word. The abbreviations appearing in many forms of entry are manually identified and only one form of abbreviations is used. Clustering is utilised to discriminate between non-frequent and frequent terms. This process reduced the number of text features dramatically from about 28,000 to 5000. The medical narrative text injury dataset, under consideration, is composed of many short documents. The data can be characterized as high-dimensional and sparse, i.e., few features are irrelevant but features are correlated with one another. Therefore, Matrix factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Non Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF) have been used to map the processed feature space to a lower-dimensional feature space. Classifiers with these reduced feature space have been built. In experiments, a set of tests are conducted to reflect which classification method is best for the medical text classification. The Non Negative Matrix Factorization with Support Vector Machine method can achieve 93% precision which is higher than all the tested traditional classifiers. We also found that TF/IDF weighting which works well for long text classification is inferior to binary weighting in short document classification. Another finding is that the Top-n terms should be removed in consultation with medical experts, as it affects the classification performance.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2665970.2665976", "venue": "DTMBIO '14", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1965229441,2967998918,2089171045", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21432004"}

The group method data handling is used to develop empirical relations between the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and various control variables, including the Reynolds number, the average velocity, the pipe friction coefficient and the pipe diameter. GMDH holds advantage in the case of small data samples due to the optimal choice of the model complexity with automatic adaptation to an unknown level of the data uncertainties.

In this work, we investigate the application of MCA-LM in extracting meaningful connectivity measures aiding in distinguishing healthy controls from individuals presenting with symptoms of HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND), which occurs as a result of HIV infection of the central nervous system. The pairwise connectivity measures provide a high-dimensional representation of connectivity profiles for subjects and are used as features for classification. We adopt feature selection (FS) techniques reducing the number of redundant and noisy features, while also controlling the complexity of the classifiers. We investigate three FS techniques: 1) Kendall's \u03c4, 2) Information Gain Attribute selection 3) ReliefF and two classifiers:1) AdaBoost and 2) Random Forests. Our results demonstrate that MCA-LM consistently outperforms correlation in terms of Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and accuracy. Improved performance with MCA-LM suggests that such a nonlinear approach is better at capturing meaningful connectivity relationships between brain regions. This demonstrates potential for developing novel neuroimaging-derived biomarkers for HAND. Furthermore, FS helps identify connections between anatomical regions that are affected by HAND. In this work, we show that the regions of the basal ganglia and frontal cortex, which are known to be affected by HAND according to current literature, are identified as most discriminative.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31189074", "doi": "10.1016/j.mri.2019.06.001", "venue": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "journal": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "mag_id": "2948720687", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:189815481"}

Acrylamide is produced in carbohydrate foods prepared at high temperatures such as fried potatoes. For this reason, it is crucial for human health to quantitatively measure the amount of acrylamide formed as a result of prolonged cooking at high temperatures. In this thesis, a correlation is demonstrated between measured acrylamide concentrations and NABY (Normalized Area of Brownish Yellow regions) values estimated from surface color properties of fried potato images using a modified form of the k-means algorithm. Same method is used to estimate acrylamide levels of roasted coffee beans. The proposed method seems to be a promising approach for the estimation of acrylamide levels and can find applications in industrial systems. The quality and price of hazelnuts are mainly determined by the ratio of shell weight to kernel weight. Due to a number of physiological and physical disorders, hazelnuts may grow without fully developed kernels. We previously proposed a prototype system which detects empty hazelnuts by dropping them onto a steel plate and processing the acoustic signal generated when kernels hit the plate. In that study, feature vectors describing time and frequency nature of the impact sound were extracted from the acoustic signal and classified using Support Vector Machines.

In this study, we quantify both change and diversification of topics covered in. This is done by analysing the author supplied keywords, since they were electronically captured in 1990. The analysis starts by selecting 40 keywords, related to Medical (M) (7), Data (D) (10), Feature (F) (17) and (AI) (6) methods. Automated keyword clustering shows the statistical connection between the selected keywords. We found that the three most popular topics in CBM are: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Electroencephalography (EEG) and IMAGE PROCESSING. In a separate analysis step, we bagged the selected keywords into sequential one year time slices and calculated the normalized appearance. The results were visualised with graphs that indicate the CBM topic changes. These graphs show that there was a transition from Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to SVM. In 2006 SVM replaced ANN as the most important AI algorithm. Our investigation helps the editorial board to manage and embrace topic change.

Obviously degenerated morphological processing limits the usable vocabulary size for the system and word-level dictionary results in exponential explosion in the number of dictionary entries. For the agglutinative languages, we need sub-word level integration which leaves rooms for general morphological processing. In this paper, we developed a phoneme-level integration model of speech and linguistic processings through general morphological analysis for agglutinative languages and a efficient parsing scheme for that integration.

By using lung CT image, automatic segmentation is done in order to assist the surgeons to remove the portion of lung for the treatment of certain illness such as lung cancer, and tumours. In the proposed method tumour is diagnosed and classified. The main blocks involved in the proposed system are image pre-processing, segmentation of lung region, feature extraction from the segmented region, classification of lung cancer as benign or malignant. Initially pre-processing is used to remove the noise present in CT image using weiner filter, and then segmentation is performed using adaptive threshold algorithm. Tumour is extracted from lung by using Seeded region growing algorithm. Features extracted from the lung tumours using gray level co- occurrence matrix (GLCM). For classification, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used. The main aim of the method is to develop a CAD system for finding the lung tumor using the lung CT images and classify the tumor as Benign or Malignant. The results indicate a potential for developing an algorithm to segment lung tumour and to detect the benign and malignant tumour for treatment planning. Cancer, tumor and nodules that are to be examined are located within the lungs parenchyma, in an area which is usually no more than half of the area of the computed tomography (CT) image slice: this means that a lot of processing time can be saved if the segmentation algorithms only run on this inner part of the lungs area. Moreover, the number of false detection of lesions found in a segmented image is dramatically lower than that found in the same image without segmentation, because no signals at all will be found outside of the lungs. Lung segmentation is a common pre- processing step of lung CAD systems and in general of lung image analysis systems. CT datasets can contain over 1000 images; therefore manually segmenting the lungs is tedious and prone to inter observer variations. That is why an automatic segmentation algorithm for lung extraction from CT patient image is implemented and tested (21). The complexity for finding the lung nodules in radiographs are as follows: \uf0b7 Nodule sizes will vary widely: Commonly a nodule diameter can take any value between a few mille meters up to several centi meters. \uf0b7 Nodules are usually with a great variation in density. \uf0b7 As nodules can appear anywhere in the lung field, they can be hidden by ribs, the mediastinum and structures beneath the diaphragm, resulting in a huge variation of contrast to the background.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14445/22315381/IJETT-V7P241", "venue": null, "journal": "international journal of engineering trends and technology", "mag_id": "2319022636", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28436004"}

Satellite infrared remote sensing is an effective tool for mapping these variables on regional and global scales. A supervised approach, based on support vector machines (SVMs), has recently been developed to estimate surface temperature from satellite radiometry. However, in order to integrate temperature estimates into hydrological or meteorological data-assimilation schemes (e.g., in flood-prevention applications), a further critical input is often required in the form of pixelwise error statistics. This information is important because it quantifies inaccuracies in the temperature estimate computed for each pixel. This letter proposes two novel methods to model the statistics of the SVM regression error on a pixelwise basis. Both approaches take into account the nonstationary behavior of the error itself. This problem has been only recently explored in the SVM literature through the use of Bayesian reformulations of SVM regressions. The methods proposed in this letter extend this approach by integrating it with either maximum-likelihood or confidence-interval supervised estimators. In both cases, the goal is improved modeling of the error contribution due to intrinsic random variability in the data (e.g., noise).

It is obvious that the chances of survival can be increased if the tumor is identified and properly classified at an initial stage. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is one source of brain tumors detection tool and is extensively used in the diagnosis of brain to detect blood clots. In the past, many researchers developed Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems that help the radiologist to detect the abnormalities in an efficient manner. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: The aim of this research is to improve the brain tumor detection performance by proposing a multimodal feature extracting strategy and employing machine learning techniques. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: In this study, we extracted multimodal features such as texture, morphological, entropybased, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and Elliptic Fourier Descriptors (EFDs) from brain tumor imaging database. The tumor was detected using robust machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) with kernels: polynomial, Radial Base Function (RBF), Gaussian; Decision Tree (DT), and Na\u00efve Bayes. Most commonly used Jack-knife 10-fold Cross- Validation (CV) was used for testing and validation of dataset. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The performance was evaluated in terms of specificity, sensitivity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), False Positive Rate (FPR), Total Accuracy (TA), Area under the receiver operating Curve (AUC), and P-value. The highest performance of 100% in terms of Specificity, Sensitivity, PPV, NPV, TA, AUC using Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers based on entropy, morphological, SIFT and texture features followed by Decision Tree classifier with texture features (TA=97.81%, AUC=1.0) and SVM polynomial kernel with texture features (TA=94.63%).

The increased availability of high spatial resolution multispectral satellite imagery and LiDAR datasets combined with the recent evolution of deep learning within remote sensing for object detection and scene classification, provide promising opportunities to map individual tree species with greater accuracy and resolution. However, there are knowledge gaps that are related to the contribution of Worldview-3 SWIR bands, very high resolution PAN band and LiDAR data in detailed tree species mapping. Additionally, contemporary deep learning methods are hampered by lack of training samples and difficulties of preparing training data. The objective of this study was to examine the potential of a novel deep learning method, Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), to identify dominant individual tree species in a complex urban environment within a fused image of WorldView-2 VNIR, Worldview-3 SWIR and LiDAR datasets. DenseNet results were compared against two popular machine classifiers in remote sensing image analysis, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our results demonstrated that: (1) utilizing a data fusion approach beginning with VNIR and adding SWIR, LiDAR, and panchromatic (PAN) bands increased the overall accuracy of the DenseNet classifier from 75.9% to 76.8%, 81.1% and 82.6%, respectively. (2) DenseNet significantly outperformed RF and SVM for the classification of eight dominant tree species with an overall accuracy of 82.6%, compared to 51.8% and 52% for SVM and RF classifiers, respectively. (3) DenseNet maintained superior performance over RF and SVM classifiers under restricted training sample quantities which is a major limiting factor for deep learning techniques. Overall, the study reveals that DenseNet is more effective for urban tree species classification as it outperforms the popular RF and SVM techniques when working with highly complex image scenes regardless of training sample size.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6471063", "pubmed_id": "30875732", "doi": "10.3390/s19061284", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2921401402", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["167238549", "82155575", "35918671", "140651636", "18044742", "14682645", "37130821", "13826115", "34508437", "17054335", "133771040", "9985555", "62323253", "12474966", "120565892", "128810717", "128425675", "17352276", "45891689", "12118055", "4387134", "28170706", "9433631", "115593078", "57201468", "125241334", "14328219", "85497679", "739583", "2844288", "38551311", "3971031", "1978715", "56020691", "24834648", "128761155", "16338297", "18030591", "13334402", "85319737", "128695009", "130441365", "56341730", "85224130", "9467764", "1272282", "84247323", "13319481", "11097589", "123042752", "130255803", "51903355", "215180801", "84256349", "11083202", "15082633", "89141", "206787478", "207763512", "11077516"], "inbound_citations": ["172136699", "197421334", "211032150", "210874380", "195515565"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:80617422"}

This interest stems from the wide range of applications in which change detection methods can be used. Detecting the changes by observing data collected at different times is one of the most important applications of network security because they can provide analysis of short interval on global scale. Research in exploring change detection techniques for medium/high network data can be found for the new generation of very high resolution data. The advent of these technologies has greatly increased the ability to monitor and resolve the details of changes and makes it possible to analyze. At the same time, they present a new challenge over other technologies in that a relatively large amount of data must be analyzed and corrected for registration and classification errors to identify frequently changing trend. In this research paper an approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which embeds a Change Detection Algorithm with Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is proposed. IDS are considered as a complex task that handles a huge amount of network related data with different parameters. Current research work has proved that kernel learning based methods are very effective in addressing these problems. In contrast to Support Vector Machines (SVM), the RVM provides a probabilistic output while preserving the accuracy. The focus of this paper is to model RVM that can work with large network data set in a real environment and develop RVM classifier for IDS. The new model consists of Change Point (CP) and RVM which is competitive in processing time and improve the classification performance compared to other known classification model like SVM.

To achieve an efficient, secure and economically optimal operation in an energy systems, it is necessary to analyze the power system operation in time and perform fast reactions to changes in electrical load. These are highly dependent on an accurate short-term load forecasting. One the other hand, the load prediction is also of great importance for energy suppliers, independent system operators, financial institutes and other parties involved in power generation, transmission, distribution and market. For the energy suppliers, a timely implementation of long-term load forecasting helps the system to improve the network stability and reduce the equipment failures and power outages and ensures a reliable energy supply. This dissertation have tried to propose a new approach toward the problem of load forecasting to provide more accurate results with a lesser error rate compared to the current methods. For this, a methodology based on the Chaos and Concept Drift theories is introduced, in which the Artificial Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) plays the main role in training and testing the model. After a short introduction on the chaos theory and nonlinear systems in the second chapter, the existence of chaos in the electrical load of the Clausthaler Umwelttechnik Forschungszentrum (CUTEC) in the year 2014 as the sample data is examined by three different methods. This chapter also deals with the concept drift as a kind of anomaly existence in time series, which can help to classify the input data based on the similarities and prepare them for a systematic feeding in the training process. The third chapter will briefly provide the basic information on electricity load prediction in general, introducing the classic and modern approaches toward the problem of load forecasting. Afterwards, the most common modern method, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN) will be studied and the result of prediction based on a simple ANN will be presented. The fourth chapter describes a tool for analyzing the use of contextual information by fuzzy neural network. Here, the ANFIS model will be introduced and the results of weekly, monthly and seasonal electrical load prediction based on this model will be presented. The results show, that the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (as one of the main indices in load forecasting) in the ANFIS- based method is roughly 2,1% to 2,6 % which is the lowest reported rate in the similar studies with almost the same data sets and prediction horizon. Subsequently, a chapter will introduce a simulation model in MATrix Labratory (MATLAB) for a decentralized energy system with the case study of the Energy Park at CUTEC institute. This model includes different units such as combined heat and power generation units (CHP), Photovoltaics, Solar thermal panels, boiler and storage systems. The implemented model is validated with EnergyPro, a commercial energy analysis software, and the results from both models have been compared.

However, the availability of a large number of derived features per segmented object can also lead to a time-consuming and subjective process of optimizing the feature subset. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of the advanced feature selection methods of popular supervised classifiers (Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)) for the example of object-based mapping of an agricultural area using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery, in order to optimize their usage for object-based agriculture pattern recognition tasks. In this study, several advanced feature selection methods were divided into both types of classifiers (SVM and RF) to conduct further evaluations using five feature-importance-evaluation methods and three feature-subset-evaluation methods. A visualization method was used to measure the change pattern of mean classification accuracy with the increase of features used, and a two-tailed t-test was used to determine the difference between two population means for both repeated ten classification accuracies. This study mainly contribute to the uncertainty analysis of feature selection for object-based classification instead of the per-pixel method. The results highlight that the RF classifier is relatively insensitive to the number of input features, even for a small training set size, whereby a negative impact of feature set size on the classification accuracy of the SVM classifier was observed. Overall, the SVM Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) seems to be an appropriate method for both groups of classifiers, while the Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) is the best feature-subset-evaluation method. Most importantly, this study verified that feature selection for both classifiers is crucial for the evolving field of Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA): It is highly advisable for feature selection to be performed before object-based classification, even though an adverse impact could sometimes be observed from the wrapper methods.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/ijgi6020051", "venue": "ISPRS Int.

When map data can be used to identify similar places services like tag suggestion could be improved. For the study very detailed crowd-sourced map data was used. In a period of four month places were manually tagged with activities done. A measurement for finding places which are similar in the sense of tagging is also presented. To evaluate our idea, we trained three machine learning classifiers (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes). With a precision of 73% and a recall of 65% Decision Tree performed best.

Initially the performance of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is compared with the existing algorithms for edge detection namely Canny, Prewitt, Roberts, Mexican Hat and Sobel operators. The Ant Colony Optimization used in communication systems has certain limitations when used in edge detection like random initial ant position in the image and the heuristic information being highly dictated by transition probabilities. In this paper, modifications like assigning a well-defined initial ant position and making use of weights to calculate heuristic value which will provide additional information about transition probabilities are used to overcome the limitations. Further a character extraction and segmentation algorithm which uses the concept of Kohonen neural network to identify the position and dimensions of characters is presented along with a comparison with the existing Histogram and Connected Pixels approach. Finally an inductive learning based classification method is compared with the Support Vector Machine based classification method and a combined classification method which uses both inductive learning and Support Vector Machine based approach for character recognition is proposed.

However, it is almost impossible to categorize them manually due to their large volume and rapid growth. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to automatically classify Chinese judgment documents using machine learning algorithms including Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). A judgment document is represented as vector space model (VSM) using TF-IDF after words segmentation. To improve performance, we construct a set of judicial stop words. Besides, as TF-IDF generates a high dimensional feature vector, which leads to an extremely high time complexity, we utilize three dimensional reduction methods. Based on 6735 pieces of judgment documents, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and high classification performance of our proposed method.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-55705-2_1", "venue": "DASFAA Workshops", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2597997863", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["65104578"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9937168"}

Normal account transaction flow shows regularity to some extent, while abnormal account transaction flow manifests itself differently in transaction amount and transaction frequency et al. When compared with those of normal account transaction flow, abnormal account usually shows abnormal change of fund flow caused by money laundering, hot money, private lending or bad management. In this study, based on identification approach between normal account and abnormal account, the characteristics of different industry transaction flow are drew out, and then the classification for normal and abnormal accounts of different industry is well established by the Support Vector Machine model. Thus, the loan monitoring and risk management can be conducted more appropriately and efficiently. Introduction The capital flow of bank account is needed for normal demand of the business activities. However, many abnormal or illegal capital flows may be mingled, which may bring challenges to perfecting finical supervision system and improving supervision method. Until to now, some studies have been conducted on monitoring finical capital flow: Liu et al.[1] distinguished account transaction types through scan statistic method. This method had an effect on distinguishing abnormal transaction. The accuracy of the model was strongly relative with the parameter, and the model parameter setting is strongly subjective, Yang[2] studied the credit card fraud detection model based on Radial-Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM). This model has some flaw that the performance of the model is unstable, Through the RBF (Radial-Basis Function) neutral network technique, Lv et al.[3] proposed a RBF neutral network model for anti-money laundering based on APC-III clustering algorithm and RLS (Recursive Least Square) algorithm. The sensitivity of the accuracy of the model to the parameter variation was strong. For commercial banks, Wang[4] suggested to use the theory of decision tree to identify suspicious customers. Results showed that this method is effective for generating anti-money laundering rules from customer information, while the setting of rules is relatively subjective. Zhu[5] proposed the EMD method for the decision of the abnormal capital flow based on historical information in the same group. The accuracy and confidence level for the model was not calculated. Taking Bank of the Malay Archipelago as an example, Aspalella[6] studied the influence of setting reporting system for suspicious transactions on bank risk monitoring. Pramod et al.[7] structured the regulation frame of anti-money laundering for the bank, and they considered that the information system based on the process control played a critical role in finding fraudulent transactions. Current techniques effectively used in the monitoring of abnormal capital are the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and neutral network technique et al[8]. Some drawbacks of the neutral International Conference on Economic Management and Trade Cooperation (EMTC 2014) \u00a9 2014. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 274 network algorithm are discovered: (1) the model assumption is too strict, for example, uniform distribution of the trained samples is usually required, (2) dimension disaster: overabundant characteristic numbers may cause the algorithm poorly efficient or inefficient, (3) the accuracy of the results: the results from the neutral network algorithm are highly dependent on the prior knowledge and experience of the user. The advantages of using SVM model in the monitoring of bank account flow are as follows: (1) SVM model can solve multidimensional sample issues through linear method. This feature is fit for the multidimensional characteristics of bank account. (2) The assumed conditions of SVM model is not as strict as that of the neutral network technique: the sequence of samples is not required by SVM model. (3) Compared with the neutral network technique, fewer parameters are needed for SVM model. Users can obtain satisfactory classification results from raw data provided that they have some prior knowledge and experience.

H. Karst.), and birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh., Betula pendula Roth), using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The features used for the classifier are radiometric involving different viewing angles, but without textural information. At-sensor radiance (ASR) signals used here were obtained using a four-band Leica ADS40-SH52 airborne sensor. The experiments were carried out in a forest area at Hyytiala, in southern Finland (61\u00b050' N, 24\u00b020' E), which has been widely used for similar purposes, so that detailed tree-level information has been reported previously. The flight was carried out on August 23, 2008. ADS40 ASR measurements can be converted to ground reflectance signatures in two viewing directions using atmosphere and BRDF modeling implemented in Leica XPro 4.2 software. Taking into account the assumptions entailed in the radiometric model, the classification performance of the ground reflectance is evaluated only for the pixel values under sunlit conditions and is compared with the performance of the ASR data. The sunlit and shaded parts of the tree crown were extracted based on the use of LiDAR data for crown shape modeling. The classification results for the real multispectral measurements are compared with the earlier results obtained with simulated Leica ADS40 at-sensor radiance response values which were based on the ground-level high-resolution ground reflectance factor measurements using a single viewing direction. The simulated classification accuracy was 75-79% with the original four bands, while it was up to 85-88%, using the simulated fifth channel. It was found here that the classification accuracy using comparable real ADS40-SH52 four-band data and one viewing angle was 75-79% and increased to 78-82% with two viewing angles. The results show that the best-case classification accuracy with real data can reach 88% if trees are modeled as objects with sunlit and shaded areas, and multiple measurements are available for every tree.

Understanding the current situation and evolution of forests is essential for a sustainable management plan that maintains forests' ecological and socio-economic functions.

This paper investigates the new opportunities offered by using Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery for forest mapping in Belgian Ardenne ecoregion. The first classification objective was to create a forest map at the regional scale. The second objective was the discrimination of 11 forest classes (Fagus sylvatica L., Betula sp., Quercus sp., other broad-leaved stands, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco, Larix sp., Pinus sylvestris L., Picea abies (L.) H.Karst., young needle-leaved stands, other needle-leaved stands, and recent clear-cuts). Method. Two S2 scenes were used and a series of spectral indices were computed for each. We applied supervised pixel-based classifications with a Random Forest classifier. The classification models were processed with a pure S2 dataset and with additional 3D data to compare obtained precisions. Results. 3D data slightly improved the precision of each objective, but the overall improvement in accuracy was only significant for objective 1. The produced forest map had an overall accuracy of 93.3%. However, the model testing tree species discrimination was also encouraging, with an overall accuracy of 88.9%. Conclusions.

The controller is highly vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks which lead to exhaustion of the system resources which causes non-availability of the services given by the controller. It is critical to detect the attacks in the controller at earlier stage. Many algorithms and techniques have been discovered for this purpose. But less work has been done in the field of SDN networks. Using machine learning algorithms for classifying the connections into legitimate and illegitimate is one such solution. We use two machine learning algorithms namely, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and the Neural Network (NN) classifier to detect the suspicious and harmful connections.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICACCI.2017.8126031", "venue": "2017 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)", "journal": "2017 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2775132284", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10352747", "15090794", "17696052", "62195333", "15956833", "40241448", "8203656", "27355178", "206576808", "1367922", "206196289", "9897393"], "inbound_citations": ["67866172", "198931904", "210992051", "212648540", "52198178", "57190159", "199440486", "199004350", "210994602", "201069332"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38813664"}

Most of the applications use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as a signaling protocol to establish and terminate call sessions. To facilitate interconnection, SIP uses gateways and servers that pave way for intruders. However, signaling attack during SIP session causes server congestion and thereby affects Quality of Service (QoS). Existing multiclass SVM uses a maximum of 38 features for achieving low False Positive (FP) with an increased training and testing duration. In this paper, we propose a two-tier fine grained model against signaling attack, by integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an entropy model. The first tier introduces a strong learning phase with minimal feature set classifying the Internet traffic into VoIP and non-VoIP classes. Subsequently, in the second tier VoIP samples are characterized into flooding and non-flooding attacks using an entropy model that is optimized. Performance evaluation results from the experimental test bed shows that the fine grained model detects signaling attacks with high classification accuracy.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TENCON.2015.7372954", "venue": "TENCON 2015 - 2015 IEEE Region 10 Conference", "journal": "TENCON 2015 - 2015 IEEE Region 10 Conference", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2243068160", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16333539", "263548", "3792697", "249590", "22172975", "16187552", "20709113", "59826665", "44329581", "45951629", "45951629", "24208186", "45687192"], "inbound_citations": ["201137555"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20277579"}

We introduce Neural Data Server (NDS), a large-scale search engine for finding the most useful transfer learning data to the target domain.

However, detecting PPIs in the laboratories are both time-consuming and expensive. For this reason, there has been much recent effort to develop techniques for computational prediction of PPIs as this can complement laboratory procedures and provide an inexpensive way of predicting the most likely set of interactions at the entire proteome scale. Although much progress has already been achieved in this direction, the problem is still far from being solved. More effective approaches are still required to overcome the limitations of the current ones. In this study, a novel Multi-scale Local Descriptor (MLD) feature representation scheme is proposed to extract features from a protein sequence. This scheme can capture multi-scale local information by varying the length of protein-sequence segments. Based on the MLD, an ensemble learning method, the Random Forest (RF) method, is used as classifier. The MLD feature representation scheme facilitates the mining of interaction information from multi-scale continuous amino acid segments, making it easier to capture multiple overlapping continuous binding patterns within a protein sequence. When the proposed method is tested with the PPI data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it achieves a prediction accuracy of 94.72% with 94.34% sensitivity at the precision of 98.91%. Extensive experiments are performed to compare our method with existing sequence-based method. Experimental results show that the performance of our predictor is better than several other state-of-the-art predictors also with the H. pylori dataset. The reason why such good results are achieved can largely be credited to the learning capabilities of the RF model and the novel MLD feature representation scheme.

In the proposed learning paradigm, a genetic algorithm (GA), one of the most popular evolutionary algorithms (EAs), is first used to select input features for LSSVM learning, i.e., evolution of input features. Then, another GA is used for parameters optimization of LSSVM, i.e., evolution of algorithmic parameters. Finally, the evolving LSSVM learning paradigm with best feature subset, optimal parameters, and a mixed kernel is used to predict stock market movement direction in terms of historical data series. For illustration and evaluation purposes, three important stock indices, S&P 500 Index, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index, and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Index, are used as testing targets. Experimental results obtained reveal that the proposed evolving LSSVM can produce some forecasting models that are easier to be interpreted by using a small number of predictive features and are more efficient than other parameter optimization methods. Furthermore, the produced forecasting model can significantly outperform other forecasting models listed in this paper in terms of the hit ratio.

Furthermore, we have also introduced a new kind of attack by using a smartphone display for the first time. Extensive experiments are carried out on a large-scale database of 300 unique finger veins collected from 100 subjects. We introduce a new finger vein artefact database collected using three different kinds of artefacts namely: (1) ink jet print (2) laser jet print and (3) smartphone display. An extensive comparison of the proposed scheme with ten different Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed scheme.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SITIS.2015.74", "venue": "2015 11th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems (SITIS)", "journal": "2015 11th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems (SITIS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2282307134", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["29187618", "16384087", "40825157", "621130", "2044072", "14720788", "9956230", "10977279", "14464373", "4883590"], "inbound_citations": ["174820620", "7995455", "30472936", "13812510", "53237383", "203128876", "12422762", "12422762", "208547619", "51957761", "57819941", "4277778", "53091081", "207829125", "1790514", "45843345", "116483956", "9234393", "51904833", "22268087"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9416076"}

Hence, developing a deep learning solution for breast cancer classification is still challenging. Data augmentation is one of the popular approaches to bridge this gap. In this work, we propose to use Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) for data augmentation. The aim of training CGANs is to generate a new set of realistic synthetic images and combine these together with real images to form a new augmented training set. The experiments show that most of the images produced by CGAN are reliable and classification performance with CGAN-based data augmentation can achieve good results.

The objective of dimension reduction algorithms, such as principal component analysis (PCA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), random projection (RP), and auto-encoder (AE), is to reduce the noise or irrelevant information of the data. The features of PCA (eigenvectors) and linear AE are not able to represent data as parts (e.g. nose in a face image). On the other hand, NMF and non-linear AE are maimed by slow learning speed and RP only represents a subspace of original data. This paper introduces a dimension reduction framework which to some extend represents data as parts, has fast learning speed, and learns the between-class scatter subspace.

While a huge amount of information can be retrieved from LUCAS points for monitoring the environmental status of agroecosystems and assessing soil carbon sequestration, a fundamental aspect relating to climate change action is missing, namely nitrous oxide (N2O) soil emissions. To fill this gap, we ran the DayCent biogeochemistry model for more than 11'000 LUCAS sampling points under agricultural use, assessing also the model uncertainty. The results showed that current annual N2O emissions followed a skewed distribution with a mean and median values of 2.27 and 1.71 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Using a Random Forest regression for upscaling the modelled results to the EU level, we estimated direct soil emissions of N2O in the range of 171-195 Tg yr-1 of CO2eq. Moreover, the direct regional upscaling using modelled N2O emissions in LUCAS points was on average 0.95 Mg yr-1 of CO2eq. per hectare, which was within the range of the meta-model upscaling (0.92-1.05 Mg ha-1 yr-1 of CO2eq).

Recent studies have shown that graph structured data are suitable for being embedded in hyperbolic space and that hyperbolic space can be naturally equipped to model hierarchical structures where they outperform Euclidean embeddings. Therefore, we comprehensively consider the hierarchical structure characteristics of graphs, and learn the vector representation of nodes in hyperbolic space by using the principle of generative adversarial learning. By using two models to simultaneously capture hierarchy and similarity and let them compete with each other, the performance of learning is alternately boosted. In this paper, node classification, link prediction and visualization are performed on multiple public datasets. The results show that this method performs well in multiple tasks.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-01012-6_10", "venue": "CCIR", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2892174086", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52303004"}

Director: Thesis Paul Brooks, Associate Professor, Department of Mathematical Sciences The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method has recently gained popularity due to the ease of implementing non-linear separating surfaces. SVM is an optimization problem with the two competing goals, minimizing misclassification on training data and maximizing a margin defined by the normal vector of a learned separating surface. We develop and implement new SVM models based on previously conceived SVM with L1-Norm regularization with ramp loss error terms. The goal being a new SVM model that is both robust to outliers due to ramp loss, while also easy to implement in open source and off the shelf mathematical programming solvers and relatively efficient in finding solutions due to the mixed linear-integer form of the model. To show the effectiveness of the models we compare results of ramp loss SVM with L1-Norm and L2-Norm regularization on human organ microbial data and simulated data sets with outliers.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "635857520", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60347693"}

A core issue of this evaluation is to establish a proper model of chaff cloud. Many opened literatures focuses on same simple random distribution models of the chaff elements. In many cases the diffusion procedure of the chaff cloud, especially in airflow, can not be simply described with functions. So this paper presents a method which can recognize the locations and orientation angles of the chaff element using high speed photography technology and SVM (Support Vector Machine). Then, the VRT (Vector Transport Theory) is used to evaluate the electromagnetic scattering properties of chaff cloud. Firstly, the image obtained by high-speed camera is extracted, and then graying, smoothing and binarizing are successively adopted to obtain the proper binarized image. Then the boundary searching algorithms is performed to find the edge of the chaff elements. According to the extracted contour information of chaff elements, the image is sliced into several segments. Secondly, according to the prior information, the basic database of chaff length and orientation angles is established. Thirdly, SVM is used to find the most similar image in database with the image which is output from high spread camera.

Many researchers believe that supervised learning will become a key technology for extracting information from the flood of data around us. The supervised learning techniques, i.e. learning from examples, can be seen as an implementation of the mappings y = F(x), relying on the fitting of given data pairs {xk ,yk}. The key point is that the fitting should be predictive and uncover an underlyi ng physical law, which is then used in a predictive or anticipatory way. A great number of models implementing the supervised learning techniques have been proposed in lit erature. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Radial Basis Functions (RBF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Fuzzy Logic based models (ANFIS) should be here mentioned. Support Vector Machines, distinctive tools for data classification, are the product of statisti cal learning theory. Recently, a new learning algorithm named Regularized Least Squares Classification (RLSC) has been proposed. The RLSC concept relyies on multivariate function approximation with regularization theory as a natural framework for solving ill-posed problems of approximation. It is worth noting that SVM and RBF models can be regarded as special cases in the framework of approximation and regularization theory. On the other hand, the Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNN) based orthogonal filters can be regarded as a natural implementation of the regularization technique. Using Hamiltonian Neural Networks based spectrum analysis, recognition, and memorization, gives rise to mapping implementations with skew-symmetric and symmetric kernels. The purpose of this chapter is to present how very large scale networks for learning can be designed by using HNN-based orthogonal filters and, specifically, by using 8dimensional (octonionic) modules. The unique feature of HNN is the fact that they can exist as either algorithms or physically implementable devices. In this chapter we mainly concentrate on algorithmic description of HNN-based networks. Moreover, since the structures of HNN can be based on the family of Hurwitz-Radon matrices, we present here how to design large scale nonlinear mappings by using neural networks with weight matrices determined by Hurwitz-Radon matrices. Hence, this chapter consists of the following issues: - Fundamentals of HNN - Family of Hurwitz-Radon matrices - RLSC basics", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/6549", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1564025222", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["19860789", "8946946", "35375529"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117980669"}

However, the modeling of emotion remains elusive due to inherent ambiguity and complexity related to the perception of emotions, interpersonal variabilities, and context-specific interpretations. Here, we present a robust method of modeling 4-D continuous affective space (Valence, Arousal, Like, and Dominance). First, we determined the functional areas and frequency bands related to 4-D affective space. Second, we extracted and selected a set of stable features. For both steps, we used two different feature selection methods namely: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and stability selection method. Moreover, compare their performances. For the RFE, we used Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Tree-based bagging, and for the stability selection, we used Randomized Lasso as an estimator. Empirical analysis on the DEAP data set shows that the stability selection method consistently provides relevant set of bands, electrode location and features over a range of model parameters. We also observed that only a small number of locations (40%\u201363%) and certain frequency bands specifically, gamma band frequency over Superior Temporal Gyrus, Supramarginal Gyrus, and Somatosensory Association Cortex were the highest ranked features across the affective dimensions. The selected features using the stability criteria were used to model 4-D affective space using SVR. Empirical analyses shows that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for Valence, Arousal, Dominance, and Like are 2.13, 2.00, 2.07, and 2.11 respectively. In addition, we also compare the performance of this method with feature fusion and ensemble classification. It was observed that the SVR with selected features outperformed all other approaches.

The aim is to design an automatic Random Forest classifier based on brain-shape pattern extraction, in order to discriminate among Control subjects, patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, and patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease using their MRI data. The features used were rotation and displacement parameters obtained from the rigid-register transformation matrix between each subject\u2019s point cloud model and the brain baseline cloud. Additional features consisted of distance metrics performed over the aligned clouds and the baseline; those metrics attempt to estimate the cerebral cortex deformations. The training set utilized 60 MRI grouped into subsets of 20 studies a class; while the test consisted of 30 not seen data (10 per class). The proposed method achieved up to 87.2% accuracy in the final validation stage.

In this work, we examine current approaches based on set representations and identify their shortcomings. To overcome these shortcomings, we argue for extending the set representation into a graph representation, encoding more relevant information. Attributes associated with the edges of the graph encode the geometric relationships between individual features by making use of the meta data of each feature, such as the position, scale, orientation and shape of the feature region.

Protein self-interaction (SIP) is a special case of PPIs, which plays a key role in the regulation of cellular functions. Due to the limitations of experimental self-interaction identification, it is very important to develop an effective biological tool for predicting SIPs based on protein sequences. In the study, we developed a novel computational method called RVM-AB that combines the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) model and Average Blocks (AB) for detecting SIPs from protein sequences. Firstly, Average Blocks (AB) feature extraction method is employed to represent protein sequences on a Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM). Secondly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is used to reduce the dimension of AB vector for reducing the influence of noise. Then, by employing the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) algorithm, the performance of RVM-AB is assessed and compared with the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) classifier and other exiting methods on yeast and human datasets respectively. Using the fivefold test experiment, RVM-AB model achieved very high accuracies of 93.01% and 97.72% on yeast and human datasets respectively, which are significantly better than the method based on SVM classifier and other previous methods. The experimental results proved that the RVM-AB prediction model is efficient and robust. It can be an automatic decision support tool for detecting SIPs.

However, traditional on-off line prediction methods ignore the specificity of different epileptic subjects (e.g., age and seizures region in brain) and the diversity of epileptic seizure modalities (e.g., seizures during stress and awake state). which leads to low prediction accuracy and poor flexibility. In this paper, sparse group penalty algorithm and incremental learning mechanism are proposed to improve seizure risk prediction. In particular, sparse group penalty algorithm is proposed based on data correlation to incorporate the dependence structure among the features into solving approaches. Then, a relative spectral feature extraction approach is applied to construct a pattern library incrementally.

The system employs deep neural network image encoder to encode a given input image and generates an extremely compact representation (as small as 10 bytes) of the image. At the receiver end, another deep neural network decoder runs on a mobile device which decodes (i.e. generates) the original image from the BLE broadcast messages. We evaluate Deep Beacon's performance using hand-written digit images and different types of RGB images that contain objects such as birds, flowers, and traffic signs. We empirically determine the tradeoffs between the system lifetime and the quality of broadcast images, and determine an optimal set of parameters for our system, under user-specified constraints such as the number of available beacon devices, maximum latency, and life expectancy. We develop a smartphone application that takes an image and user-requirements as inputs, shows previews of different quality output images, writes the encoded image into a set of beacons, and reads the broadcasted image back.

However, with the ever-increasing size of modern datasets, combined with the difficulty of obtaining label information, semi-supervised learning (SSL) has become one of the most remarkable issues in data analysis. In this paper, we propose an I ncremental S elf- L abeling strategy for SSL based on G enerative A dversarial N ets (ISL-GAN), which functions by constantly assigning unlabeled data with virtual labels for promoting the training process. Specifically, during the virtual labeling process, we introduce a temporal-based self-labeling strategy for safe and stable data labeling. Then, to dynamically assign more virtual labels to data during the training, we conduct a phased incremental label screening and updating strategy. Finally, to balance the contribution of samples with different loss during the training process, we further introduce the Balance factor Term (BT). The experimental results show that the proposed method gives rise to state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning results for the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets. Particularly, our model performs well with fewer labeled conditions. With a dataset of only 1,000 labeled CIFAR-10 images with CONV-Large Net, a test error of 11.2% can be achieved, and nearly the same performance with a 3.5% test error can be achieved with both 500 and 1,000 image-labeled SVHN datasets.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2964315", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2999289173", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3074096", "4903005", "125713312", "203850801", "10707042", "58006502", "202688573", "1033682", "6230637", "3699386", "17504174", "108297336", "10970469", "16406313", "6546734", "13123084", "3657192", "16173204", "6104263", "14542261", "16852518", "18268744", "208910191", "4381935", "104291869", "4397268", "52046547", "73729288", "174801147"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210694504"}

Existing person re-id methods rely mostly on implicit solutions, such as seeking robust features or designing discriminative distance metrics. Compared to these methods, human solutions are more straightforward. That is, imagine the appearance of the target person under different camera views before matching target person. The key idea is that human can intuitively implement viewpoint transfer, noting the association of the target person under different camera views but the machine failed. In this paper, we attempt to imitate such human behavior that transfer person image to certain camera views before matching. In practice, we propose a conditional transfer network (cTransNet) that conditionally implement viewpoint transfer, which transfers image to the viewpoint with the biggest domain gap through a variant of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). After that, we obtain hybrid person representation by fusing the feature of original image with the transferred image then perform similarity ranking according to cosine distance.

Numerous machine learning approaches have been examined, aiming at AD computer-aided diagnosis through employing MR image analysis. Conversely, MR brain image changes could be caused by different effects such as aging and dementia. It is still a challenging difficulty to extract the relevant imaging features and classify the subjects of different groups. This paper would propose an automatic classification technique based on feature decomposition and kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) for classifications of progressive MCI (pMCI) vs. normal control (NC), AD vs. NC, and pMCI vs. stable MCI (sMCI). Feature decomposition would be based on dictionary learning, which is used for separation of class-specific components from the non-class-specific components in the features, while KDA would be applied for mapping original nonlinearly separable feature space to the separable features that are linear.

A clear understanding of their evolution and spatial relationships with the city is of great importance to policy formulation, implementation and assessment. In this paper, we propose a new framework based on landscape metrics and transfer learning for the long-term monitoring and analysis of UVs, and we apply it to Shenzhen and Wuhan, two metropolitan cities of China, with high-resolution satellite images acquired from 2003\u20132012 and 2009\u20132015, respectively. In the framework, landscape metrics are used for identifying the UVs and quantifying their evolution patterns on the basis of a city-UV-building hierarchical landscape model. Transfer learning is also introduced to use the samples and features across the spatial and temporal domains, which reduces the time and labor cost, as well as improves the mapping accuracies by 3\u201310%. The results show that the total area of UVs has decreased by less than 6 % in Shenzhen and more than 45 % in Wuhan.

One way is to directly apply a mature dependency graph learned from a source domain to the target domain.

Traditional transfer learning methods mainly focus on numerical data and are not applicable. ::: In this paper, we propose ACRET, a knowledge transfer based model for accelerating dependency graph learning from heterogeneous categorical event streams. In particular, we first propose an entity estimation model to filter out irrelevant entities from the source domain based on entity embedding and manifold learning. Only the entities with statistically high correlations are transferred to the target domain. On the surviving entities, we propose a dependency construction model for constructing the unbiased dependency relationships by solving a two-constraint optimization problem. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ACRET. We also apply ACRET to a real enterprise security system for intrusion detection.

Coastal zones are one of the world\u2019s most densely populated areas and it is necessary to propose an accurate, cost effective, frequent, and synoptic method of monitoring these complex ecosystems. However, misclassification of sediments on exposed intertidal flats restricts the development of coastal zones surveillance. With the advent of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellites, polarimetric SAR satellite imagery plays an increasingly important role in monitoring changes in coastal wetland. This research investigated the necessity of combining SAR polarimetric features with optical data, and their contribution in accurately sediment classification. Three experimental groups were set to make assessment of the most appropriate descriptors. (i) Several SAR polarimetric descriptors were extracted from scattering matrix using Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden and Yamaguchi methods; (ii) Optical remote sensing (RS) data with R, G and B channels formed the second feature combinations; (iii) The chosen SAR and optical RS indicators were both added into classifier. Classification was carried out using Random Forest (RF) classifiers and a general result mapping of intertidal flats was generated. Experiments were implemented using ALOS-2 L-band satellite imagery and GF-1 optical multi-spectral data acquired in the same period. The weights of descriptors were evaluated by VI (RF Variable Importance). Results suggested that optical data source has few advantages on sediment classification, and even reduce the effect of SAR indicators.

Traditional forecasting methods based on a single data source find it hard to cover all these aspects comprehensively, thus limiting model performance. Multi source event forecasting has proven promising but still suffers from several challenges, including 1) geographical hierarchies in multi-source data features, 2) missing values, and 3) characterization of structured feature sparsity. This paper proposes a novel feature learning model that concurrently addresses all the above challenges. Specifically, given multi-source data from different geographical levels, we design a new forecasting model by characterizing the lower-level features' dependence on higher-level features. To handle the correlations amidst structured feature sets and deal with missing values among the coupled features, we propose a novel feature learning model based on an $N$th-order strong hierarchy and fused-overlapping group Lasso. An efficient algorithm is developed to optimize model parameters and ensure global optima.

Arm movements were recognized by flex sensors and motion gestures by Accelerometers. Accelerometers are used to measure acceleration in respect to movement of the sensor in 3D. Flex sensors changes its resistance based on the amount of bend in the sensor. SVM is the classification algorithm used for classification of the samples. LIBSVM (Library for Support Vector Machines) is integrated software for support vector classification, regression and distribution estimation which supports multi class classification. Sensors data is connected to the WI micro dig to digitize the signal and to transmit it wirelessly to the computing device. Feature extraction and Signal windowing were the two major factors which contribute for the accuracy of the system.

The currently identified cyclin motifs and cyclin associated domains do not represent all of the identified and characterized cyclin sequences. We describe a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier, CyclinPred, which can predict cyclin sequences with high efficiency. The SVM classifier was trained with features of selected cyclin and non cyclin protein sequences. The training features of the protein sequences include amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, secondary structure composition and PSI-BLAST generated Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) profiles. Results obtained from Leave-One-Out cross validation or jackknife test, self consistency and holdout tests prove that the SVM classifier trained with features of PSSM profile was more accurate than the classifiers based on either of the other features alone or hybrids of these features.

While ecologists generally are interested in large-scale patterns and the overall quality of SDMs, decision-makers and conservationists focus on the reliability of localized predictions relevant for specific projects. Here, we use the machine learning methods Random Forest and Quantile Regression Forest to predict local abundance of the black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa with prediction intervals, a measure of the probability that a future observation will lie between certain limits. Although the confidence intervals for local predictions are very narrow, the corresponding prediction intervals are very wide. Therefore, the actual numbers of the black-tailed godwit expected at a given point in the field may vary from virtually absent to high density. We conclude that practitioners should lower their expectations of maps based on the currently available SDMs and to be careful when utilizing them for supporting local management decisions.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecoinf.2017.07.003", "venue": "Ecol.

Connectionist models are based upon the information processing properties of neurons in the brain and consist of very many, simple, interconnected processing elements which operate upon simple signals in parallel. The main objective of the work reported here is to show that connectionism may be applied to areas other than cognitive science. ::: A simulation program has been implemented in which a connectionist network performs the real-time planning and control activities required to supervise the movement and processing of parts in a manufacturing system. The concurrency of connectionism is exploited in such a way that production of a part type may be characterised as \u201cparallel\u201d, where many machine tools are specified to perform each one of the operations required to transform raw material into finished product. The connectionist network is able to control all of these machines simultaneously and in real-time so that many parts can be at any stage of completion in a production facility. The precise routing of a part through the production facility is not specified in advance. Instead, the machine to which a part is scheduled next and the route by which it reaches this machine are decided when the part completes its current operation. These decisions are based upon the availabilities of machines at the time the decisions are made. The connectionist network is able to make these decisions, for every part in the production facility, in negligible time. ::: The benefit of this approach is shown when the breakdown of machines is simulated.

HSI data often lie on sparse, nonlinear manifolds whose geometric and topological structures can be exploited via manifold-learning techniques. In this article, we focused on demonstrating the opportunities provided by manifold learning for classification of remotely sensed data. However, limitations and opportunities remain both for research and applications. Although these methods have been demonstrated to mitigate the impact of physical effects that affect electromagnetic energy traversing the atmosphere and reflecting from a target, nonlinearities are not always exhibited in the data, particularly at lower spatial resolutions, so users should always evaluate the inherent nonlinearity in the data. Manifold learning is data driven, and as such, results are strongly dependent on the characteristics of the data, and one method will not consistently provide the best results. Nonlinear manifold-learning methods require parameter tuning, although experimental results are typically stable over a range of values, and have higher computational overhead than linear methods, which is particularly relevant for large-scale remote sensing data sets. Opportunities for advancing manifold learning also exist for analysis of hyperspectral and multisource remotely sensed data. Manifolds are assumed to be inherently smooth, an assumption that some data sets may violate, and data often contain classes whose spectra are distinctly different, resulting in multiple manifolds or submanifolds that cannot be readily integrated with a single manifold representation. Developing appropriate characterizations that exploit the unique characteristics of these submanifolds for a particular data set is an open research problem for which hierarchical manifold structures appear to have merit. To date, most work in manifold learning has focused on feature extraction from single images, assuming stationarity across the scene.

Currently, most spectral libraries are designed to support the classification of land cover types, whereas few are dedicated to agricultural remote sensing monitoring. Here, we gathered spectral observation data on plants in multiple experimental scenarios into a spectral database to investigate methods for crop classification (16 crop species) and status monitoring (tea plant and rice growth). We proposed a set of screening methods for spectral features related to plant classification and status monitoring (band reflectance, vegetation index, spectral differentiation, spectral continuum characteristics) that are based on ISODATA and JM distance. Next, we investigated the performance of different machine learning classifiers in the spectral library application, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and a genetic algorithm coupled with a support vector machine (GA-SVM). The optimal combination of spectral features and the classifier with the highest classification accuracy were selected for crop classification and status monitoring scenarios. The GA-SVM classifier performed the best, which produced an accuracy of OAA = 0.94, Kappa = 0.93 for crop classification in a complex scenario (crops mixed with 71 non-crop plant species), and promising accuracies for tea plant growth monitoring (OAA = 0.98, Kappa = 0.97) and rice growth stage monitoring (OAA = 0.92, Kappa = 0.90).

Effective prediction enables reasonable testing resource allocation, which eventually leads to a more reliable software. Objective The complex structures and the imbalanced class distribution in software defect data make it challenging to obtain suitable data features and learn an effective defect prediction model. In this paper, we propose a method to address these two challenges. Method We propose a defect prediction framework called KPWE that combines two techniques, i.e., Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Weighted Extreme Learning Machine (WELM). Our framework consists of two major stages. In the first stage, KPWE aims to extract representative data features. It leverages the KPCA technique to project the original data into a latent feature space by nonlinear mapping. In the second stage, KPWE aims to alleviate the class imbalance. It exploits the WELM technique to learn an effective defect prediction model with a weighting-based scheme. Results We have conducted extensive experiments on 34 projects from the PROMISE dataset and 10 projects from the NASA dataset. The experimental results show that KPWE achieves promising performance compared with 41 baseline methods, including seven basic classifiers with KPCA, five variants of KPWE, eight representative feature selection methods with WELM, 21 imbalanced learning methods. Conclusion In this paper, we propose KPWE, a new software defect prediction framework that considers the feature extraction and class imbalance issues. The empirical study on 44 software projects indicate that KPWE is superior to the baseline methods in most cases.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.infsof.2018.10.004", "venue": "Inf.

To employ the system effectively and efficiently, one has to be versatile in similarity measures used, and other implementation issues. In order to overcome these shortcomings, researchers in the field of content-based retrieval are making efforts to develop semantic features. However, most of the work done in semantic features indexing build a priori model of a video's structure that is based on domain knowledge; and they are focused on narrow domains like extracting interesting shots from 'soccer', finding 'Tennis' shots etc. In this paper, an adequately domain-independent approach is presented where local features can characterize multimedia data using Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). In our previous work, we have shown that classification in content-based retrieval requires non-linear mapping of feature space. This can normally be accomplished by ANN and SVM. However, they inherently lack the capability to deal with meaningful feature evaluation and large dimensional feature space in the sense that they are inaccurate and slow. These defects can be overcome by employing meaningful feature selection on the basis of discriminative capacity of a feature. The experiments on database consisting of real video sequences show that the speed and accuracy of SVM can be improved substantially using this technique, while execution time can be substantially reduced for ANN. The comparison also shows that improved SVM turns out to be a better choice than ANN.

In order to detect the changes in communities over time, there is a need for algorithms that can detect communities incrementally with proper precision.

With little room \u201cat the top\u201d to track shifting climate envelopes, alpine species may be especially negatively affected by climate-induced habitat fragmentation. We ask how climate change will affect the total amount, mean patch size, and number of patches of suitable habitat for Vancouver Island White-tailed Ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura saxatilis; VIWTP), a threatened, endemic alpine bird. Using a Random Forest model and a unique dataset consisting of citizen science observations combined with field surveys, we predict the distribution and configuration of potential suitable summer habitat for VIWTP under baseline and future (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s) climates using three general circulation models and two greenhouse gas scenarios. VIWTP summer habitat is predicted to decline by an average of 25%, 44%, and 56% by the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively, under the low greenhouse gas scenario and 27%, 59%, and 74% under the high scenario. Habitat patches are predicted to become fragmented, with a 52\u201379% reduction in mean patch size. The average elevation of suitable habitat patches is expected to increase, reflecting a loss of patches at lower elevations. Thus ptarmigan are in danger of being \u201csqueezed off the mountain\u201d, as their remaining suitable habitat will be increasingly confined to mountaintops in the center of the island. The extent to which ptarmigan will be able to persist in increasingly fragmented habitat is unclear. Much will depend on their ability to move throughout a more heterogeneous landscape, utilize smaller breeding areas, and survive increasingly variable climate extremes. Our results emphasize the importance of continued monitoring and protection for high elevation specialist species, and suggest that White-tailed Ptarmigan should be considered an indicator species for alpine ecosystems in the face of climate change.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4631505", "pubmed_id": "26529306", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0142110", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1950838699", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["53409126", "83613026", "6094772", "83936312", "4414279", "210261444", "86743973", "85590738", "54203849", "44236521", "85731375", "84224021", "1705342", "36864195", "44307784", "17496549", "85401998", "84616012", "153453114", "85440316", "87943914", "12856623", "85844250", "86017021", "56374240", "83632013", "21737748", "88308746", "18895899", "88511927", "2319988", "17952309", "15451758", "85857213", "40733284", "53073682", "45920215", "14016397", "3626971", "89141", "2827580", "84510959", "23349242", "83603208", "18256030", "39993315", "25074722", "55909358", "84249108", "53457764", "82808259", "4641071", "83752847", "86351294", "7096448", "38655785", "86389305", "22690027", "84645867", "84758625", "13187378", "16327687", "7853959", "83875953", "24851421"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2228370"}

This is typically accomplished by sending an email message to a user, with a link directing the user to a web site used to collect personal information. Phishing detection systems typically rely on content filtering techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify phishing messages. In the case of spear phishing, however, this may be ineffective because messages from a trusted source may contain little content. In order to handle such emerging spear phishing behavior, we propose as a first step the use of Spectral Clustering to analyze messages based on traffic behavior. In particular, Spectral Clustering analyzes the links between URL substrings for web sites found in the message contents. Cluster membership is then used to construct a Random Forest classifier for phishing. Data from the Phishing Email Corpus and the Spam Assassin Email Corpus are used to evaluate this approach. Performance evaluation metrics include the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC), as well as accuracy, precision, recall, and the (harmonic mean) F measure. Performance of the integrated Spectral Clustering and Random Forest approach is found to provide significant improvements in all the metrics listed, compared to a content filtering technique such as LDA coupled with text message deletion done randomly or in an adaptive fashion using adversarial learning. The Spectral Clustering approach is robust against the absence of content. In particular, we show that Spectral Clustering yields (99.8%, 97.8%) for (AUC, F measure) compared to LDA that yields (94.6%, 89.4%) and (79.6%, 57.9%) when the content of the messages is reduced to 10% of their original size using random and adversarial deletion, respectively.

Firstly, the CEEMD is used to decompose the Acoustic Emission (AE) signal that acquired by cutting tool. The AE signal is adaptively decomposed into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) among with each IMF contains different time scale characteristic.

Patients experiencing POD show increased risk for future cognitive decline, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and, conversely, patients with cognitive decline at surgery show increased risk for POD. Here, we demonstrate that a previously established panel of AD-driven MCI (ADMCI) autoantibody (aAB) biomarkers can be used to detect prodromal AD pre-surgically in individuals admitted into the hospital for hip fracture repair (HFR) surgery. Plasma from 39 STRIDE (STRIDE: A Strategy to Reduce the Incidence of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients) HFR patients and sera from 25 age- and sex-matched non-demented and non-surgical controls were screened using human protein microarrays to measure expression of a panel of 44 previously identified MCI aAB biomarkers. The predictive classification accuracy of the aAB biomarker panel was evaluated using Random Forest (RF). The ADMCI aAB biomarkers successfully distinguished 21 STRIDE HFR patients (CDR = 0.5) from 25 matched non-surgical controls with an overall accuracy of 91.3% (sensitivity = 95.2%; specificity = 88.0%). The ADMCI aAB panel also correctly identified six patients with preoperative CDR = 0 who later converted to CDR = 0.5 or >1 at one-year follow-up. Lastly, the majority of cognitively normal (CDR = 0) STRIDE HFR subjects that were positive for CSF AD biomarkers based on the A/T/N classification system were likewise classified as ADMCI aAB-positive using the biomarker panel.

Also, a novel pattern analysis for fMRI based on the discovered brain regions is proposed in this work. Firstly, to identify which region responds to stimuli, a statistical t-test is used after the scan. Based on these preliminary regions of interest, this study develops discriminant features extracted from multivoxels for cognitive modeling. In total, five parameters are used in the time-series and contextual analysis, including the proposed blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast edge, BOLD contrast centroid, activated voxels, mean, and variance. Furthermore, this study also proposes a test function for examining voxel activation based on variance, so that insignificant voxels and irrelevant outliers can be removed from the features. After the feature extraction from brain regions of interest, the analysis subsequently uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for reducing the feature size. Lastly, this study adopts a computer-aided pattern recognizer, the Support Vector Machine (SVM), to facilitate automation of the proposed analysis. A dataset consisting of brain-scanning images from 22 subjects was used for evaluation. The statistical result shows that the neural circuitry associated with maternal bonds indeed appears in the relevant brain regions as indicated by the other research. Such regions are subsequently used for assessment of the proposed analysis. Classification result shows that the proposed approach can effectively identify activated samples.

Volatility is a quantification of how much a value moves in a time series. It is now customary to assume that volatility of foreign exchange markets is time-varying.

Under high volatility regime, there are chances of high returns but with very high risks. For many nonprofessional traders, the high volatility regimes are periods that they loose with high probability. We believe that giving an early alert of starts of high volatility regimes is beneficial for many nonprofessional traders and for the foreign exchange markets. There are many studies to predict volatility of foreign exchange market by using ARCH or GARCH model with possibly hidden Markov model to represent regimes.

Our experiments on three real-world text datasets show that the proposed approach using binarised Laplacian Eigenmap (LapEig) and linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques significantly.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": "1004.5370", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1835449.1835455", "venue": "SIGIR '10", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2950673190,2743065240,1835419070", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["47308016", "18720176", "14879317", "14503164", "15460579", "60624922", "2941443", "61894598", "62932125", "3116168", "14300215", "13918468", "8216313", "10726702", "207160068", "2309950", "1658773", "7880266", "2427083", "5155714", "207168823", "17797070", "387449", "14482618", "14798917", "60375743", "15335817", "6692382", "1501682", "1113678", "3091", "2051403", "14848918", "7792256", "1236947", "3898511", "14503028", "8109758", "291713", "344349", "11179649"], "inbound_citations": ["2434850", "16187052", "15114148", "9563890", "14412818", "210931358", "9637224", "67922589", "29153990", "215416299", "18725724", "4303168", "19195787", "174802558", "17574759", "47261502", "28022011", "16572331", "3438378", "203598265", "14355364", "58013913", "51927574", "40047973", "18210936", "16580119", "15361180", "7321858", "18738836", "17760740", "10842394", "68327", "6919863", "38270358", "26488999", "7518615", "1596835", "19225076", "1043258", "17246920", "199554907", "18856237", "10074754", "1542098", "15590170", "8958258", "17081330", "6183240", "15623541", "4330670", "54569735", "18444169", "14811827", "16165117", "53080152", "6261591", "8113250", "3331287", "13794651", "17347637", "211729797", "3499217", "58666662", "22688627", "11468788", "11727842", "49901965", "3595890", "14339387", "13933742", "3889511", "12382428", "62045334", "17003189", "49646269", "7768088", "5706227", "32092054", "172210", "18776044", "3693305", "8277389", "53774908", "2011672", "8760309", "19749101", "173991021", "53757775", "49639167", "18091854", "3344122", "51611446", "7277809", "13520491", "13520491", "10527651", "207060279", "3393323", "8147617", "21628403", "16170805", "56055495", "9353042", "14199536", "27445276", "4316428", "16110021", "14066308", "1262273", "462457", "32384185", "5246689", "37030488", "210333511", "58654885", "3691446", "10899916", "6257296", "10553486", "53857761", "207107717", "15005549", "17522273", "1896999", "18691577", "54755282", "207202940", "15305787", "4968455", "5263344", "9582414", "3248198", "3490875", "4342390", "3375221", "1454481", "7391285", "41043070", "197928432", "7990142", "5671282", "15783377", "208881497", "17675449", "12293304", "5321851", "15109520", "15734530", "4837436", "7224908", "7147644", "3621118", "208355425", "7903406", "8662607", "4264738", "5102668", "18876041", "17775762", "16935240", "9637532", "42672006", "10771481", "11307479", "207902022", "211554492", "2529243", "957548", "17562350", "173180527", "7019086", "3450322", "18009171", "24316454", "865622", "25199", "8125601", "1386849", "20609319", "756588", "18454349", "9381935", "11380896", "166228683", "9824152", "8206849", "4514989", "13692090", "26999996", "16231660", "4335958", "3318669", "214996627", "20931328", "2920541", "15449333", "422407", "3070866", "51613177", "15351810", "720091", "15866503", "209696686", "10760779", "11373930", "15749623", "18938228", "67855699", "2459335", "38209787", "4843878", "1799999", "192624981", "27885053", "201669103", "16586088", "2456427", "22822376", "51921050", "1917867", "3892356"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5294049"}

Canada yew foliage contains high concentrations of paclitaxel and other taxanes, which have proven effective in treating many forms of cancer. A major challenge to the sustainable management of wild Canada yew harvest is the lack of a spatial inventory of the resource. The objective of this study was to develop a spatial model to predict the distribution and abundance of Canada yew populations in a forest landscape representative of the boreal forest region of Ontario, Canada. The study was conducted in the Romeo Mallete Forest (RMF) located on the southern edge of the boreal forest west of Timmins, Ontario. Abundance of Canada yew populations was assessed in 140 circular sample plots (5541 m2), established at locations throughout the RMF. Canada yew abundance in each sample plot was estimated as the mean percent cover of three randomly located 100 m2 subplots. Predictor variables were extracted from the Forest Resources Inventory (FRI) of the RMF, and from layers derived from remote sensing data covering the study area. A combination of classification and regression trees with Random Forests analysis was used to develop a classification model for FRI polygons based on patterns of Canada yew abundance, and assess the performance of the model. The classification error rate on the presence/absence model was approximately 21%, and the root mean squared error on the best continuous cover model was 9.1%. In all analyses, the most important classification node was based on percent basal area of the shade-tolerant late successional species Balsam Fir (Abies balsamea (L.)

However, in practical applications, the number of samples available for training is relatively small, so the SAR target recognition can be regarded as a small sample recognition problem. One of the main directions to solve the small sample recognition problem is to realize the data augmentation. Therefore, a SAR image data augmentation method via Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) is proposed in this paper. The method uses Wasserstein GAN with a gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate new samples based on existing SAR data, which can augment the sample number in training dataset. Meanwhile, the sample selection filters are designed to extract the generated samples with high quality and specific azimuth, which can avoid the randomness of the data augmentation, and improve the quality of the newly generated training samples. The experiments based on MSTAR data show that, for three-class recognition problem, when the training sample is only 108, the proposed method can improve the recognition rate from 79% to 91.6%; and for ten-class recognition problem, when the training sample is only 360, the proposed method can improve the recognition rate from 57.48% to 79.59%.

This article presents a novel approach for unsupervised classification of land cover study of hyper-spectral satellite images to improve separation between objects and background by using multi-level thresholding based on the maximum Renyi entropy (MRE). Multi-level thresholding, which partitions a gray-level image into several distinct homogeneous regions, is a widely popular tool for segmentation.

Differential Evolution (DE), a simple yet efficient evolutionary algorithm of current interest, is employed to improve the computation time and robustness of the proposed algorithm. The performance of DE is also investigated extensively through comparison with other well-known nature inspired global optimization techniques.

So, accurate and reliable prediction and estimation of river discharge have been widely considered by many researchers in different fields such as surface water management, design of hydraulic structures, flood control and ecological studies in spetialand temporal scale. Therefore, in last decades different techniques for short-term and long-term estimation of hourly, daily, monthly and annual discharge have been developed for many years. However, short-term estimation models are less sophisticated and more accurate.Various global and local algorithms have been widely used to estimate hydrologic variables. The current study effort to use Lazy Learning approach to evaluate the adequacy of input data in order to follow the variation of discharge and also simulate next-day discharge in Talar River in KasilianBasinwhere is located in north of Iran with an area of 66.75 km2. Lazy learning is a local linear modelling approach in which generalization beyond the training data is delayed until a query is made to the system, as opposed to in eager learning, where the system tries to generalize the training data before receiving queries ::: Materials and Methods: The current study was conducted in Kasilian Basin, where is located in north of Iran with an area of 66.75 km2. The main river of this basin joins to Talar River near Valicbon village and then exit from the watershed. Hydrometric station located near Valicbon village is equipped with Parshall flume and Limnogragh which can record river discharge of about 20 cubic meters per second.In this study, daily data of discharge recorded in Valicbon station related to 2002 to 2012 was used to estimate the discharge of 19 September 2012. The mean annual discharge of considered river was also calculated by using available data about 0.441 cubic meters per second. To estimate the discharge of considered day, three methods of constant, linear and quadratic functionscontrollers based on the local linearization provided by the lazy learning algorithm were considered. Lazy learning is a memory-based linear technique for local modeling approach which is reported as a high-efficient algorithm for simulating variables with low input data.The series of input data was categorized into previous 6, 8, 10, 15 and 20 days, 1 and 2 months, 1, 2 and 3 seasons and also 1 and 2 years to evaluate which series is appropriately enough to predict next-day discharge inthe river. Then, mean absolute error and root-mean square error were calculated for all series and modelsin order to find the best estimator model and the most appropriate series of input data. ::: Results: Results showed that constant and linear model had the minimum root-mean square error of 0.001 and 0.057 respectivelywith previous 60 days\u2019 data series. Whilethe quadratic model had its best estimation with previous 2 season data series with the minimum root-mean square error of 0.059. The result indicated that the more input data increase, the best quadratic model estimate until 60 days. But after 60 days, estimation error gradually increased. Consequently, not more data but adequate areneeded for accurate estimation. Also, RMSE in linear model had less fluctuation and therefore less sensitivity compared with other models. And quadratic model had less fluctuation and sensitivity to neighborhoods. Also, according to results, the more variation in each period increase, the better estimation is accrued by lazy learning algorithm. Hence, it was expected that next-day discharge prediction in low-water period needs longer data series than high-water period. ::: Conclusion: Regarding to thousands of prepared training models, constant model with previous 60 days\u2019 data and minimum error of 0.0001 was selected as the most accurate estimatefor next-day river discharge in Talar River. Results showed that despite of some limitation and demerits, the local Lazy Learning algorithm has significant efficiency in time series simulating. Although the accuracy of simulation increase with more input data, but this algorithm can runby at least 5 training data. However we find lazy learning to be the best performing approach on average goodness indicators (such as mean absolute error and Root-mean square error). On the other hand, the lazy learning predictor can be quickly developed and easily kept up-to-date by adding new data to its database. Also, it does not face with overfitting problems which are common in global modeling approaches.According to some noteworthy features of lazy learning noticed in this regards, this approach will have good performance for time-series studies.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.22067/jsw.v30i6.47522", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2589764725", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64427292"}

Their measurement is generally based on well logging and experiments after core sampling. In this study, we present a different approach from these methods to evaluate the characteristics of organic matter, which is based on the numerical simulations in combination with machine learning technologies. Formation heating processes of organic-rich shales and in-situ pyrolysis of kerogen are numerically simulated, where the time-series data of heater temperature are monitored. Here, we consider the whole organic matter composed with kerogen. The monitored heater temperature data are used as an input of inverse modeling by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to figure out the characteristics of kerogen. Heater temperature acts as an indicator of type and maturity of kerogen, since it is affected by the bulk thermal conductivity of formation, which is a function of dynamically changing rock-and-pore composition by kerogen decomposition. We simulate the processes of electrical heating of 300 different formations, containing either one of Type 1, 2, or 3 kerogen with various amounts and activation energies. ANN method is employed to generate a data-driven model to estimate the unknown kerogen content and activation energy using heater temperature as an input data. SVM method, which categorizes dataset into the multiple classes by using hyperplanes, is applied to classify the dataset of heater temperature into different types of kerogens. Developed ANN and SVM models show great performances in the inversion and classification. The suggested characterization method provides a simple tool of estimating reactivity and type of kerogens.

In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) based solution to augment training data for improved performance of palmprint recognition. An improved Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Net (DCGAN) is first devised to generate high quality plamprint images by replacing convolutional transpose layer with linear upsampling and introducing Structure Similarity (SSIM) index into loss function. As a result, the generated images have discriminative features, increased smoothness and consistency, and less variance compared to those generated by the baseline DCGAN.

A level playing field is created for the models by means of a single data transformation to keep the input of all models equal. This level playing field is achieved by using Weight of Evidence to create a scaled data set without outliers or missing values.

The research shows that the added value of the machine learning approach over the traditional (logistic) regression approach is present. Where the machine learning algorithms can handle all variables and decide for themselves how to model the relationships between the variables, the (logistic) regression approaches need careful selection of subsets of independent variables.

This can result in unstable classifiers, which perform poorly on unseen data. In this work we present a way to overcome this limitation by aggregating several support vector machines in to an ensemble. Different ensemble systems, including bagging, boosting and tree-based models, were investigated for a FTIR data set acquired from different types and stages of breast cancer. It was found that an ensemble system predicts 88.9% of the unseen multi-class test set correctly. In comparison a single classifier only achieved a predictive performance of 66.7%.

We show that the new adaptive approach combines the benefit of a class of non-adaptive procedures and gives the best performance of this class across a variety of situations.

However, the diagnostic reliability of ultrafast high-frame rate plane-wave (PW) imaging is reduced by its low-quality images. The medical ultrasound equipment on the market usually adopts the line-scanning mode, which can obtain high-quality images at a very low frame rate. In addition, many proven data-driven ultrasound image processing methods are trained by line-scan images. Since the gray-level distributions of line-scan images and PW images are very different, these gray-level distribution-sensitive methods cannot be generalized to ultrafast ultrasound imaging, which limits further applications. Hence, we propose an ultrasound-transfer generative adversarial network to improve the quality of PW images and extend the existing image processing methods to ultrafast ultrasound imaging by reconstructing PW images into line-scan images. This network adopts a residual dense generator with a self-attention system that fully uses the hierarchical features and generates details from all the relevant physiological information. A projection discriminator and spectral normalization are introduced to increase the discernibility and to maintain a balance between the generator and the discriminator. Moreover, we reorganize the transmit sequence of the transducer array to eliminate the negative influence of human movements and facilitate the convergence of the proposed model. The experimental results are evaluated with five metrics, which confirm the feasibility of the proposed method to obtain a line-scan-quality image with a very high frame rate.

However, it is difficult to directly map woody vegetation and herbaceous vegetation in the dryland from the satellite images due to the mixture of their distribution at small scale. Emerging UAV remote sensing provides a good opportunity to capture and quantify the distribution of the sparse vegetation in the drylands ecosystem. In this study, we proposed a new method to classify woody vegetation and herbaceous vegetation and calculate their FVC based on the high-resolution orthomosaic generated from UAV images by the machine learning algorithm of classification and regression tree (CART). This proposed method was validated and evaluated by visual interpretation, the detailed ground measurement dataset of 4832 trees and 18,798 shrubs and three popular machine learning algorithms of Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random Forest(RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT). The overall assessments showed good overall accuracy (0.78), average accuracy (0.76), and the Kappa coefficient (0.64). The FVC of woody vegetation calculated from orthomosaic agreed well with that estimated from ground measurements. Both group of FVC have a stable linear relationship over different spatial scales. The proposed method showed higher efficiency of 166%, 111% and 290% than SVM, RF, GBDT respectively. A new optimized model was developed to reduce the workload of vegetation investigation and to design more efficient sampling strategies. The proposed method was incorporated into an interactive web-based software \u201cUAV- High Resolution imagery Analysis Platform\u201d (UAV-HiRAP, http://www.uav-hirap.org ). Our study demonstrates that UAV-HiRAP combined with UAV platform can be a powerful tool to classify woody vegetation and herbaceous vegetation and calculate their FVC for sparse vegetation in the drylands.

To this end, we reformulate distance metric learning problem as finding a feasible point of a constraint set where the embedding vectors of the training data satisfy desired intra-class and inter-class proximity. The feasible set induced by the constraint set is expressed as the intersection of the relaxed feasible sets which enforce the proximity constraints only for particular samples (a sample from each class) of the training data. Then, the feasible point problem is to be approximately solved by performing alternating projections onto those feasible sets. Such an approach introduces a regularization term and results in minimizing a typical loss function with a systematic batch set construction where these batches are constrained to contain the same sample from each class for a certain number of iterations. Moreover, these particular samples can be considered as the class representatives, allowing efficient utilization of hard class mining during batch construction. The proposed technique is applied with the well-accepted losses and evaluated on Stanford Online Products, CAR196 and CUB200-2011 datasets for image retrieval and clustering.

{"paper_id": "68576621", "title": "Identification of drug-resistance predictive genes in breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy", "authors": [{"first": "Lorenza", "middle": [], "last": "Mittempergher", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and markers for therapy response remain poorly defined. Since the effectiveness of treatment differs between individual patients, during the last years much effort has being invested in the identification of new markers, to estimate patients's outcome (prognostic markers) and to indicate which treatment is most effective for an individual patient (predictive markers). ::: The implementation of predictive factors in clinical setting is a big challenge of the cancer research and it will provide the opportunity to guide treatment decisions. Only patients that are likely to benefit from a specific treatment will receive this specific treatment. An individualized therapy will avoid the administration of ineffective chemotherapy that increases mortality and decreases quality of life in cancer patients. ::: For many years research has focused on the identification of single markers predicting tumour response to chemotherapy. However it is unlikely that the chemotherapy resistance/responsiveness in breast cancer is the result of one or limited number of genes, because of the complexity of pathways involved in tumour response to chemotherapy and the heterogeneity of the individual tumours. The microarray technology made possible to study gene expression profiling of breast cancer on a global scale. It was successfully applied on the identification of breast cancer subgroups and profiles predicting patient's prognosis. More recently microarrays have been also focused on identifying gene expression profiles predicting response to chemotherapy. With the introduction of preoperative chemotherapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) it has become possible to directly evaluate the sensitivity of breast cancer to chemotherapy by the clinical/pathological response of the patient to the treatment. The main goal of this thesis was to identify predictive genes of response to a specific neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen based on paclitaxel and anthracyclines (doxorubicin and epirubicin) drugs in breast cancer patients. ::: From 41 pre-treatment breast tumours biopsies good quality RNA was obtained and gene expression profiling was performed. Gene expression patterns of 37 patients were analyzed using Operon v2.0 70mer oligos collection at CRIBI Biotech centre and 4 patients were profiled with Operon v3.0 70mer oligos collection at Netherlands Cancer Institute. Clinical responses of 34 (out of 41) patients were recorded after administration of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Complete Responses (CR) to the treatment were observed in 3 patients, Partial Responses in 18 (PR) patients, No Change of the tumour mass (NC) in 11 patients and Progressive Disease (PD) in 2 patients. ::: First of all, a correlation analysis between the ImmunoHistoChemical data of six prognostic markers (ER, PR, Erb-B2, Bcl-2, Ki-67, p53) and the gene expression data was carried out. The results showed a significant correlation for ER, PR and Bcl-2 markers. Moreover Bcl-2 status measured by ImmunoHistoChemistry (IHC) was significantly associated with the clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. ::: The molecular subtypes of 37 breast tumours analyzed with Operon v2.0 were identified using the \"intrinsic gene signature\" of Perou and colleagues. Most part of the patients were luminal-like subtype (28 of 37), 7 patients showed an erb-B2+ molecular subtype and 2 patients belonged to the basal-like group. Since it was reported that breast cancer molecular subtypes respond differently to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, I also checked how the clinical response to the treatment were associated to the molecular subtypes. From the analysis emerged that the luminal-like and erb-B2+ molecular subtypes were enriched of PR patients. ::: A hierarchical cluster analysis on the pre-treatment tumours (analyzed with Operon v2.0 and with clinical response available) was performed in order to evaluate how the patients would have been separated on the basis of their gene expression profile, using an unsupervised approach. As expected, no clear separation between Responders (PR + CR) and Non Responders (NC + PD) was found. The results did not change if we included in the responder group only the PR patients. We hypothesized that the predictive genes of resistance/sensitivity to the chemotherapy were a subtle set. The high number of differentially expressed genes would have masked the \"real\" predictive gene set, leading to a clustering of the patients based on biological parameters different from the clinical response. In addition the small size of the dataset was a limiting factor in the analysis. ::: In light of this result we opted for a supervised approach that consisted in dividing the tumours into Responders and Non Responders and searching for the genes (the drug-resistance predictive genes) that could correctly distinguish the two classes of response. I considered two datasets of patients, the dataset I including PR patients against not responders patients (NC + PD) and the dataset II with responders patients (PR and CR) against not responders patients (NC + PD). ::: The first approach, based on the software PAM (Prediction Analysis of Microarray), did not give a good prediction performance on both dataset of patients, misclassifying ca 36% of patients. Therefore, a more effective analysis in terms of classification accuracy was requested. A gene selection process based on the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) was considered a good choice in light of the characteristics of the study: low number of patients (examples) and high number of genes (or features). SVMs are a supervised learning algorithm that work well at high dimensionality, overcoming the risk of overfitting due to a number of features much larger than the numbers of examples. A specific recursively feature selection procedure based on SVMs (R-SVM) was used to select the set of genes with the lowest error of classification on the dataset of patients. Because of the small sample size, it was not possible to have a training set and a test set completely separated, so a Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOO-CV) procedure was used to assess the performance of the feature selection process. The analysis identified a set of 54 genes able to classify the 28 patients of the dataset I with an accuracy of 85% (4 patients misclassified on 28) and a set of 14 genes able to classify the 30 patients of the dataset II with an accuracy of 76% (7 patients misclassified on 30). The lower accuracy obtained on the dataset II was attributed to the introduction of the cCR patients in the group of Responders. The cCR patients were probably too much dissimilar in terms of clinical response in respect to the PR patients, thus rendering the group of Responders not enough homogeneous. For this reason I focused the following analysis only on the dataset I. ::: The accuracy of 85% obtained for the dataset I was an encouraging result although the small size of the dataset. ::: The biological function and cellular localization of the 54 genes was examined by using GoMiner, a web tool to find associations of Gene Ontology categories within a specific group of genes. As emerged from the analysis, there were several functional categories related to the tumourigenesis processes (\"cell adhesion\", \"insulin receptor signaling pathway\", \"cell proliferation\", \"regulation of cell proliferation\"). Some categories were more closely related to cellular processes and compartments target of the chemotherapy agents used in this study (\"cell cycle\", \"cell cycle arrest\", \"nucleus\") and to responsiveness to the treatment (\"response to hypoxia\"). ::: A literature research focused on each gene of the predictive signature showed that some of these genes (MYC, NUF2, SPC25; KFL5, CDKN1b, ITGA6, POSTN) are 'biologically plausible', since they have some connections with the drug resitance phenomenon investigated in this study. Others of the 54 genes are related to breast cancer progression and metastasis (CXCL9, CEBPD, IRS2, TCF8, ADAMTS5, PPARGC1A), but their direct involvement in drug resistance to paclitaxel/anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not emerged. ::: At this point of my analysis, I tried to find out how to use the 54 genes signature as a predictive tool of responsiveness to paclitaxel/anthracyclines based chemotherapy treatment. On the basis of the 54 genes was trained a SVM model that could be used to classify a new patient, not yet classified, as partial responder or not responder. However, the SVM output is a value not so easily usable in statistics prediction problems. Therefore using a sigmoid function, we translated the SVM outputs into probability values that offered a more direct evaluation of the response class of the patient. In practice we transformed the SVM scores obtained for each patient of the dataset in a measure of probability, from 0 to 1, of belonging to the positive class of response (PR patients). Using the trained SVM model on a new, not-yet classified patient, it will make possible to map his SVM score on the sigmoid function and to have a corresponding probability value to belong to the positive class of response. ::: The results reported in this thesis look promising but have to be considered as preliminary, since they were obtained from a study investigating only a small number of patients and need to be validated in a completely independent test set of patients. Thus a validated gene expression signature may improve our understanding of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response mechanisms and in the future may lead to more individual, patient-tailored therapy decisions.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "207820657", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:68576621"}

Our work focused on a semi-structured workshop designed around the Psychoactive Substances Bill (PSB).

Current research has concentrated on analogical transfer \u2013 a mechanic is able to fix a type of car he has never seen before by comparing it to cars he has fixed before. This approach is typical of case-based reasoning systems and has been successful on a wide variety of problems [Watson, 1997]. When a new problem is encountered, a database of previously solved problems is searched for a problem with similar features. The solution to the most similar problem is selected, adapted and then applied to the new problem. Similar methods exist for adapting reinforcement learning policies [Taylor and Stone, 2009]. We refer to the above approaches as solution adaptation algorithms \u2013 a pair of problems are matched on similarity and the solution to the first problem, after some adaptation, is applied to the second problem. The solution adaptation approach requires three things. First, the two problems must be substantially similar in surface or structural features. Second, there must exist a clear method of adapting one solution to another. This is typically done through manually-authored feature mappings or adaptation rules. Third, problem similarity must imply solution similarity. The \u201csimilar feature, similar solution\u201d assumption does not hold for all domains. One such domain is tower defense. Tower defense (TD) is a broad category of spatial reasoning puzzles that share a common theme \u2013 a set of agents follow a path through a maze (the map) and the player must prevent them from making it to the exit by placing \u201cdefense towers\u201d at strategic locations. There are many different tower defense games, each with their own set of towers. The majority of these games have pieces that fit into one of five archetypes: slow but strong, fast but weak, area of effect (AoE), damage over time (DoT) and slowing. The specific traits of each tower and their relative strengths vary from game to game. There are hundreds of TD games, most with multiple maps, making it a good domain for investigating multiple levels of transfer learning. It is not, however, a good candidate for solution-adaptation algorithms. Problem (maze) similarity does not imply solution (piece placement) similarity. Small differences in mazes can lead to qualitatively different solutions and there is no clear way to adapt one maze\u2019s solution to another. Figure 1: Training map in GopherTD.

In this article, we propose a predictive model that integrates transfer learning and degeneracy under a Bayesian framework. Theoretical properties of the proposed model are studied. Finally, we present an application of modeling the predictive relationship between transcription factors and gene exp...", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4912055", "pubmed_id": "27330227", "doi": "10.1080/00401706.2015.1044117", "venue": "Technometrics : a journal of statistics for the physical, chemical, and engineering sciences", "journal": "Technometrics : a journal of statistics for the physical, chemical, and engineering sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1942239643", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1813055", "10790217", "207752942", "4976551", "60624922", "8153773", "33540060", "719551", "16336251", "6670058", "15764546", "15840053", "618399", "51985230", "8905975", "16162039", "205383514", "18237764"], "inbound_citations": ["93002792", "252760", "59231778", "57755575", "202543745", "52899882"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28245118"}

They also help in early prediction of disease by accurate interpretation of medical data. Disease management strategies can further be improved by the detection of early signs of disease. This early prediction, moreover, can be helpful in controlling the symptoms of the disease as well as the proper treatment of disease. Machine learning approaches can be used in the prediction of chronic diseases, such as kidney and heart diseases, by developing the classification models. In this paper, we propose a preprocessing extensive approach to predict Coronary Heart Diseases (CHD). The approach involves replacing null values, resampling, standardization, normalization, classification, and prediction. This work aims to predict the risk of CHD using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbours. Also, a comparative study among these algorithms on the basis of prediction accuracy is performed. Further, $K$ -fold Cross Validation is used to generate randomness in the data. These algorithms are experimented over \u201cFramingham Heart Study\u201d dataset, which is having 4240 records. In our experimental analysis, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbour achieved an accuracy of 96.8%, 92.7%, and 92.89% respectively.

That is to say, the image frame patch can be sparse linear combinations of basis elements. However, most of these existing methods fail to consider the local geometrical structure in the space of the training data. To take this crucial issue into account, this paper proposes a method named double sparsity regularized manifold learning (DSRML).

This form includes two risk scales for a gestalt physician assessment of risk (Suicide Likelihood scale, suicide Attempt Likelihood scale) and the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA).

A major part of this puzzle is sketch identification using either 2D gestures \u2014 which is commonly recorded from mouse, light pen and touchpad \u2014 or air gestures captured from some newly emerged devices such as Leap Motion and Soft-Kinect. To this end, we present a leaning based technique for segmentation of air gestures. The proposed technique can detect the separation points of any single-stroke air gesture using specific motion features such as speed, curvature and center of curvature. Two types of separation points are considered: 1) rough separation points or simply corner points and 2) soft separation points such as inflection points. The segmentation is performed in two steps: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to adaptively differentiate the corner points from regular points. A soft segmentation method is then implemented to further break the rough segments into a set of smaller arcs and lines based on sudden change in the center of curvature. The experimental validation shows robust performance of the proposed method and low computation expenses.Copyright \u00a9 2014 by ASME", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/DETC2014-34809", "venue": "Volume 1B: 34th Computers and Information in Engineering Conference", "journal": "Volume 1B: 34th Computers and Information in Engineering Conference", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2314653187", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["15246313", "15620907", "7782972", "9862224", "23080242", "2538253", "991181", "14286223", "1479998", "17909134", "82107", "26581201", "9791050"], "inbound_citations": ["204231024"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18660896"}

But, unlike NER systems, we address a deeper task: classifying the detected locations into names of cities, provinces/states, and countries in order to map them into physical locations. We approach the task in a novel way, consisting in two stages. In the first stage, we train Conditional Random Fields (CRF) models that are able to detect the locations mentioned in the messages. We train three classifiers: one for cities, one for provinces/states, and one for countries, with various sets of features. Since a dataset annotated with this kind of information was not available, we collected and annotated our own dataset to use for training and testing. In the second stage, we resolve the remaining ambiguities, namely, cases when there exists more than one place with the same name. We proposed a set of heuristics able to choose the correct physical location in these cases.

This paper studies the classification problem of the digestive organs for wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) images aiming at saving the review time of doctors. Our previous study has proved the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based WCE classification system is able to achieve 95% classification accuracy in average, but it is difficult to further improve the classification accuracy owing to the variations of individuals and the complex digestive tract circumstance. Research shows that there are two possible approaches to improve classification accuracy: to extract more discriminative image features and to employ a more powerful classifier. In this paper, we propose to design a WCE classification system by a hybrid CNN with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). In our approach, we construct the CNN as a data-driven feature extractor and the cascaded ELM as a strong classifier instead of the conventional used full-connection classifier in deep CNN classification system. Moreover, to improve the convergence and classification capability of ELM under supervision manner, a new initialization is employed. Our developed WCE image classification system is named as HCNN-NELM. With about 1 million real WCE images (25 examinations), intensive experiments are conducted to evaluate its performance.

They can be found in several fields, ranging from the Internet to social sciences, biology, epidemiology, geography, finance, and many others. In the literature, several methods have been proposed for the analysis of network data, but they usually focus on homogeneous networks, where all the objects are of the same type, and links among them describe a single type of relationship. More recently, the complexity of real scenarios has impelled researchers to design methods for the analysis of heterogeneous networks, especially focused on classification and clustering tasks. However, they often make assumptions on the structure of the network that are too restrictive or do not fully exploit different forms of network correlation and autocorrelation. Moreover, when nodes which are the main subject of the classification task are linked to several nodes of the network having missing values, standard methods can lead to either building incomplete classification models or to discarding possibly relevant dependencies (correlation or autocorrelation). In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning approach for multi-type classification. We adopt the system Mr-SBC, which is originally able to analyze heterogeneous networks of arbitrary structure, within an ensemble learning approach. The ensemble allows us to improve the classification accuracy of Mr-SBC by exploiting i) the possible presence of correlation and autocorrelation phenomena, and ii) the classification of instances (which contain missing values) of other node types in the network. As a beneficial side effect, we have also that the models are more stable in terms of standard deviation of the accuracy, over different samples used for training. Experiments performed on real-world datasets show that the proposed method is able to significantly outperform the standard implementation of Mr-SBC. Moreover, it gives Mr-SBC the advantage of outperforming four other well-known algorithms for the classification of data organized in a network.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TKDE.2018.2822307", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2900791133,2604015085", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3950297", "6877426", "3941626", "9545845", "7914981", "307055", "15227652", "15144827", "1220904", "1625479", "62016134", "10025478", "773070", "1052837", "12824453", "524493", "40167516", "2654660", "9232391", "122671539", "121621272", "16193644", "498773", "3757350", "10189148", "1480930", "7679549", "2282762", "17037483", "16596248", "8542016", "15051251", "62226424", "15646167", "14682102", "937841", "19682573", "207738357", "34725013"], "inbound_citations": ["203579261", "53033659", "212649257", "202561875", "106411777", "155754086", "199540893", "68107902"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52075606"}

To address this issue, we aim to learn a facial expression classification model from several labeled source databases and generalize it to target databases. This is achieved by integrating domain alignment and class-compact features learning across source domains. Domain alignment paves the way to involve more expression-related representations. Learning compact features can signicantly diminish the intra-class divergence, which is beneficial to both domain alignment and expression recognition.

We find that although exact classification is impossible, several other useful, robust kinds of classification are permitted. The representation of structured information and constituent structure are considered, and we find a basis for more flexible rule-like processing than that permitted by conventional methods.

However, synthesizing multiple heterogeneous features to learn a comprehensive description of the data samples is challenging. To tackle this problem, many methods explore the correlations among various features across different views by the assumption that all views share the common semantic information. Following this line, in this letter, we propose a new unsupervised multiview nonnegative correlated feature learning (UMCFL) method for data clustering. Different from the existing methods that only focus on projecting features from different views to a shared semantic subspace, our method learns view-specific features and captures inter-view feature correlations in the latent common subspace simultaneously. By separating the view-specific features from the shared feature representation, the effect of the individual information of each view can be removed. Thus, UMCFL can capture flexible feature correlations hidden in multiview data. A new objective function is designed and efficient optimization processes are derived to solve the proposed UMCFL.

However, results of these studies, such as the prediction accuracy, are not satisfying and many contradictory conclusions are achieved in previous research works. These controversies are triggered by several factors, including the non-Gaussian distributions and multicollinearity of urban social data, inaccuracy and inadequacy of the processed data, etc. To fill these gaps, we analyzed the influence of 18 urban indicators within 6 categories including geography, economy, education, housing, urbanization and population structure on crime risk in China\u2019s major prefecture-level cities by year. We used the big data algorithm, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Extremely-randomized Trees (Extra-Trees), to predict the crime risk and quantify the influence of urban parameters on crime. 83% of accuracy on crime risk prediction can be obtained from our fitted model and the importance of urban indicators is ranked.

Firstly, the auxiliary variables and the dominant variables of soft sensor model are determined based on the analysis of the mechanism of marine protease fermentation process. Secondly, considering the regularization parameter and kernel parameter are the difficulties in the LS-SVM modeling, Bayesian theory is used to optimal select parameters of LS-SVM, and then a soft sensor model is established by LS-SVM based on Bayesian Criteria. The simulation results show that the modeling has higher prediction precision and better generalization ability characteristics than LS-SVM.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.13031/aim.20131687326", "venue": "2013 Kansas City, Missouri, July 21 - July 24, 2013", "journal": "2013 Kansas City, Missouri, July 21 - July 24, 2013", "mag_id": "2025347588", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109411371"}

Usually features are represented as vectors that capture expert knowledge of measurable discriminative properties of the classes to be distinguished. The feature selection process entails manual expert involvement and repeated experiments. Automatic feature selection is necessary when (i) expert knowledge is unavailable, (ii) distinguishing features among classes cannot be quantified, or (iii) when a fixed length feature description cannot faithfully reflect all possible variations of the classes as in the case of sequential patterns (e.g. time series data). Automatic feature selection and extraction are also useful when developing pattern recognition systems that are scalable across new sets of classes. For example, an OCR designed with explicit feature selection process for the alphabet of one language usually does not scale to an alphabet of another language. ::: One approach to avoiding explicit feature selection is to use a (dis)similarity representation instead of a feature vector representation. The training set is represented by a similarity matrix and new objects are classified based on their similarity with samples in the training set. A suitable similarity measure can also be used to increase the classification efficiency of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs). ::: In this thesis we establish new techniques for sequential pattern recognition without explicit feature extraction for applications where: (i) a robust similarity measure exists to distinguish classes and (ii) the classifier (such as SVM) utilizes a similarity measure for both training and evaluation. We investigate the use of similarity measures for applications such as on-line signature verification and on-line handwriting recognition. Paucity of training samples can render the traditional training methods ineffective as in the case of on-line signatures where the number of training samples is rarely greater than 10. We present a new regression measure (ER 2) that can classify multi-dimensional sequential patterns without the need for training with large number of prototypes. We use ER 2 as a preprocessing filter in cases when sufficient training prototypes are available in order to speedup the SVM evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of a two stage recognition system by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) in the supervised classification framework of SVM.

Among these methods, the most common used method is statistical modeling, and the most applied algorithms are linear/multiple linear regression models (LM). There are only a handful of studies using machine learning algorithm models such as random forest (RF) or cubist regression (CB). In particular, there is no study comparing different combinations of four MODIS LST datasets with or without auxiliary data using different algorithms such as multiple linear regression, random forest, and cubist regression for daily Ta-max, Ta-min, and Ta-mean estimation. Our study examines the mentioned combinations of four MODIS-LST datasets and shows that different combinations and differently applied algorithms produce various Ta estimation accuracies. Additional analysis of daily data from three climate stations in the mountain area of North West of Vietnam for the period of five years (2009 to 2013) with four MODIS LST datasets (AQUA daytime, AQUA nighttime, TERRA daytime, and TERRA nighttime) and two additional auxiliary datasets (elevation and Julian day) shows that CB and LM should be applied if MODIS LST data is used solely. If MODIS LST is used together with auxiliary data, especially in mountainous areas, CB or RF is highly recommended. This study proved that the very high accuracy of Ta estimation (R2 > 0.93/0.80/0.89 and RMSE ~1.5/2.0/1.6 \u00b0C of Ta-max, Ta-min, and Ta-mean, respectively) could be achieved with a simple combination of four LST data, elevation, and Julian day data using a suitable algorithm.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs9050398", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2609881461", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["9629950", "2304660", "49230787", "128594451", "120229618", "130445226", "84372020", "140668711", "51835471", "128621194", "14848187", "128612843", "128674017", "17811750", "133477215", "128736264", "46380904", "129890542", "154565239", "10674355", "40145554", "5789230", "16608422", "44367592", "129024991", "132353946", "21966264", "24710895", "60246745", "89141", "1056674", "2327460", "60428484", "129933270", "140566639", "55060256", "4662311", "150549023", "55959922"], "inbound_citations": ["198145892", "145872092", "191152540", "203074488", "210135982", "125733557", "92979232", "125385949", "58653133", "210473737", "126358169", "8093991", "204268589"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13489066"}

However, relevance by itself may not be enough to guarantee recommendation usefulness. Promoting novelty and diversity in tag recommendation not only increases the chances that the user will select \u201csome\u201d of the recommended tags but also promotes complementary information (i.e., tags), which helps to cover multiple aspects or topics related to the target object. Previous work has addressed the tag recommendation problem by exploiting at most two of the following aspects: (1) relevance, (2) explicit topic diversity, and (3) novelty. In contrast, here we tackle these three aspects conjointly, by introducing two new tag recommendation methods that cover all three aspects of the problem at different levels. Our first method, called Random Forest with topic-related attributes, or RFt, extends a relevance-driven tag recommender based on the Random Forest (RF) learning-to-rank method by including new tag attributes to capture the extent to which a candidate tag is related to the topics of the target object. This solution captures topic diversity as well as novelty at the attribute level while aiming at maximizing relevance in its objective function. Our second method, called Explicit Tag Recommendation Diversifier with Novelty Promotion, or xTReND, reranks the recommendations provided by any tag recommender to jointly promote relevance, novelty, and topic diversity. We use RFt as a basic recommender applied before the reranking, thus building a solution that addresses the problem at both attribute and objective levels. Furthermore, to enable the use of our solutions on applications in which category information is unavailable, we investigate the suitability of using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to automatically generate topics for objects. We evaluate all tag recommendation approaches using real data from five popular Web 2.0 applications. Our results show that RFt greatly outperforms the relevance-driven RF baseline in diversity while producing gains in relevance as well. We also find that our new xTReND reranker obtains considerable gains in both novelty and relevance when compared to that same baseline while keeping the same relevance levels. Furthermore, compared to our previous reranker method, xTReD, which does not consider novelty, xTReND is also quite effective, improving the novelty of the recommended tags while keeping similar relevance and diversity levels in most datasets and scenarios. Comparing our two new proposals, we find that xTReND considerably outperforms RFt in terms of novelty and diversity with only small losses (under 4p) in relevance. Overall, considering the trade-off among relevance, novelty, and diversity, our results demonstrate the superiority of xTReND over the baselines and the proposed alternative, RFt. Finally, the use of automatically generated latent topics as an alternative to manually labeled categories also provides significant improvements, which greatly enhances the applicability of our solutions to applications where the latter is not available.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2801130", "venue": "TIST", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2270188535", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17530455", "3077937", "42930867", "32187082", "16350677", "18906127", "38097220", "2643537", "6334682", "7572506", "1137993", "17660556", "11517775", "799275", "11318288", "52827488", "6045884", "2398876", "3205721", "11344526", "16710202", "18075416", "1260117", "15676013", "15868523", "14131330", "14351979", "6787551", "18639022", "9551273", "5705857", "6284787", "14321266", "2708853", "19060446", "9542680", "119048760", "207177737", "207197436", "2547490", "15684768", "8194873", "207167403", "7564979", "18524717", "13843474", "15121534", "440027", "1662064", "16349160", "6798468", "14950459", "2956587"], "inbound_citations": ["192490084", "43753490", "201883249", "199509943", "39077589"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16369243"}

These kernel functions are incorporated into the pairwise potential of CRF model to improve the ability of the model. Afterwards, the piecewise training and Bayesian inference are proposed to achieve the object-based segmentation.

Faces are located using a spatial ratio template tracker algorithm. Optical flow of the face is subsequently determined using a real-time implementation of a robust gradient model. The expression recognition system then averages facial velocity information over identified regions of the face and cancels out rigid head motion by taking ratios of this averaged motion. The motion signatures produced are then classified using Support Vector Machines as either nonexpressive or as one of the six basic emotions.

Finally, experimental results on benchmark data sets validate the effectiveness of the improved scheme.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics", "mag_id": "2398101415", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124589254"}

In this paper, a colorimetric detection system was coupled with a new color calibration method for detection under complex ambient light conditions. A 3 \u00d7 4 colorimetric probe array was used to display the color changes of different analytes. With the color calibration function and the Support Vector Machine discrimination function based on the RGB data captured at 5000 K preloaded in a remote server, the analysis results could be fed back immediately after sending the RGB data captured under complex ambient light conditions by the smartphone to the remote server. The discrimination results showed that this colorimetric detection system has a relatively high accuracy under complex ambient light conditions. An optimal probe selection algorithm (OPSA) based on the improvement of the traditional stepwise discriminant analysis was also proposed to dramatically reduce the number of probes for the identification of various analytes. The analysis results showed that this algorithm significantly simplifies the probe array and the simplified probe array kept exhibiting a good classification performance.

We have developed an oral cancer risk index using DNA index value to quantitatively assess cancer risk in patients with oral leukoplakia, but with limited success. In order to improve the performance of the risk index, we collected exfoliative cytology, histopathology, and clinical follow-up data from two independent cohorts of normal, leukoplakia and cancer subjects (training set and validation set). Peaks were defined on the basis of first derivatives with positives, and modern machine learning techniques were utilized to build statistical prediction models on the reconstructed data. Random forest was found to be the best model with high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (99.2%). Using the Peaks-Random Forest model, we constructed an index (OCRI2) as a quantitative measurement of cancer risk. Among 11 leukoplakia patients with an OCRI2 over 0.5, 4 (36.4%) developed cancer during follow-up (23 \u00b1 20 months), whereas 3 (5.3%) of 57 leukoplakia patients with an OCRI2 less than 0.5 developed cancer (32 \u00b1 31 months). OCRI2 is better than other methods in predicting oral squamous cell carcinoma during follow-up. In conclusion, we have developed an exfoliative cytology-based method for quantitative prediction of cancer risk in patients with oral leukoplakia.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5542248", "pubmed_id": "28545021", "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.17550", "venue": "Oncotarget", "journal": "Oncotarget", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2611603023", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["206806639", "6645641", "11894470", "74063220", "10053628", "24355552", "37450185", "15035294", "215179916", "1722130", "20202085", "25398419", "20057340", "38778775", "19079316", "38571520", "205533179", "73206815", "44771409", "10243699", "44783633", "25937985", "13878006", "396877", "22966667", "44698882", "13199090", "206350975", "15150512", "11924067", "30286019", "15135070", "10772206", "38332937", "68782094"], "inbound_citations": ["58637483", "48354373", "49882824", "214873245", "53106436"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4875241"}

In the last decade, highly efficient face recognition systems have been developed that extensively use the nature of the image domain to achieve accurate real-time performance.

Support vector machine learning is a relatively recent method that offers a good generalization performance in classification problems like face recognition. An algorithm based on Gabor texture information with SVM classifier is demonstrated in this book.The estimated model parameters serve as texture representation and experiments were performed on Yale,ORL and FERET databases to validate the feasibility of the method. The results showed that both Gabor magnitude and Gabor phase based texture representation technique with SVM classifier significantly outperformed the widely used Gabor energy based systems and other existing subspace methods.

Most current single image SR methods use empirical risk minimisation, often with a pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss. ::: However, the outputs from such methods tend to be blurry, over-smoothed and generally appear implausible. A more desirable approach would employ Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference, preferring solutions that always have a high probability under the image prior, and thus appear more plausible. Direct MAP estimation for SR is non-trivial, as it requires us to build a model for the image prior from samples. Here we introduce new methods for \\emph{amortised MAP inference} whereby we calculate the MAP estimate directly using a convolutional neural network. We first introduce a novel neural network architecture that performs a projection to the affine subspace of valid SR solutions ensuring that the high resolution output of the network is always consistent with the low resolution input. We show that, using this architecture, the amortised MAP inference problem reduces to minimising the cross-entropy between two distributions, similar to training generative models. We propose three methods to solve this optimisation problem: (1) Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) (2) denoiser-guided SR which backpropagates gradient-estimates from denoising to train the network, and (3) a baseline method using a maximum-likelihood-trained image prior. Our experiments show that the GAN based approach performs best on real image data. Lastly, we establish a connection between GANs and amortised variational inference as in e.g. variational autoencoders.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1610.04490", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2537458122,2950560720", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["7201816", "18828233", "10578341", "6593498", "8758543", "1033682", "1605979", "9433631", "1036792", "8785311", "211227", "6635779", "18245806", "14570343", "107645"], "inbound_citations": ["211066414", "195347056", "202764721", "53715265", "204008145", "52922902", "145895760", "53041283", "53245685", "53011298", "52070776", "10366219", "51629981", "52145130", "56895592", "202763864", "51714608", "49337895", "22341613", "52048515", "52284182", "202760019", "26873455", "4679427", "201645237", "52036885", "46939522", "201701924", "53046534", "44033959", "32788347", "203581380", "28244118", "18265100", "22066308", "204897849", "209414931", "56012030", "159040565", "46898260", "132283318", "10186982", "5824780", "84187209", "4008212", "211004079", "88517649", "208030059", "202786346", "71717159", "31613184", "115150096", "211506594", "2349418", "9803807", "1142468", "14570343", "199442429", "6610705", "52281312", "43925777", "10183447", "1176485", "91056614", "9768941", "13002849", "3355038", "53082914", "4504215", "1245517", "195776423", "42767017", "10014283", "54212601", "54058392", "67855714", "2830751", "8478736", "166228128", "21667538", "46941169", "3659701", "16665285", "202712852", "29185976", "203634280", "3508638", "203626522", "6603928", "21282813", "209515526", "202540701", "91176158", "23519254", "3398677", "58029008", "23101662", "166228440", "195821312", "49311919", "119151914", "73488576", "14191515", "208527619", "8525940", "174798336", "59158847", "204766779", "3936209", "132039519", "181950201", "15427058", "119313959", "1277217", "204008419", "9302801", "208206423", "49530438", "214641021", "207871056", "22852474", "59842963", "211531452", "71151728", "47017552", "60441776", "54440751", "8131021", "211020567", "13818971", "204734464", "48585536", "125942897", "68137503", "210839653", "20404279", "59222854", "208526887", "3865906", "53209473", "155100183", "3882452", "62841491", "27706557", "149790550", "13680765", "13354644", "3345908", "21245435", "3646966", "128284525", "51909334", "92435373", "28135428", "210693404", "53132578", "14064410", "52895409", "52889459", "23021437", "145922673", "211532778", "30465165"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6138149"}

This article introduces one approach to detect diseases on cotton leaf using cotton leaf image. In this article, we are focusing on cotton leaf instead of focusing on whole cotton plant. There are different types of diseases on cotton leaf with different pattern of color in each disease. Comparing image directly with another image is not an efficient way of disease detection. So the proposed system includes three main phases that are Pre-processing, Feature Extraction and Classification. In pre-processing phase image is blurred and converted into Gray color scale from RGB color scale. Next, in feature extraction phase, color feature and texture features are extracted. Since color feature and texture feature are the most important features that describe the cotton images, the proposed system uses Color Coherent Vectors (CCV) for color feature extraction and Entropy, Local Range, Standard Deviation for texture feature extraction. Using k-means clustering algorithm different clusters are formed.

We prepared five groups of PQ derivatives: amides 1a-k, ureas 2a-k, semicarbazides 3a,b, acylsemicarbazides 4a-k and bis-ureas 5a-v, and evaluated them for antimalarial activity in vitro against the erythrocytic stage of P. falciparum NF54. Particular substituents, such as trityl (in 2j and 5r) and methoxybenzhydryl (in 3b and 5v) were associated with a favorable cytotoxicity-to-activity ratio. To systematically link structural features of PQ derivatives to antiplasmodial activity, we performed a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study using the Support Vector Machines machine learning method. This yielded a highly accurate statistical model (R2 = 0.776 in cross-validation), which was used to prioritize novel candidate compounds. Seven novel PQ-ureidoamides 10a-g were synthesized and evaluated for activity, highlighting the benzhydryl ureidoamides 10e and 10f derived from p-chlorophenylglycine. Further experiments on human cell lines revealed that 10e and 10f are an order of magnitude less toxic than PQ in vitro while having antimalarial activity indistinguishable from PQ. The toxicity profile of novel compounds 10 toward human cells was particularly favorable when the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was inhibited, while toxicity of PQ was exacerbated by G6PD inhibition. Our work therefore highlights promising lead compounds for the development of effective antimalarial drugs that may also be safer for G6PD-deficient patients. In addition, we provide computational inferences of antimalarial activity and cytotoxicity for thousands of PQ-like molecular structures.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29407988", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.01.062", "venue": "European journal of medicinal chemistry", "journal": "European journal of medicinal chemistry", "mag_id": "2793314606", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204850530", "133433337", "54447526", "201700587", "199387628"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4046154"}

In this paper, the effect of sample sizes to the results of hyper-parameter tuning process is investigated. Hyper-parameters of Support Vector Machines are tuned on samples of different sizes generated from a dataset. Hausdorff distance is proposed for computing the differences between the results of hyper-parameter tuning on two samples of different size. 100 real-world datasets and two tuning methods (Random Search and Particle Swarm Optimization) are used in the experiments revealing some interesting relations between sample sizes and results of hyper-parameter tuning which open some promising directions for future investigation in this direction.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-53480-0_27", "venue": "ISDA", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2590763747", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15700257", "961425", "12512548", "88516979", "6944647", "1427241", "18284734", "7277001", "7947884", "14308239", "44945", "3580792", "632197", "14357226", "6367142"], "inbound_citations": ["12945886"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20384862"}

These datasets included Sentinel-2A (S2), Sentinel-1A (S1) in dual polarization, one-arc-second Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission Digital Elevation (DEM) and multi-temporal Landsat-8 images (L8). We tested seven different sets of explanatory variables for classifying eight forest types in Wuhan, China. The results indicate that single-sensor (S2) or single-day data (L8) cannot obtain satisfactory results; the overall accuracy was 54.31% and 50.00%, respectively. Compared with the classification using only Sentinel-2 data, the overall accuracy increased by approximately 15.23% and 22.51%, respectively, by adding DEM and multi-temporal Landsat-8 imagery. The highest accuracy (82.78%) was achieved with fused imagery, the terrain and multi-temporal data contributing the most to forest type identification.

We previously showed that postoperative serum metabolomic profiles were predictive of relapse in a single-center cohort of estrogen receptor (ER)\u2013negative EBC patients. Here, we investigated this further using preoperative serum samples from ER-positive, premenopausal women with EBC who were enrolled in an international phase III trial. Experimental Design: Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of 590 EBC samples (319 with relapse or \u22656 years clinical follow-up) and 109 metastatic breast cancer (MBC) samples was performed. A Random Forest (RF) classification model was built using a training set of 85 EBC and all MBC samples. The model was then applied to a test set of 234 EBC samples, and a risk of recurrence score was generated on the basis of the likelihood of the sample being misclassified as metastatic. Results: In the training set, the RF model separated EBC from MBC with a discrimination accuracy of 84.9%. In the test set, the RF recurrence risk score correlated with relapse, with an AUC of 0.747 in ROC analysis. Accuracy was maximized at 71.3% (sensitivity, 70.8%; specificity, 71.4%). The model performed independently of age, tumor size, grade, HER2 status and nodal status, and also of Adjuvant! Online risk of relapse score. Conclusions: In a multicenter group of EBC patients, we developed a model based on preoperative serum metabolomic profiles that was prognostic for disease recurrence, independent of traditional clinicopathologic risk factors.

The obtained preference area, the parameters (calculated from close and volume stock price data) of the distributions and the indicators representing the present have been employed as Random Forest inputs in predicting the direction of the change in future Accounting & Governance Risk (AGR) rating, which defines the change in the risk of provision of financial data, i.e., whether the risk will increase or decrease.

Its dam-building procedure is not an object for its own further cognitive processes. It cannot operate on and amend the procedure at will, despite its plasticity relative to local context. It has flexibility only in a restricted domain. By contrast, human cognition (and perhaps the cognition of some higher animals) seems flexible in a much deeper sense.

Active learning has been proposed to address this bottleneck using stopping methods to minimize the cost of data annotation. An important capability for improving the utility of stopping methods is to effectively forecast the performance of the text classification models. Forecasting can be done through the use of logarithmic models regressed on some portion of the data as learning is progressing. A critical unexplored question is what portion of the data is needed for accurate forecasting. There is a tension, where it is desirable to use less data so that the forecast can be made earlier, which is more useful, versus it being desirable to use more data, so that the forecast can be more accurate. We find that when using active learning it is even more important to generate forecasts earlier so as to make them more useful and not waste annotation effort. We investigate the difference in forecasting difficulty when using accuracy and F-measure as the text classification system performance metrics and we find that F-measure is more difficult to forecast. We conduct experiments on seven text classification datasets in different semantic domains with different characteristics and with three different base machine learning algorithms. We find that forecasting is easiest for decision tree learning, moderate for Support Vector Machines, and most difficult for neural networks.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2001.10337", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSC.2020.00018", "venue": "2020 IEEE 14th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC)", "journal": "2020 IEEE 14th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3011436981,3003665996", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["63341924", "2222590", "11554115", "1367519", "18912195", "915058", "5449715", "59316940", "29266327", "1302329", "878109", "6241225", "12183141", "6066358", "12913094", "1713753", "12046719", "6442771", "17451347", "8374063", "59317017", "27044525", "14838537", "12481926", "369457", "91185890", "916523", "1211138", "580196", "2427083", "617436", "7311285", "17125090", "14439180", "4862083", "4867595", "1479461"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210932490"}

Efforts to model the potential habitat for P. ramorum and sudden oak death (SOD) are important for disease regulation and management. Yet, spatial models using identical data can have differing results. In this paper we examine the results from five types of models generated from common input parameters, and investigate model agreement for distribution of risk for P. ramorum. We examine five models: (1) Rule-based, (2) Logistic regression, (3) Classification and Regression Trees, (4) Genetic Algorithm modeling, and (5) Support Vector Machines. The models differed in terms of parametric and non-parametric requirements, necessity for presence/absence data, and whether or not the explanatory variables were determined a priori or revealed during the model process. Nationwide input data included vegetation/host (hardwood diversity and hardwood density), topography, and climate (e.g. precipitation, frost days, temperature, and many other layers). We developed a risk map for the conterminous United States in which probabilities for P. ramorum disease establishment were based not on one model, but on agreement between multiple models. The five models were consistent in their prediction of some SOD risk in coastal CA, OR and WA. All models predicted some risk in the northern foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains in CA. Outside of the west coast, the combined models predicted highest risk for SOD in a east-west oriented band including eastern OK, central AR, TN, KY, northern MI, AL, GA and SC, parts of central NC, and eastern VA, DL and MD.

Furthermore, a series of simulations in the cantilever beams involving different damage scenarios (at different location and different extent), have been conducted to verify this method.

For instance, explanation is used in machine learning, in case-based reasoning and, most important, the explanation of the results of a reasoning process to a user must be a component of any inference system. Experience with expert systems has shown that the ability to generate explanations is absolutely crucial for the user acceptance of Al systems. In contrast to symbolic systems, neural networks have no explicit, declarative knowledge representation and therefore have considerable difficulties in generating explanation structures. In neural networks, knowledge is encoded in numeric parameters (weight) and distributed all over the system. It is the intention of this paper to discuss the ability of neural networks to generate explanations. It will be shown that connectionist systems benefit from the explicit coding of relations and the use of highly structured networks in order to allow explanation and explanation components (ECs). Connectionist semantic networks (CSNs), i.e. connectionist systems with an explicit conceptual hierarchy, belong to a class of artificial neural networks which can be extended by an explanation component which gives meaningful responses to a limited class of \u201cHow\u201d questions.

The bitmap images are presented to an artificial retina and the phonologi- cally encoded five-word sentences describing the image serve as the phonological input. The visual scene is hence repre- sented by several self-organizing maps (SOMs) and the pho- nological description is proce ssed by the Recursive SOM that learns to topographically represent the spatial phrases, repre- sented as five-word sentences (e.g., 'blue ball above red cup'). Primary representations from the first-layer modules are unambiguously integrated in a multimodal second-layer module, implemented by the SOM or the 'neural gas' algo- rithms.

With the rapid growth of biological data, this field has become even more multi-disciplinary that includes Big Data, Bioinformatics, Biology and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The intersection of NLP is interesting and important as NLP can contribute from multiple angles and help solve various problems in Big Data, Biology, Bioinformatics and more. In this paper, we propose Semantic Engine using Brain-Like Approach (SEBLA) and associated NLP & Natural Language Understanding (NLU) based approach to address the key problems of Big Data in Bioinformatics and Biology. Our approach (SEBLA- NLU) resembles human Brain-Like and Brain-Inspired algorithms as humans can significantly compress the data by representing with a few words or sentences using the semantics of the information while preserving the core meaning. Thus, it very effectively converts data to knowledge and also compresses it; and hence addresses the key Big Data problems in an effective way. We describe how SEBLA- NLU can be used to handle both unstructured and structured Big Data for addressing complex problems including summarization and analytics.

Therefore, a two-branch semantic segmentation network, called TwinsAdvNet, which uses two kinds of predictive probability map to adversarial learning, is proposed.

Design Retrospective longitudinal study. Participants A total of 103 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma in 68 patients with 8 reliable VFs using the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc, Dublin, CA). Methods The mean total deviation (mTD) of the 52 test points in the 24-2 HFA test pattern was calculated for each VF, and the mTD progression rate was determined. A Corvis ST measurement was performed, and CSI was calculated as the ratio of (peak distance \u00d7 curvature radius at the time of highest concavity [HC] state) to (the deflection amplitude at the time of HC \u00d7 curvature radius at the undeformed state). The association between mTD progression rate and CSI, as well as other variables (including age, intraocular pressure, corneal hysteresis [CH], and 35 standard Corvis ST parameters), was investigated using the linear mixed model. The optimal linear mixed model to describe mTD progression rate was selected using the Random Forest method followed by variable selection using the second order bias corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) index. Main Outcome Measures Optimal linear mixed models for the mTD progression rate, as determined by AICc index. Results Univariate analysis revealed mTD progression rate was significantly associated with CSI (P = 0.0042), CH, HC radius, A1 deflection length, max inverse radius, and integrated radius. The optimal model to describe mTD progression rate included CSI, max inverse radius, Ambrosio rational thickness horizontal, and age (AICc = 41.59).

We then proceed by investigating dual normal forms for evidence and hypotheses in predicate logic. We define evidence nonnal form (ENF), which is Skolemised existential DNF under a Consistent Naming Assumption.

The first three issues are due to the inherent structure of spatial units of analysis, which can be easily accommodated if a (multi-)relational data mining approach is considered. The fourth issue demands for the adoption of a transductive setting, which aims to make predictions for a given set of unlabelled data. Transduction is also motivated by the contiguity of the concept of positive autocorrelation, which typically affect spatial phenomena, with the smoothness assumption which characterize the transductive setting. In this work, we investigate a relational approach to spatial classification in a transductive setting. Computational solutions to the main difficulties met in this approach are presented. In particular, a relational upgrade of the naive Bayes classifier is proposed as discriminative model, an iterative algorithm is designed for the transductive classification of unlabelled data, and a distance measure between relational descriptions of spatial objects is defined in order to determine the k-nearest neighbors of each example in the dataset.

We present a parsing technique that utilizes a Hybrid Connectionist Parser (HCP) extended with a Phrase Structure Matching Algorithm (PSMA) for the syntactic processing (parsing) of spoken language. The HCP is a hybrid of a connectionist and a symbolic approach, which builds a neural network dynamically based on a given context-free grammar and an input sentence. It has an advantage over traditional parsers due to the use of graded activation and activation passing in the network. These features were exploited in techniques to detect and repair disfluencies, in combination with the Phrase Structure Matching Algorithm, which operates on the graphical structure of the network. This approach to spoken language parsing is purely syntactical and - in contrast to other work - does not require a modified grammar for spoken language, or information derived from the speech input, nor any pre-marking of disfluencies. We implemented the combined HCP and PSMA parser and tested it on a standard corpus for spoken language, the HCRC Map Task Corpus. The experiments showed very good results, especially for a purely syntactic method, which detects as well as corrects disfluencies.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "NeSy", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "194948764", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14701220", "16371363", "9322318", "1136528"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7447881"}

Authoritative studies have revealed that facial expressions in human daily life are in multiple or co-occurring mental states. However, due to the lack of valid datasets, most previous studies are still restricted to basic emotions with single label. In this paper, we present a novel multi-label facial expression database, RAF-ML, along with a new deep learning algorithm, to address this problem. Specifically, a crowdsourcing annotation of 1.2 million labels from 315 participants was implemented to identify the multi-label expressions collected from social network, then EM algorithm was designed to filter out unreliable labels. For all we know, RAF-ML is the first database in the wild that provides with crowdsourced cognition for multi-label expressions. Focusing on the ambiguity and continuity of blended expressions, we propose a new deep manifold learning network, called Deep Bi-Manifold CNN, to learn the discriminative feature for multi-label expressions by jointly preserving the local affinity of deep features and the manifold structures of emotion labels. Furthermore, a deep domain adaption method is leveraged to extend the deep manifold features learned from RAF-ML to other expression databases under various imaging conditions and cultures. Extensive experiments on the RAF-ML and other diverse databases (JAFFE, CK$$+$$+, SFEW and MMI) show that the deep manifold feature is not only superior in multi-label expression recognition in the wild, but also captures the elemental and generic components that are effective for a wide range of expression recognition tasks.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11263-018-1131-1", "venue": "International Journal of Computer Vision", "journal": "International Journal of Computer Vision", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2902200737", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["961425", "123451361", "1342065", "6600989", "636149", "62117949", "7559976", "206590483", "9898195", "17781221", "15570523", "6161478", "24675185", "142679654", "152006801", "142574268", "8072069", "9395736", "17612122", "207211581", "9696931", "10742222", "9067102", "8281592", "3920085", "10726702", "6894709", "6379316", "124830309", "2661203", "1799558", "2245690", "8900320", "207763512", "5058972", "52164815", "11413183", "20884773", "4987097", "6184196", "1451440", "556999", "3329621", "1783506", "1586662", "712162", "10647804", "12359230", "28371004", "11844016", "918513", "14362153", "17221751", "3464628", "206592766", "6383532", "14124313", "11608263", "12415435", "16083666", "2715202", "42232702", "4711865", "2332622", "1411999", "608055", "18463041", "15408906", "362467", "744633", "4403107", "619269", "209702", "14886376", "1008003", "3794163", "31332441", "3511972", "2807666", "460679", "29805103"], "inbound_citations": ["204207447"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53967424"}

The goal was to develop a method that automatically, accurately and in a generic way could identify and classify faults once they occur for any type of industrial robot used. Although a large number of diagnosis methods and relevant applications for industrial equipment already exist, the current research in the area of fault diagnosis of industrial robotic manipulators is rather poor, due to the large variability of faults, the unsteady and non-uniform operating conditions, the small amount of sensors used in industrial manipulators and the rather limited time records of the equipment. These restrictions present key challenges of the current research to be undertaken. In this paper we present a novel approach to perform fault diagnostics of industrial robotic systems using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Discrete Wavelet Transform based feature extraction.

We call this model dAFM, based on augmentation of the original Additive Factors Model (AFM), whose calculations and constraints we show can be exactly replicated within the framework of neural networks. In order to parameterize the Q-matrix definition in the model, the associations between questions and knowledge components (KC) need to be represented by adjustable weights. Furthermore, student KC opportunity counts, instead of serving as fixed inputs, need to be calculated dynamically as the Q-matrix changes during training. We describe our solutions to these two modeling challenges and evaluate several variants of our fully realized model on datasets from the Cognitive Tutor and ASSISTments. We compare learning the Q-matrix from scratch vs. refining an expert specified KC model and evaluate various procedures for refinement. In our quantitative predictive analysis, we find that dAFM learns a better generalizing Q-matrix than the original expert model in all our primary datasets. Using a development set, we also find that the dAFM Q-matrix is superior to KC representations extracted from trained Deep Knowledge Tracing and skip-gram models. Examples are shown of questions whose fit was improved by dAFM with depictions of their original and refined KC associations. We consistently find in our experiments that our dAFM variant which attempted to learn the Q-matrix from scratch underperformed models which started with an expert defined Q-matrix that was then refined.

An example of the former is The Virtual Brain (TVB) software platform, which allows one to apply large-scale neural modeling in a whole brain framework. TVB provides a set of structural connectomes of the human cerebral cortex, a collection of neural processing units for each connectome node, and various forward models that can convert simulated neural activity into a variety of functional brain imaging signals. In this paper, we demonstrate how to embed a previously or newly constructed task-based large-scale neural model into the TVB platform. We tested our method on a previously constructed large-scale neural model (LSNM) of visual object processing that consisted of interconnected neural populations that represent, primary and secondary visual, inferotemporal , and prefrontal cortex. Some neural elements in the original model were 'non task-specific' (NS) neurons that served as noise generators to 'task-specific' neurons that processed shapes during a delayed match-to-sample (DMS) task. We replaced the NS neurons with an anatomical TVB connectome model of the cerebral cortex comprising 998 regions of interest interconnected by white matter fiber tract weights. We embedded our LSNM of visual object processing into corresponding nodes within the TVB connectome. Reciprocal connections between TVB nodes and our task-based modules were included in this framework. We ran visual object processing simulations and showed that the TVB simulator successfully replaced the noise generation originally provided by NS neurons; i.e., the DMS tasks performed with the hybrid LSNM/TVB simulator generated equivalent neural and fMRI activity to that of the original task-based models. Additionally, we found partial agreement between the functional connectivities using the hybrid LSNM/TVB model and the original LSNM. Our framework thus presents a way to embed task-based neural models into the TVB platform, enabling a better comparison between empirical and computational data, which in turn can lead to a better understanding of how interacting neural populations give rise to human cognitive behaviors.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4971081", "pubmed_id": "27536235", "doi": "10.3389/fninf.2016.00032", "venue": "Front.

Automatic text categorization, which is the task of assigning text documents to pre-specified classes (topics or themes) of documents, is an important task that can help both in organizing as well as in finding information on these huge resources. Text categorization presents unique challenges due to the large number of attributes present in the data set, large number of training samples, and attribute dependencies. In this paper we focus on a simple linear-time centroid-based document classification algorithm, that despite its simplicity and robust performance, has not been extensively studied and analyzed. Our extensive experiments show that this centroid-based classifier consistently and substantially outperforms other algorithms such as Naive Bayesian, k-nearest-neighbors, and C4.5, on a wide range of datasets. Our analysis shows that the similarity measure used by the centroid-based scheme allows it to classify a new document based on how closely its behavior matches the behavior of the documents belonging to different classes, as measured by the average similarity between the documents. This matching allows it to dynamically adjust for classes with different densities. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the similarity measure of the centroid-based scheme accounts for dependencies between the terms in the different classes. We believe that this feature is the reason why it consistently outperforms other classifiers that cannot take these dependencies into account.", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.21236/ada439538", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "312021071", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["7489833", "56025192", "26196420", "5314923", "14234765", "2460669", "206601447", "60596274"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60250430"}

In this paper, a growing DBN with transfer learning (TL-GDBN) is proposed to automatically decide its structure size, which can accelerate its learning process and improve model accuracy. First, a basic DBN structure with single hidden layer is initialized and then pretrained, and the learned weight parameters are frozen. Second, TL-GDBN uses TL to transfer the knowledge from the learned weight parameters to newly added neurons and hidden layers, which can achieve a growing structure until the stopping criterion for pretraining is satisfied. Third, the weight parameters derived from pretraining of TL-GDBN are further fine-tuned by using layer-by-layer partial least square regression from top to bottom, which can avoid many problems of traditional backpropagation algorithm-based fine-tuning. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the TL-GDBN is presented. Finally, TL-GDBN is tested on two benchmark data sets and a practical wastewater treatment system.

Since classification systems capable of incrementally storing, filtering, and classifying data are economical, in terms of both space and time, which makes them immensely useful for industrial, military, and commercial purposes, interest in designing them is growing. However, the challenge with incremental learning is that classification tasks can no longer be seen as unvarying, since they can actually change with the evolution of the data. These changes in turn cause dynamic changes to occur in the classification system's parameters If such variations are neglected, the overall perfonnance of these systems will be compromised in the future. ::: ::: In this thesis, on the development of a system capable of incrementally accommodating new data and dynamically tracking new optimum system parameters for self-adaptation, we first address the optimum selection of classifiers over time. We propose a framework which combinesthe power of Swann Intelligence Theory and the conventional grid-search method to progressively identify potential solutions for gradually updating training datasets. The key here is to consider the adjustment of classifier parameters as a dynamic optimization problem that depends on the data available. Specifically, it has been shown that, if the intention is to build efficient Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers from sources that provide data gradually and serially, then the best way to do this is to consider model selection as a dynamic process which can evolve and change over time. This means that a number of solutions are required, depending on the knowledge available about the problem and uncertainties in the data. We also investigate measures for evaluating and selecting classifier ensembles composed of SVM classifiers. The measures employed are based on two different theories (diversity and margin)commonly used to understand the success of ensembles. This study has given us valuable insights and helped us to establish confidence-based measures as a tool for the selection of classifier ensembles. ::: ::: The main contribution of this thesis is a dynamic optimization approach that performs incremental learning in an adaptive fashion by tracking, evolving, and combining optimum hypotheses over time. The approach incorporates various theories, such as dynamic Particle Swann Optimization, incremental Support Vector Machine classifiers, change detection, and dynamic ensemble selection based on classifier confidence levels. Experiments carried out on synthetic and real-world databases demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the classification methods often used in incremental learning scenarios.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1567589860", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60721723"}

This discrepancy between low-level content features (such as color, texture, and shape) and high-level semantic concepts (such as sunset, flowers, outdoor scene, etc.) is known as \u201csemantic gap,\u201d which is an open challenging problem in current CBIR systems. ::: With the ultimate goal of narrowing the semantic gap, this thesis makes three contributions to the field of CBIR. The first contribution is a novel region-based image similarity measure. An image is represented by a set of segmented regions each of which is characterized by a fuzzy feature (fuzzy set) reflecting color, texture, and shape properties. Fuzzy features naturally characterize the gradual transition between regions (blurry boundaries) within an image, and incorporate the segmentation-related uncertainties into the retrieval algorithm. The resemblance of two images is defined as the overall similarity between two families of fuzzy features, and quantified by a similarity measure that integrates properties of all the regions in the images. Compared with similarity measures based on individual regions and on all regions with crisp-valued feature representations, the proposed measure greatly reduces the influence of inaccurate segmentation, and provides a very intuitive quantification. ::: The second contribution is a novel image retrieval scheme using unsupervised learning. It is built on a hypothesis that images of the same semantics tend to be clustered in some feature space. The proposed method attempts to capture semantic concepts by learning the way that images of the same semantics are similar and retrieving image clusters instead of a set of ordered images. Clustering is dynamic. In particular, clusters formed depend on which images are retrieved in response to the query. Therefore, the clusters give the algorithm as well as the users semantic relevant clues as to where to navigate. The proposed retrieval scheme is a general approach that can be combined with any real-valued symmetric similarity measure (metric or nonmetric). Thus it may be embedded in many current CBIR systems. ::: The last contribution is a novel region-based image classification method. An image is represented as a set of regions obtained from image segmentation. It is assumed that the concept underlying an image category is related to the occurrence of regions of certain types, which are called region prototypes (RPs), in an image. Each RP represents a class of regions that is more likely to appear in images with the specific label than in the other images, and is found according to an objective function measuring a co-occurrence of similar regions from different images with the same label. An image classifier is then defined by a set of rules associating the appearance of RPs in an image with image labels. The learning of such classifiers is formulated as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning problem with a special class of kernels.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1849916637", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:120245635"}
