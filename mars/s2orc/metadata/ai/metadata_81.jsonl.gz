The increase in machine computing capabilities over the past decades has provided the possibility to perform advanced analyses such as ML on big data, which can be effectively used in geotechnical engineering applications. For driven piles, the impact of the piling hammer induces compression and tension stresses in the piles. Hence, an important design consideration is to check that the strength of the pile is sufficient to resist the stresses caused by the impact of the pile hammer. Due to the intrinsic complexity as well as various design variables, pile drivability lacks a precise analytical solution with regard to the phenomena involved. In this paper, the random forest regression (RFR) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models are developed for assessing pile drivability in relation to the prediction of the Maximum compressive stresses (MCS) and Blow per foot (BPF). In this study, the 10-fold cross validation method and Lasso regularization is adopted for obtaining the model of superior generalization ability and better persuasiveness results.

Moreover, many existing MSVMs are not Fisher consistent, or do not take into account the effect of outliers. In this paper, we focus on classification in the angle-based framework, which is free of the explicit sum-to-zero constraint, hence more efficient, and propose two robust MSVM methods using truncated hinge loss functions. We show that our new classifiers can enjoy Fisher consistency, and simultaneously alleviate the impact of outliers to achieve more stable classification performance.

Number of follicles are detected by ovarian ultrasound image processing using preprocessing which includes contrast enhancement and filtering, feature extraction using Multiscale morphological approach and segmentation. Support Vector Machine algorithm is used for classification which takes into account all the parameters such as body mass index (BMI), hormonal levels, menstrual cycle length and no of follicles detected in ovarian ultrasound image processing.

In this paper, we revisit a random forest model originally proposed by [Breiman, 2004] and later studied by [Biau, 2012], where a feature is selected at random and the split occurs at the midpoint of the box containing the chosen feature. If the Lipschitz regression function is sparse and only depends on a small, unknown subset of $S$ out of $d$ features, we show that, given access to $n$ observations, this random forest model outputs a predictor that has a mean-squared prediction error $O((n(\\sqrt{\\log n})^{S-1})^{-\\frac{1}{S\\log2+1}})$. This positively answers an outstanding question of [Biau, 2012] about whether the rate of convergence therein could be improved. The second part of this article shows that the aforementioned prediction error cannot generally be improved, which we accomplish by characterizing the variance and by showing that the bias is tight for any linear model with nonzero parameter vector.

This is because effective indicators and management actions aimed at preserving/rebuilding marine biodiversity should be found from the knowledge of the spatial distribution of target species and extension of critical habitats as well as their overlapping with human activities, pressure and impacts. In this regard, the spatial distributions of the striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba and the common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus in the Gulf of Taranto (Northern Ionian Sea, Central-eastern Mediterranean Sea) were investigated by means of a generalized additive model (GAM) and a Random Forest (RF) based on sighting data collected during standardized vessel-based surveys carried out from 2009 to 2015. Eight predictive variables were considered, taking into account both the local physiographic features and human activities existing in the investigated area, suggesting an innovative approach to habitat modeling. In particular, the explanatory variables depth, distance from industrial areas and distance from the coast proved to significantly influence the distribution of both dolphin species. In addition, the distribution of S. coeruleoalba and T. truncatus were also significantly shaped by the distance from the navy exercise areas and the fishing areas, respectively. On the contrary, the slope and the distance from the main commercial routes never provided any significant influence. The reliability of GAM and RF models in predicting the spatial distribution of both dolphins was tested by applying the Youden Index method to the ROC curves. The RF model allowed the projection of the expected presence/absence pattern of S. coeruleoalba and T. truncatus to produce the preference habitat versus non habitat map. In particular, the RF model predicted that the striped dolphin is widely present in the central and deeper part of the Gulf of Taranto. In contrast, the common bottlenose dolphin seems to be mainly distributed along the coasts in both the eastern and western sector of the basin. A clear overlapping of the preference habitats estimated for S. coeruleoalba and T. truncatus is shown north of Punta Alice and in front of Policoro as well as offshore from Ugento in the eastern and western parts of the investigated area, respectively. Finally, the critical habitats of S. coeruleoalba and T. truncatus are the outcome of both the influence of environmental conditions and anthropogenic pressures presently occurring in the Gulf of Taranto, basically indicating the need for conservation measures, especially considering that the area is expected to be considered for hydrocarbon prospecting.

Unlike conventional trial and error tricks, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique is proposed to design the optimal bandwidth at each prediction. According to this strategy, the optimal neighbors of the query are obtained and the predictive precision is improved.

For radio map update, some studies suggest taking new measurements at some random locations, usually from the ones used in the radio map construction. In this paper, we argue that the locations should not be random, and propose how to determine them. Given the set locations where the measurements used for the initial radio map construction were taken, a subset of locations for the update measurements is chosen through optimization so that the remaining locations found in the initial measurements are best approximated through regression. The regression method is Support Vector Regression (SVR) and the optimization is achieved using a genetic algorithm approach. We tested our approach using a database of WiFi measurements collected at a relatively dense set of locations during ten months in a university library setting. The experiments results show that, if no dramatic event occurs (e.g., relevant WiFi networks are changed), our approach outperforms other strategies for determining the collection locations for periodic updates.

Therefore, early detection of heart diseases is crucial to reduce the rising death rate. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used to diagnose many types of heart diseases such as abnormal heartbeat rhythm (arrhythmia). However, the non-linearity and the complexity of the abnormal ECG signals make it very difficult to detect its characteristics. Besides, it may be time-consuming to check these ECG signals manually. To overcome these limitations, we have proposed fast and accurate classifier that simulates the diagnosis of the cardiologist to classify the ECG signals into normal and abnormal from a single lead ECG signal and better than other well-known classifiers. First, an accurate algorithm is used for correcting the ECG signals from noise and extracting the major features of each ECG signal. After that, we simulated the characteristics of the ECG signals and created the proposed classifier from these characteristics. Two Neural Network (NN) classifiers, four Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier are employed to classify the ECG signals and compared with the proposed classifier. The total 13 features extracted from each ECG signal used in the proposed algorithm and set as input to the other classifiers. Our algorithm is validated using all records of MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.

When GAN learns the semantic-rich data distribution from a dataset, the density of the generated distribution tends to concentrate on the training data. Due to the gradient parameters of the deep neural network contain the data distribution of the training samples, they can easily remember the training samples. When GAN is applied to private or sensitive data, for instance, patient medical records, as private information may be leakage. To address this issue, we propose a Privacy-preserving Generative Adversarial Network (PPGAN) model, in which we achieve differential privacy in GANs by adding well-designed noise to the gradient during the model learning procedure.

The employment of a structured abstract is useful to represent the major components of the paper. This, in turn, enhances extracting information about the study. Regardless of the importance of the structured abstract, many computer science research papers do not apply it. This may lead to weak abstracts. This paper aims at implementing the natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning on conventional abstracts to automatically generate structured abstracts that are formatted using the IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) format which is considered as a predominant in medical, scientific writing. The effectiveness of such sentence classi\ufb01cation, which is the capability of a method to produce an expected outcome of classifying unstructured abstracts in computer science research papers into IMRAD sections, depends on both feature selection and classi\ufb01cation algorithm. This can be achieved via IMRaD Classifier by measuring the similarity of sentences between the structured and the unstructured abstracts of different research papers. After that, it can be classified the sentences into one of the IMRaD format tags based on the measured similarity value. Finally, the IMRaD Classifier is evaluated by applying Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classi\ufb01ers on the same dataset. To conduct this work, we use dataset contains 250 conventional Computer Science abstracts for periods 2015 to 2018. This dataset is collected from two main websites: DBLP and IOS Press content library. In this paper, 200 xml based files are used for training, and 50 xml based files are used for testing. Thus, the dataset is 4x250 files where each file contains a set of sentences that belong to different abstracts but belong to the same IMRaD sections. The experimental results show that Naive Bayes (NB) can predict better outcomes for each class (Introduction, method, results, Discussion and Conclusion) than Support Vector Machine (SVM).

This is usually a difficult problem per se, due to the localization of the tumour in an extremely sensitive and difficult to reach organ such as the brain. The clinical analysis of brain tumours often requires the use of non-invasive measurement methods, the most common of which resort to imaging techniques. The discrimination between high-grade malignant tumours of different origin but similar characteristics, such as glioblastomas and metastases, is a particularly difficult problem in this context. This is because imaging techniques are often not sensitive enough and their spectroscopic signal is overall too similar. In spite of this, machine learning techniques, coupled with robust feature selection procedures, have recently made substantial inroads into the problem. In this study, magnetic resonance spectroscopy data from an international, multi-centre database were used to discriminate between these two types of malignant brain tumours using ensemble learning techniques, with a focus on the definition of a feature selection method specifically designed for ensembles. This method, Breadth Ensemble Learning, takes advantage of the fact that many of the frequencies of the available spectra convey no relevant information for the discrimination of the tumours.

Typical applications of patent classification systems are: (1) the automatic assignment of a new patent to the group of patent examiners concerned with the topic, (2) the search for prior art in fields similar to the incoming patent application and (3) the reclassification of patent specifications. By means of machine learning techniques, a collection of 1 270 185 patents is used to build a classifier that is able to classify documents with varyingly large feature spaces. The two algorithms that are compared are Balanced Winnow and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). A previous study [Zhang, 2000] found that Winnow achieves a similar accuracy to SVM but it is much faster as the execution time for Winnow is linear in the number of terms and the number of classes. This primary finding is verified on a feature space 100 times the size using patent documents instead of news paper articles. Results show that SVM outperforms Winnow considerably on all considered measures. Moreover, SVM is found to be a much more robust classifier than Winnow.

This means assigning a label to each pixel of an image, describing the object it is depicting. Due to its applicability in many areas, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics and medical surgery assistance, semantic segmentation has become an essential task in image analysis. During the last few years a lot of progress have been made for image segmentation algorithms, mainly due to the introduction of deep learning methods, in particular the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are powerful for modeling complex connections between input and output data but lack the ability to directly model dependent output structures, for instance, enforcing properties such as label smoothness and coherence. This drawback motivates the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), widely applied as a post-processing step in semantic segmentation. This thesis summarizes the content of three papers, all of them presenting solutions to semantic segmentation problems. The applications have varied widely and several different types of data have been considered, ranging from 3D CT images to RGB images of horses. The main focus has been on developing robust and accurate models to solve these problems. The models consist of a CNN capable of learning complex image features coupled with a CRF capable of learning dependencies between output variables. Emphasis has been on creating models that are possible to train end-to-end, as well as developing corresponding optimization methods needed to enable efficient training. End-to-end training gives the CNN and the CRF a chance to learn how to interact and exploit complementary information to achieve better performance.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2804903620", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67352580"}

In this paper we introduce an alternative method to stacking which is based on cluster analysis. Similar to stacking, instances from a validation set are initially classified by all base classifiers. The output of each classifier is subsequently considered as a new attribute of the instance. Following this, a validation set is divided into clusters according to the new attributes and a small subset of the original attributes of the instances. For each cluster we find its centroid and calculate its class label. The collection of centroids is considered as a meta-classifier. Experimental results show that the new method outperformed all benchmark methods, namely Majority Voting, Stacking J48, Stacking LR, AdaBoost J48 and Random Forest, in 12 out of 22 data sets.

METHODS: Tissue microarrays were constructed from 19 ATCs and 96 DTCs (90 papillary carcinomas and 6 follicular carcinomas), and immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of 54 molecular markers. Significant associations between marker staining and cancer pathology (DTC vs ATC) were determined using contingency table and marginal homogeneity tests. A Random Forests classifier algorithm was also used to identify useful or important molecular classifiers. RESULTS: Overall, there were 25 significantly differentially expressed markers when comparing ATCs with DTCs. These included 5 of the 8 markers that were previously identified as being altered during anaplastic transformation and 3 additional markers were also found to be highly significantly differentially expressed by ATCs and DTCs. Clustering and classification analysis based on the previously identified 8-marker transformation panel, or the 5 of these markers that were found to be most important in the current study, readily separated DTC and ATC with a high degree of accuracy.

Several data processing and data evaluation steps are required to come to the final results. These operations are often difficult to reproduce, because of too specific computing platforms. This effect, known as \u2019workflow decay\u2019, can be diminished by using a standardized informatic infrastructure. Thus, we compiled an integrated platform, which contains ready-to-use tools and workflows for mass spectrometry data analysis. Apart from general unit operations, such as peak picking and identification of proteins and metabolites, we put a strong emphasis on the statistical validation of results and Data Mining. MASSyPup64 includes e. g. the OpenMS/TOPPAS framework, the Trans-Proteomic-Pipeline programs, the ProteoWizard tools, X!Tandem, Comet and SpiderMass. The statistical computing language R is installed with packages for MS data analyses, such as XCMS/metaXCMS and MetabR. The R package Rattle provides a user-friendly access to multiple Data Mining methods. Further, we added the non-conventional spreadsheet program teapot for editing large data sets and a command line tool for transposing large matrices. Individual programs, console commands and modules can be integrated using the Workflow Management System (WMS) taverna. We explain the useful combination of the tools by practical examples: 1) A workflow for protein identification and validation, with subsequent Association Analysis of peptides, 2) Cluster analysis and Data Mining in targeted Metabolomics, and 3) Raw data processing, Data Mining and identification of metabolites in untargeted Metabolomics. Association Analyses reveal relationships between variables across different sample sets. We present its application for finding co-occurring peptides, which can be used for target proteomics, the discovery of alternative biomarkers and protein-protein interactions. Data Mining derived models displayed a higher robustness and accuracy for classifying sample groups in targeted Metabolomics than cluster analyses. Random Forest models do not only provide predictive models, which can be deployed for new data sets, but also the variable importance. We demonstrate that the later is especially useful for tracking down significant signals and affected pathways in untargeted Metabolomics. Thus, Random Forest modeling supports the unbiased search for relevant biological features in Metabolomics. Our results clearly manifest the importance of Data Mining methods to disclose non-obvious information in biological mass spectrometry .

In AL, one selects the instances to be manually labeled with the aim of maximizing model performance with minimal effort. Neural models capitalize on word embeddings as representations (features), tuning these to the task at hand. We argue that AL strategies for multi-layered neural models should focus on selecting instances that most affect the embedding space (i.e., induce discriminative word representations). This is in contrast to traditional AL approaches (e.g., entropy-based uncertainty sampling), which specify higher level objectives. We propose a simple approach for sentence classification that selects instances containing words whose embeddings are likely to be updated with the greatest magnitude, thereby rapidly learning discriminative, task-specific embeddings. We extend this approach to document classification by jointly considering: (1) the expected changes to the constituent word representations; and (2) the model's current overall uncertainty regarding the instance. The relative emphasis placed on these criteria is governed by a stochastic process that favors selecting instances likely to improve representations at the outset of learning, and then shifts toward general uncertainty sampling as AL progresses. Empirical results show that our method outperforms baseline AL approaches on both sentence and document classification tasks. We also show that, as expected, the method quickly learns discriminative word embeddings.

A recently proposed dimensionality reduction algorithm, namely t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), generates effective two-dimensional representations of a wide range of datasets based on pairwise statistical distances of the input. However, direct application to multi-element geochemical assays has been shown to produce representations which can fail to separate specimens by a desired geological property, such as state of hydration. Since t-SNE is a statistical distance-based method, these sub-optimal representations may be due to the presence of dimensions (i.e., elements) irrelevant to the desired property\u2014an issue often termed the \u2018curse of dimensionality\u2019. To address this shortcoming, t-SNE was applied to (i) 31 elements in a geochemical assay database covering 16 000 drill core intervals intersecting the Kevitsa mafic-ultramafic intrusion (Lapland, Finland); and (ii) a subset of 11 elements capable of discriminating between unaltered and altered host rock specimens, as determined by a Random Forest classifier within a recursive feature elimination framework. The resulting representation more effectively separates altered and unaltered specimens, and we demonstrate that it produces more favourable representations than alternative well-known methods (namely, a self-organising map and principal components analysis) applied to the same dataset. We also demonstrate that the proposed t-SNE representation is applicable for re-logging of the specimens' alteration state as logged by geologists, and in particular provides visual insight into the labels suggested by a black box statistical re-logging algorithm.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cageo.2018.12.005", "venue": "Comput.

Deep features produced the highest accuracy of 100% as compared to 93.52% produced by using GLCM features. This study also compared the classification of deep features with five different classifiers and Support Vector Machine (SVM) showed the highest result. This high accuracy was also reproduced with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Regression classifiers. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was also done to evaluate the usage of reduced number of features and its effect on the classification performance. Using deep features produced 4096 features and a classification accuracy of 100%. When PCA is introduced, only 79 features were used however the accuracy produced was the same.

Many people are being benefited from the mobile healthcare services. Compared with the traditional healthcare services, patients\u2019 medical behavior trajectories can be recorded by mobile healthcare services meticulously. They monitor the entire healthcare services process and help to improve the quality and standardization of healthcare services. By tracking and analyzing the patients\u2019 medical records, they provide real-time protection for the patients\u2019 healthcare activities. Therefore, medical fraud can be avoided and the loss of public health funds can be reduced. Although mobile healthcare services can provide a large amount of timely data, an effective real-time online algorithm is needed due to the timeliness of detecting the medical insurance fraud claims. However, because of the complex granularity of medical data, existing fraud detection approaches tend to be less effective in terms of monitoring the healthcare services process.

By means of the proposed SSIsomap activity clustering method, SimLOF outlier detection method, and the Dempster\u2013Shafer theory-based evidence aggregation method, our approach is able to detect unusual categories and frequencies of behaviors simultaneously. Our approach is applied to a real-world data set containing more than 40 million medical insurance claim activities from over 40 000 users.

Finally, the 2nd derivatives of the normalizedODs served as regressors. Subsequently, calibration models from regressors and regressands (the corresponding measured BGL or classified BGL values) were constructed with PCR, PLS, SVMsR and SVMsC.

Automating this process is challenging due to the high diversity in the appearance of tumor tissues among different patients.

The abnormal tissues have to be removed without causing any lacerations in the adjacent structures during entry or exit from the area subject tothe tumor removal operation. This paper deals with a new identification technique for extracting the brain tumors in computed tomography images using Support Vector Machine (SVM). In the training phase, the SVM is used as an identifier to identify the tumor from the brain MRI images.

The SVM is then used to match the extracted features in the testing phase to those of the training phase. The method is applied to a set of real data of 20 MRI images with normal and abnormal tumors. Experimental results show that the recognition rate for features extracted from the Discrete Sine Transform (DST) of images contaminated by AWGN, features extracted from images plus the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of images contaminated by impulsive noise, and features extracted from images plus the DST of images contaminated by speckle noise achieve better performance compared to the existing techniques.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CIBCB.2014.6845504", "venue": "2014 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "journal": "2014 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2177884247", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8998657", "18917127", "13093868", "28637672", "2443126", "14561315", "207165665"], "inbound_citations": ["33670330"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1114562"}

The time series, including simulated data and landslide deformation data sets, were preformed for regression and prediction by support vector machine, RBF networks, and elman recurrent neural networks. A comparison of these three methods was made based on their predicting ability. The results show that: when noise level is lower in simulated experiment, support vector machine is perfect relatively, and the Elman and RBF network are of more instability, on the other hand, with the higher noise levels, the greater relative error of two networks models is made. For landslide data sets prediction, the neural networks are limited to predict short term nonlinear time series in terms of their accuracy, whereas support vector machine has a higher precision in the short term and long term.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Computer Simulation", "mag_id": "2366813498", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:112457372"}

First , we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or \u2018atrous convolution\u2019, as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second , we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third , we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed \u201cDeepLab\u201d system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

Machine learning (kernel classification) has become ubiquitous as the forefront method for pattern recognition and has been shown to have numerous societal applications. While not yet fault-tolerant, Quantum computing is an entirely new method of computation due to its exploitation of quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. While current machine learning classifiers like the Support Vector Machine are seeing gradual improvements in performance, there are still severe limitations on the efficiency and scalability of such algorithms due to a limited feature space which makes the kernel functions computationally expensive to estimate. By integrating quantum circuits into traditional ML, we may solve this problem through the use of quantum feature space, a technique that improves existing Machine Learning algorithms through the use of parallelization and the reduction of the storage space from exponential to linear. This research expands on this concept of the Hilbert space and applies it for classical machine learning by implementing the quantum-enhanced version of the K nearest neighbors algorithm. This paper first understands the mathematical intuition for the implementation of quantum feature space and successfully simulates quantum properties and algorithms like Fidelity and Grover's Algorithm via the Qiskit python library and the IBM Quantum Experience platform. The primary experiment of this research is to build a noisy variational quantum circuit KNN (QKNN) which mimics the classification methods of a traditional KNN classifier. The QKNN utilizes the distance metric of Hamming Distance and is able to outperform the existing KNN on a 10-dimensional Breast Cancer dataset.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2002.10453", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3008643341", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Physics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["124545445", "15291489", "207198067", "6541235", "51680972", "3494721", "30804812", "206598347", "117928740", "5193327", "73432134", "64536201", "125493100", "35607645", "21704668"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211296551"}

However, the model training is very time-consuming when meeting large scale data sets. Some efforts have been devoted to screening out non-support vectors (non-SVs) to accelerate the training. But their processes rely on prior knowledge of other classifiers with different parameters to screen out non-SVs. In this paper, we propose Directional Indicator Support Vector Machines (DISVMs) to efficiently identify non-SVs. DISVMs employs a directional indicator, which points to the approximately orthogonal direction of the separating hyperplane, to qualitatively define the location of different samples and thus identify non-SVs. Furthermore, DISVMs leverages a two-stage algorithm: the first stage is to compute the directional indicator. The second stage is to identify non-SVs using the indicator. To avoid misjudgement, we propose CnSV method for non-SVs based on the majority rule. DISVMs screens out non-SVs with light computation and little accuracy loss.

To overcome this problem, a novel adaptive Kalman filtering (SVMAKF), adjusted by Support Vector Machine, was introduced. The adaptation of the SVMAKF is in the sense of dynamically tuning the measurement noise covariance matrix R by employing the support vector machine (SVM) based on a covariance matching technique. If the measurement noise under it operates change or evolves with time, SVMAKF can give a new noise covariance matrix. This relaxes the a priori measurement noise statistical assumptions and significantly benefits the Kalman filtering states estimate. The computer simulation about SVMAKF was done for the problem of initial alignment of SINS. The results illustrate that the SVMAKF gives better performance, in terms of accuracy and robustness, than traditional Kalman filtering.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Computer Simulation", "mag_id": "2383747471", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:112505174"}

We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to evaluate major metabolic fluctuations in 76 organic acids present in urine from 156 children with ASD and from 64 non-autistic children. Three algorithms, Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were used to develop models to distinguish ASD from typically developing (TD) children and to detect potential biomarkers. In an independent testing set, full model of XGBoost with all 76 acids achieved an AUR of 0.94, while reduced model with top 20 acids discovered by voting from these three algorithms achieved 0.93 and represent a good collection of potential ASD biomarkers.

Medical health big data provides a basic data resource guarantee for medical service intelligence and smart healthcare. The classification of medical health big data is of great significance for the intelligentization of medical information. Due to the simplicity of KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) classification algorithm, it has been widely used in many fields. However, when the sample size is large and the feature attributes are large, the efficiency of the KNN algorithm classification will be greatly reduced. This paper proposes an improved KNN algorithm and compares it with the traditional KNN algorithm. The classification is performed in the query instance neighborhood of the conventional KNN classifier, and weights are assigned to each class. The algorithm considers the class distribution around the query instance to ensure that the assigned weight does not adversely affect the outliers. Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional KNN algorithm in processing large data sets, this paper proposes an improved KNN algorithm based on cluster denoising and density cropping. The algorithm performs denoising processing by clustering, and improves the classification efficiency of KNN algorithm by speeding up the search speed of K-nearest neighbors, while maintaining the classification accuracy of KNN algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the classification efficiency of KNN algorithm in processing large data sets, and maintain the classification accuracy of KNN algorithm well, and has good classification performance.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2955754", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2991232928", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3404003", "215370870", "14270381", "125934029", "3402275", "52927879", "96448513", "44152025", "4325206", "3485851", "139559182", "116269770", "25153554", "67327745", "120354902", "16494999", "122929513", "17392198", "139267702", "118063043", "63823117", "4058074", "2715145", "1389584"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211227745"}

However, when directly applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, the recognition rate is low. This is because ELM does not use spatial information, which is very important for HSI classification. In view of this, this paper proposes a new framework for the spectral-spatial classification of HSI by combining ELM with loopy belief propagation (LBP). The original ELM is linear, and the nonlinear ELMs (or Kernel ELMs) are an improvement of linear ELM (LELM). However, based on lots of experiments and much analysis, it is found that the LELM is a better choice than nonlinear ELM for the spectral-spatial classification of HSI. Furthermore, we exploit the marginal probability distribution that uses the whole information in the HSI and learns such a distribution using the LBP. The proposed method not only maintains the fast speed of ELM, but also greatly improves the accuracy of classification. The experimental results in the well-known HSI data sets, Indian Pines, and Pavia University, demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1709.02253", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5713108", "pubmed_id": "29137159", "doi": "10.3390/s17112603", "venue": "Sensors,17,2017,2603", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2753816389", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["12624470", "6906514", "7771801", "22209205", "1153858", "10969170", "38299172", "67870428", "31741528", "9855973", "116858", "2051753", "13306516", "207101649", "15037168", "8715388", "52835993", "16008390", "15617677", "206691761", "34586567", "34856165", "207251944", "1462777", "14173829", "1715212", "120489597", "14293639", "16327957"], "inbound_citations": ["201067561", "52296981", "85498741", "13712855", "127616255", "52275756"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3633459"}

We introduce a novel approach for the prediction of changes in protein stability that arise from a single-site amino acid substitution; the approach uses available data on mutations occurring in the same position and in other positions. Our algorithm, named Pro-Maya (Protein Mutant stAbilitY Analyzer), combines a collaborative filtering baseline model, Random Forests regression and a diverse set of features.

This solves an important problem which has largely been ignored by kernel methods: How to systematically deal with incomplete data? Our method can also be applied to problems with partially observed labels as well as to the transductive setting where we view the labels as missing data. Our approach relies on casting kernel methods as an estimation problem in exponential families. Hence, estimation with missing variables becomes a problem of computing marginal distributions, and finding efficient optimization methods.

Finding efficient measurements for detecting fraudulent electricity consumption has been an active research area in recent years. This paper presents a new approach towards Distribution Power Loss analysis for electric utilities using a novel intelligence- based techniques like Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), OS-ELM & Support Vector Machine (SVM). The main motivation of this study is to assist Gujarat Urjha Vikas Nigam LTD (GUVNL) to reduce its Distribution Power Loss due to electricity theft. The proposed model preselects suspected customers to be inspected onsite for fraud based on irregularities and abnormal consumption behaviour. This approach provides a method of data mining and involves feature extraction from historical customer consumption data. The approach uses customer load profile information to expose abnormal behaviour that is known to be highly correlated with Power Loss activities. The result yields classification classes that are used to shortlist potential fraud suspects for onsite inspection, based on significant behaviour that emerges due to irregularities in consumption. Simulation results prove the proposed method is more effective compared to the current actions taken by GUVNL in order to reduce Power Loss activities.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2188412116", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["196196604", "23276900", "211690772", "169385473"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17097659"}

The simulations are conducted on a benchmark intrusion dataset, and the accuracy of the random forest algorithm has reached 92.39%, which is higher than other comparison algorithms.

HSI used in this study has an advantage over existing techniques due to its combination of imaging system and spectroscopy, along with being contactless and non-destructive in nature. Hyperspectral images of the chemical were collected using the BaySpec hyperspectral sensor which operated in the spectral range of 400\u20131000 nm (144 bands). Image processing was applied on the acquired hyperspectral image to select the region of interest (ROI) and to extract the spectral reflectance of the chemicals which were stored as spectral library. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and first derivative was applied to reduce the high dimensionality of the image and to determine the optimal wavelengths between 400 and 1000 nm. In total, 22 out of 144 wavelengths were selected by analysing the loadings of principal components (PC). SVM was used to develop the classification model. SVM model established on the whole spectrum from 400 to 1000 nm achieved an accuracy of 81.11%, whereas an accuracy of 77.17% with less computational load was achieved when SVM model was established on the optimal wavelengths selected.

The hybrid model is based on discrete Preisach model and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The Preisach model is generally implemented using a numerical technique basing on the first-order reversal curves (FORCs). The accuracy of the Preisach model mainly depends on the number of FORCs. However it is generally difficult to achieve enough number of FORCs in practice. In order to promote the modeling efficiency, firstly in Preisach modeling process, the storage method of prehistory and interpolation approach of output are improved; then SVM is employed in the work to circumvent the deficiency of the Preisach model resulting from the lack of FORCs, which produces a hybrid model based on the improved Preisach model and SVM. This hybrid model is implemented in calibration of a piezoelectric stack actuator and validated experimentally. Finally, a novel dual-stack PA is introduced and calibrated with this hybrid model. The results demonstrate that the presented hybrid model possesses the advantages both of SVM and Preisach model. In comparison with pure Preisach model, the hybrid model has higher accuracy and is easier to be obtained without increasing the number of FORCs. In addition, the inverse model for PA is derived from the hybrid model, which can be employed in active vibration control of structures.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ymssp.2012.05.015", "venue": null, "journal": "Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing", "mag_id": "1991385713", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["6878753", "23467875", "3777299", "124799375", "28734730", "201624605", "117537657"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:121043996"}

So, 92 MODIS images were gained from NASA website for three water years of 2003\u20132005. Then, snow cover areas in all images were extracted and finally SWE values were calculated. Also, the data of precipitation, temperature and discharge for the mentioned years were used for modeling. According to the results, ANN with the hyperbolic tangent function, rainfall-temperature-SWE inputs, 1-day delay and RMSE and \\({R^{2}}\\) of 0.024 and 0.77, and the model with the sigmoid transfer function, rain-temperature-SWE inputs and RMSE and \\({R^{2}}\\) of 0.026 and 0.75 had better prediction capability than the other models. This indicates that the SWE has improved the accuracy of the models.

To address this problem, we compare two recently-introduced state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines and Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and develop how to use them to solve this difficult acoustic classification task. We obtain classification accuracy results that could make these techniques suitable for fielding on autonomous devices. Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machines appear to yield slightly better accuracy than Support Vector Machines, and are less sensitive to the choice of signal preprocessing and model hyperparameters. Importantly, we also address methodological issues that one faces in order to rigorously compare several classifiers on limited data collected from field trials; these questions are of significance to any application of machine learning methods to Army problems.

{"paper_id": "65396939", "title": "Relationship between conceptual and linguistic systems: toward a connectionist modelling approach", "authors": [{"first": "Peter", "middle": [], "last": "Fugger", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This thesis is related to embodied and symbolic approaches to the representation of meaning. Language is a structured symbolic representation system linked to the content. On the other hand we have concepts which are related to our experience in the world. Embodied approaches claim that language comprehension requires re-activation of our representations built from experiences with the world and that there are no amodal symbols (i.e. symbolic representations independent of any sensory modality) and that our concepts are perceptually grounded. Symbolic approaches claim that language comprehension relies on interdependencies of words, and that symbols are amodal, thus non-perceptual. What are the differences between comprehension of abstract and concrete concepts? The starting point is the view that two different systems are engaged and interacting when we comprehend language. One is the linguistic system (LS), the other is the conceptual system (CS). Different opinions are stated about the activation and contribution of these two systems during language comprehension - as it seems also to depend on the level of abstractness of the involved concepts. Accordingly, these opinions are represented by different theories; three of them shall serve as theoretical background for our intended connectionist model. ::: ::: Theoretical background ::: Linguistic and Simulation Systems (LASS) theory (Barsalou et al., 2008) of language understanding assumes that there is a distinction between knowledge that is purely linguistic and knowledge that is grounded in the brain's modal-specific systems. The LASS approach makes a principled distinction between linguistic versus conceptual representations, where each of them resides in two distinct systems, LS and a simulation system (CS). Simulation means that semantic content is achieved by re-activating, usually in weaker form, the same sensory-motor system which is used when the referent of a word or sentence is actually experienced. The LASS framework takes into account the evidence related to linguistic processing, situated simulation, mixtures and interactions between language and situated simulation, and statistical underpinnings of language and situated simulation. Situated simulation and hence conceptual structure relates to rich aspects of perceptual and subjective experience. When language is perceived then representations of linguistic forms are more similar to the perceived words than simulations of experience are. Therefore representations of linguistic forms are activated first. Upon that pointers to the related conceptual informations are generated. Linguistic strategies are regarded as relatively superficial: if the retrieval of linguistic forms and associated statistical information is sufficient for adequate performance, then no retrieval of deeper conceptual information is necessary. According to LASS, LS does not refer much to meaning; meaning is rather instead represented in the simulation system. ::: ::: Symbol interdependency hypothesis (SIH) (Louwerse & Jeuniaux, 2008) tries to combine the embodied and the symbolic approach. Language comprehension is claimed to be both embodied and symbolic. Language is partly grounded but symbols also derive meaning from other symbols because they are linked/interdependent to each other. The evidence for embodied representations is drawn from experiments showing that motor actions interact with comprehension. Eye-tracking studies show interaction between eye gaze and text comprehension. Conversation is multi-modal: eye gaze, facial expression, gesture and language interact. On the other hand, evidence for symbolic representations comes from statistical computational models such as LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis). It computes semantic relatedness by the frequency of word co-occurrences in large text corpora. This works upon the view that semantic relatedness or semantic similarity is given if the words occur in the same context. The output of these models correlates with human performance. ::: According to SIH, symbols are interdependent to objects AND to each other, therefore it is not always necessary for comprehension that every detail of the embodied representations has to be activated, but instead linguistic information can be used. Because of efficiency reasons in language processing a continuous systematic grounding is not yielded. Language is accessed symbolically, unless embodied representations are cued by the task. There is a very strong claim made by SIH: Embodied relations tend to be encoded in language structure, hence the structures found in the physical world are reflected in language structures. ::: Theory of Lexical Concepts and Cognitive Models (LCCM) (Evans, 2006) takes a somewhat intermediate position regarding meaning representation. It predicts that on LS side 'lexical concepts' represent linguistically encoded 'packages' of information which are conventionally associated with a particular phonological (and/or written) form. Lexical concepts also carry encoded information by combinations with other lexical concepts in an utterance. The lexical concepts provide access to a vast body of encyclopaedic knowledge in the CS. Each speaker can potentially activate this knowledge which is termed a lexical concept's semantic potential and is a collection of structured cognitive models. The semantic representation in LCCM is spread over both systems, LS and CS; it comprises cognitive models (CS) as well as lexical concepts (LS). ::: ::: Connectionist modelling ::: The intended connectionist model is motivated by the above mentioned theories that highlight the grounding of knowledge and also point to the relationship between the conceptual knowledge and linguistic knowledge. The goal of the model is to get a better insight in the interaction between the LS and the CS as well as the overall behaviour when concrete or abstract concepts are processed. The model will be based on LASS theory for the word level and on LCCM theory for a reduced/simple sentence level. ::: The model shall be implemented as a neural network whose core will consist of two main self-organizing maps (SOM), LS and CS. LS gets its representational structure using LSA-like method capturing the statistical relationships among the words. In the CS the semantic structure is developed by (preselected) modal features in case of concrete concepts and by (human-made) associations in case of abstract concepts. The semantic structure of the CS will be created as a SOM that will build spatial relationships between neurons depending on the similarities and frequencies of the input patterns. Both systems, CS and LS will be mapped to each other by associative connections trained by Hebbian learning. ::: The words and concepts are selected so that taxonomic hierarchies can be built, which is a certain kind of building abstract concepts (other abstract concepts like freedom or democracy are much more difficult to represent). For example a higher level in this taxonomy is the very essential distinction between living beings (animals, plants) and non-living things/objects. The variation within these categories is big enough so that sub-categories can be built downwards until a basic level is reached where the concrete concepts are described with their modal features. Which semantic representation form shall be chosen for sentences is still under investigation but the most likely candidates are the recurrent neural network that will be trained to represent simple SVO (subject-verb-object) sentences, and an auto-associative network that can learn compressed representations of sentence frames. ::: The model will allow to simulate various linguistic processes such as word comprehension, lexical decision task, or word production. It will be tested against the empirical evidence, related to differences in processing concrete and abstract concepts. The model shall also take into account that abstract words/concepts are learnt later than concrete ones and the differences in the development of the two systems: CS precedes LS (at least at the very beginning) but later on both systems can influence each other during development. ::: ::: References ::: Barsalou L., Santos A., Simmons W. & Wilson C.

The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) has been investigated with habitat modeling techniques since 1997. The objectives of this work were to predict the distribution of bottlenose dolphin in a coastal area through the use of static morphological features and to compare the prediction performances of three different modeling techniques: Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Random Forest (RF). Four static variables were tested: depth, bottom slope, distance from 100 m bathymetric contour and distance from coast. RF revealed itself both the most accurate and the most precise modeling technique with very high distribution probabilities predicted in presence cells (90.4% of mean predicted probabilities) and with 66.7% of presence cells with a predicted probability comprised between 90% and 100%.

The trajectory, which appears as a result of the ship\u2019s navigation, is monitored and stored by a Vessel Traffic Service center, and is used for an analysis of the ship\u2019s navigational pattern and risk assessment within a particular area. However, such an analysis is performed in the same manner, despite the different navigational environments between coastal areas and the harbor limits. The navigational environment within the harbor limits changes rapidly owing to construction of the port facilities, dredging operations, and so on. In this study, a support vector machine was used for processing and modeling the trajectory data. A K-fold cross-validation and a grid search were used for selecting the optimal parameters. A complicated traffic route similar to the circumstances of the harbor limits was constructed for a validation of the model. A group of vessels was composed, each vessel of which was given various speed and course changes along a specified route. As a result of the machine learning, the optimal route and voyage data model were obtained. Finally, the model was presented to Vessel Traffic Service operators to detect any anomalous vessel behaviors. Using the proposed data modeling method, we intend to support the decision-making of Vessel Traffic Service operators in terms of navigational patterns and their characteristics.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5391/IJFIS.2015.15.4.268", "venue": "Int.

To apply the wind power efficiently, predictions of the wind speed are very important. Thus, this paper aims to precisely predict the short term regional wind speed by using a real valued genetic algorithm (RGA) based least squared support vector machine (LS-SVM). A dataset including the time, temperature, humidity, and the average regional wind speed being measured in a randomly selected date from a wind farm being located in Penghu, Taiwan was selected for verifying the forecast efficiency of the proposed RGA based LS-SVM. In this empirical study, prediction errors of the wind turbine speed are very limited.

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are the state-of-the-art approaches taking the sequence characteristics to do better labeling. However, as the appearance of correlative characteristics between Web object elements, previous CRFs have their limitations for semantic annotation of Web objects and cannot deal with the long distance dependencies between Web object elements efficiently. To better incorporate the long distance dependencies, on one hand, this paper describes long distance dependencies by correlative edges, which are built by making good use of structured information and the characteristics of records from external databases; and on the other hand, this paper presents a two-dimensional Correlative-Chain Conditional Random Fields (2DCC-CRFs) to do semantic annotation of Web objects.

This can explain why two people that en- counter the same stimulus can behave in very different ways (Chomsky, 1959). For example, an art historian viewing a Jackson Pollock painting may exclaim \u201cthis is beautiful\u201d due to her representation of his work as a rejection of painting with a brush; however, a lay person may say \u201cthis is ugly\u201d due to his representation of the painting as a cluttered mess of col- ors. Without knowledge of the representations of each person in this example, it would be nearly impossible to explain their behavior when interacting with the Jackson Pollock painting. Over the last three decades, cognitive psychologists have demonstrated that the representations people use can change flexibly to capture changes in their environment (Hoffman & Richards, 1985; Schyns, Goldstone, & Thilbaut, 1998; Gold- stone, 2003). However, if the representations we use are de- termined by the stimuli in our environment, this threatens the explanatory utility of representations as it could be superflu- ous to use representations to explain people\u2019s reaction to stim- uli if the representations are determined by the stimuli. Thus, cognitive psychologists need to explicitly formulate how rep- resentations change with experience. Although computational modelers, from connectionists to Bayesians, disagree on many things, one thing they do agree on is the importance of representations in their models (Mc- Clelland et al., 2010; Griffiths, Chater, Kemp, Perfors, & Tenenbaum, 2010). Recently, there has been a growing in- terest in exploring computational models that adapt their rep- resentations with experience in ways that match this human capacity. In this symposium, we explore computational mod- els that adapt their representations with experience in ways that are inspired by the human capability. Recently, there have been several proposals for computa- tional models whose representations flexibly adapt to the in- put data like people do; however, there has not been a thor- ough comparison of the different models. The goal of the symposium is the compare and contrast the different meth- ods, evaluate their ability to capture of human representation learning, and make explicit what is meant in each model by \u201crepresentation change\u201d as this can be a controversial claim (Schyns et al., 1998). Currently, it is not clear whether or not the different proposals mean the same thing by a \u201crepresenta- tion\u201d and if they are competing proposals to explain the same aspect of human cognition or different levels of explanation. Thus, the symposium will emphasize understanding what is meant by representation change and how well each model can explain human representation change. The symposium will focus on a wide variety of methods for representation learning from some of the most popular computational paradigms in computational cognitive science: nonparametric Bayesian modeling (Austerweil & Griffiths; Canini & Griffiths), connectionist modeling (Gureckis; Gold- stone), and reinforcement learning (Jones). Importantly, each presenter will focus on how their computational proposals ex- plain human experimental data and discussing what exactly is a representation in their framework and how they are inferred. Thus, the symposium should be interesting to a broad audi- ence of cognitive scientists (from computation modelers to experimentalists to philosphers). We hope it inspires a growth of new computational models and human experiments in this underdeveloped, yet incredibly important, aspect of cognitive science. Introduction and Nonparametric Bayesian Models of Fea- ture Learning Austerweil and Griffiths Cognitive psychology is concerned primarly with representations and how they mediate the re- sponse to stimuli. In this talk, we present a framework for exploring the principles underlying human feature learning using nonparametric Bayesian statistics. We show that our framework can capture how people infer features using sta- tistical information of the observed images, spatial informa- tion from the observed images, and categorization cues. Next, we extend our initial framework to infer features that are in- variant over a set of transformations and demonstrate that the model infers new invariant features like people do. Although most shapes and features can be transformed by translations and rescalings, some shapes and features lose their identity when rotated. We show how our model is easily extended to capture how people infer the allowable set of transformations of an object from their observations of the object. Finally, we conclude with the implications of our framework for refer- ence frames in shape perception and feature-based cognitive models and compare it to other approaches for inferring rep- resentations. Building flexible categorization models by grounding them in perception Goldstone One limitation of most existing models of catego- rization is that they do not start with a perceptually grounded representation of the objects that they categorize. Instead, they use dimensional or featural representations that discard information about the spatial relations among an object\u2019s parts. This restricts the models\u2019 ability to create psycho- logically plausible object representations that can be flexibly adapted to meet categorization demands.

In contrast to previous techniques which generate the semantic map on the whole global scene immediately or smooth the semantic predictions by a graph model, we intend to discover temporal information over RGB-D images and leverage it to enforce the label consistency. Our method contains two key components: a low-level component and a high-level component. On the low level, temporal segmentation method is adopted to find the correspondence of the superpixels incrementally. On the high level, temporal information is treated as the higher order cliques and a higher-order Dense Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is utilized to jointly infer the object category and structural class of the global point cloud. On the experiments, we compare our temporal consistent segmentation algorithm with the state-of-the-art approach and generate the semantic maps from the NYU v2 dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that temporal consistent constraints are significant for the semantic mapping procedure and can improve the precision of the semantic mapping results.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IROS.2015.7353359", "venue": "2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)", "journal": "2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2214706885", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15922160", "11830123", "15010509", "15174950", "13993169", "6718247", "12061055", "6681692", "15284132", "15225615", "14281310", "333838", "15623791", "942000", "207173948", "778478", "2121536", "461853", "207663697", "5574079", "3084505", "10139639"], "inbound_citations": ["14381705"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3722122"}

We predict good honours outcomes based on data at admission, and some early results from the 1st year. ::: ::: Secondly, we study more granular predictions at the module level. We compare several data mining techniques in order to build both regression and classification models. One of the difficulties we encounter is that, within our problem, missing data is abundant because students do not always take the same module choices. The problem of missing data is prevalent in many data mining applications and remains challenging. We address this problem in a novel way by using multiple imputation combined with an ensemble setting to produce our models. The results show that all the data mining algorithms that use multiple imputation perform better than those without multiple imputation, both in the cases of classification and regression. The algorithms developed, and in particular Support Vector Machines and Random Forest, give us reasonably accurate predictions that could be used as the basis for a future recommender system to assist with module choice selection. ::: ::: Lastly, we study how to use the knowledge found in a way acceptable to students and other stakeholders.

In this paper, we propose a Semi-Random Projection (SRP) framework, which takes the merit of random feature sampling of RP, but employs learning mechanism in the determination of the transformation matrix. One advantage of SRP is that it achieves a good balance between computational complexity and classification accuracy. Another advantage of SRP is that multiple SRP modules can be stacked to form a deep learning architecture for compact and robust feature learning. In addition, based on the insight on the relationship between RP and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), the SRP is applied to ELM to derive Partially Connected ELM (PC-ELM). The hidden nodes of PC-ELM are more discriminative and hence a smaller number of nodes are needed.

First, we investigate a feasible device structure with practical physical parameters in micromagnetic numerical analysis, and show the detailed characteristics of the forward volume magnetostatic spin waves. Then, we demonstrate high generalization ability in the estimation of input-signal parameters performed by the spin-wave-based reservoir computing. We find that the hysteresis characteristics of the spin waves propagating asymmetrically with respect to excitation points, as well as the nonlinear interference, works advantageously to realize high diversity in the time-sequential signals in high-dimensional information space, which has the highest significance for effective learning in reservoir computing.

The optimal logP was at 5.5 (Ghose-Crippen ALOGP estimate) while both higher and lower values were detrimental to biological potency.

To validate this QSAR model, we synthesized six novel, highly lipophilic diaza-18-crown-6 derivatives with adamantane moieties attached to the side arms.

The bioactivities of different diaza-18-crown-6 analogs in Bacillus subtilis and cancer cells were correlated, suggesting conserved molecular features may be mediating the cytotoxic response.

Our approach abstracts the sub-scenes with geometric primitives, and accordingly constructs the topology graphs with structural attributes based on the functional parts of objects (namely, anchors). To decompose sub-scenes into individual indoor objects, we devise an anchor-guided subgraph matching algorithm which leverages template graphs to partition the graphs into subgraphs (i.e., individual objects), which is capable of handling arbitrarily oriented objects within scenes. Subsequently, we present a data-driven approach to model individual objects, which is particularly formulated as a model instance recognition problem.

Conventional metric-learning methods achieve satisfactory performance on distance metric computation of data in a single-view observation space, but fail to handle well data sampled from multiview observation spaces, especially those with highly nonlinear structure. To tackle this problem, we propose a new method called Multiview Metric Learning with Global consistency and Local smoothness (MVML-GL) under a semisupervised learning setting, which jointly considers global consistency and local smoothness. The basic idea is to reveal the shared latent feature space of the multiview observations by embodying global consistency constraints and preserving local geometric structures. Specifically, this framework is composed of two main steps. In the first step, we seek a global consistent shared latent feature space, which not only preserves the local geometric structure in each space but also makes those labeled corresponding instances as close as possible. In the second step, the explicit mapping functions between the input spaces and the shared latent space are learned via regularized locally linear regression. Furthermore, these two steps both can be solved by convex optimizations in closed form. Experimental results with application to manifold alignment on real-world datasets of pose and facial expression demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2168752.2168767", "venue": "TIST", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2107407880", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5702881", "6865208", "5896838", "2629535", "2261947", "7519208", "125621430", "1555909", "8616518", "1157198", "2913820", "202473", "10726702", "122166830", "2695159", "10082278", "9383617", "7599559", "42094340", "9096902", "1586662", "2071866", "17230667", "10444821", "10331842", "7138354", "207168317", "8170563", "47325215", "14963093", "18501843", "14286472", "8255387", "2643381", "1736184", "6302074", "7738304", "17066951", "176392", "3923437"], "inbound_citations": ["201650137", "914562", "23108774", "2119068", "167205351", "167205351", "16521938", "83458773", "15361180", "21811851", "9410918", "12571832", "57361495", "7979386", "6470978", "70047933", "30880819", "18058643", "86634060", "207121080", "9189739", "3344397", "57761159", "3432436", "4605913", "32577220", "16843297", "14378357", "785692", "9911235", "46932164", "18908012", "3999229", "198906771", "17497337", "7311300", "8361833", "195786159", "3876303"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18999596"}

These methods employ weights to measure the informativeness of a brain region and highly reduce the large computational cost that Searchlight entails. We evaluated their performance in two different scenarios where the differential BOLD activation between experimental conditions was large vs. small, and employed nine different atlases to assess the influence of diverse brain parcellations. Results show that both methods were able to localize informative regions when differences between conditions were large, demonstrating a large sensitivity and stability in the identification of regions across atlases. Moreover, the sign of the weights reported by these methods provided the directionality of univariate approaches. However, when differences were small, only ABLA localized informative regions.

Repeated stimuli will lead to unpredictable impairment on signals, due to material familiarity or subjects\u05f3 fatigue. In this consideration, signal processing tools powerful on small numbers of trials are expected to alleviate the work load on subjects, especially for mental disease studies. Methods Forty-four subjects, half-depressed patients and half-healthy subjects, were recruited for MEG scanning in response to sad facial stimuli. Multichannel matching pursuit (MMP) was implemented to manage the limited number of trials. The post-MMP MEG signals were utilized to calculate the power topography over the whole brain, as inputs for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Standard ICA and conventional ensemble averaging plus Butterworth filtering were employed as well as benchmark studies for performance comparison. Results A limited number of trials were required via MMP to discriminate the depressive. Post-MMP discriminative analysis revealed a deficit theta pattern and an excessive alpha/beta pattern. Limitations The small sample size may impair the stability of the reported findings. The transient tiny variance of the signal was excluded from exploration. Conclusions The deficit theta pattern together with the excessive alpha/beta pattern in depression may indicate the dysfunction of the limbic-cortical circuit in a \u2018top-down\u2019 process.

Another, even more challenging problem, is how one can exploit partially labeled data of a source task to learn good representations for a different, but related, target task. This is the main subject of transfer learning. ::: ::: In this paper, we present a novel approach to transfer learning based on kernel learning.

However, most of current approaches are dealing with some specific tasks or a part of the ontology learning process rather than providing complete support to users. There are few studies that attempt to automate the entire ontology learning process from the collection of domain-specific literature, filtering out documents irrelevant to the domain, to text mining to build new ontologies or enrich existing ones.

It can be considered as the foundation of some advanced models such as random parameter models. Despite its rich literature and ample application in various fields, still there is room for improving the accuracy of these models. For instance, the process of selecting independent variables to be incorporated in the model is still known as a challenging issue ADDIN EN.CITE Prinzie 2008 82 (Prinzie and Van den Poel, 2008) 82 82 17 Prinzie, Anita Van den Poel, Dirk Random Forests for multiclass classification: Random MultiNomial Logit Expert Systems with Applications Expert Systems with Applications 1721-1732 34 3 Multiclass classifier design and evaluation Feature evaluation and selection Data mining methods and algorithms Customer relationship management (CRM) 2008 4// 0957-4174 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407000498 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2007.01.029 ( Prinzie and Van den Poel, 2008 ) . This study aims to employ bagging predictors method ADDIN EN.CITE Breiman 1996 112 (Breiman, 1996) 112 112 17 Breiman, Leo Bagging predictors Machine learning Machine learning 123-140 24 2 1996 0885-6125 ( Breiman, 1996 ) , which has been explored in data mining paradigm, in the discrete choice modelling context and examine its merits and demerits. The bagging predictors method refers to developing a combination of models (alternatively referred to as predictors) which have similar structures but different coefficients. The coefficients in each version of model are estimated based on fitting the model to a random subsample of the main database. This technique was initially used to structure a random forest (RF) model, where each individual model is a decision tree. Bagging predictors not only has been shown to increase the accuracy of the model, but it also enables modellers to select independent variables more efficiently. Methodology In the first step, this study uses the same terminology of RF and structures a combination of MNL in opposed to a single MNL model. Then it examines the distribution of estimated values of coefficients for each independent variable. Besides, it investigates the statistical relationship between the achieved distribution and the true value of it if a single model was developed for the whole population. It should be emphasized that, similar to RF, for developing individual models, only a random subset of independent variables are considered. In other words, not all the independent variables are present in every individual model. The bagging predictors method facilitate the variable selection process in a systematic way which results in a more flexible structure for examining policy sensitive variables. There several reasons that policy sensitive variables might not be end up being included in an MNL model. Not being statistically significant when estimated with the full sample, and having correlation with other independent variables which have stronger relationship with the dependent variable can result in exclusion of some explanatory variables. Obviously, if a variable is not included, the model is not capable of capturing the elasticity of the dependent variable due to changes in the independent variable. Hence, the model is not capable of estimating the sensitivity of the results due to policies affecting the excluded variable. On the contrary, in the proposed method, every independent variable would be incorporated in a number of individual models therefore it has a contribution to the final result of the model ensemble. However, calculating the elasticity in this case is not as straightforward as for the MNL, and numerical procedures would be required. In terms of data, the online available data on travel mode choice for intercity travel in Australia is chosen for model estimation [1] . This dataset is consisted of 840 observations for 210 individuals who choose a travel mode for traveling from Sydney to Melbourne. There are two individual specific attributes and four alternative specific variables in the dataset. Income and party size are the two individual specific attributes, and the alternative specific variables comprise waiting time, vehicle cost, generalized cost and travel time. The competing modes for each individual are car, air, train and bus. Lastly as a reference point, the ensemble model is compared against a random parameter logit model ADDIN EN.CITE McFadden 2000 113 (McFadden and Train, 2000) 113 113 17 McFadden, Daniel Train, Kenneth Mixed MNL models for discrete response Journal of applied Econometrics Journal of Applied Econometrics 447-470 15 5 2000 0883-7252 ( McFadden and Train, 2000 ) . It is assumed that developing separated models for subsamples of database can be considered as an alternative way to capture taste variation in the database. Therefore, the model ensemble is compared against a random parameter logit model to illustrate its merits and demerits. The comparison covers the distribution of coefficients and the overall accuracy of models in predicting observed data. When it comes to the simulation process, final result of the model ensemble can be derived either by averaging out the result of individual models, when the dependent variable is continuous, or by plurality vote, when predicting a discrete variable is aimed. Regularly modellers divide the dataset into training data and test data in order to achieve an unbiased estimation of model\u2019s accuracy. Whereas, regarding the concept of out of bag (OOB) data, the bagging predictors technique inherently provides an unbiased estimation of accuracy. Technically, the set of all observations which are not present in the developing process of each individual model is called OOB for that model. Considering the results of those models where a specific observation is in their OOB set gives an unbiased estimation of the model ensemble accuracy for that observation, and aggregating single accuracy on all observations results in an overall unbiased estimation of accuracy. In this fashion, model developing process benefits from using all of observations and test and train sectioning becomes redundant. Reference Breiman, L. (1996) Bagging predictors.

In addition, class activation map (CAM), a visualization technique for CNNs, is applied for providing an interpretation of the results.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1808.02870", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2885930233", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17956469", "207738357", "3892881", "54466407", "122660469", "160705", "86522127", "36306547", "13195869", "5808102", "6628106", "3889213", "6294674", "6916627", "3074096", "3312863", "16636683", "30386292", "12074985", "6443440", "1450294", "21056258", "7243878", "9591565", "6789015", "60385584"], "inbound_citations": ["212419858"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51940073"}

Since ELM randomly initializes the hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights, it may easily lead to redundant hidden representation and numerical instability problem. Conventional single-objective optimization methods have been applied for improving ELM, however multiple objectives associate with ELM should be considered. This paper proposes an evolutionary ELM method based on multiobjective particle swam optimization to overcome the drawbacks. The input weights and hidden biases are learnt by optimizing three objectives simultaneously including the root mean squared error, the norm of the output weights and the sparsity of hidden output matrix. The proposed method tends to select small weights which make ELM becomes robust to small input changes for improving the numerical stability. Moreover, this algorithm inhibits activated neurons and enables ELM to obtain an informative hidden representation. The proposed approach can achieve good generalization performance with sparse hidden representation. Experimental results verify that the new algorithm is highly competitive and superior to ELM and conventional evolutionary ELMs on benchmark classification problems.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-95957-3_1", "venue": "ICIC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2881222688", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51941940"}

In a first phase, we have individually benchmarked 13 different descriptor types in fold identification experiments in a highly diverse set of protein sequences. The relevant descriptors were related to the fold class membership by using simple similarity measures in the descriptor spaces, such as the cosine angle. Our results revealed that the three best-performing sets of descriptors were the sequence-alignment-based descriptor using PSI-BLAST e-values, the descriptors based on the alignment of secondary structural elements (SSEA), and the descriptors based on the occurrence of PROSITE functional motifs. In a second phase, the three top-performing descriptors were combined to obtain a final method with improved performance, which we named DescFold. Class membership was predicted by Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning. In comparison with the individual PSI-BLAST-based descriptor, the rate of remote homology identification increased from 33.7% to 46.3%. We found out that the composite set of descriptors was able to identify the true remote homolog for nearly every sixth sequence at the 95% confidence level, or some 10% more than a single PSI-BLAST search.

The use of existing computing intelligence methods is not always appropriate due to the significant complexity of training and debugging procedures.

Therefore, the paper describes a new ensemble method based on generalized regression neural networks. The basic idea of the developed ensemble is to linearize the response surface given by the data of the available sample. Therefore, the surface obtained by means of the general regression neural network is given to the input of a linear neural structure. This combination helps improve the accuracy of solving the task by the ensemble. The described ensemble is used to solve the problem of predicting the price of used cars. Application of the ensemble developed enables predicting the price of the used cars based on the most suitable independent attributes. In common practice solving this task requires expert knowledge.

Support Vector Machines with a linear kernel are used to classify the epochs and receiver operating characteristic analysis is used to evaluate our method's performance. I. INTRODUCTION An expanding research field on Biomedical Engineering is the design of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). In recent years the scientific community has focused its efforts in providing patients suffering a motor disability with a way to communicate or interact with the external world. Many BCI system are based in the analysis of the EEG Event Related Potentials (ERP) such as the P300 oddball event response (1). The most reliable method to detect a P300 is the averaging of several epochs that contain the ERP, however the number of epochs is large (at least five preprocessed epochs) and it could take a few minutes to process a meaningful message. A proposed solution to this problem is the ERP detection in a single epoch of EEG (2). The most difficult part of the detection problem is the feature extraction due to the poor signal to noise ratio (SNR) of a single epoch. The P300 is a positive deflection that ocurrs around 300 ms after the stimuli; this deflection is clearly a low-frecuency signals, therefore a method to filter or decompose the signal could be used to spot this wave. The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a method of analysis that represents a signal as the sum of a zero-mean amplitude-frecuency modulated signal set (3). Each element of this set is known as a Intrinsical Mode Function (IMF). Based on the IMF, different feature extraction schemes could be design. Once a number of features have been extracted for each epoch a classifier is used to perform the detection task. We have selected the Support Vector Ma- chines (SVM) wich are classifiers that adjust an hyperplane to the training sets minimizing the distance of the decision boundary to the data (4).", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17946027", "doi": "10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260589", "venue": "Conference proceedings : ...

In the past, several efforts have been made to predict cancer biomarkers with very limited success so far. One of the challenges in the field of cancer biology is to predict cancer at an early stage. The success of various therapies to treat cancer patients depends on correct identification of stage or progression of cancer. Despite the tremendous progress in the field of genomics and proteomics, the performance of stage classification has not improved substantially. Recently our group also developed CancerCSP, a server with prediction models for discriminating early and late stage of clear cell renal cancer (ccRCC) samples based on the gene expression profile. We achieved maximum accuracy of 72.64% with ROC value 0.81, despite the fact that we tried state of- the-art techniques to improve the performance of our models. This raises the question, why the models fail to discriminate ccRCC patients in the early and late stage with high accuracy. In this poster, the analysis is carried out on ccRCC samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal to understand the reasons for the failure of the stage classification models. Firstly, we performed bin-wise analysis of top 20 genes that can discriminate (single gene-based models using threshold) early and late stage samples with highest ROC. A significant overlap was observed in the expression of each gene in early and late stage samples. Though the number of early and late stage samples varied in different gene expression bins, this was not sufficient to classify both types of samples with high accuracy. As an example, the gene NR3C2 had maximum ROC of 0.67 at expression (log RSEM) of 7.61. There were nearly 70% early stage patients above this threshold that made it an average expression marker but the presence of nearly 55% of late stage patients above this threshold increased the false positives. Secondly, we performed hierarchical clustering of ccRCC samples using 64- gene expression features selected using Weka showed weak concordance with pathological stage. The k-means clustering of patients into four groups showed four separable clusters, but these clusters were not associated with the pathological stage. These observations led to the conclusion that the molecular parameters do not always comply with histopathological features. The third analysis was done to identify patients, which were not predicted correctly by any of the four machine-learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, SMO and Naive Bayes). Many samples were not predicted correctly by any of the four machine-learning methods. The false positives and false negatives belonged to explicit clusters obtained through clustering. This further points out to the interspersed nature of the data to differentiate between histopathological stages of cancer. We reach the conclusion that expression profile of genes is not adequate to classify different stages of cancer samples.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3107411.3108211", "venue": "ACM-BCB '17", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2746661221", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31110732"}

By exploiting the higher order correlations among the tasks, MLMTL is expected to improve the performance of traditional MTL, which only considers the first-order correlation across all tasks, e.g., low-rank structure of the coefficient matrix. The key to MLMTL is designing a rational regularization term to represent the latent correlation structure underlying the coefficient tensor instead of matrix. In this paper, we propose a new MLMTL model by employing the rank-product regularization term in the objective, which on one hand can automatically rectify the weights along all its tensor modes and on the other hand have an explicit physical meaning. By using this regularization, the intrinsic high-order correlations among tasks can be more precisely described, and thus, the overall performance of all tasks can be improved. To solve the resulted optimization model, we design an efficient algorithm by applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We also analyze the convergence and show that the proposed algorithm, with certain restriction, is asymptotically regular.

In this research, we discriminated and mapped tree species in tropical seasonal semi-deciduous forests (Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome) by using airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral data in the 450 to 2400 nm wavelength range. After quantifying the spectral variability within and among individual tree crowns of eight species, three supervised machine learning classifiers were applied to discriminate the species at the pixel level. Linear Discriminant Analysis outperformed Support Vector Machines with Linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF-SVMs) kernels and Random Forests in almost all the tested cases. An average classification accuracy of 70% was obtained when using the visible/near-infrared (VNIR, 450\u2013919 nm) bands. The inclusion of shortwave infrared bands (SWIR, 1045\u20132400 nm) increased the accuracy to 84%. Narrow-band vegetation indices (VIs) were also tested and increased the classification accuracy by up to 5% when combined with VNIR features. Furthermore, the spectral bands of the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite sensor were simulated for classification purposes. WV-3 VNIR bands provided an accuracy of 57.4%, which increased to 74.8% when using WV-3 SWIR bands. We also tested the production of species maps by using an object-oriented approach that integrated a novel segmentation algorithm that was tailored to delineate tree crowns and label high class membership pixels inside each object. In this scenario, RBF-SVMs produced the best species maps, correctly identifying 84.9% of crowns with hyperspectral data and 78.5% with simulated WV-3 data. The use of a reduced set of hyperspectral bands, which were selected with stepwise regression, did not significantly affect the classification accuracies but allowed us to depict the most important wavelengths to discriminate the species. These wavelengths were located around the green reflectance peak (550 nm), at the red absorption feature (650 nm) and in the SWIR range at 1200, 1700, 2100 and 2300 nm. These encouraging results suggest the feasibility of the proposed approach for mapping pioneering and climax tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome, highlighting its potential use in forest recovery and inventory initiatives.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2016.03.021", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2329061269", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["54046644", "134221058", "21688358", "30523189", "35256112", "68050886", "132463292", "73633534", "86867198", "155125521", "33274891", "204959911", "60442741", "132406778", "209336587", "134347339", "56237636", "204913522", "4556556", "91648221", "57012581", "53233161", "165146810", "108284262", "427994", "201692754", "210843399"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131052853"}

The objective of this research is to classify major crop types cultivated in Karacabey Plain of north western Turkey using multitemporal Kompsat-2 and Envisat ASAR data with an object-based methodology.

Next, Mean-Shift image segmentation procedure is applied to the pansharpened Kompsat-2 data with multiple parameter combinations. Multiple goodness measures are utilized to evaluate the object-based results. The optimum objects are then employed in object-based classifications of the single-date images. Next, single-date multispectral (MS) Kompsat-2 images and Kompsat-2 images along with the Envisat ASAR data are classified with the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) method. The training samples are provided automatically by the selected objects based on spatial statistical properties. Next, probability maps are generated for each image in pixel-based manner during the image classification operations. The maximum probabilities are then assigned to the pixels as class labels and the combined thematic maps (June-July, June-August, June-July-August) are generated in pixel-based and object-based manners.

Two of the four components in the original EFICAz are based on the detection of functionally discriminating residues (FDRs). FDRs distinguish between member of an enzyme family that are homofunctional (classified under the EC number of interest) or heterofunctional (annotated with another EC number or lacking enzymatic activity). Each of the two FDR-based components is associated to one of two specific kinds of enzyme families. EFICAz exhibits high precision performance, except when the maximal test to training sequence identity (MTTSI) is lower than 30%. To improve EFICAz's performance in this regime, we: i) increased the number of predictive components and ii) took advantage of consensual information from the different components to make the final EC number assignment.ResultsWe have developed two new EFICAz components, analogs to the two FDR-based components, where the discrimination between homo and heterofunctional members is based on the evaluation, via Support Vector Machine models, of all the aligned positions between the query sequence and the multiple sequence alignments associated to the enzyme families. Benchmark results indicate that: i) the new SVM-based components outperform their FDR-based counterparts, and ii) both SVM-based and FDR-based components generate unique predictions. We developed classification tree models to optimally combine the results from the six EFICAz components into a final EC number prediction. The new implementation of our approach, EFICAz2, exhibits a highly improved prediction precision at MTTSI < 30% compared to the original EFICAz, with only a slight decrease in prediction recall. A comparative analysis of enzyme function annotation of the human proteome by EFICAz2 and KEGG shows that: i) when both sources make EC number assignments for the same protein sequence, the assignments tend to be consistent and ii) EFICAz2 generates considerably more unique assignments than KEGG.ConclusionPerformance benchmarks and the comparison with KEGG demonstrate that EFICAz2 is a powerful and precise tool for enzyme function annotation, with multiple applications in genome analysis and metabolic pathway reconstruction.

Thus, providing automatic tool to assist clinicians during the diagnosis task is highly desirable. In this work, we propose a fully automatic approach for accurate severe cardiac stenoses detection. Our algorithm uses the Random Forest classi cation to detect stenotic areas. First, the classi er is trained on 18 CT cardiac exams with CTA reference standard. Then, then classi cation result is used to detect severe stenoses (with a narrowing degree higher than 50%) in a 30 cardiac CT exam database. Features that best captures the di erent stenoses con guration are extracted along the vessel centerlines at di erent scales. To ensure the accuracy against the vessel direction and scale changes, we extract features inside cylindrical patterns with variable directions and radii. Thus, we make sure that the ROIs contains only the vessel walls. The algorithm is evaluated using the Rotterdam Coronary Artery Stenoses Detection and Quantication Evaluation Framework. The evaluation is performed using reference standard quanti cations obtained from quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and consensus reading of CTA.

The information exchange (pheromone) behavior of ants has been applied to forecast traffic conditions in existing pheromone models. These models were developed to forecast congestion on roads with signalized intersections by considering only green and red phases. Motivated by this issue, three short-term traffic forecasting models are proposed: (i) Extended Pheromone Model (EPM), (ii) Extended Pheromone Model with epsilon-Support Vector Regression ( e SVR-EPM), and (iii) Extended Pheromone Model with Artificial Neural Network and Particle Swarm Optimization (ANNPSO-EPM). It is worth noticing that EPM is an algorithmic model whereas the other two are machine learning models. In all proposed models, a new color pheromone concept is proposed with two significant contributions. First, the color pheromone concept is developed to capture stochastic traffic conditions on the roads with non-signalized intersections. Second, the proposed concept is further extended to include all three color phases (red, yellow and green) to forecast dynamic changing traffic behaviors for roads with signalized intersections. The proposed color pheromone concept in EPM, e SVR-EPM, and ANNPSO-EPM is different from the existing models as it dynamically switches its computation techniques based on traffic light phases. All three proposed models can be realized through a Pheromone-based Multi-Agent System composed of Vehicle Agents and Intersection Agents coordinating locally with one another To promote practicality, Singapore City Hall map is employed in a microscopic simulator of Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO), showing that all proposed models outperform the other existing pheromone models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.engappai.2019.03.017", "venue": "Eng.

To this end, two different Computational Intelligence approaches are herein evaluated: (1) a modified Harmony Search (HS) optimization algorithm with an exponential prediction model and (2) an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). In the case of the HS, a feature selection of the best set of features for the prediction is carried out jointly with the optimization of the model\u2019s parameters. On the other hand, the ELM will be tested with and without the feature selection carried out by the HS approach. We describe several modifications on the proposed HS, which include a hybrid encoding with a binary part for the feature selection, and a real part to tune the parameters of the prediction model. Other adaptations focused on the HS operators are also introduced. The performance of both approaches has been assessed in a real application scenario, corresponding to the total energy demand estimation in Spain, in which we have 14 macroeconomic variables with history values for the last 30 years, including the recent crisis period starting in 2008. The performance of the proposed HS and ELM models incorporating feature selection is shown to provide an accurate one-year-ahead forecast at a higher prediction\u2019s accuracy when compared to previous proposals in the literature. Specifically, the HS and ELM approaches are able to improve the results of a previous approach (based on a genetic algorithm), obtaining an improvement over 15% in this problem of energy demand estimation. As a final experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm, a similar problem of one-year ahead CO 2 emissions estimation from macro-economic variables is also tackled, and also in this case the HS and ELM are able to obtain significant improvements over a previous approach based on evolutionary computation, over 10% of improvement in this problem.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.enconman.2015.03.109", "venue": null, "journal": "Energy Conversion and Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2042845339", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["198145378", "125094559", "208206302", "54872949", "30064616", "208207708", "198326548"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17012731"}

Tundra fires exert considerable influence on local ecosystem functioning and contribute to climate change through biogeochemical (e.g. carbon cycle) and biogeophysical (e.g. albedo) effects. These treeless landscapes are characterized by a high degree of variation in fuel loading at scales much finer than moderate (30 m) satellite observations. However, because of the remoteness of the tundra and its lower contribution to carbon release compared to boreal forests, most frequently tundra fuels are poorly characterized, limiting the effective development of tundra-specific fire occurrence and behavior models. This study presents an approach to mapping the fractional coverages of major fuel type components in Alaskan tundra circa 2015 combining field data and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager observations. We adopt a multi-step Random Forest method to estimate the fractional vegetation cover of woody, herbaceous, and nonvascular components at subpixel level. We demonstrate the strong capability of exploiting multi-seasonal spectral information to identify these component types, with R-squared values around 0.95 and root mean squared errors below 10% for predicting their fractional cover. Our mapping products depict the spatial distribution of woody, herbaceous, and nonvascular components at subpixel resolution across Alaskan tundra, which can function as a critical input for studying wildland fire risk and behavior in the tundra.

The diffuse infiltration into the surrounding normal brain by these tumors makes their accurate identification by the naked eye difficult. Since surgery is the common treatment for brain cancer, an accurate radical resection of the tumor leads to improved survival rates for patients. However, the identification of the tumor boundaries during surgery is challenging. Hyperspectral imaging is a non-contact, non-ionizing and non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis. This study presents the development of a novel classification method taking into account the spatial and spectral characteristics of the hyperspectral images to help neurosurgeons to accurately determine the tumor boundaries in surgical-time during the resection, avoiding excessive excision of normal tissue or unintentionally leaving residual tumor. The algorithm proposed in this study to approach an efficient solution consists of a hybrid framework that combines both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Firstly, a supervised pixel-wise classification using a Support Vector Machine classifier is performed. The generated classification map is spatially homogenized using a one-band representation of the HS cube, employing the Fixed Reference t-Stochastic Neighbors Embedding dimensional reduction algorithm, and performing a K-Nearest Neighbors filtering. The information generated by the supervised stage is combined with a segmentation map obtained via unsupervised clustering employing a Hierarchical K-Means algorithm. The fusion is performed using a majority voting approach that associates each cluster with a certain class. To evaluate the proposed approach, five hyperspectral images of surface of the brain affected by glioblastoma tumor in vivo from five different patients have been used.

The recently proposed cost-sensitive hinge loss support vector machine (CSHL-SVM) guarantees consistency with the cost-sensitive Bayes risk, and this technique provides better generalization accuracy compared to traditional cost-sensitive support vector machines. In practice, data typically appear in the form of sequential chunks, also called an on-line scenario. However, conventional batch learning algorithms waste a considerable amount of time under the on-line scenario due to re-training of a model from scratch. To make CSHL-SVM more practical for the on-line scenario, we propose a chunk incremental learning algorithm for CSHL-SVM, which can update a trained model without re-training from scratch when incorporating a chunk of new samples. Our method is efficient because it can update the trained model for not only one sample at a time but also multiple samples at a time. Our experimental results on a variety of datasets not only confirm the effectiveness of CSHL-SVM but also show that our method is more efficient than the batch algorithm of CSHL-SVM and the incremental learning method of CSHL-SVM only for a single sample.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2018.05.023", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.", "journal": "Pattern Recognit.", "mag_id": "2806842871", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["209481499", "201139739", "59413340", "214761775", "209460772", "202560019"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52009478"}

Considering the complementarity of different media platforms, it is reasonable to leverage venue-relevant media data from different platforms to boost the prediction performance. Intuitively, recognizing one venue category involves multiple semantic cues, especially objects and scenes and, thus, they should contribute together to venue category prediction. In addition, these venues can be organized in a natural hierarchical structure, which provides prior knowledge to guide venue category estimation. Taking these aspects into account, we propose a Hierarchy-dependent Cross-platform Multi-view Feature Learning (HCM-FL) framework for venue category prediction from videos by leveraging images from other platforms. HCM-FL includes two major components, namely Cross-Platform Transfer Deep Learning (CPTDL) and Multi-View Feature Learning with the Hierarchical Venue Structure (MVFL-HVS). CPTDL is capable of reinforcing the learned deep network from videos using images from other platforms. Specifically, CPTDL first trained a deep network using videos. These images from other platforms are filtered by the learnt network and these selected images are then fed into this learnt network to enhance it. Two kinds of pre-trained networks on the ImageNet and Places dataset are employed. Therefore, we can harness both object-oriented and scene-oriented deep features through these enhanced deep networks. MVFL-HVS is then developed to enable multi-view feature fusion. It is capable of embedding the hierarchical structure ontology to support more discriminative joint feature learning. We conduct the experiment on videos from Vine and images from Foursquare.

In this paper, we propose an approach and introduce a novel algorithm for extraction of first-order rules from propositional rule learners, when dealing with data propositionalized with BCP. A theorem then shows that the extracted first-order rules are consistent with their propositional version. The algorithm was evaluated using the rule learner RIPPER, although it can be applied on any propositional rule learner. Initial results show that the accuracies of both RIPPER and the extracted first-order rules can be comparable to those obtained by Aleph (a traditional ILP system), but our approach is considerably faster (obtaining speed-ups of over an order of magnitude), generating a compact rule set with at least the same representation power as standard ILP learners.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4230/OASIcs.ICCSW.2013.35", "venue": "ICCSW", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2245453572", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6745692", "6492502", "9531857", "14682074", "5310845", "62175176", "16455032", "15772014", "11261417", "36237350", "12643399", "16762143", "47073917", "5262555", "15982740", "11059482", "2127626"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2453700"}

However, the performance of statistical methods is reported to be limited due to the inadequate accuracy produced by the inability of these methods to comprehend the meaning of texts created by humans. Miss classification of the actual terrorism web content as non-terrorism or vice versa reduces the usefulness of intelligent techniques to support the efforts against potential threats, and limits the opportunities for the effective use of intelligence and security informatics in the early detection of terrorist activities. In this paper, we propose a hybridized method based on the basic term-weighting techniques for accurate terrorism activities detection in textual contexts. The proposed method combines the feature sets generated by different individual term-weighting techniques such as Term Frequency (TF), Document Frequency (DF), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Glasgow, and Entropy into one feature set for effective classification. Moreover, two combination functions are proposed to reduce the dimensionality of combined feature set. The method is tested on a selected dataset from the Dark Web Portal Forum (DWPF) and benchmarked using Support Vector Machine (SVM), and other famous text classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifiers. Experimental results show that the hybridized method efficiently identifies the terrorist activities content and outperforms the individual methods. Moreover, the results further revealed that the classification performance achieved by hybridizing few feature sets is relatively competitive in the number of features used for classification with higher hybridization levels. Moreover, the experiments of hybridizing functions show that the dimensionality of the feature sets is significantly reduced by applying the symmetric difference function for feature sets combination.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2625027729", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202683808"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195959173"}

As an answer to this, we propose the use of Reservoir Computing, a recently developed technique for efficient training of recurrent neural networks, for monthly time series prediction.

This work demonstrates the utility and validity of using Transfer Learning to apply image insights gained from careful and exhaustive training on photographic images to an unrelated data domain and achieve valuable results. This strategy is expected to assist scientists in reducing time and effort in data discovery and reducing time to science.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8898840", "venue": "IGARSS 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "journal": "IGARSS 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2984504020", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["125694917", "206592191", "7200347", "126712272", "14124313", "5808102", "6628106"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208037722"}

The aim of the current work is to explore the feasibility of using ultrasound image features derived from radiological experience to distinguish between common skin lesions. 5\u201318 MHz B-mode ultrasound images were acquired of incoming patients. Images containing lesions 1\u20132 mm thick were selected (N=248), with histology used to diagnose suspicious lesions. 73 melanomas, 130 BCC, and 45 nevi were studied. Following semi-automatic segmentation, a number of relevant features expressing the geometry of the lesion boundary and boundary layer, as well as the image characteristics of the lesion, lesion boundary layer, and post-lesion region were considered. With the exception of lesion echogenicity, all features had an area under the curve (AUC) value of above 0.70.

Although genetic association studies account for a substantial proportion of the abstracts in PubMed, identifying them with standard queries is not always accurate or efficient. Further automating the literature-screening process can reduce the burden of a labor-intensive and time-consuming traditional literature search. The Support Vector Machine (SVM), a well-established machine learning technique, has been successful in classifying text, including biomedical literature. The GAPscreener, a free SVM-based software tool, can be used to assist in screening PubMed abstracts for human genetic association studies.ResultsThe data source for this research was the HuGE Navigator, formerly known as the HuGE Pub Lit database. Weighted SVM feature selection based on a keyword list obtained by the two-way z score method demonstrated the best screening performance, achieving 97.5% recall, 98.3% specificity and 31.9% precision in performance testing. Compared with the traditional screening process based on a complex PubMed query, the SVM tool reduced by about 90% the number of abstracts requiring individual review by the database curator. The tool also ascertained 47 articles that were missed by the traditional literature screening process during the 4-week test period. We examined the literature on genetic associations with preterm birth as an example. Compared with the traditional, manual process, the GAPscreener both reduced effort and improved accuracy.ConclusionGAPscreener is the first free SVM-based application available for screening the human genetic association literature in PubMed with high recall and specificity.

In this paper, we present a joint metric learning (JML) model on Riemannian Manifold of Gaussian distributions. The distance between two Gaussians is defined as the sum of the Mahalanobis distance between the mean vectors and the log-Euclidean distance (LED) between the covariance matrices.

We propose IP-GAN, a framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks to disentangle the identity and pose of faces, such that we can generate face images of a specific person with a variety of poses, or images of different identities with a particular pose. To rotate a face, our framework requires one input image of that person to produce an identity vector, and any other input face image to extract a pose embedding vector. Then we recombine the identity vector and the pose vector to synthesize a new face of the person with the extracted pose. Two learning pathways are introduced, the generation and the transformation, where the generation path focuses on learning complete representation in the latent embedding space. While the transformation path focuses on synthesis of new face images with target poses. They collaborate and compete in a parameter-sharing manner, and in an unsupervised settings.

Our dataset consists of call detail records of a major wireless carrier sampled from four demographically diverse regions, from which we built a directed social graph, with over 200,000 vertices and 400,000 edges. Using account and subscription plan information, we labeled each edge in the graph as one of the following four relationships: family, co-worker, customer and service. Our analysis of the dataset shows that these four relationship types exhibit distinct communication behavior patterns and generate characteristic topological features on the social network surrounding the pairs. For instance, subscriber pairs with a family relationship generate high average number of calls, have low call duration, call more frequently and share more mutual contacts than pairs with a service or co-worker relationship. Using a set of features that abstract these characteristics and the Random Forest supervised machine learning classifier, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the relationship type between a subscriber pair with an accuracy of 87%.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SocialCom-PASSAT.2012.79", "venue": "2012 International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2012 International Confernece on Social Computing", "journal": "2012 International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2012 International Confernece on Social Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2042830166", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11185950", "1133242", "9791197", "14167442", "207557742", "16340411", "89141", "14196694", "13861754", "16050699"], "inbound_citations": ["189824734", "1521241", "1446262"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15104255"}

The importance of computer simulation in understanding cellular processes is now widely accepted, and a variety of simulation algorithms useful for studying certain subsystems have been designed. In this article, a Sparse Compact Incremental Learning Machine (SCILM) is proposed for cancer classification problem on microarray gene expression data which take advantage of correntropy cost that makes it robust against diverse noises and outliers. Moreover, since SCILM uses l1-norm of the weights, it has sparseness which can be applied for gene selection purposes as well. Finally, due to compact structure, the proposed method is capable of performing classification task in most of the cases with only one neuron in its hidden layer. The experimental analysis are performed on 26 well known microarray datasets regarding diverse kinds of cancers and the results stated that the proposed method not only achieved significantly high accuracy according to t-test in most of the datasets but also because of its sparseness, final connectivity weights determined the value and effectively of each gene regarding the corresponding cancer.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/028720", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2224957915", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["13117866", "3072378", "46215280", "9451896", "13866112", "3688244", "14019418", "2914506", "10039376", "116858", "10602102", "7534766", "7694246", "16000876", "30443043", "308370", "6736504", "52059378", "1300054", "14791297", "15927677", "10715511", "17432816", "3540990", "7754967", "17622019", "16272269", "24502082", "2327483", "16740703", "25325", "9061359", "58145487", "4382833", "2698102", "961425"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195906112"}

The Neuro-fuzzy model was developed in JAVA using four plausible parameters deemed critical in transporting contaminants in and through the soil profile. These parameters include soil hydrologic group, depth of the soil profile, soil structure (pedality points) of the soil A horizon and landuse. The model was validated using nitrate-N concentration data. The majority of the highly vulnerable areas predicted by the model coincided with agricultural landuse, moderately deep to deep soils, soil hydrologic group C (moderately low Ksat) and high pedality points (high water transmitting properties of the soil structure).

Charles Street Baltimore, MD 21218-2685 USA An Integrated Cognitive Architecture identified as a challenges for connectionism by Fodor Pylyshyn (1988) (the objections of Fodor McLaughlin, 1990 and Fodor, 1997 notwithstanding). Optimization. Because the symbolic level is realized in a connectionist substrate, cognitive functions at the symbolic level inherit subsymbolic properties. Crucially, the connectionist level is governed by processing princi- ples that entail optimization behavior: given an input activation pattern, the network computes the output pattern that maximizes Harmony with respect to that input and the connection strengths (Geman Geman, 1984; Golden, 1986; Hinton Sejnowski, 1983; Hopfield, 1982; Smolensky, 1983; et seq.). Harmony measures the well-formedness of network states. Connections realize soft constraints and the Harmony-maximizing state optimally satisfies these constraints. In general, the relevant constraints are highly conflicting; their relative strengths determine how conflicts are resolved. The optimization character of this substrate percolates up to the symbolic level. The functions computed by grammars produce outputs that maximize Harmony given the input and the soft constraints of the system: these constraints, together with their relative strengths, constitute a Harmonic Grammar (Legendre, Miyata, Smolensky, 1990ab et seq.) Strict domination hierarchies and universality. Two central empirical discoveries about the actual Harmo- nic Grammars found in human languages form the foundation of Optimality Theory (Prince Smolensky, 1991). First, the strength of each constraint is suffi- ciently greater than that of all weaker constraints that weaker constraints can never gang up and overpower the preference of a stronger constraint. Thus, in actual grammars, constraints form a strict domination hierarchy, each constraint having absolute priority over all lower-ranked constraints combined. Secondly, the grammars of actual languages contain the same constraints; grammars differ only in how the constraints are ranked, that is, only in how conflicts among the constraints are resolved. This yields OTs formal theory of cross-linguistic variation: a grammatical domain is governed by a set of universal constraints, identical in all languages; the typology of possible grammatical systems in this domain is that given by all possible strict domination hierarchies of the universal constraints. This is factorial typology, the first general, formal theory of typology in linguistics. The adversarial relationship characteristic of the past two decades (e.g., the ongoing debate initiated by Rumelhart McClelland, 1986; Pinker Prince, 1988) is here replaced by a collaboration between symbolic generative linguistics and connectionist theories of mental representations and processes. These theories converge in a symbolic grammatical framework, Op- timality Theory (OT, Prince Smolensky 1993/2004, 1997), which is realized in a connectionist substrate. Relative to alternative symbolic theories, OT provides stronger explanations of many empirical generalizations and linguistic universals. OT also provides a platform for explaining linguistic performance. The higher level structure of OT grammars offers the networks that realize them improved empirical adequacy relative to the large body of data addressed by linguistic theory, and the connectionist processing in these networks promises models of linguistic processing that are more empirically adequate relative to the data of psycholinguistics. Pursuing the view proposed in Smolensky (1988) of the proper role in cognitive science of parallel distributed processing (McClelland, Rumelhart, the PDP Group 1986, Rumelhart, McClelland, the PDP Group 1986), the Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic Cognitive Ar- chitecture (ICS; Smolensky Legendre, 2005) crucially employs two levels of description in its account of computation in the mind/ brain. At the lower level, mental representations are patterns of activity over simple processing units, and mental processes are massively parallel processes of spreading activation. For certain cognitive domains including grammatical phenomena, the connectionist level is organized in such a way as to realize a higher-level cognitive system. This system contains symbolic representations and symbolic functions. But in general the system contains no sym- bolic algorithms that compute these functions; detailed, psychologically real accounts of mental processing, even in grammatical domains, require connectionist descrip- tion at the lower level. Thus the division of explanatory labor is, to first approximation, that representations and functions are accounted for at the higher level, symbolically, and processing and learning is accounted for at the lower level, subsymbolically. The principles defining the ICS architecture at the connectionist level explain the general properties of cognition such as systematicity and unbounded productivity that were", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2590108386", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126331104"}

Dana mining is a term that refers to discovernig information and knowledge from existing data ; one important condition is the existence of uniform data sets. The aim of our study was to explore the possibilities of data minig methods in creating a diagnostic algorithm for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Materials and Methods. Using Random Forest classifier and Data minig server intelligent data analysis intelligent data analysis methods we have built several models for predicting a PTSD diagnosis, based on data from 102 inpatients (51 with diagnosis of PTSD and 51 with psychiatric diagnosis other than PTSD). The models were based on data from the structured psychiatric interview, psychiatric scales (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Positive and Nagative Syndrom Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD)) and combined data from these sources. Results. The model based exclusively on the structured psychiatric interview distunguished comorbid diagnoses (neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders) from PTSD. Using Data minig server, a diagnostic algorithm was constructed with moderate sensitivity and specificity. In the second model along the same group of diagnoses, the elements of the CAPS score and PANSS additional criteria score were found to be importaint. A diagnostic algorithm was made, using Data mining server, with a higher sensitivity and specificity than the previous model. In the third model, the attributes from psychiatric scales were found to be most important., together with comorbid diagnoses of neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders. Conclusion. Some importaint attributes from each of the models were recognized that could be used in a diagnosic algorithm and some preliminary models for diagnosing PTSD have been built.

We present the first major attempt to assimilate all of these elements within a unified, implemented computational framework. Our model combines a hub-and-spoke architecture with a buffer that allows its state to be influenced by prior context. This hybrid structure integrates the view, from cognitive neuroscience, that concepts are grounded in sensory-motor representation with the view, from computational linguistics, that knowledge is shaped by patterns of lexical co-occurrence. The model successfully codes knowledge for abstract and concrete words, associative and taxonomic relationships, and the multiple meanings of homonyms, within a single representational space. Knowledge of abstract words is acquired through (a) their patterns of co-occurrence with other words and (b) acquired embodiment, whereby they become indirectly associated with the perceptual features of co-occurring concrete words. The model accounts for executive influences on semantics by including a controlled retrieval mechanism that provides top-down input to amplify weak semantic relationships. The representational and control elements of the model can be damaged independently, and the consequences of such damage closely replicate effects seen in neuropsychological patients with loss of semantic representation versus control processes.

To do so, Household Travel Survey (HTS) can be used to learn the relation between trips and socioeconomic attributes of passengers. This paper compares the performance of three well-known classifiers of Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine for estimating age and income of passengers in the public transit network using the HTS. The explanatory variables are considered as the start time of the trip, activity duration (time period between two consecutive trips), land use around the origin, and land use around the destination of trips. The target variables are age and income of passengers. HTS data, which include both explanatory and target variables, are used to train and validate the classifiers. Three measures including Accuracy, F-score, and Informedness are used to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. Also, the three classifiers are compared to a random classifier.

To date machine learning methods have been applied in Genome-Wide Association Studies for identification of candidate genes, epistasis detection, gene network pathway analyses and genomic prediction of phenotypic values. However, the utility of two machine learning methods, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting Method (XgBoost), in identifying a subset of SNP makers for genomic prediction of breeding values has never been explored before. In this study, using 38,082 SNP markers and body weight phenotypes from 2,093 Brahman cattle (1,097 bulls as a discovery population and 996 cows as a validation population), we examined the efficiency of three machine learning methods, namely Random Forests (RF), GBM and XgBoost, in a) the identification of top 400, 1,000 and 3,000 ranked SNPs; b) using the subsets of SNPs to construct genomic relationship matrices (GRMs) for the estimation of genomic breeding values (GEBVs). For comparison purposes, we also calculated the GEBVs from 1) 400, 1,000 and 3,000 SNPs that were randomly selected and evenly spaced across the genome, and 2) from all the SNPs. We found that RF and especially GBM are efficient methods in identifying a subset of SNPs with direct links to candidate genes affecting the growth trait. In comparison to the estimate of prediction accuracy of GEBVs from using all SNPs (0.43), the 3,000 top SNPs identified by RF (0.42) and GBM (0.46) had similar values to those of the whole SNP panel.

The principle is that nearby nodes should have similar spectrum sensing results. However, the only direct information obtained from spectrum sensing is the similarities of spectrum among nodes.

The class of wood is indicated the quality of the wood itself. So, wood industries must classify carefully for increase the productivity. Wood industries usually classify the wood with manual method such as classifying with eyesight of human however it just produces about 55% of correct classification rate.

Deep Convolutional Neural Network (D-CNN) is developed to improve the accuracy and performance from many deep layers of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and is designed for classify image with small dataset. This paper investigates the usage of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (D-CNN) with transfer learning method and bottleneck features for wood classification with a small dataset.

We extend DDO with: (1) a hybrid categorical-continuous distribution model to parametrize high-level policies that can invoke discrete options as well continuous control actions, and (2) a cross-validation method that relaxes DDO's requirement that users specify the number of options to be discovered.

In the 3-link arm simulation, results suggest that DDCO can take 3x fewer demonstrations to achieve the same reward compared to a baseline imitation learning approach. In the needle insertion task, DDCO was successful 8/10 times compared to the next most accurate imitation learning baseline 6/10.

CryoGAN sidesteps this problem by using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the 3D structure whose simulated projections most closely match the real data in a distributional sense. The architecture of CryoGAN resembles that of standard GAN, with the twist that the generator network is replaced by a cryo-EM physics simulator. CryoGAN is an unsupervised algorithm that only demands picked particle images and CTF estimation as inputs; no initial volume estimate or prior training are needed. Moreover, it requires minimal user interaction and can provide reconstructions in a matter of hours on a high-end GPU.

In this paper, we will introduce the theoretical basis of support vector machine, summarize the research status and analyze the research direction and development prospects of kernel function.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-94-007-7262-5_93", "venue": "EMC/HumanCom", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "614350723", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207165665", "28637672", "7138354", "124905753", "17466014", "123940139", "13617673", "30806637", "36931061", "1204938", "123984593", "8952183", "14607075", "123248989", "124872132", "2168002", "62585438", "123773334"], "inbound_citations": ["20800524", "4624043", "51938048", "207992953", "209496225"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33844744"}

Although within-utterance information about emotion changes recently has received some attention, there remain open questions unresolved, such as how to approach delta emotion ground truth, how to predict the extent of emotion change from speech, and how well change can be predicted relative to absolute emotion ratings. In this article, we investigate speech-based automatic systems for continuous prediction of the extent of emotion changes in arousal/valence. We propose the use of regression (smoothed) deltas as ground truth for emotion change, which yielded considerably higher inter-rater reliability than first-order deltas, a commonly used approach in previous research, and represent a more appropriate approach to derive annotations for emotion change research, findings which are applicable beyond speech-based systems. In addition, the first system design for continuous emotion change prediction from speech is explored. Experimental results under the Output-Associative Relevance Vector Machine framework interestingly show that changes in emotion ratings may be better predicted than absolute emotion ratings on the RECOLA database, achieving 0.74 vs 0.71 for arousal and 0.41 vs 0.37 for valence in concordance correlation coefficients. However, further work is needed to achieve effective emotion change prediction performances on the SEMAINE database, due to the large number of non-change frames in the absolute emotion ratings.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3389/fict.2018.00011", "venue": "Front.

For example, by using a suitable energy distribution controller, the fuel cell system can be maintained in a high efficiency region and thus saving hydrogen consumption. In this paper, an energy management strategy for online driving cycles is proposed based on a combination of the parameters from three offline optimized fuzzy logic controllers using data fusion approach. The fuzzy logic controllers are respectively optimized for three typical driving scenarios: highway, suburban and city in offline. To classify patterns of online driving cycles, a Probabilistic Support Vector Machine (PSVM) is used to provide probabilistic classification results. Based on the classification results of the online driving cycle, the parameters of each offline optimized fuzzy logic controllers are then fused using Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory, in order to calculate the final parameters for the online fuzzy logic controller. Three experimental validations using Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) platform with different-sized FCHEVs have been performed.

The SVR is able to introduce two important types of a priori information into the estimation. First, the kernel and the parameter C can jointly assure an implicit quality requirement on the estimated curve. It is presented a proposition that reduces the search space for the optimal value of this parameter. Second, Vapnik\u2019s e-insensitive cost function provides a natural channel to bring into the estimation information about liquidity and the price formation process of the assets from which the curve is extracted. It is captured by a variable observed during assets\u2019 transactions: bid-ask spreads (BAS). This cost function also allows for financial analysis of the assets selected as support vectors. The e-insensitive function was modified in order to deal with different values for the parameter e in the same estimation, as imposed by the curve estimation problem. It is proved that this change keeps all the SVR properties. This paper models the dollar-Libor interest rate swap curves. It is a small-sample estimation: twelve contracts are available daily, from 1997 to 2001. The proper C-value ranges for some types of kernels were identified. The spline-with-an-infinitenumber-of-nodes kernel provided the best out-of-sample specification for the SVR. On average, it required approximately 5 contracts to describe the curves under the desired accuracy fixed by the BAS. However, the support vectors cannot be used as sufficient statistics to analyze curve movements through time. Comparing this SVR with other three different approximation methods, it achieved the best control of the trade-off bias-variance for the interpolation problem.

Real-time knowledge of indicated torque is typically important for engine diagnostics, and recently, an engine idle speed controller capable of reducing the effects of cyclic combustion variability through the use of indicated torque information was proposed. While measurements of in-cylinder pressure can be used to determine indicated torque, these sensors are generally deemed prohibitively expensive for implementation in a production engine. Estimation methods, particularly traditional model based estimation, are typically computationally expensive and require independent data throughout the cylinder expansion stroke. Overlap of the expansion strokes in a six-cylinder engine complicates the problem and limits the ability of traditional model based approaches in fully reconstructing the torque production process. Intelligent estimation techniques can identify the key characteristics of the instantaneous engine speed as a function of crank angle for the combustion stroke, thereby allowing an optimal subset of the available information to be utilised. A support vector machine approach is used in this paper due to the inherent optimisation of the training procedure, resulting in an optimised prediction matrix. Torque estimation is then obtained through simple mathematical evaluations, allowing fast reconstruction of indicated torque. A comparison between reconstruction performances at different operating points is presented as an evidence of the capabilities of the support vector machines. This paper demonstrates that indicated torque reconstruction with support vector machines in a sixcylinder engine is not only possible, but it can be done with sufficient accuracy for the purpose of advanced engine control applications. INTRODUCTION Combustion in an engine cylinder, even at a fixed operating point, is subject to cycle-by-cycle variations, due to factors such as internal exhaust gas recirculation, uneven air-fuel mixture distribution, and variations in mixture density. During low-load idle conditions, air density and fuel mass fed into the cylinder are at their lowest, thereby increasing the likelihood of uneven distribution of the mixture throughout the cylinder. Consequently, this causes variability in combustion process, and subsequently, indicated torque. As variations in combustion or torque production directly influence engine speed, fluctuations of the crankshaft speed are also increased. These speed fluctuations may lead to unnecessary control action at idle [1], or requirements such as higher idle set points to counteract engine stall, and reduce vehicle noise vibration and harshness quality (NVH). Obviously, increasing idle set points also increases emissions and fuel consumption, and should be avoided. Knowledge of indicated torque generated during the combustion process is desirable for several key applications, such as idle speed control and engine diagnostics. Recently, an engine idle speed controller capable of reducing the effects of cyclic combustion variability was proposed [1]. This relies on information about indicated torque in order to predict and compensate for cyclic variations. While there exist incylinder pressure sensors, and there is a direct correlation between in-cylinder pressure and indicated torque, these sensors are generally deemed too expensive and impractical for implementation in a production line engine. Torque sensors, while available, generally have complicated construction, and their realworld production line performance and reliability are yet to be established. Consequently, there is considerable research into methods that will allow the indicated torque to be inferred from available measurements.

Our aim is evaluating feature selection techniques with respect to the performance of vision-based inspection and classification of pot plant seedlings. A large feature set was initially obtained from seedlings images and several subsets were generated with various features selection techniques.

In this paper, a novel measurement data classification algorithm based on support vector machine (SVM) is provided.

While some investigators are focused on identifying informative genes and proteins that play a role in specific diseases, other researchers have attempted instead to use patients based on their expression profiles to prognosticate disease status. A major limitation in the ability to accurately classify these high-dimensional data sets stems from the \"curse of dimensionality,\" occurring in situations where the number of genes or peptides significantly exceeds the total number of patient samples. Previous attempts at dealing with this issue have mostly centered on the use of a dimensionality reduction (DR) scheme, principal component analysis (PCA), to obtain a low-dimensional projection of the high-dimensional data. However, linear PCA and other linear DR methods, which rely on euclidean distances to estimate object similarity, do not account for the inherent underlying nonlinear structure associated with most biomedical data. While some researchers have begun to explore nonlinear DR methods for computer vision problems such as face detection and recognition, to the best of our knowledge, few such attempts have been made for classification and visualization of high-dimensional biomedical data. The motivation behind this work is to identify the appropriate DR methods for analysis of high-dimensional gene and protein expression studies. Toward this end, we empirically and rigorously compare three nonlinear (Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding, and Laplacian Eigenmaps) and three linear DR schemes (PCA, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Multidimensional Scaling) with the intent of determining a reduced subspace representation in which the individual object classes are more easily discriminable. Owing to the inherent nonlinear structure of gene and protein expression studies, our claim is that the nonlinear DR methods provide a more truthful low-dimensional representation of the data compared to the linear DR schemes. Evaluation of the DR schemes was done by 1) assessing the discriminability of two supervised classifiers (Support Vector Machine and C4.5 Decision Trees) in the different low- dimensional data embeddings and 2) five cluster validity measures to evaluate the size, distance, and tightness of object aggregates in the low-dimensional space. For each of the seven evaluation measures considered, statistically significant improvement in the quality of the embeddings across 10 cancer data sets via the use of three nonlinear DR schemes over three linear DR techniques was observed. Similar trends were observed when linear and nonlinear DR was applied to the high-dimensional data following feature pruning to isolate the most informative features. Qualitative evaluation of the low-dimensional data embedding obtained via the six DR methods further suggests that the nonlinear schemes are better able to identify potential novel classes (e.g., cancer subtypes) within the data.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2562675", "pubmed_id": "18670041", "doi": "10.1109/TCBB.2008.36", "venue": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics", "journal": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2123887997", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2914506", "8166615", "13744083", "20183727", "205693778", "14974643", "4382833", "12929471", "2698102", "308370", "14505333", "52059378", "7983577", "9061359", "10570640", "121462544", "58452344", "17338385", "23265028", "4419580", "174047", "10253140", "2382325", "6880114", "22622233", "2759526", "8406472", "5359201", "2296213", "25032025", "25023228", "20768718", "144828484", "14848918", "1536455", "14879317", "13599438", "8108053", "1049985", "8590246", "14176193", "56776745", "15037717", "17030953", "7159780", "52874011", "937841", "613410", "13328418", "18441828"], "inbound_citations": ["12343315", "11416445", "85809744", "206522771", "21721726", "1728889", "34548730", "14085142", "18114009", "15986089", "16092005", "2055306", "12262651", "56336494", "31604666", "815138", "8609252", "53777401", "15326183", "206265929", "16918035", "215418060", "49340333", "1464707", "10529551", "10023482", "21732148", "17934424", "9400801", "862738", "54942982", "46953029", "16435805", "18864303", "283247", "18881973", "7036296", "45923904", "4233232", "197674081", "12697402", "16676425", "211084064", "58026647", "18657306", "16794391", "16793925", "2794722", "10375779", "36928348", "13019090", "215603444", "85792017", "16381822"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6227766"}

This study uses fine-grained human perceptual similarity ground-truth to provide a comprehensive evaluation of 51 texture feature sets. We conduct two types of evaluation and both show that these features do not estimate similarity well when compared against human agreement rates, but that performances are improved when the features are combined using a Random Forest. Using a simple two-stage statistical model we show that few of the features capture long-range aperiodic relationships. We perform two psychophysical experiments which indicate that long-range interactions do provide humans with important cues for estimating texture similarity. This motivates an extension of the study to include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as they enable arbitrary features of large spatial extent to be learnt.

Classifying an individual in a class with higher (respectively lower) rank than its actual rank is called an upgrading (respectively downgrading) error. Since upgrading and downgrading errors may not have the same importance, they should be considered as two different criteria to be taken into account when measuring the quality of a classifier. In Support Vector Machines, margin maximization is used as an effective and computationally tractable surrogate of the minimization of misclassification errors. As an extension, we consider in this paper the maximization of upgrading and downgrading margins as a surrogate of the minimization of upgrading and downgrading errors, and we address the biobjective problem of finding a classifier maximizing simultaneously the two margins. The whole set of Pareto-optimal solutions of such biobjective problem is described as translations of the optimal solutions of a scalar optimization problem. For the most popular case in which the Euclidean norm is considered, the scalar problem has a unique solution, yielding that all the Pareto-optimal solutions of the biobjective problem are translations of each other. Hence, the Pareto-optimal solutions can easily be provided to the analyst, who, after inspection of the misclassification errors caused, should choose in a later stage the most convenient classifier. The consequence of this analysis is that it provides a theoretical foundation for a popular strategy among practitioners, based on the so-called ROC curve, which is shown here to equal the set of Pareto-optimal solutions of maximizing simultaneously the downgrading and upgrading margins.

Inspecting the status of insulators from aerial images has been challenging due to the complex background and rapid view changing under different illumination conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to inspect the insulators with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). A CNN model with multi-patch feature extraction method is applied to represent the status of insulators and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained based on these features. A thorough evaluation is conducted on our insulator status dataset of six classes from real inspection videos.

Features were selected among training data and were reduced afterward via scalar feature selection using three criteria including T test, entropy, and Bhattacharyya distance. Selected features were classified by the one-against-one support vector machine (SVM) multi-class classifier. The parameters of SVM were optimized based on training and validation sets.

One of the main issues in food security in Developing and Sanctioned Countries (DSCs) is establishment of food industries and related distributions in appropriate places. In this respect, geospatial technology offers the most up-to-date Land Cover (LC) information to improve site selection for assisting food security in the study area. Currently food security issues are not comprehensively addressed, especially in DSCs. In this research, ASTER L1B and LANDSAT satellite data were used to derive various LC biophysical parameters including build-up area, water body, forest, citrus, and rice fields in Qaemshahr city, Iran using different satellite-derived indices. A Product Level Fusion (PLF) approach was implemented to merge the outputs of the indices to prepare an improved LC map. The suitability of the proposed approach for LC mapping was evaluated in comparison with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classification techniques. For implementing site selection, the outcomes of satellite-derived indices, as well as the city, village, road, railway, river, aqueduct, fault, casting, abattoir, cemetery, waste accumulation, wastewater treatment, educational centre, medical centre, military centre, asphalt factory, cement factory, and slope layers were obtained using Global Positioning System (GPS), on-screen digitizing, and image processing were used as input data. The Fuzzy Overlay and Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) methods were adopted to perform site selection process. The outcomes were then classified and analyzed based on the accessibility to main roads, cities and raw food materials. Finally, the existing industrial zones in the study area were evaluated for establishing food industries based on site selection results of this study. The results indicated higher performance of PLF method to provide up-to-date LC information with an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient values of 95.95% and 0.95, respectively.

SLM is compared with the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm and with a fixed-topology neuroevolution approach. Experiments are performed on a total of 9 real-world regression and classification datasets. The results show that the best SLM variants generally outperform the other neuroevolution approaches in terms of generalization achieved, while also being more efficient in learning the training data. The best SLM variants also outperform the common NN backpropagation-based approach under different topologies.

Thus, how to avoid negative transfer and then ensure a \"safe transfer\" of knowledge is crucial in transfer learning. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Transfer learning algorithm based on Gaussian Processes (AT-GP), which can be used to adapt the transfer learning schemes by automatically estimating the similarity between a source and a target task. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a new semi-parametric transfer kernel for transfer learning from a Bayesian perspective, and propose to learn the model with respect to the target task, rather than all tasks as in multi-task learning.

Inspired by exposure blending with luminosity masks usually applied by professional photographers, in this paper, we develop a novel algorithm for learning local exposures with deep reinforcement learning and adversarial learning. To be specific, we segment an image into sub-images that can reflect variations of dynamic range exposures according to raw low-level features. Based on these sub-images, a local exposure for each sub-image is automatically learned by virtue of policy network sequentially while the reward of learning is globally designed for striking a balance of overall exposures. The aesthetic evaluation function is approximated by discriminator in generative adversarial networks. The reinforcement learning and the adversarial learning are trained collaboratively by asynchronous deterministic policy gradient and generative loss approximation.

With the widespread application in end-use fields, the 3D printing (3DP) has already attracted great ecological attentions in energy efficiency, material saving and emissions reduction for better sustainability. Firstly, the energy and material consumption model of 3DP is built by decomposing 3DP into three sub-systems: thermal, mechanical, and auxiliary. The potential impacts on the ecological environment can be further evaluated by correlated degree using covariance analysis. The customized parameters of 3DP such as adaptive layer thickness, infill patterns, infill trajectories are sequentially and deeply investigated to form customization schemes for higher success rate by parameter combination. Considering the implicit non-linear relationships between energy efficiency and the customized parameters, adaptive Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is built to improve calculation accuracy and prevent premature convergence inspired by Game Theory. To determine the best customization scheme according to the requirements, the mathematical model of AMC is built using multi-objective optimization (MOO). The physical experiment of energy efficiency is implemented by testing energy consumption, temperature, emissions and scanning electron micrograph (SEM). The energy efficiency is improved by maximum ratio of 11.51% and the maximum total carbon emission is reduced by 49.91% for ecological 3DP.

As brain is a chaos dynamical system, many complexity based methods have been used to track the dynamical changes of absence seizure EEG. However, most of these methods treat multichannel EEG recordings as a set of individual time series, which will inevitably lead to the loss of crucial cross-channel correlation in the epileptic network. Recently, a spatial-temporal permutation entropy method called multivariate multiscale permutation entropy (MMPE) was proposed to measure the complexity of multichannel data. In this study, MMPE was applied to multichannel EEG for characterizing dynamics of absence seizure. It was found that the pre-ictal EEG exhibited a significant lower MMPE value than interictal EEG, and a significant higher MMPE value than the ictal EEG, indicating that the complexity of multichannel EEG decreased in the transition of brain activities. This finding confirmed the existence of a pre-seizure state in absence epilepsy. The identification ability of MMPE was tested against its original univariate complexity measures: permutation entropy (PE) and multiscale permutation entropy (MSPE), and another multivariate multiscale entropy: multivariate multiscale sample entropy (MMSE). After evaluating the performance by four classifiers (Decision Tree, K -Nearest Neighbor, Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine), MMPE can achieve accuracy of 87.2% at least, which is about 15%, 12%, and 10% higher than that of PE, MSPE and MMSE. Hence, this work supports the view that EEG has a detectable change prior to an absence seizure, and MMPE could be considered as a candidate precursor of the impending absence seizures.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2017.09.007", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2752616047", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["51604333", "210131336", "53015356", "4711178"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30301512"}

Using signal processing techniques, after a first step of signal conditioning, abrupt frequency changes in two EEG derivations and amplitude events in one submental electromyogram are identified.

Besides, obtaining and taking advantage of association information between miRNAs and diseases play an increasingly important role in improving the treatment level for complex diseases. However, due to the high cost of traditional experimental methods, many researchers have proposed different computational methods to predict potential associations between miRNAs and diseases. In this work, we developed a computational model of Random Forest for miRNA-disease association (RFMDA) prediction based on machine learning. The training sample set for RFMDA was constructed according to the human microRNA disease database (HMDD) version (v.)2.0, and the feature vectors to represent miRNA-disease samples were defined by integrating miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity. The Random Forest algorithm was first employed to infer miRNA-disease associations. In addition, a filter-based method was implemented to select robust features from the miRNA-disease feature set, which could efficiently distinguish related miRNA-disease pairs from unrelated miRNA-disease pairs.

In previous work, such \"distributional clustering\" of features has been found to achieve improvements over feature selection in terms of classification accuracy, especially at lower number of features [2, 28]. However the existing clustering techniques are agglomerative in nature and result in (i) sub-optimal word clusters and (ii) high computational cost. In order to explicitly capture the optimality of word clusters in an information theoretic framework, we first derive a global criterion for feature clustering. We then present a fast, divisive algorithm that monotonically decreases this objective function value, thus converging to a local minimum. We show that our algorithm minimizes the \"within-cluster Jensen-Shannon divergence\" while simultaneously maximizing the \"between-cluster Jensen-Shannon divergence\". In comparison to the previously proposed agglomerative strategies our divisive algorithm achieves higher classification accuracy especially at lower number of features. We further show that feature clustering is an effective technique for building smaller class models in hierarchical classification.

However, efficient processing and interpretation of large volumes of data remain challenging, especially for two-dimensional or light materials because the diffraction signal recorded on the pixelated arrays is weak. Here we employ data-driven manifold leaning approaches for straightforward visualization and exploration analysis of 4D-STEM datasets, distilling real-space neighboring effects on atomically resolved deflection patterns from single-layer graphene, with single dopant atoms, as recorded on a pixelated detector. These extracted patterns relate to both individual atom sites and sublattice structures, effectively discriminating single dopant anomalies via multi-mode views. We believe manifold learning analysis will accelerate physics discoveries coupled between data-rich imaging mechanisms and materials such as ferroelectric, topological spin, and van der Waals heterostructures. Automatic algorithms can extract information on the atomic details of materials hidden in high-resolution microscopy images. An international team led by Sergei V. Kalinin at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA, use a computer protocol for data analysis, called manifold learning, to find recurrent features in a large set of images collected by illuminating an ultrathin layer of graphene with a beam of electrons. Then, the computer automatically linked such features to information related to the relative position of the atoms. This technique may be used not only to identify local changes in the material structure that may be responsible for unusual optoelectronic or magnetic properties, but also to understand how the experimental conditions used to generate these images can be further improved to obtain the most from high-resolution microscopy techniques.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1811.00080", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1038/s41524-018-0139-y", "venue": "npj Computational Materials volume 5, Article number: 5 (2019)", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2899341660", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science", "Engineering", "Physics", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["4464276", "24025555", "17004112", "125609904", "20649181", "121989150", "16557666", "13580935", "15668105", "49679029", "38588023", "22736968", "46205817", "16080234", "22964012", "54088193", "2747657", "3641284", "15167460", "9477123", "207186093", "16447573", "49334901", "2196967", "2887636", "139965064", "43900048", "206748905", "21688817", "4591112", "9197702", "119088212", "126392715"], "inbound_citations": ["199405276", "155107759"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53607081"}

Thus, MCR gives a more comprehensive description of importance by accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of different parametric forms, may fit the data well. In the process of deriving MCR, we show several informative results for permutation-based VI estimates, similar to the VI measures used in Random Forests. Specifically, we derive connections between permutation importance estimates for a single prediction model, U-statistics, conditional causal effects, and linear model coefficients. We then give probabilistic bounds for MCR, using a novel, generalizable technique.

Recent results have shown that dynamic caching can significantly offload different parts of the network including the Radio access networks (RANs) and core network (CN), by smartly prefetching and storing contents closer to the end-users. In parallel to that, the era of pushing contents through the network on a best-effort basis ignoring who end-users are and what they are doing with their devices has dawned, calling for a truly context-aware and proactive networking paradigm [2]. As a result, edge caching has taken the recent 5G literature by storm over the last few years as evidenced in [2]\u2013[6]. In [6], the concept of femtocaching was proposed addressing the problem of capacity-limited backhaul links by embedding base stations with high-storage units. In [2], a novel edge-centric networking paradigm was proposed in which network nodes (i.e., base station (BS) and/or user terminals (UTs)) proactively cache judiciously selected contents at the network edge. Exploiting both spatial and social caching coupled with suitable device-to-device (D2D) communication was shown to efficiently offload the backhaul traffic and enhancing the overall network performance in terms of cache-hit-rates and users' satisfaction ratios. Therein, a proactive caching proce-dure is formulated as a supervised machine learning problem and collaborative filtering (CF) techniques are used to estimate the file popularity matrix exploiting users-files correlations. Notwithstanding this fact, the file popularity matrix remains typically large and sparse in practice, rendering CF techniques sub-optimal suffering from data sparseness and cold-start problem, which are major challenges in the machine learning community [7]. In this work, we build upon the work in [2] and propose a more efficient machine learning technique, using the frame-work of transfer learning (TL) [7]. Indeed, in many real-world applications, it is expensive or even impossible to collect and label training data to build suitable prediction models. With this in mind, TL is seen as a suitable framework which allows to exploit data from other rich information sources (referred to as source domain) to further improve the prediction task in the target domain. TL has been traditionally used in data mining This research has been supported by the ERC Starting Grant 305123 MORE (Advanced Mathematical Tools for Complex Network Engineering), the SHARING project under the Finland grant 128010 and the project BESTCOM. problems such as classification, regression and very recently in the context of CF [7]. 1) Transfer Learning: In a nutshell, TL can be classified into inductive, transductive and unsupervised transfer learning depending on the availability of the source and target domain labels. Research issues in transfer learning boil down to: 1) what to transfer, 2) how to transfer, and 3) when to transfer. While \"what to transfer\" studies which part of the knowledge can be transferred across domains or tasks, \"when to transfer\" deals with the issue of knowing when is best to transfer the knowledge to avoid negative transfer, notably when the source and target domains become unrelated. Finally, \"how to transfer\" deals with knowledge extraction which needs to be transferred. A comprehensive survey of transfer learning is found in [7]. 2) Contribution: The basic idea of the proposed learning approach is to alleviate the data sparsity problem encountered in most CF problems, by learning and transferring the rich contextual information (i.e., source domain), to better estimate the (large-scale) file popularity matrix in the target domain. We assume that the knowledge extracted from the source domain stems from the interaction of users accessing/sharing and recommending files within their social community via D2D (Web2.0-like). Instead of learning from scratch in the target domain, the nice feature of the TL approach lies in judiciously extracting collaborative social behavior information from the source domain to aid in the learning in the target domain, which will be explained in the sequel. To the best of our knowledge this is perhaps the first contribution of transfer learning in RANs. A.

{"paper_id": "205738936", "title": "Random Survival Forests", "authors": [{"first": "Jeremy M.G.", "middle": [], "last": "Taylor", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "In the article by Chen et al,1 the authors used Random Survival Forests (RSF) as part of their approach for analyzing the data. In this note, we will explain RSF in a nontechnical way; precise details of the RSF method are described in the article by Ishwaran et al.2 RSF are an adaptation of Random Forests (RF)3 designed to be used for survival data. Software to run RSF is described in the article by Ishwaran and Kogalur.4 RSF differs from RF in that the response data are a survival time, which may be censored. RF are a group of methods that are developed from data in which there is an outcome or response variable and also a potentially large number of predictors or explanatory factors. The dataset would typically include data from a large number of subjects. In the article by Chen et al, the explanatory factors are all the gene expression measurements, after some initial selection of genes, age, gender, and stage, and the response variable is survival time. The model is designed to be used for prediction purposes. Specifically for a new subject, who has all the explanatory factors measured, the model gives a prediction of the response. The RF method has a number of appealing features. One major feature is that it can easily handle datasets with many more variables than subjects. It does not delete or select any of the variables, it allows them all to influence the prediction if the training data suggest they should. Another attractive feature of RF is that they do not impose a restrictive structure on how the variables should be combined, for example, it is not a weighted sum of the gene expression values. If the relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable is complex with nonlinear patterns and interactions then RF are capable of incorporating this. RF is an ensemble tree method, i.e., the Forest consists of many trees. The final prediction is a combination of the predictions from each tree. It is well known that methods that combine predictions from separate methods can substantially improve prediction performance. It has also been shown that injecting some controlled variation or randomness into the construction of each of the separate trees can improve performance. Hence the name Random Forests. Each tree in the Forest is slightly different, and each tree by itself gives a prediction. The final prediction from the Forest is the average of the predictions from each tree. Each decision tree is a series of simple questions with yes/no answers, where examples of the questions could be \u201cIs gene-78 2.7?\u201d or \u201cIs gene-953 5.3?\u201d When an observation, consisting of a set of gene expression measurements, is \u201cdropped down the tree,\u201d the questions are asked sequentially about that observation, the answers to the questions determine the path through the tree until all questions have been asked for that path. All observations that follow the same path will be similar and will be given a predicted value for the response. How each tree is constructed is a complex procedure, but the general idea is to choose the questions (e.g., gene 78 and gene 953) and the cut-points (e.g., 2.7 and 5.3) so the group who answer \u201cYes\u201d has a very different outcome variable value from the group who answer \u201cNo.\u201d The RSF produces a prediction for each observation that is dropped down the tree, this prediction we refer to as the mortality risk index (MRI). A higher MRI means this person is at higher risk based on their gene expression values. The actual definition of the MRI is the expected number of deaths that would be seen if all observations in the sample had that particular set of gene expression values. The MRI is thus a single number that can be used to put people into categories of low, medium, or high, for example. Because the inner workings of a RF are not transparent, trying to understand which of the input variables are important in determining the predictions is more challenging. However, a measure of how important a variable is can be provided by a RF, and it is called the variable importance measure (VIMP). It measures how worse would the prediction be if that variable were not available. In the article by Chen et al, not surprisingly stage had the highest VIMP values and age was one of the highest. We also used the VIMP in the article by Chen et al to help in eliminating genes. Specifically, we added a set of irrelevant random variables as potential predictors. The VIMP for those random variables were very low as we expected. This helps us set a threshold for the VIMP, as we can select real predictors whose VIMP is greater than the VIMP of the random variables. Another feature that is provided by RSF is the prediction error. For other prediction models, this is called the C-index and is related to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The prediction error is the fraction of times that for a pair of subjects the person who was predicted to live longer actually died sooner, i.e., the prediction ranked these two people incorrectly. Thus, a small prediction error rate is good, and error rates of less than 25% would be Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Thus a major contribution of connectionism is that it provides an alternative model of knowledge and cognition that avoids many of the limitations of the traditional approach. But what idea serves for connectionism the same unifying role that the idea of a calculus served for the traditional theories? We claim it is the idea of a continuous symbol system. This paper presents a preliminary formulation of continuous symbol systems and indicates how they may aid the understanding and development of connectionist theories. It begins with a brief phenomenological analysis of the discrete and continuous; the aim of this analysis is to directly contrast the two kinds of symbols systems and identify their distinguishing characteristics.

We have developed the \u201cHypothesised Interactions Distribution\u201d (HID) analysis, to quantify the spatial heterogeneity of cell type interactions between lymphocytes in the tumour microenvironment. HID features were extracted to train a machine learning model for survival prediction and their performance was compared to other architectural biomarkers. Scalability of the method was examined by observing interactions between cell types that were identified using 6-plexed immunofluorescent staining. Methods: Two follicular lymphoma datasets were used in this study; a microarray with tissue cores from patients, stained with CD69, CD3 and FOXP3 using multiplexed brightfield immunohistochemistry and a second tissue microarray, stained with PD1, PDL1, CD4, FOXP3, CD68 and CD8 using immunofluorescence. Spectral deconvolution, nuclei segmentation and cell type classification was carried out, followed by extraction of features based on cell type interaction probabilities. Random Forest classifiers were built to assign patients into groups of different overall survival and the performance of HID features was assessed. Results: HID features constructed over a range of interaction distances were found to significantly predict overall survival in both datasets (p = 0.0363, p = 0.0077).

It is essential to separate the true effect of genetic variation from other confounding factors, such as adaptation to different uses and geographical locations. The rapid availability of large datasets makes it necessary to explore statistical methods that can be computationally less intensive and more flexible for data exploration. Methodology/Principal Findings A core collection of 168 Brassica rapa accessions of different morphotypes and origins was explored to find genetic association between markers and metabolites: tocopherols, carotenoids, chlorophylls and folate. A widely used linear model with modifications to account for population structure and kinship was followed for association mapping. In addition, a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest (RF) was used as a comparison. Comparison of results across methods resulted in the selection of a set of significant markers as promising candidates for further work. This set of markers associated to the metabolites can potentially be applied for the selection of genotypes with elevated levels of these metabolites. Conclusions/Significance The incorporation of the kinship correction into the association model did not reduce the number of significantly associated markers. However incorporation of the STRUCTURE correction (Q matrix) in the linear regression model greatly reduced the number of significantly associated markers. Additionally, our results demonstrate that RF is an interesting complementary method with added value in association studies in plants, which is illustrated by the overlap in markers identified using RF and a linear mixed model with correction for kinship and population structure. Several markers that were selected in RF and in the models with correction for kinship, but not for population structure, were also identified as QTLs in two bi-parental DH populations.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3094343", "pubmed_id": "21602927", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0019624", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1997875345", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["34644211", "27079048", "24012353", "40523903", "24796604", "20519003", "14437343", "85110151", "14924481", "8507433", "85649103", "52871542", "1065105", "8127858", "3772454", "9893119", "89141", "15880873", "5394647", "18957897", "24930533", "11877130", "8587556", "9134834", "1156737", "45174121", "23064920", "20329444", "86545527", "23369575", "6568475", "196023174", "2858699", "199404731", "9859526"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18364592"}

The current state-of-art methods 1) exploit both the annotated and unannotated data in a semi-supervised manner, and 2) learn morph lexicons and subsequently uncover segmentations by generating the most likely morph sequences. In contrast, we discuss 1) employing only the annotated data in a supervised manner, while entirely ignoring the unannotated data, and 2) directly learning to predict morph boundaries given their local sub-string contexts instead of learning the morph lexicons. Specifically, we employ conditional random fields, a popular discriminative log-linear model for segmentation. We present experiments on two data sets comprising five diverse languages.

The emergence of parasites resistant to commonly used drugs and the lack of availability of vaccines aggravates the problem. One of the preventive approaches targets adhesion of parasites to host cells and tissues. Adhesion of parasites is mediated by proteins called adhesins. Abrogation of adhesion by either immunizing the host with adhesins or inhibiting the interaction using structural analogs of host cell receptors holds the potential to develop novel preventive strategies. The availability of complete genome sequence offers new opportunities for identifying adhesin and adhesin-like proteins. Development of computational algorithms can simplify this task and accelerate experimental characterization of the predicted adhesins from complete genomes. A curated positive dataset of experimentally known adhesins from Plasmodium species was prepared by careful examination of literature reports. \"Controversial\" or \"hypothetical\" adhesins were excluded. The negative dataset consisted of proteins representing various intracellular functions including information processing, metabolism, and interface (transporters). We did not include proteins likely to be on the surface with unknown adhesin properties or which are linked even indirectly to the adhesion process in either of the training sets. A nonhomology-based approach using 420 compositional properties of amino acid dipeptide and multiplet frequencies was used to develop MAAP Web server with Support Vector Machine (SVM) model classifier as its engine for the prediction of malarial adhesins and adhesin-like proteins. The MAAP engine has six SVM classifier models identified through an exhaustive search from 728 kernel parameters set. These models displayed an efficiency (Mathews correlation coefficient) of 0.860-0.967. The final prediction P(maap) score is the maximum score attained by a given sequence in any of the six models. The results of MAAP runs on complete proteomes of Plasmodium species revealed that in Plasmodium falciparum at P(maap) scores above 0.0, we observed a sensitivity of 100% with two false positives. In P. vivax and P. yoelii an optimal threshold P(maap) score of 0.7 was optimal with very few false positives (upto 5). Several new predictions were obtained. This list includes hypothetical protein PF14_0040, interspersed repeat antigen, STEVOR, liver stage antigen, SURFIN, RIFIN, stevor (3D7-stevorT3-2), mature parasite-infected erythrocyte surface antigen or P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 2, merozoite surface protein 6 in P. falciparum, circumsporozoite proteins, microneme protein-1, Vir18, Vir12-like, Vir12, Vir18-like, Vir18-related and Vir4 in P. vivax, circumsporozoite protein/thrombospondin related anonymous proteins, 28 kDa ookinete surface protein, yir1, and yir4 of P. yoelii. Among these, a few proteins identified by MAAP were matched with those identified by other groups using different experimental and theoretical strategies. Most other interspersed repeat proteins in Plasmodium species had lower P(maap) scores.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named Latently Invertible Autoencoder (LIA) to address the above two issues in one framework. An invertible network and its inverse mapping are symmetrically embedded in the latent space of VAE. Thus the partial encoder first transforms the input into feature vectors and then the distribution of these feature vectors is reshaped to fit a prior by the invertible network. The decoder proceeds in the reverse order of the encoder's composite mappings. A two-stage stochasticity-free training scheme is designed to train LIA via adversarial learning, in the sense that the decoder of LIA is first trained as a standard GAN with the invertible network and then the partial encoder is learned from an autoencoder by detaching the invertible network from LIA.

Current neurophysiological measurements can distinguish groups of healthy controls and groups of schizophrenia patients. Individual classification based on neurophysiological measurements mostly shows moderate accuracy. We wanted to examine whether it is possible to distinguish controls and patients individually with a good accuracy. To this end we used a combination of features extracted from the auditory and visual P300 paradigms and the mismatch negativity paradigm. Methods We selected 54 patients and 54 controls, matched for age and gender, from the data available at the UPC Kortenberg. The EEG-data were high- and low-pass filtered, epoched and averaged. Features (latencies and amplitudes of component peaks) were extracted from the averaged signals. The resulting dataset was used to train and test classification algorithms. First on separate paradigms and then on all combinations, we applied Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree, with two of its improvements: Adaboost and Random Forest. Results For at least two classifiers the performance increased significantly by combining paradigms compared to single paradigms. The classification accuracy increased from at best 79.8% when trained on features from single paradigms, to 84.7% when trained on features from all three paradigms. Conclusion A combination of features originating from three evoked potential paradigms allowed us to accurately classify individual subjects as either control or patient.

We address this issue by proposing customized model ensembles on demand, inspired by Lazy Learning. In our approach, referred to as Lazy Meta-Learning, for a given query we find the most relevant models from a DB of models, using their meta-information. After retrieving the relevant models, we select a subset of models with highly uncorrelated errors. With these models we create an ensemble and use their meta-information for dynamic bias compensation and relevance weighting.

To deal with a domain that has insufficient labeled data, these approaches can be used in a Transfer Learning (TL) setting to leverage labeled data from a resource-rich source domain. To achieve better performance, source domain data selection is essential in this process to prevent the \"negative transfer\" problem. However, the emerging deep transfer models do not fit well with most existing data selection methods, because the data selection policy and the transfer learning model are not jointly trained, leading to sub-optimal training efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforced data selector to select high-quality source domain data to help the TL model. Specifically, the data selector \"acts\" on the source domain data to find a subset for optimization of the TL model, and the performance of the TL model can provide \"rewards\" in turn to update the selector. We build the reinforced data selector based on the actor-critic framework and integrate it to a DNN based transfer learning model, resulting in a Reinforced Transfer Learning (RTL) method. We perform a thorough experimental evaluation on two major tasks for text matching, namely, paraphrase identification and natural language inference. Experimental results show the proposed RTL can significantly improve the performance of the TL model. We further investigate different settings of states, rewards, and policy optimization methods to examine the robustness of our method. Last, we conduct a case study on the selected data and find our method is able to select source domain data whose Wasserstein distance is close to the target domain data. This is reasonable and intuitive as such source domain data can provide more transferability power to the model.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1812.11561", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3289600.3290978", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2907710302", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4884302", "14096841", "14604520", "9112273", "5360764", "388785", "22272492", "19100390", "5688521", "70831", "24462950", "6628106", "26030198", "3147007", "630188", "15238391", "205242740", "11866664", "740063", "8495258", "29162247", "1957433", "57464058", "6979578", "7403346", "59872172", "3861990", "205261034", "19178620", "3432876", "19115634", "4897319", "207237683", "646109", "13661768", "17984798", "5535381", "13742189", "362467", "13314839"], "inbound_citations": ["196177586", "214743276", "209852784", "210932328", "210951870", "215238431", "166228706"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57189500"}

Existing pheromone-based traffic management frameworks were developed to reduce urban congestion by fusing traffic lights control strategies and vehicle routing schemes. Despite a significant reduction in traffic congestions, the greener aspects of transportation were not well investigated. In view of this, a Pheromone-based Green Transportation System (PGTS) is proposed to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions and urban congestion in a three-step approach. First, traffic congestions are predicted based on the transport pheromone intensity of the target and adjacent upstream roads through an online epsilon-Support Vector Regression model. Second, a Coordinated Traffic Light Control (CTLC) strategy generates green wave scenario, dispersing heavy traffic on congested roads to the coordinated downstream paths. Third, a Cooperative Green Vehicle Routing (CGVR) takes a further leap by probabilistically rerouting upstream vehicles from entering the congested road, preventing the accumulation of vehicles that can lead to upstream congestion. Intuitively, the integration of CTLC and CGVR increases the chances that vehicles traversing multiple intersections with fewer frequencies of acceleration, effectively marking down fuel consumption. The proposed PGTS can be realized through a Pheromone-based Hierarchical Multi-Agent System (PHMAS). Based on Singapore traffic data, experimental results from a microscopic simulation SUMO show that the proposed PGTS outperforms other six approaches in reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 37.7%, fuel consumption by 37.6%, mean travel time by 47.5%, mean waiting time by 57.3%, and increasing number of arrived vehicles at designated destinations by 62.6%.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2019.105486", "venue": "Appl.

We therefore focused our efforts on the following landforms: rock outcrops, screes, alluvial fans and low relief areas. A characteristic of RF, which makes it a good algorithm for geomorphological mapping, is its ability to generate thousands of classification trees. Each tree provides a classification and the value classified by the majority of the trees is the final output of the algorithm. Furthermore, having multiple classifications provides a measure of uncertainty. This is very important because it gives practitioners an idea of areas where the method is less accurate, which would require more effort in terms of sampling or surveying. This method was applied in two mountainous areas of Switzerland, the first where we trained and calibrated it and the second where we used it for classification. The results were validated using existing geomorphological maps, and they show that this method can obtain good training accuracy with a relatively small starting dataset. Moreover, both calibration and classification present a percentage of agreement with existing geomorphological maps of over 70%. Some geomorphological classes, alluvial fans and screes, present a classification accuracy that is lower than the calibration, which is in line with previous tests found in the literature. However, for other classes, i.e., rock outcrops and low relief areas, the accuracy increases, suggesting that this method can be employed extensively and relatively securely for these landforms.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geomorph.2014.07.020", "venue": null, "journal": "Geomorphology", "mag_id": "1990425532", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["110508860", "203122949", "131858699", "208224759"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:128674770"}

A novel regression technique, called Support Vector Machine (SVM), based on the statistical learning theory is explored in this study. SVM is based on the principle of Structural Risk Minimization as opposed to the principle of Empirical Risk Minimization espoused by conventional regression techniques. The flood data at Dhaka, Bangladesh, are used in this study to demonstrate the forecasting capabilities of SVM. The result is compared with that of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based model for one-lead day to seven-lead day forecasting. The improvements in maximum predicted water level errors by SVM over ANN for four-lead day to seven-lead day are 9.6 cm, 22.6 cm, 4.9 cm and 15.7 cm, respectively. The result shows that the prediction accuracy of SVM is at least as good as and in some cases (particularly at higher lead days) actually better than that of ANN, yet it offers advantages over many of the limitations of ANN, for example in arriving at ANN's optimal network architecture and choosing useful training set.

The main objective of this paper is to solve this problem by evaluating the relatedness among given domains through transferred weights. We propose a novel method to learn such transferred weights with the aid of co-occurrence data, which contain the same set of instances but in different feature spaces. Because instances with the same category should have similar features, our method is to compute their principal components in each feature space such that co-occurrence data can be rerepresented by these principal components. The principal component coefficients from different feature spaces for the same instance in the co-occurrence data have the same order of significance for describing the category information. By using these principal component coefficients, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is employed to construct a directed cyclic network where each node is a domain and each edge weight is the conditional dependence from one domain to another domain. Here, the edge weight of the network can be employed as the transferred weight from a source domain to a target domain. The weight values can be taken as a prior for setting parameters in the existing heterogeneous transfer learning methods to control the amount of knowledge transferred from a source domain to a target domain. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets are reported to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method that can capture strong or weak relations among feature spaces, and enhance the learning performance of heterogeneous transfer learning.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26353384", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2472457", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2418667810", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["740063", "16197334", "15778895", "2090561", "18391272", "15260040", "196536", "10360019", "777477", "4908577", "4553188", "597779", "10084422", "4623903", "14108802", "15866435", "8153773", "13322062", "14634330", "10163399", "15042288", "1993257", "15622614", "15552946", "13723620", "53928084", "5521191", "14995779", "7676706", "12470121", "18041873", "16748115", "11608679", "13252401", "6483070", "45793141", "18213300", "1372587", "2237682", "8492991", "961425", "162164972"], "inbound_citations": ["214713946", "172136823", "6988444", "196204862", "69987286", "49723572", "1880767", "2899523", "59337374", "30442332", "67872061", "89620794", "19349971", "207902589", "7559976", "10092092", "174801595", "204700614", "3761015", "44216797", "21713922", "52813589", "53098908"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5838380"}

Therefore, this paper proposes an improved balanced distribution adaptation (BDA), named multi-core balanced distribution adaptation (MBDA). This method constructs a weighted mixed kernel function to map different working conditions data to a unified feature space. It does not need to obtain the cross-characteristics of different working conditions data in advance, which simplifies the data processing and meet end-to-end state recognition in practical applications. At the same time, MBDA adopts the A-Distance algorithm to estimate the balance factor of the distribution and the balance factor of the kernel function, which not only effectively reduces the distribution difference between different working conditions data, but also improves efficiency.

This study, carried out using Baguio gold district (Philippines), examines (a) the sensitivity of the RF algorithm to different sets of deposit and non-deposit locations as training data and (b) the performance of RF modeling compared to established methods for data-driven predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity. We found that RF modeling with different training sets of deposit/non-deposit locations is stable and reproducible, and it accurately captures the spatial relationships between the predictor variables and the training deposit/non-deposit locations. For data-driven predictive mapping of epithermal Au prospectivity in the Baguio district, we found that (a) the success-rates of RF modeling are superior to those of weights-of-evidence, evidential belief and logistic regression modeling and (b) the prediction-rate of RF modeling is superior to that of weights-of-evidence modeling but approximately equal to those of evidential belief and logistic regression modeling. Therefore, the RF algorithm is potentially much more useful than existing methods that are currently used for data-driven predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity. However, further testing of the method in other areas is needed to fully explore its usefulness in data-driven predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.oregeorev.2014.08.010", "venue": null, "journal": "Ore Geology Reviews", "mag_id": "1973595880", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208302771", "198419734", "214784517", "135128043", "202896061", "20519603", "198410366", "59036579", "132525654", "4950935", "133708914", "202733606", "13425955", "133731164", "131501604", "59310713", "203653916", "133934661", "127632303", "69927629", "209392366", "113638840", "146011015", "130475248", "54907231", "126283318", "207988370", "134852205", "126283342", "204848763"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129071685"}

Here, we analyse an alternative strategy that uses text transcripts and a support vector machine classifier. For each one of the 710 videos of mathematics classes from the 2005 Chilean National Teacher Assessment Programme, a single 4-minute slice was selected randomly and manually transcribed. The texts were then rated by two mathematicians and two teachers on the basis of the presence/absence of eight categories of contents and 12 categories of teacher practices. Then for each rater and category a classifier was built using a support vector machine algorithm trained with his/her ratings on a subset of texts. The agreements between the classifiers and the corresponding raters computed for texts belonging to an independent subset were better than the agreements between the raters. Next, we trained classifiers by using ratings created by raters who watched the videos rather than analysing the transcripts. Again, the agreements between classifiers and the raters were satisfactory. Given that class assessment can be an extremely slow, error prone and tedious process, the proposed automatic classifier scheme could be a promising alternative for monitoring classes and building online performance support system of teacher practices. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic High importance of monitoring teacher practices in order to improve teaching., Monitoring is currently performed by trained raters, but it is an infrequent, tedious and laborious task, prone to biases and errors., What this paper adds A vector support machine algorithm to build automatic raters with high agreement with human experts., A systematic method to quantify contents actually covered and strategies used in class., Tool that can be implemented in order to give continuous and immediate feedback to the teacher., Implications for practice and/or policy Computer methods can be used to construct personal and confident auto-support performance support system for improving teacher practices, avoiding the natural fear for evaluation by third parties., Computerised methods can be strategic tools to help improve quality of teaching.

Early diagnosis of NAFLD is important, as this can help prevent irreversible damage to the liver and ultimately hepatocellular carcinomas. ::: Methods and Findings: Utilizing the baseline data from the IMI DIRECT participants (n=1514) we sought to expand etiological understanding and develop a diagnostic tool for NAFLD using machine learning. Multi-omic (genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) and clinical (liver enzymes and other serological biomarkers, anthropometry, and measures of beta-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and lifestyle) data comprised the key input variables. The models were trained on MRI image-derived liver fat content ( =5%). We applied LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) to select features from the different layers of omics data and Random Forest analysis to develop the models. The prediction models included clinical and omics variables separately or in combination. A model including all omics and clinical variables yielded a cross-validated receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (ROCAUC) of 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.82, 0.86), which compared with a ROCAUC of 0.82 (95% CI=0.81, 0.83) for a model including nine clinically-accessible variables.

In other words, it is important to improve the efficiency of interventions of the current healthcare system by prioritizing resources to the patients who are most likely to be non-adherent. Our objective in this work is to make predictions regarding individual patients' behaviour in terms of taking their medication on time during their next scheduled medication opportunity. We do this by leveraging a number of machine learning models.

The SCRF framework is able to appropriately weight these different information sources to produce significant gains on both the Broadcast News and Wall Street Journal tasks.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5947490", "venue": "2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "journal": "2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2151660570", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1406894", "2727489", "1819708", "7827952", "10205241", "131773", "13495419", "141295", "277918", "14036493", "3120824", "30942751", "12092296"], "inbound_citations": ["15911185", "2682371", "1883764", "4525936", "5911399", "841254", "52962594", "9677213", "10006724", "834762", "4541069"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1710846"}

Feating is a generic ensemble approach that can enhance the predictive performance of both stable and unstable learners. In contrast, most existing ensemble approaches can improve the predictive performance of unstable learners only. Our analysis shows that the new approach reduces the execution time to generate a model in an ensemble through an increased level of localisation in Feating. Our empirical evaluation shows that Feating performs significantly better than Boosting, Random Subspace and Bagging in terms of predictive accuracy, when a stable learner SVM is used as the base learner. The speed up achieved by Feating makes feasible SVM ensembles that would otherwise be infeasible for large data sets. When SVM is the preferred base learner, we show that Feating SVM performs better than Boosting decision trees and Random Forests. We further demonstrate that Feating also substantially reduces the error of another stable learner, k-nearest neighbour, and an unstable learner, decision tree.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10994-010-5224-5", "venue": "Machine Learning", "journal": "Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1987236320", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["209099422", "9219592", "1854295", "207738357", "89141", "7169506", "1332925", "7244810", "3116168", "8809507", "206420153", "16596563", "2608530", "422042", "34090248", "1241550", "5139000", "2858917", "10160463", "14500006", "207163669", "140109802", "28204", "6997662", "6637227"], "inbound_citations": ["10617728", "207032537", "15492873", "29296290", "12150474", "1664475", "12646288", "46491445", "15887424", "52262388", "12947678", "1049113", "55659133", "1087133", "19073137", "6155408", "18880311", "8917762", "14037541", "11632848"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21174602"}

In the first level, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)-based feature learning approach captures the nonlinearity in the data distribution by mapping it onto a d-dimensional space. In the second level, ELM-based feature extracted data is used as an input for Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to predict the number of clusters termed as a cluster prediction. In the final level, feature-extracted data along with the cluster prediction is passed to the Kohonen Network to obtain improved clustering accuracy. The main advantage of the proposed method is to overcome the problem of having a priori identifiers or class labels for the data; it is difficult to obtain labels in most of the cases for the real world datasets. The BELMKN framework is applied to 3 synthetic datasets and 10 benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and compared with the state-of-the-art clustering methods.

The increasing amount of data used for classification led to new parallel implementations of the decomposition method with efficient inner solvers. With these solvers larger working sets can be assigned. It was shown, that for parallel training with the decomposition algorithm large working sets achieve good speedup values.

Promoter engineering was mostly focused on the random mutation or combination of regulation elements such as transcription factor binding sites. However, the size of promoter sequence space is still overwhelming and better navigation method is required. On the other hand, the generative adversarial network (GAN) is known for its great ability to reduce the searching space by learning to generate new data on the similar manifold of original data. Here, we applied WGAN-GP model into de novo promoter sequence design to generate entirely new promoter sequences. In total, 83 of model-generated promoter sequences were tested in promoter activity screening by regulating the expression of sfGFP gene in Escherichia coli. As a result, 26 out of 83 newly designed promoters were found functional and successfully expressed with varying activities, with similarity score to natural promoters all less than 0.7. Moreover, 3 of them showed higher promoter strength than the wild type promoters and their highly expression mutants. The much higher successful rate and promoter activity with much lower similarity score in our model-designed novel promoters confirmed the effectiveness of promoter sequence learning.

In this case, conventional signal enhancement techniques yield compromised performance due to several limitations which include processing signals in frequency domains only, relying mainly on first order statistics, loss of important information present in higher frequency band and handling limited number of noise types. To address these issues, we propose a solution based on using generative adversarial network, a popular deep learning scheme, to enhance SMI signal corrupted with different noise types. Thus, taking advantage of the deep networks that can learn arbitrary noise distribution from large example set, our proposed method trains the deep network model end-to-end, able to process raw waveforms directly, learn 51 different noise conditions including white noise and amplitude modulation noise for 1,140 different types of SMI waveforms made up of 285 different optical feedback coupling factor ( $C$ ) values and 4 different line-width enhancement factor $\\alpha $ values. The results show that the proposed method is able to significantly improve the SNR of noisy SM signals on average of 19.49, 16.29, 10.34 dB for weak-, moderate-, and strong-optical feedback regime signals, respectively. For amplitude modulated SMI signals, the proposed method has corrected the amplitude modulation with maximum error (using area-under-the-curve based quantitative analysis) of 0.73% for SMI signals belonging to all optical feedback regimes.

Nevertheless, the quality of sleep is rarely evaluated due to the required technological complexity. A new technique for automatic sleep staging is here proposed for patients treated by NIV. This new technique only requires signals (airflow and hemoglobin oxygen saturation) available in domiciliary ventilators plus a photo-plethysmogram, a signal already managed by some ventilators. Consequently, electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, electromyogram, and electrocardiogram recordings are not needed. Cardiorespiratory features are extracted from the three selected signals and used as input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) multi-class classifier. Two different types of sleep scoring were investigated: the first type was used to distinguish three stages (wake, REM sleep and nonREM sleep), and the second type was used to evaluate five stages (wake, REM sleep, N1, N2 and N3 stages). Patient-dependent and patient-independent classifiers were tested comparing the resulting hypnograms with those obtained from visual/manual scoring by a sleep specialist. An average accuracy of 91% (84%) was obtained with three-stage (five-stage) patient-dependent classifiers. With patient-independent classifiers, an average accuracy of 78% (62%) was obtained when three (five) sleep stages were scored. Also if the PPG-based and flow features are left out, a reduction of 4.5% (resp. 5%) in accuracy is observed for the three-stage (resp. five-stage) cases.

In this study, a new framework of modeling is suggested. Compared with other popular methods, a distinctive characteristic is\"from image based model to analysis based model (e.g. stress, strain, and deformation)\". In such a framework, a reconstruction neural network (ReConNN) model designed for simulation-based physical field's reconstruction is proposed. The ReConNN contains two submodels that are convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial net-work (GAN). The CNN is employed to construct the mapping between contour images of physical field and objective function. Subsequently, the GAN is utilized to generate more images which are similar to the existing contour images. Finally, Lagrange polynomial is applied to complete the reconstruction. However, the existing CNN models are commonly applied to the classification tasks, which seem to be difficult to handle with regression tasks of images. Meanwhile, the existing GAN architectures are insufficient to generate high-accuracy\"pseudo contour images\". Therefore, a ReConNN model based on a Convolution in Convolution (CIC) and a Convolutional AutoEncoder based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN-CAE) is suggested. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model representatively, a classical topology optimization procedure is considered. Then the ReConNN is utilized to the reconstruction of heat transfer process of a pin fin heat sink.

On the basis of results and analysis of laboratory test, different liver diseases are classified. Hence to simplify this complex process, we have developed a Rule Base Classification Model (RBCM) to predict different types of liver diseases. The proposed model is the combination of rules and different data mining techniques.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to propose a rule based classification model with machine learning techniques for the prediction of different types of Liver diseases.METHOD: A dataset was developed with twelve attributes that include the records of 583 patients in which 441 patients were male and rests were female. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Rule Induction (RI), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) data mining techniques with K-cross fold technique are used with the proposed model for the prediction of liver diseases. The performance of these data mining techniques are evaluated with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and kappa parameters as well as statistical techniques (ANOVA and Chi square test) are used to analyze the liver disease dataset and independence of attributes.RESULT: Out of 583 patients, 416 patients are liver diseases affected and rests of 167 patients are healthy. The proposed model with decision tree (DT) technique provides the better result among all techniques (RI, SVM, ANN and NB) with all parameters (Accuracy 98.46%, Sensitivity 95.7%, Specificity 95.28% and Kappa 0.983) while the SVM exhibits poor performance (Accuracy 82.33%, Sensitivity 68.03%, Specificity 91.28% and Kappa 0.801). It is also found that the best performance of the model without rules (RI, Accuracy 82.68%, Sensitivity 86.34%, Specificity 90.51% and Kappa 0.619) is almost similar to the worst performance of the rule based classification model (SVM, Accuracy 82.33%, Sensitivity 68.03%, Specificity 91.28% and Kappa 0.801 and the accuracy of chi square test is 76.67%.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that there is a significant difference between the proposed rules based classification model and the model without rules for the liver diseases prediction and the rule based classification model with decision tree (DT) technique provides most accurate result. This model can be used as a valuable tool for medical decision making.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "23963359", "doi": "10.3233/THC-130742", "venue": "Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine", "journal": "Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine", "mag_id": "1715543708", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["8226000", "9182332", "3743777", "214820195", "21417528", "27579000"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25448666"}

However, surveillance videos of subway spaces suffer from severe crowd occlusion and perspective distortion. In this paper, a novel double-region learning algorithm is presented to overcome these challenges. The main idea of this algorithm is to identify the best two-region boundary and then design a reasonable pedestrian-counting method in each separated region. First, a separate line is obtained via possibility learning, and each frame is divided into a nearby region and a distant region to eliminate the influence of perspective distortion. Second, in the nearby region, we apply the improved aggregate channel feature detection to count the number of pedestrians N 1 . In the distant region, we employ the Extreme Learning Machine and Gaussian Process regression methods to estimate the number of pedestrians N 2 . Finally, the total number of pedestrians in each frame can be obtained with high accuracy according to N 1 and N 2 . We establish a subway pedestrian video dataset about several typical subway stations in Shanghai to validate the algorithm performance. Various experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed approach surpasses that of compared methods, which means that our algorithm can meet the management requirements of subway stations.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.engappai.2017.06.017", "venue": "Eng.

The task includes clustering and hash learning as special cases. Deep neural networks are promising to be used because they can model the non-linearity of data and scale to large datasets. However, their model complexity is huge, and therefore, we need to carefully regularize the networks in order to learn useful and interpretable representations that exhibit intended invariance for applications of interest. To this end, we propose a method called Information Maximizing Self-Augmented Training (IMSAT). In IMSAT, we use data augmentation to impose the invariance on discrete representations. More specifically, we encourage the predicted representations of augmented data points to be close to those of the original data points in an end-to-end fashion. At the same time, we maximize the information-theoretic dependency between data and their predicted discrete representations. Our IMSAT is able to discover interpretable representations that exhibit intended invariance.

One key issue in such modeling frameworks is to efficiently handle variability. The traditional approach consists in first removing as much as possible signal variability in the preprocessing stage, and to use more complex models, for instance in the case of hidden Markov models one increases the number of states and the Gaussian mixture size. We focus here on another kind of approaches where the probability distribution implemented by the models depends on a number of additional contextual variables, that are assumed fixed or that vary slowly along a sequence. The context may stand for emotion features in speech recognition, physical features in gesture recognition, gender, age, etc. We propose a framework for deriving markovian models that make use of such contextual information.

However, the wind towers generate a noise that is perceived as an annoyance by the population living near the wind farms. It is therefore important to new tools that can help wind farm builders and the administrations. In this study, the measurements of the noise emitted by a wind farm and the data recorded by the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system were used to construct a prediction model. First, acoustic measurements and control system data have been analyzed to characterize the phenomenon. An appropriate number of observations were then extracted, and these data were pre-processed. Subsequently two models of prediction of sound pressure levels were built at the receiver: a model based on multiple linear regression, and a model based on Random Forest algorithm. As predictors wind speeds measured near the wind turbines and the active power of the turbines were selected. Both data were measured by the SCADA system of wind turbines. The model based on the Random Forest algorithm showed high values of the Pearson correlation coefficient (0.981), indicating a high number of correct predictions. This model can be extremely useful, both for the receiver and for the wind farm manager. Through the results of the model it will be possible to establish for which wind speed values the noise produced by wind turbines become dominant. Furthermore, the predictive model can give an overview of the noise produced by the receiver from the system in different operating conditions.

In this work, statistical distributions of different texture descriptors and their combination are investigated with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for objective breast density classification: Scale Invariant Feature Transforms (SIFT), Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and texton histograms. SIFT is an approach for detecting and extracting local feature descriptors that are reasonably invariant to changes in illumination, image noise, rotation, scaling and small changes in viewpoint. The SIFT descriptor is a coarse descriptor of the edges found in the keypoints. LBPs provide a robust and computationally simple way for describing pure local binary patterns in a texture. They provide information regarding the prevalence of different edge patterns and uniformity. Textons are defined under the operational definition of clustered filter responses and provide a statistical and structural unifying approach for texture characterization. The breast density classification accuracy of the SVM classifiers modeled on the histograms of the three different sets of texture features separately and their combination is evaluated on the Medical Image Analysis Society (MIAS) mammographic database and the results are presented.

In this work we propose a methodology for detecting masses by determining certain asymmetric regions between pairs of mammograms of the left and the right breast. The asymmetric regions are detected by means of structural variations between corresponding regions, defined by a spatial descriptor called cross-variogram function. After determining the asymmetric regions of a pair of images, the variogram function is applied to each asymmetric region separately, for classification as either mass or non-mass. The first stage of the methodology consists in preprocessing the images to make them adequate for registration. The following step performs the bilateral registration of pairs of left and right breasts. Pairs of corresponding regions are listed and their variations are measured by means of the cross-variogram spatial descriptor. Next, a model is created to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) using the values of the cross-variogram function of each pair of windows as features. The pairs of breasts containing lesions are classified as asymmetric regions; the remaining ones are classified as symmetric regions. From the asymmetric regions, features are extracted from the variogram function to be used as tissue texture descriptors. The regions containing masses are classified as mass regions, and the other ones as non-mass regions. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis is used to select the most statistically significant features. Tests are performed with new cases for the final classification as either mass or non-mass by the trained SVM.

Monocular vision-based road-detection algorithms are mostly based on machine learning approaches and are usually cast as classification problems. However, the pixel-wise classifiers are faced with the ambiguity caused by changes in road appearance, illumination and weather. An effective way to reduce the ambiguity is to model the contextual information with structured learning and prediction. Currently, the widely used structured prediction model in road detection is the Markov random field or conditional random field.

Unlike in speech recognition, coarticulation effects in sign languages are over longer durations and simultaneously impact different aspects of the sign such as the hand shape, position, and movement. Due to this effect, the appearance of a sign, especially at the beginning and at the end, can be significantly different under different sentence contexts, which makes the recognition of signs in sentences hard. We advocate a two-step approach, where in the first step one segments the individual signs in a sentence and in the next step one recognizes the signs. In this work, we show how the first step, i.e. sign segmentation, can be performed effectively by using the conditional random fields (CRF) to directly detect the coarticulation points. The CRF approach does not make conditional independence assumptions about the observations and can be trained with fewer samples than Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We validate our approach by demonstrating performance with American Sign Language (ASL) sentence level data and show that the CRF approach is 85% accurate in segmenting signs compared to 60% for the HMM approach at 0.1 false alarm rate.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICPR.2006.431", "venue": "18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'06)", "journal": "18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'06)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2134788091", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18440098", "3189198", "277918", "118344657", "328576", "6420751"], "inbound_citations": ["3034962", "9702031", "15118062", "12111807", "11663037", "15413259", "15840819", "85451539", "30461286", "12717848", "4013080", "8391854", "53540256", "53540256", "15522082", "55294244", "56275515", "5933616", "32085897", "9186774", "7152729", "34263166", "31667441", "4541069", "86771036", "1641547", "13838791", "62726667", "17496666", "23969551", "15921425", "5897471"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14395556"}

The result is increased drilling costs and a need to maximize the value of the drill hole samples collected. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis of pyrite is one tool that is showing promise in deep exploration. Since the trace element content of pyrite approximates the composition of the fluid from which it precipitated and the crystallization mechanism, the trace element characteristics can be used to predict the type of deposit with which a pyritic sample is associated. This possibility, however, is complicated by overlapping trace element abundances for many deposit types. The solution lies with simultaneous comparison of multiple trace elements through rigorous statistical analysis. Specifically, we used LA-ICP-MS pyrite trace element data and Random Forests, an ensemble machine learning supervised classifier, to distinguish barren sedimentary pyrite and five ore deposit categories: iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG), orogenic Au, porphyry Cu, sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX), and volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) deposits. The preferred classifier utilizes in situ Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Ag, Sb, Te, Tl, and Pb measurements to train the Random Forests. Testing of the Random Forests classifier using additional data from the same deposits and sedimentary basins (test data set) yielded an overall accuracy of 91.4% (94.9% for IOCG, 78.8% for orogenic Au, 81.1% for porphyry Cu, 93.6% for SEDEX, 97.2% for sedimentary pyrite, 91.8% for VHMS). Similarly, testing of the Random Forests classifier using data from deposits and sedimentary basins that did not have analyses in the training data set yielded an overall accuracy of 88.0% (81.4% for orogenic Au, 95.5% for SEDEX, 90.0% for sedimentary pyrite, 73.9% for VHMS; insufficient data was available to perform a blind test on porphyry Cu and IOCG). The performance of the classifier was further improved by instituting criteria (at least 40% of total votes from the Random Forests needed for a conclusive identification) to remove uncertain or inconclusive classifications, increasing the classifier\u2019s accuracy to 94.5% for the test data (94.6% for IOCG, 85.8% for orogenic Au, 87.8% for porphyry Cu, 95.4% for SEDEX, 98.5% for sedimentary pyrite, 94.6% for VHMS) and 93.9% for the blind test data (85.5% for orogenic Au, 96.9% for SEDEX, 96.7% for sedimentary pyrite, 84.6% for VHMS).The Random Forests classification models for pyrite trace element data can be used as a predictive modeling tool in greenfield terrains by providing an accurate indication of ore deposit type. This advance will assist mineral explorers by allowing early implementation of predictive ore deposit models when prospecting for ore deposits. Furthermore, the ability of the classifier to accurately identify pyrite of sedimentary origin will allow researchers interested in paleoenvironmental conditions of ancient oceans to effectively screen prospective samples that are affected by a hydrothermal overprint.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5382/econgeo.4654", "venue": null, "journal": "Economic Geology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2953377318", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["131480306", "60985554", "206380316", "129794850", "38422928", "10344554", "54086146", "129832219", "62533883", "260400", "127686179", "131003666", "132992055", "128748361", "128758121", "6336016", "205212619", "130309491"], "inbound_citations": ["210184305", "212682185"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197573326"}

The scientific community has increased the amount of research into new technologies, with a view to improving the digital video utilization: its archiving, indexing, accessibility, acquisition, store and even its process and usability. All these parts of the video utilization entail the necessity of the extraction of all important information of a video, especially in cases of lack of metadata information. The main goal of this paper is the construction of a system that automatically generates and provides all the essential information, both in visual and textual form, of a video. By using the visual or the textual information, a user is facilitated on the one hand to locate a specific video and on the other hand is able to comprehend rapidly the basic points and generally, the main concept of a video without the need to watch the whole of it. The visual information of the system emanates from a video summarization method, while the textual one derives from a key-word-based video annotation approach. The video annotation technique is based on the key-frames, that constitute the video abstract and therefore, the first part of the system consists of the new video summarization method. According to the proposed video abstraction technique, initially, each frame of the video is described by the Compact Composite Descriptors (CCDs) and a visual word histogram. Afterwards, the proposed approach utilizes the Self-Growing and Self-Organized Neural Gas (SGONG) network, with a view to classifying the frames into clusters. The extraction of a representative key frame from every cluster leads to the generation of the video abstract. The most significant advantage of the video summarization approach is its ability to calculate dynamically the appropriate number of final clusters. In the sequel, a new video annotation method is applied to the generated video summary leading to the automatic generation of key-words capable of describing the semantic content of the given video. This approach is based on the recently proposed N-closest Photos Model (NCP).

In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing an efficient representation learning framework that is able to convert a set of time series with various lengths to an instance-feature matrix. In particular, we guarantee that the pairwise similarities between time series are well preserved after the transformation, thus the learned feature representation is particularly suitable for the time series clustering task. Given a set of $n$ time series, we first construct an $n\\times n$ partially-observed similarity matrix by randomly sampling $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ pairs of time series and computing their pairwise similarities. We then propose an efficient algorithm that solves a non-convex and NP-hard problem to learn new features based on the partially-observed similarity matrix.

The purpose of GS-LSSVM is to execute feature selections, mixed kernel applications, and parameter optimization in a learning paradigm. The proposed learning paradigm includes three steps. First, an orthogonal design is utilized to initialize the number of input features and candidate parameters stored in GS. Then, the features are randomly selected according to the first grid acquired from the first step. These features and the candidate parameters are then passed to LSSVM. Finally, an artificial bee colony algorithm, the recently popular heuristic algorithm, is used to optimize parameters for LSSVM learning. For illustration and evaluation purposes, ten remarkable data sets from the University of California Irvine database are used as testing targets. The experimental results reveal that the proposed GS-LSSVM can produce a classification model more easily interpreted using a small number of features.

Robust recognition of sonar data still remains a problem, but if solved it would enable more autonomy for underwater vehicles providing more reliable information about the surroundings to aid decision making.

While image recognition with Deep Learning is known to require large amounts of labeled data, there are data-efficient learning methods using generic features learned by a network pre-trained on data from a different domain.

A working image-based vehicle classification system is proposed in this paper. The first component vehicle detection is implemented by applying histogram of oriented gradient features and SVM classifier. The second component vehicle classification, which is the emphasis of this paper, is accomplished by a hybrid model composed of clustering and kernel autoassociator (KAA). The KAA model is a generalization of auto-associative networks by training to recall the inputs through kernel subspace. As an effective one-class classification strategy, KAA has been proposed to implement classification with rejection, showing balanced error---rejection trade-off. With a large number of training samples, however, the training of KAA becomes problematic due to the difficulties involved with directly creating the kernel matrix. As a solution, a hybrid model consisting of self-organizing map (SOM) and KAM has been proposed to first acquire prototypes and then construct the KAA model, which has been proven efficient in internet intrusion detection. The hybrid model is further studied in this paper, with several clustering algorithms compared, including k-mean clustering, SOM and Neural Gas. Experimental results using more than 2,500 images from four types of vehicles (bus, light truck, car and van) demonstrated the effectiveness of the hybrid model.

Gesture sequences often have a complex underlying structure, and models that can incorporate hidden structures have proven to be advantageous for recognition tasks. Most existing approaches to gesture recognition with hidden states employ a Hidden Markov Model or suitable variant (e.g., a factored or coupled state model) to model gesture streams; a significant limitation of these models is the requirement of conditional independence of observations. In addition, hidden states in a generative model are selected to maximize the likelihood of generating all the examples of a given gesture class, which is not necessarily optimal for discriminating the gesture class against other gestures. Previous discriminative approaches to gesture sequence recognition have shown promising results, but have not incorporated hidden states nor addressed the problem of predicting the label of an entire sequence. In this paper, we derive a discriminative sequence model with a hidden state structure, and demonstrate its utility both in a detection and in a multi-way classification formulation. We evaluate our method on the task of recognizing human arm and head gestures, and compare the performance of our method to both generative hidden state and discriminative fully-observable models.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2006.132", "venue": "2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)", "journal": "2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2145835757", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2840579", "5391819", "6526484", "1744924", "14054070", "59824158", "277918", "775373", "11664683", "10070991", "5702505", "14719771", "61503518", "9389968", "13618539", "5714776", "28824442", "60326635", "16542114"], "inbound_citations": ["14847241", "11267398", "36632065", "14411619", "5455360", "9342072", "6140902", "9907977", "210172937", "19178535", "17633890", "15645571", "661834", "3418002", "202743696", "14057902", "11663037", "8755245", "40636835", "53518709", "2281930", "15560006", "566572", "10945339", "19529765", "2429363", "22606743", "41694", "14825282", "12462761", "15749005", "16635841", "15413259", "57756062", "42032197", "17919362", "53040277", "10731294", "14617149", "3123075", "6560384", "8786500", "2466592", "2607117", "49218728", "15998923", "24420206", "17390685", "212699788", "212699788", "646354", "2858305", "12028302", "4379732", "13298437", "6069201", "24186410", "14047528", "14775089", "5633701", "22823536", "7755839", "13615107", "9861440", "16051176", "5976979", "18179977", "3371628", "14259602", "17858451", "8076093", "2778283", "2549206", "16920387", "18495197", "18594092", "14207783", "16665464", "18024570", "16122424", "14975878", "611940", "10067955", "14847516", "17735383", "143428488", "17362856", "7349448", "11592520", "467663", "30461286", "16586874", "182573780", "15975307", "11479641", "16144039", "14638730", "9338901", "9407584", "198118990", "17218274", "24823941", "18529209", "28701384", "37469787", "207757300", "209459257", "7546858", "14591934", "8899848", "17013912", "2358468", "8391854", "9461858", "34472822", "17907083", "9038538", "56176406", "10799645", "15457660", "170078994", "30439037", "14474949", "4247866", "8239902", "3201197", "537701", "15892779", "14293014", "195254943", "12332219", "13037163", "19548629", "53646912", "11594781", "8941201", "13987062", "2649620", "15145390", "8031603", "27203151", "3363350", "210698372", "16905128", "29130140", "51922113", "136934", "14433321", "41152851", "569679", "62721709", "4507843", "11021779", "17811593", "16547250", "208615102", "208615102", "17230974", "13632969", "14831952", "18017109", "7117722", "13979157", "215423512", "7913732", "6436645", "858399", "1901095", "17981140", "2695317", "202747429", "20012668", "1993674", "833138", "17619428", "10682309", "14273316", "282260", "18628582", "4500260", "54865074", "9805362", "2815090", "51810309", "17775852", "13212736", "3056003", "9978380", "33230106", "1426492", "54498360", "10240161", "22000353", "1887226", "5087991", "6369679", "14294923", "1258408", "110877954", "18663848", "3523601", "15437990", "206793831", "12172196", "2702135", "736859", "950462", "208881100", "9181746", "5635696", "6461500", "13834160", "9999435", "17256290", "10553749", "2730381", "1620756", "17641589", "1461424", "8296490", "11262761", "214319176", "198968363", "16805697", "1713619", "901628", "18720131", "3163783", "1079173", "18979700", "16930015", "215544284", "16236716", "14332076", "195443370", "16200807", "16194376", "202700395", "10867063", "49551723", "59394449", "17859212", "206597741", "197642241", "199489895", "11781278", "10528017", "13486439", "18120600", "57200934", "888855", "2661869", "10302527", "3440695", "17005393", "17005393", "62736801", "18964573", "13061702", "2461679", "27315909", "1641547", "3061088", "96457638", "20008978", "36435020", "31204691", "16052627", "12977162", "12589297", "9755535", "262363", "9798125", "34133594", "2131231", "207852623", "24586707", "29124415", "55143030", "21555785", "53111569", "5777383", "1073613", "5450736", "16694575", "5326722", "11464708", "15168116", "28478043", "148565530", "14779543", "9496133", "35832524", "14819173", "2046047", "6083506", "15195437", "54922817", "51770215", "14686537", "4911134", "20854023", "9500923", "18335475", "8810735", "13982196", "13260754", "13641280", "18070677", "18086510", "15409991", "14843154", "14843154", "1569711", "11534109", "25085630", "12588098"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1171329"}

Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach for learning in distributed systems that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents, based on inductive logic programming techniques. The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data.

The goal of this work is to perform a comparison study between state-of-the-art imputation techniques and a Stacked Denoising Autoencoders approach.

To address this challenge, we propose an alternative GAN training procedure that naturally combines the two-step training procedure of GANs and the two-step training procedure of meta-learning algorithms. DAWSON is a plug-and-play framework that supports a broad family of meta-learning algorithms and various GANs with architectural-variants. Based on DAWSON, We also propose MUSIC MATINEE, which is the first few-shot music generation model. Our experiments show that MUSIC MATINEE could quickly adapt to new domains with only tens of songs from the target domains.

Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was measured (NIOX MINO). EBC pH was measured directly after sampling without deaeration, EBC 8- isoprostane was measured by ELISA (Cayman). Patterns of exhaled proteins and gasses were analysed by LC/MS or GC/MS to obtain a fingerprint of molecules which are indicative for the airway status. Results: Increased FeNO values were observed in the asthma group compared to the healthy controls (Mann-Whitney U test; p=0.057), and in the allergic asthmatic patients compared to the non-allergic asthmatic patients (p=0.01). EBC pH was significantly lower in the asthma group compared to healthy controls (p=0.047). EBC 8-isoprostane was comparable between children with asthma and healthy controls, but was significantly increased in allergic asthma patients compared to non-allergic patients (p=0.032). Various proteins that might be relevant in respiratory health outcomes were for the first time identified in EBC, amongst which annexin A1 and A2, calgranulin A and B, catalase, galectin-7, and prolactin-induced protein. Prediction models of selected proteolytic peptides or gasses were build (Support Vector Machine analysis) based on the health outcome asthma. Conclusion: Exhaled molecules are influenced by asthma or allergy status. This study identified new exhaled molecules that might be relevant for respiratory health.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "European Respiratory Journal", "mag_id": "2218263252", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:73844979"}

However, water demand introduces high levels of uncertainty in WDS hydraulic models. As a result, there is growing interest in developing accurate methodologies for water demand forecasting. Several mathematical models can serve this purpose. One crucial aspect is the use of suitable predictive variables. The most used predictive variables involve weather and social aspects. To improve the interrelation knowledge between water demand and various predictive variables, this study applies three algorithms, namely, classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and machine learning powerful algorithms such as Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and Random Forest (RF). We show that these last algorithms help corroborate the results found by PCA, while they are able to unveil hidden features for PCA, due to their ability to cope with nonlinearities.

ELMs are competing with Neural Networks as tools for solving pattern recognition and regression problem. A single ELM model is developed for credible contingencies for accurate and fast estimation of the voltage stability level at different loading conditions. Loading margin is taken as the indicator of voltage instability. Precontingency voltage magnitudes and phase angles at the load buses are taken as the input variables. The training data are obtained by running Continuation Power Flow (CPF) routine. The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through voltage stability assessment in IEEE 30-bus system.

Yet, as the eminent mathematical biologist Robert Rosen has pointed out, such control strategies are curiously absent from existing formal approaches to automatic control and decision-making processes.

Significant improvements in neural predictive computing when combined with the flexibility of fuzzy systems, supports the development of neurofuzzy anticipatory control architectures that integrate planning and control sequencing functions with feedback control algorithms.

Although many recent methods have been proposed for representation learning of HNs, there is still much room for improvement. Random walks based methods are currently popular methods to learn network embedding; however, they are random and limited by the length of sampled walks, and have difficulty capturing network structural information. Some recent researches proposed using meta paths to express the sample relationship in HNs. Another popular graph learning model, the graph convolutional network (GCN) is known to be capable of better exploitation of network topology, but the current design of GCN is intended for homogenous networks. This paper proposes a novel combination of meta-graph and graph convolution, the meta-graph based graph convolutional networks (MGCN). To fully capture the complex long semantic information, MGCN utilizes different meta-graphs in HNs. As different meta-graphs express different semantic relationships, MGCN learns the weights of different meta-graphs to make up for the loss of semantics when applying GCN. In addition, we improve the current convolution design by adding node self-significance. To validate our model in learning feature representation, we present comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets and two representation tasks: classification and link prediction. WMGCN\u2019s representations can improve accuracy scores by up to around 10% in comparison to other popular representation learning models.

Anomaly detection is particularly useful as an edge mining technique to reduce the transmission overhead in such a context when the frequently monitored activities contain only a sparse set of anomalies. This paper analyzes the potential overhead-savings of machine learning based anomaly detection models on the edge in three different IoT scenarios.

We prove that Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and Discriminant Analysis models can viably save time and energy on the edge device during data transmission. K-Nearest Neighbors, although reliable in terms of prediction accuracy, demands exorbitant overhead and results in net time and energy loss on the edge device.

We propose an explanation for transfer learning effects in human categorization, implementing a model from the statistical machine learning literature \u2013 the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) \u2013 to make empirical evaluations of its ability to explain these effects. We present two laboratory experiments which measure the degree to which people engage in transfer learning in a controlled setting, and we compare our model to their performance. We find that the HDP provides a good explanation for transfer learning exhibited by human learners.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ICML", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2102480623", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["145600408", "181433975", "123261211", "12565208", "2734422", "3054429", "142354856", "26166298", "5788356", "27148249", "8869524", "19021573", "118502441", "7888697", "9726859", "6009000", "17435620"], "inbound_citations": ["195984114", "18692341", "3407466", "16769207", "18205653", "10355177", "38954287", "14625311", "11169788", "59337606", "18262363", "34355592", "18910380", "17927435", "12594052", "53079841"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16325184"}

Length effects in reading were characterized at the neurobiological level by a significant and specific activity increase for pseudo-words as compared to words in the right lingual gyrus (BA 19), the left superior parietal lobule and precuneus (BA7), the left middle temporal gyrus (BA21) and the left cerebellum. The behavioral results suggest that polysyllabic pseudo-word reading mainly relies on an analytic procedure. At the biological level, additional activations in visual and visual attentional brain areas during long pseudo-word reading emphasize the role of visual and visual attentional processes in pseudo-word reading.

However, there are varieties of sensors for implementing human activity recognition with diverse capabilities and types of activities they provide best performances. Also, the diverse nature of human activities and nature in which they are performed by the individual makes them challenging to recognize. Therefore, determining the impact of these sensors in human activity recognition using machine learning techniques are of immense advantages in human activity monitoring and detection.

Secondly, we conducted a comprehensive experimental evaluation of sensor fusion attached on the same location and on different locations of the body. The extensive evaluation with 10-fold cross validation demonstrates that highest average F-measures for single sensor and fusion are 0.908 and 0.938 with Random Forest and Voting ensemble algorithms respectively. Furthermore, the fusion of heterogeneous sensors attached to different locations of the body shows Chest and Hip sensors fusion achieves an average F-measure of 0.942 and classification accuracy of 94.23% using Random Forest algorithm.

In this paper, we propose an instance-based approach to improve deep transfer learning in a target domain. Specifically, we choose a pre-trained model from a source domain and apply this model to estimate the influence of training samples in a target domain. Then we optimize the training data of the target domain by removing the training samples that will lower the performance of the pre-trained model. We later either fine-tune the pre-trained model with the optimized training data in the target domain, or build a new model which is initialized partially based on the pre-trained model, and fine-tune it with the optimized training data in the target domain. Using this approach, transfer learning can help deep learning models to capture more useful features.

It utilizes a progressive learning manner to discover knowledge by jointly exploiting the heterogeneous data structures from visual contents and user-provided tags of social images. The semantic structure in the textual space is expected to be well preserved while the problem of the noisy, incomplete or subjective tags is addressed by leveraging the visual structure in the original visual space. Besides, a sparse model with the ${\\ell _{2,1}}$ mixed norm is imposed on the transformation matrix of the first layer in the deep architecture to compress the noisy or redundant visual features. The proposed problem is formulated as an optimization problem with a well-defined objective function and a simple yet efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to solve it.

The real-world high-dimensional data typically lie on or near a certain unknown low-dimensional manifold (Data manifold) embedded in an ambient high-dimensional \u2018observation\u2019 space, so in this article we assume this Manifold assumption to be fulfilled.

Thiscontribution presents our recent advances in assessing di-mensional representations of emotion, such as arousal, ex-pectation, power, and valence, in an audiovisual human-computer interaction scenario. We propose a fully auto-matic multimodal recognition approach based on context-sensitive modeling of audio and video features. Evalua-tions on the Audiovisual Sub-Challenge of the 2011 Au-dio/Visual Emotion Challenge show how accurately dif-ferent affective dimensions can be recognized. Our ex-periments reveal that the proposed multimodal recognitionsystem outperforms previously introduced techniques eval-uated on the same task. 1 Introduction Since multimodal human-machine communication systemsthat not only take into account what the user says but alsohow the user communicates, are usually perceived as morenatural and more enjoyable to use, automatic emotion recog-nition is attracting more and more attention. Typically,audio and video channels can provide complementary in-formation and tend to improve recognition performance ifthey are used in a combined multimodal setup [1]. The ac-curacy of automatic emotion recognition heavily dependson the considered scenario: Acted, prototypical emotionsrecorded in a laboratory environment typically lead to highrecognition rates. Yet, \u2018second generation\u2019 AER systemsthat focus on realistic data have to face ambiguous non-prototypical emotions which lead to lower recognition ac-curacies. In this paper, we focus on the 2011 Audio/VisualEmotion Challenge (AVEC) [1] which was organized toprovide research teams with uni\ufb01ed training, developmentand test data sets that can be used to compare individual ap-proaches applying a de\ufb01ned test scenario and de\ufb01ned per-formance measures. The task was to classify two levels ofarousal, expectation, power, and valence from audiovisualdata as contained in the SEMAINE database [2]. Com-pared to rather \u2018friendly\u2019 test conditions as considered inthe early days of emotion recognition research, this sce-nario is exceedingly challenging and typically leads to re-sults from below chance-level accuracies to around 70%accuracy for a two-class task.As recognizer back-end, we apply so-called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks which tend to be bestsuited for long-range context modeling in emotion recog-nition [3]. Unlike conventional recurrent neural network(RNN) architectures, LSTM is able to incorporate an arbi-trary, self-learned amount of (long-range) context into thedecoding process by using memory blocks instead of con-ventional hidden neurons (see [3], for example). The audiofeature extraction front-end applied in our study is basedon our open-source toolkit openSMILE [4] which is ableto extract large sets of prosodic, spectral, and voice qualitylow-level descriptors (LLD) combined with various statis-tical functionals in real-time. Linguistic features, includ-ing non-linguistic vocalizations such as laughing, breath-ing, and sighing are extracted with an antomatic speechrecognition (ASR) engine optimized for emotional speechrecognition. In addition, we employ visual features gener-ated by our facial movement feature extractor.The proposed technique is evaluated on both the de-velopment set and the of\ufb01cial test set of the AudiovisualSub-Challenge. This allows us to compare our results withother methods proposed for this task, including context-free approaches such as Support Vector Machines (SVM).", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ITG Conference on Speech Communication", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2404838118", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["20004891", "3558736", "55073919", "59037320", "18871979"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33684513"}

{"paper_id": "52956516", "title": "Avoiding Communication in First Order Methods for Optimization", "authors": [{"first": "Aditya", "middle": [], "last": "Devarakonda", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Author(s): Devarakonda, Aditya | Advisor(s): Demmel, James W | Abstract: Machine learning has gained renewed interest in recent years due to advances in computer hardware (processing power and high-capacity storage) and the availability of large amounts of data which can be used to develop accurate, robust models. While hardware improvements have facilitated the development of machine learning models in a single machine, the analysis of large amounts of data still requires parallel computing to obtain shorter running times or where the dataset cannot be stored on a single machine.In addition to hardware improvements, algorithm redesign is also an important direction to further reduce running times. On modern computer architectures, the cost of moving data (communication) from main memory to caches in a single machine is orders of magnitude more expensive than the cost of performing floating-point operations (computation). On parallel machines the cost of moving data from one processor to another over an interconnection network is the most expensive operation. The large gap between computation and communication suggests that algorithm redesign should be driven by the goal of avoiding communication and, if necessary, decreasing communication at the expense of additional computation. Many problems in machine learning solve mathematical optimization problems which, in most non-linear and non-convex cases, requires iterative methods. This thesis is focused on deriving communication-avoiding variants of the block coordinate descent method, which is a first-order method that has strong convergence rates for many optimization problems. Block coordinate descent is an iterative algorithm which at each iteration samples a small subset of rows or columns of the input matrix, solves a subproblem using just the chosen rows or columns, and obtains a partial solution. This solution is then iteratively refined until the optimal solution is reached or until convergence criteria are met. In the parallel case, each iteration of block coordinate descent requires communication. Therefore, avoiding communication is key to attaining high performance. This thesis adapts well-known techniques from existing work on communication-avoiding (CA) Krylov and s-step Krylov methods. CA-Krylov methods unroll vector recurrences and rearrange the sequence of computation in way that defers communication for s iterations, where s is a tunable parameter. For CA-Krylov methods the reduction in communication cost comes at the expense of numerical instability for large values of s. We apply a similar recurrence unrolling technique to block coordinate descent in order to obtain communication-avoiding variants which solve the L2-regularized least-squares, L1-regularized least-squares, Support Vector Machines, and Kernel problems. Our communication-avoiding variants reduce the latency cost by a tunable factor of s at the expense of a factor of s increase in computational and bandwidth costs for the L2 and L1 least-squares and SVM problems. The CA-variants for these problems require additional computation and bandwidth in order to update the residual vector. For CA-kernel methods the computational and bandwidth costs do not increase. This is because the CA-variants of kernel methods can reuse elements of the kernel matrix already computed and therefore do not need to compute and communicate additional elements of the kernel matrix.Our experimental results illustrate that our new, communication-avoiding methods can obtain speedups of up to 6.1x on a Cray XC30 supercomputer using MPI for parallel processing. For CA-kernel methods we show modeled speedups of 26x, 120x, and 197x for MPI on a predicted Exascale system, Spark on a predicted Exascale system, and Spark on a cloud system, respectively. Furthermore we also experimentally confirm that our algorithms are numerically stable for large values of s.Finally, we also present an adaptive batch size technique which reduces the latency cost of training convolutional neural networks (CNN). With this technique we have achieved speedups of up to 6.25x when training CNNs on up to 4 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. Furthermore, we were able to train the ImageNet dataset using the ResNet-50 network with a batch size of up to 524,228 which would allow neural network training to attain a higher fraction of peak GPU performance than training with smaller batch sizes.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2891491149", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52956516"}

This study proposed a hybrid algorithm, based on Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and LSSVM, that consists of three algorithms; ABC-LSSVM, lvABC-LSSVM and cmABC-LSSVM. The lvABC algorithm is introduced to overcome the local optima problem by enriching the searching behaviour using Levy mutation.

Upon the completion of data collection and data pre processing, the eABC-LSSVM algorithm is designed and developed.

The ensemble nature of the model helps random forests outperform any individual decision tree. However, it also leads to a poor model interpretability, which significantly hinders the model from being used in fields that require transparent and explainable predictions, such as medical diagnosis and financial fraud detection. The interpretation challenges stem from the variety and complexity of the contained decision trees. Each decision tree has its unique structure and properties, such as the features used in the tree and the feature threshold in each tree node. Thus, a data input may lead to a variety of decision paths. To understand how a final prediction is achieved, it is desired to understand and compare all decision paths in the context of all tree structures, which is a huge challenge for any users.

The 2014\u20132015 highly pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreaks affecting California and other states in the United States have underscored the need for solutions to protect the US poultry industry against this devastating disease. We applied disease distribution models to predict where Avian influenza is likely to occur and the risk for HPAI outbreaks is highest. We used observations on the presence of Low Pathogenic Avian influenza virus (LPAI) in waterfowl or water samples at 355 locations throughout the state and environmental variables relevant to the disease epidemiology. We used two algorithms, Random Forest and MaxEnt, and two data-sets Presence-Background and Presence-Absence data. The models performed well (AUCc > 0.7 for testing data), particularly those using Presence-Background data (AUCc > 0.85). Spatial predictions were similar between algorithms, but there were large differences between the predictions with Presence-Absence and Presence-Background data. Overall, predictors that contributed most to the models included land cover, distance to coast, and broiler farm density. Models successfully identified several counties as high-to-intermediate risk out of the 8 counties with observed outbreaks during the 2014\u20132015 HPAI epizootics.

To overcome problems like this, deep neural networks have been proposed and presented great results in many tasks. Despite being able to work with more robust and high-level features, an issue with such deep approaches is the lack of data for training, given their huge amount of parameters. Transfer Learning emerged as an alternative to deal with such problem. In this work, we propose an accurate and efficient approach for face spoofing detection based on Transfer Learning, i.e., using the very deep VGG-Face network, previously trained on large face recognition datasets, to extract robust features of facial images from the Replay-Attack spoofing database. An SVM is trained based on the feature vectors extracted by VGG-Face from the training images of Replay database in order to detect spoofing.

The Random Forest (RF) technique was used to link the measured SOC concentrations to the FTIR-ATR measurements in order to identify the relevant absorbance bands explaining most of the variability in SOC. We then used linear regression (MLR) to predict SOC concentrations from the selected FTIR-ATR bands as independent proxy. This model showed a good predictive performance (r-squared=0.88; RSME=2.14; ME=0.05; RPD=3.14), indicating that SOC can be effectively estimated from the identified spectral bands. Finally, we used Partial Least Squares (PLS) to model the spatial distribution of the predictor bands using a number of environmental raster maps (climate, land use and geology) as covariates.

We built a framework for a complete workflow to experiment with multimodal sensor data ranging from recording (with Kinect 3D sensor), labeling, 3D signal processing, analysing and replaying. We also built three custom recognizers (automatic speech recognizer, 3D object recognizer and 3D gesture recognizer) to convert the raw sensor streams to decisions and feed this to the neural network using a late fusion strategy. We recorded 25 particpants performing 27 unique verbal and gestural interactions (intents) with objects and trained the neural network using a supervised strategy. We proved that the framework works by building a deep neural networks assisted speech recognizer that performs approximately 5% better with multimodal data at 20 dB SnR up to 61% better with multimodal data at -5 dB SnR while performing identical to the individual recognizer when fed a unimodal datastream. Analysis shows that performance gain in low acoustic noise is due to true fusion of classifer results while gain at high acoustic noise is due to absence of speech results as it cannot detect speech events anymore, while the gesture recognizer is not affected. The impact of this thesis is significant for computational linguists and computer vision researchers as it describes how practical issues with (real and) real-time data can be solved such as dealing with sensor noise, GPU offloading for computational performance, 3D object and hand tracking. The speech-, object- and gesture recognizers are not state-of-the-art and the small vocabulary with 27 unique phrases and 9 objects can be considered a preliminary experiment.

Pixel based location (row, column and diagonal wise pixel locations), Vertical and horizontal (Zoning division based pixel calculation) way of feature extraction techniques, Pixel location calculated through Axis based procedures and the concepts of calculating the pixel points (distinct pixels counted from rows and columns) were employed to extract the features from each selected character portions. Finally the most successful classifier Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been applied on the selected features to recognize the exact characters. 89% of accurate result was achieved when implemented those concepts on Tamil vowels and consonants.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2182606547", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["171085328", "17390275", "7785312", "17267560", "35394892", "1851868", "8028599"], "inbound_citations": ["157068190"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57096232"}

Motor neuroprosthesis based on electrical stimulation can be applied to induce restoration of motor function in paraplegic patients. Furthermore, electrical stimulation of such motor neuroprosthesis can be more efficiently managed and delivered if combined with powered exoskeletons that compensate the limited force in the stimulated muscles and bring additional support to the human body. Such hybrid overground gait therapy is likely to be more efficient to retrain the spinal cord in incomplete injuries than conventional, robotic or neuroprosthetic approaches. However, the control of bilateral joints is difficult due to the complexity, non-linearity and time-variance of the system involved. Also, the effects of muscle fatigue and spasticity in the stimulated muscles complicate the control task. Furthermore, a compliant joint actuation is required to allow for a cooperative control approach that is compatible with the assist-as-needed rehabilitation paradigm. These were direct motivations for this research. The overall aim was to generate the necessary knowledge to design a novel hybrid walking therapy with fatigue management for incomplete spinal cord injured subjects. Research activities were conducted towards the establishment of the required methods and (hardware and software) systems that required to proof the concept with a pilot clinical evaluation. Speciffically, a compressive analysis of the state of the art on hybrid exoskeletons revealed several challenges which were tackled by this dissertation. Firstly, assist-as-needed was implemented over the basis of a compliant control of the robotic exoskeleton and a closed-loop control of the neuroprosthesis. Both controllers are integrated within a hybrid-cooperative strategy that is able to balance the assistance of the robotic exoskeleton regarding muscle performance. This approach is supported on the monitoring of the leg-exoskeleton physical interaction. Thus the fatigue caused by neuromuscular stimulation was also subject of speciffic research. Experimental studies were conducted with paraplegic patients towards the establishment of an objective criteria for muscle fatigue estimation and management. The results of these studies were integrated in the hybrid-cooperative controller in order to detect and manage muscle fatigue while providing walking therapy. Secondly closed-loop control of the neuroprosthesis was addressed in this dissertation. The proposed control approach allowed to tailor the stimulation pattern regarding the speciffic residual motor function of the lower limb of the patient. In order to uncouple the closed-loop control from muscle performance monitoring, the hybrid-cooperative control approach implemented a sequential switch between closed-loop and open-loop control of the neuroprosthesis. Lastly, a comprehensive clinical evaluation protocol allowed to assess the impact of the hybrid walking therapy on the gait function of a sample of paraplegic patients. Results demonstrate that: 1) the hybrid controller adapts to patient residual function during walking, 2) the therapy is tolerated by patients, and 3) the walking function of patients was improved after participating in the study. In conclusion, the hybrid walking therapy holds potential for rehabilitate walking in motor incomplete paraplegic patients, guaranteeing further research on this topic. This dissertation is framed within two research projects: REHABOT (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, grant DPI2008-06772-C03-02) and HYPER (Hybrid Neuroprosthetic and Neurorobotic Devices for Functional Compensation and Rehabilitation of Motor Disorders, grant CSD2009-00067 CONSOLIDER INGENIO 2010). Within these research projects, cutting-edge research is conducted in the eld of hybrid actuation and control for rehabilitation of motor disorders. This dissertation constitutes proof-of concept of the hybrid walking therapy for paraplegic individuals for these projects. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2528098962", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3699277", "70160576", "3494797"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114988171"}

Given that vibration signals usually contain multiple temporal structures, this paper proposes a multiscale representation learning (MSRL) framework to learn useful features directly from raw vibration signals, with the aim to capture rich and complementary fault pattern information at different scales. In our proposed approach, a coarse-grained procedure is first employed to obtain multiple scale signals from an original vibration signal. Then, sparse filtering, a newly developed unsupervised learning algorithm, is applied to automatically learn useful features from each scale signal, respectively, and then the learned features at each scale to be concatenated one by one to obtain multiscale representations. Finally, the multiscale representations are fed into a supervised classifier to achieve diagnosis results.

The main challenges for accurate MR prostate localization lie in two aspects: (i) inhomogeneous and inconsistent appearances around the prostate boundary, and (ii) large variation of the prostate shapes across different patients. To tackle these two problems, we propose a new deformable MR prostate segmentation method by unifying deep feature learning with sparse patch matching. First, instead of directly using handcrafted features, we propose to learn the latent feature representation from prostate MR images by the stacked sparse auto-encoder (SSAE). Since the deep learning algorithm learns feature hierarchy from data, the learned features are often more concise and effective than the handcrafted features in describing the underlying data. To improve the discriminability of learned features, we further refine the learned feature representation in a supervised fashion. Second, based on the learned features, a sparse patch matching method is proposed to infer a prostate likelihood map by transferring the prostate labels from multiple atlases to the new prostate MR image. Finally, a deformable segmentation is used to integrate the sparse shape model with the prostate likelihood map for achieving the final segmentation. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the dataset containing 66 T2-wighted prostate MR images. Experimental results show that the deep-learned features are more effective than the handcrafted features in guiding MR prostate segmentation.

Social robots need to communicate with humans, which increased also the popularity of affective embodied models that adopt different emotional concepts in many everyday tasks. However, there is still a gap between the development of these solutions and the integration and development of a complex emotion appraisal system, which is much necessary for true social robots. In this paper, we propose a deep neural model which is designed in the light of different aspects of developmental learning of emotional concepts to provide an integrated solution for internal and external emotion appraisal. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model with different challenging corpora and compare it with state-of-the-art models for external emotion appraisal. To extend the evaluation of the proposed model, we designed and collected a novel dataset based on a Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenario. We deployed the model in an iCub robot and evaluated the capability of the robot to learn and describe the affective behavior of different persons based on observation. The performed experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive with the state of the art in describing emotion behavior in general.

Data mining methods from the field of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) have potential advantages for structural chemical data. In this paper we present Warmr, the first ILP data mining algorithm to be applied to chemoinformatic data. We illustrate the value of Warmr by applying it to a well studied database of chemical compounds tested for carcinogenicity in rodents. Data mining was used to find all frequent substructures in the database, and knowledge of these frequent substructures is shown to add value to the database. One use of the frequent substructures was to convert them into probabilistic prediction rules relating compound description to carcinogenesis. These rules were found to be accurate on test data, and to give some insight into the relationship between structure and activity in carcinogenesis. The substructures were also used to prove that there existed no accurate rule, based purely on atom-bond substructure with less than seven conditions, that could predict carcinogenicity. This results put a lower bound on the complexity of the relationship between chemical structure and carcinogenicity. Only by using a data mining algorithm, and by doing a complete search, is it possible to prove such a result. Finally the frequent substructures were shown to add value by increasing the accuracy of statistical and machine learning programs that were trained to predict chemical carcinogenicity.

Although fuzzy systems are focused on knowledge representation, they do not allow the estimation of membership functions. Conversely, neuronal networks use powerful learning techniques but they are not able to explain how results are obtained. Neurofuzzy systems benefit from both techniques by using training data to generate membership functions and by using fuzzy rules to represent expert knowledge. Moreover, contextual information is collected from a knowledge base. The complete solution that we propose is integrated in a GIS, enhancing it with proximity reasoning. From an application perspective, the proposed approach was used in the telecommunication domain and particularly in fiber optic monitoring systems. In such systems, a user needs to qualify the distance between a fiber break and the surrounding objects of the environment to optimize the assignment of emergency crews.

In the current investigation, we propose a new approach for representation of neural data for pattern analysis, namely a Mesh Learning Model. In this approach, at each time instant, a star mesh is formed around each voxel, such that the voxel corresponding to the center node is surrounded by its p-nearest neighbors. The arc weights of each mesh are estimated from the voxel intensity values by least squares method. The estimated arc weights of all the meshes, called Mesh Arc Descriptors (MADs), are then used to train a classifier, such as Neural Networks, k-Nearest Neighbor, Na\\\"ive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. The proposed Mesh Model was tested on neuroimaging data acquired via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a recognition memory experiment using categorized word lists, employing a previously established experimental paradigm (\\\"Oztekin & Badre, 2011).

After delineating the 12-lead ECG signals with a wavelet transform-based method, a unique set of characteristic points was obtained for the ECG leads by suppressing outliers and by taking the average of the remaining points. Then, mathematical operations (average, standard deviation, skewness, etc.) performed to the P wave duration, QRS complex duration, ST-T complex, QT interval, T wave duration and RR interval were used as temporal features, and mathematical operations performed to ECG signals bounded by the P wave, QRS complex, ST-T complex and QT interval were used as morphological features. A 10-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation was employed to analyze the reproducibility of the classification results by randomly splitting the dataset into training (70%) and test (30%) sets with balanced classes. Mean classification accuracies above 93% were achieved when the SVM classifier uses only temporal ECG features, only morphological ECG features, and both temporal and morphological ECG features.

However, in order to successfully learn those features, they usually require massive amounts of manually labeled data, which is both expensive and impractical to scale. Therefore, unsupervised semantic feature learning, i.e., learning without requiring manual annotation effort, is of crucial importance in order to successfully harvest the vast amount of visual data that are available today. In our work we propose to learn image features by training ConvNets to recognize the 2d rotation that is applied to the image that it gets as input. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that this apparently simple task actually provides a very powerful supervisory signal for semantic feature learning. We exhaustively evaluate our method in various unsupervised feature learning benchmarks and we exhibit in all of them state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, our results on those benchmarks demonstrate dramatic improvements w.r.t. prior state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised representation learning and thus significantly close the gap with supervised feature learning. For instance, in PASCAL VOC 2007 detection task our unsupervised pre-trained AlexNet model achieves the state-of-the-art (among unsupervised methods) mAP of 54.4% that is only 2.4 points lower from the supervised case. We get similarly striking results when we transfer our unsupervised learned features on various other tasks, such as ImageNet classification, PASCAL classification, PASCAL segmentation, and CIFAR-10 classification.

Positive class usually refers to the main interest of the classification task. Although conventional Support Vector Machine (SVM) results in relatively robust classification performance on imbalanced datasets, it treats all samples with the same importance leading to the decision surface biasing toward the negative class. To overcome this inherent drawback, Fuzzy SVM (FSVM) is proposed by applying fuzzy membership to training samples such that different samples provide different contributions to the classifier. However, how to evaluate an appropriate fuzzy membership is the main issue to FSVM. In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy membership evaluation which determines the fuzzy membership based on the class certainty of samples. That is, the samples with higher class certainty are assigned to larger fuzzy memberships. As the entropy is utilized to measure the class certainty, the fuzzy membership evaluation is named as entropy-based fuzzy membership evaluation. Therefore, the Entropy-based FSVM (EFSVM) is proposed by using the entropy-based fuzzy membership. EFSVM can pay more attention to the samples with higher class certainty, i.e. enhancing the importance of samples with high class certainty. Meanwhile, EFSVM guarantees the importance of the positive class by assigning positive samples to relatively large fuzzy memberships. The contributions of this work are: (1) proposing a novel entropy-based fuzzy membership evaluation method which enhances the importance of certainty samples, (2) guaranteeing the importance of the positive samples to result in a more flexible decision surface.

This assumption allows us to optimally identify the correlations between classes and features; such correlations are moreover shared across all models of the ensemble.

To minimize Hamming loss, we compute the marginal probability of the classes by running standard inference on each Bayesian network in the ensemble, and then pooling the inferences.

Since neither abdominal pain nor enzyme elevations are specific for acute pancreatitis (AP), and patients with RAP often have a normal appearing pancreas on CT after resolution of an AP episode, RAP diagnosis can be challenging. This study aims to determine if quantitative radiomic features of the pancreas on CT can differentiate patients with functional abdominal pain, RAP, and chronic pancreatitis (CP). Method Contrast enhanced CT abdominal images of adult patients evaluated in a pancreatitis clinic from 2010 to 2018 with the diagnosis of RAP, functional abdominal pain, or CP were retrospectively reviewed. The pancreas was outlined by drawing region of interest (ROI) on images. 54 radiomic features were extracted from each ROI and were compared between the patient groups. A one-vs-one Isomap and Support Vector Machine (IsoSVM) classifier was also trained and tested to classify patients into one of the three diagnostic groups based on their radiomic features. Results Among the study\u2019s 56 patients, 20 (35.7 %) had RAP, 19 (33.9 %) had functional abdominal pain, and 17 (30.4 %) had CP.

The classical experiment is to ask participants to judge the similarity between a face and chimeric faces made from the two left halves (left chimeric face) or the two right halves (right chimeric face) of the original face (from the viewer\u2019s perspective; Figure 1). The results show that the left chimeric face is usually judged more similar to the original face than the right chimeric face, especially for highly familiar faces (Brady, Campbell, & Flaherty, 2005). Consistent with this result, other studies have argued for a right hemisphere (RH) bias in face perception (e.g., Rossion, Joyce, Cottrell, & Tarr, 2003). Nevertheless, it remains unclear how far the split effect extends. Although it has been shown that our visual system is organized as a set of hierarchically connected regions, and the receptive field sizes of the neurons increase by a factor of about 2.5 at each succeeding stage (Rolls, 2000), the initial trajectory of visual activation flow is a fast and widespread sweep and continues through iterations of feedback loops for further processing in the sensory area (Foxe & Simpson, 2002); hence, it is unclear yet whether the split influences high-level cognition. In visual word recognition, Hsiao and Shillcock (2005a) showed that this split effect can reach far enough to interact with sex differences in brain laterality for phonological processing. Thus, the split seems to influence high-level cognition. Abstract Anatomical evidence shows that our visual field is initially split along the vertical axis and contralaterally projected to different hemispheres. It remains unclear at which stage the split information converges. In the current study, we applied the Double Filtering by Frequency (DFF) theory (Ivry & Robertson, 1998) to modeling the visual split; the theory assumes a right hemisphere/low frequency bias. We compared three cognitive architectures with different timing of convergence and examined their cognitive plausibility to account for the left side bias effect in face perception observed in human data. We show that the early convergence model failed to show the left side bias effect. The left side bias effect was also observed in Greeble recognition. The modeling hence suggests that the convergence may take place at an intermediate or late stage, at least after information has been extracted/transformed separately in the two hemispheres; it also provides testable predictions about whether the left side bias effect may also be observed in (expertise-level) object recognition. Keywords: Connectionist modeling; hemispheric differences; split modeling. face recognition; Introduction Because of the partial decussation of optic nerves, our visual system is initially vertically split and the two visual hemifields are initially contralaterally projected to different hemispheres. A fundamental question in cognitive science is whether this initial split has any functional significance; that is, whether the effect of initial splitting can extend far enough to influence our cognition? A second question is at what stage does the information converge? Figure 1: Left chimeric, original, and right chimeric faces. A functional split Split modeling & timing of convergence Evidence from visual word recognition supports a functional split. The general finding is that the two hemispheres have contralateral influence on responses driven by the first and last halves of the stimuli, which are initially projected to different visual hemifields (e.g., Lavidor, Ellis, Shillcock, & Bland, 2001; Lavidor & Walsh, 2003; Hsiao & Shillcock, 2005a; Hsiao, Shillcock, & Lavidor, 2006). There is also evidence from face recognition supporting a functional split. For example, a left side bias effect has been frequently In order to address the splitting effects observed in visual word recognition, Shillcock and Monaghan (2001) proposed a split fovea model (Figure 2) and showed that some psychological phenomena in visual word recognition can be better accounted for by the split architecture, such as exterior letter effects in English word recognition and eye fixation behavior in reading English (Shillcock, Monaghan, & Ellison, 2000). Hsiao and Shillcock (2005b) further showed that the split and nonsplit architectures in modeling", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2765197487", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14250598", "9504895", "9234219", "10301716", "13003505", "6442205", "1590696", "210555121", "1266405", "42339556", "9951662", "748094", "146421927", "64834404", "6844697", "707975", "13161091", "15757187", "22218635"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15822101"}
