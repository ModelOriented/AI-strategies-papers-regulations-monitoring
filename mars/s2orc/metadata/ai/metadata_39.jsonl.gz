Because current experimental structure determination methods carry a high price tag, computational predictions are highly desirable. Given a protein sequence, computational methods produce numerous 3D structures known as decoys. Selection of the best quality decoys is both challenging and essential as the end users can handle only a few ones. Therefore, scoring functions are central to decoy selection. They combine measurable features into a single number indicator of decoy quality. Unfortunately, current scoring functions do not consistently select the best decoys. Machine learning techniques offer great potential to improve decoy scoring. This paper presents two machine-learning based scoring functions to predict the quality of proteins structures, i.e., the similarity between the predicted structure and the experimental one without knowing the latter. We use different metrics to compare these scoring functions against three state-of-the-art scores. This is a first attempt at comparing different scoring functions using the same non-redundant dataset for training and testing and the same features. The results show that adding informative features may be more significant than the method used.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28113636", "doi": "10.1109/TCBB.2016.2602269", "venue": "TCBB", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2517375182", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1835995", "44577703", "8856710", "15770366", "18557296", "17161652", "25512709", "36252197", "60352732", "15367741", "20055649", "14218941", "21557001", "14342590", "7693920", "28796090", "36923082", "8102990", "97383637", "12199938", "9576280", "28678522", "5871712", "2869315", "10390433", "22771553", "45534628", "14767868", "1788613", "31716330", "39021189", "60452768", "205939", "1046577"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13466455"}

As a capital-technology-intensive project, it has high requirements for power substation project management. Accurate cost forecasting can help to reduce the project cost, improve the investment efficiency, and optimize project management. However, affected by many factors, the construction cost of a power substation project usually presents strong nonlinearity and uncertainty, which make it difficult to accurately forecast the cost. This paper presents a new hybrid substation project cost forecasting method called PCA-PSO-SVM model, which is a support vector machine (SVM) model optimized by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with principal component analysis (PCA). In this intelligent prediction model, the PCA method is introduced to reduce the data dimension. Furthermore, the PSO algorithm is used to optimize the model parameters. In the example, 65 sets of substation construction data are input into PCA-PSO-SVM model for construction cost prediction, and the prediction results are compared with other prediction methods to verify the forecasting accuracy. The results show that the MAPE and RMSE of the PCA-PSO-SVM model is 6.21% and 3.62, respectively.

We argue that the generalization capability of learned features depends on what image neighborhood size is sufficient to discriminate different image transformations: The larger the required neighborhood size and the more global the image statistics that the feature can describe. An accurate description of global image statistics allows to better represent the shape and configuration of objects and their context, which ultimately generalizes better to new tasks such as object classification and detection. This suggests a criterion to choose and design image transformations. Based on this criterion, we introduce a novel image transformation that we call limited context inpainting (LCI). This transformation inpaints an image patch conditioned only on a small rectangular pixel boundary (the limited context). Because of the limited boundary information, the inpainter can learn to match local pixel statistics, but is unlikely to match the global statistics of the image. We claim that the same principle can be used to justify the performance of transformations such as image rotations and warping. Indeed, we demonstrate experimentally that learning to discriminate transformations such as LCI, image warping and rotations, yields features with state of the art generalization capabilities on several datasets such as Pascal VOC, STL-10, CelebA, and ImageNet.

Methods: The MLR, ANN, and SVM models were developed to predict metabolizable energy (ME) content of compound feeds for pigs based on the German energy evaluation system from analyzed contents of crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), crude fibre (CF), and starch. A total of 290 datasets from standardized digestibility studies with compound feeds was provided from several institutions and published papers and ME was calculated thereon. Accuracy and precision of developed models were evaluated given their produced prediction values. Results: The results revealed that the developed ANN (R2= 0.95; root mean square error= 0.19 MJ/kg of dry matter) and SVM (R2= 0.95; root mean square error= 0.21 MJ/kg of dry matter) models produced better prediction values in estimating ME in compound feed than those produced by conventional MLR (R2= 0.89; root mean square error= 0.27 MJ/kg of dry matter). Conclusion: The developed ANN and SVM models produced better prediction values in estimating ME in compound feed than those produced by conventional MLR, however, there were not obvious differences between performance of ANN and SVM models. Thus, SVM model may also be considered as a promising tool for modeling the relationship between chemical composition and ME of compound feeds for pigs.

One of the current technologies being applied in recent years is the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for mapping purposes. The use of UAV is widespread in various fields because it is low cost, has high resolution and is able to fly at low altitude without the constraints of cloudy weather. Typically, the method of data extraction for UAV in Malaysia is still very limited and the traditional methods are still being implemented by some industries. The features from aerial photo orthomosaic are manually detected and digitised from visual interpretation for the mapping purposes. Unfortunately, these methods are tedious, expensive, consume much time, and may involve much fieldwork, to acquire only a limited information. Pixel-based technique is often used to extract low level features where the image is classified according to the spectral information where the pixels in the overlapping region will be misclassified due to the confusion among the classes. The supervised object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification technique is widely used nowadays for automatic data extraction. Therefore, the general objective of this study is to assess the capability of UAV with high resolution data for image classifications. The pixel-based and OBIA classifications were compared using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The classifications were assessed using different numbers of sample size.

We propose a model for generating sentences from keywords using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) composed of a generator and a discriminator among these artificial neural networks. Specifically, the generator uses the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Encoder-Decoder structure, and the discriminator uses the bi-directional LSTM with self-attention. Also, the keyword for input to the encoder of the generator is input together with two words similar to oneself. This method contributes to the creation of sentences containing words that have similar meanings to the keyword.

Therefore in recent years research towards identifying and semantically labeling the environments based on onboard sensors for mobile robots has been gaining popularity. After the era of heuristic and rule-based approaches, supervised learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and AdaBoost have been extensively used for this purpose showing satisfactory performance. With the introduction of graphical models, approaches like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) which take the advantage of connectivity of samples provide more flexibility to capture complex dependencies. In this paper, we focus on a real-world task which challenges the generalization ability of the model, evaluate some graph based features, propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm by iteratively utilizing the results from SVM and CRF, and suggest a solution for CRF parameter estimation with partially labeled training data. Experiments have been conducted on six real-world indoor environments demonstrating the competence of the algorithm.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICARCV.2012.6485266", "venue": "2012 12th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV)", "journal": "2012 12th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2017669754", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9947570", "15628170", "11439563", "35340684", "18578126", "5756966", "1894060", "8981812", "63035419", "961425", "10703250", "125577081", "9570040", "117872175", "1978101", "119848563", "11031306", "207228399"], "inbound_citations": ["22068285", "20387906", "201678512"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14492401"}

These algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement tasks and certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing information from which such estimates could be computed. Specific examples of such algorithms are presented, some of which bear a close relationship to certain existing algorithms while others are novel but potentially interesting in their own right. Also given are results that show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with backpropagation. We close with a brief discussion of a number of additional issues surrounding the use of such algorithms, including what is known about their limiting behaviors as well as further considerations that might be used to help develop similar but potentially more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi":

Learning of Chinese characters and tone adaption are both essential and hard tasks for non-native speakers. The frequent terms, defined in morphosyntatic particle \uff02De\uff02 with three characters {\u7684, \u5f97, \u5730}, is hard to learn for foreign learners due to the similar pronunciation and meaning. This investment illustrates a data-driven algorithm to classify the usages about the morphosyntatic particle \uff02De\uff02 in Chinese learning. Rule induction is one of the most important techniques to learn the knowledge from data. Since regularities hidden in data are frequently expressed in terms of rules, rule induction is one of the fundamental tools for natural language processing and obtains a significant improvement in character selection. By the automatic rule induction process, 32 rules are adopted here to classify the character usage in morphosyntatic particle \uff02De.\uff02 According to the experimental results, we find the proposed method can provide good enough performance to classify the character usages for morphosyntatic particle \uff02De.\uff02", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": "O15-2005", "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "IJCLCLP", "journal": "IJCLCLP", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2463842393", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["143412816", "16099120", "19005325", "36357521", "7457315", "62178364", "62715778", "2059398", "62643469", "9292081", "60893852", "37387425", "61448238", "29359467", "15120627", "55524984", "143112144", "62764350", "60266361"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18977200"}

Among the known methods for GES, only Neural Gastric Electrical Stimulation (NGES) provides direct control of contractility without utilizing the spontaneously existing gastric electrical activity as an intermediary. However, only one of the established GES techniques, gastric pacing, has been described to produce retrograde peristalsis for delaying gastric emptying. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of producing retrograde peristalsis using either single electrode set or dual electrode set NGES. Methods: 8 anesthetized dogs underwent laparotomy and implantation of 2 circumferential electrode sets approximately 3 cm and 7 cm proximal to the pylorus, respectively. Single-set and dual-set NGES sessions were repeatedly administered using a custom-designed implantable neurostimulator. Gastric motility patterns were captured using 3 force transducers implanted on the anterior gastric wall along the gastric axis. Motility indices and velocities were employed to quantify the produced contractile patterns. Results: Both single-set and dual-set NGES produced circumferential lumen-occluding contractions in the vicinity of the electrode sets. The invoked contractions propagated proximally in a retrograde fashion. The propagation scope was different depending on the number of electrode sets used. Different velocities of the invoked retrograde contractions associated with single- and dual-set NGES were observed and quantified. Contractility patterns reflected by the normalized motility indices were very similar regardless of the electrode stimulation technique. Conclusion: Pre-pyloric NGES can produce controlled retrograde peristalsis and serve as another avenue for the treatment of obesity.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "16608619", "doi": "10.1381/096089206776327422", "venue": "Obesity surgery", "journal": "Obesity surgery", "mag_id": "2136661739", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["560987", "12478454", "22312978", "22312978", "29053417", "8790072", "206879619", "8594218"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35849357"}

Circulating miRNAs have also emerged as promising diagnostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. In this study, we investigated the performance of a specific signature of miRNA in plasma samples to design a robust predictive model that can distinguish healthy individuals from those with CRC or advanced adenomas (AA) diseases. METHODS: Case control study of 297 patients from 8 Spanish centers including 100 healthy individuals, 101 diagnosed with AA, and 96 CRC cases. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription was used to quantify a signature of miRNA (miRNA19a, miRNA19b, miRNA15b, miRNA29a, miRNA335, and miRNA18a) in plasma samples. Binary classifiers (Support Vector Machine [SVM] linear, SVM radial, and SVM polynomial) were built for the best predictive model. RESULTS: Area under receiving operating characteristic curve of 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.871\u20130.962) was obtained retrieving a model with a sensitivity of 0.85 and specificity of 0.90, positive predictive value of 0.94, and negative predictive value of 0.76 when advanced neoplasms (CRC and AA) were compared with healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We identified and validated a signature of 6 miRNAs (miRNA19a, miRNA19b, miRNA15b, miRNA29a, miRNA335, and miRNA18a) as predictors that can differentiate significantly patients with CRC and AA from those who are healthy.

It is shown that the conventional HMMs are equivalent to linear recurrent networks (LRNs) with time varying weights. Inspired by the nonlinear nature of nodes in the neural networks, nonlinearity is introduced into the HMMs. Accordingly, a connectionist training approach is proposed to train such nonlinear HMMs. The training is discriminative when the objective function is defined as the mutual information between the observed event and the Markov model. The introduction of nonlinearity allows one to view the HMMs in a broader perspective. For instance, the normalizing of forward probability can be interpreted as a kind of nonlinearity in a nonlinear HMM. The proposed training algorithm has been tested on a speaker-dependent isolated digit recognition problem; this test demonstrated that the discriminative power of the HMMs can be enhanced. >", "year": 1991, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170645", "venue": "[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks", "journal": "[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks", "mag_id": "1665646464", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["18227952"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59105273"}

Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machine (S3VM) is a powerful semi-supervised learning model. However, the high computational cost and non-convexity severely impede the S3VM method in large-scale applications. Although several learning algorithms were proposed for S3VM, scaling up S3VM is still an open problem. To address this challenging problem, in this paper, we propose a new incremental learning algorithm to scale up S3VM (IL-S3VM) based on the path following technique in the framework of Difference of Convex (DC) programming. The traditional DC programming based algorithms need multiple outer loops and are not suitable for incremental learning, and traditional path following algorithms are limited to convex problems. Our new IL-S3VM algorithm based on the path-following technique can directly update the solution of S3VM to converge to a local minimum within one outer loop so that the efficient incremental learning can be achieved. More importantly, we provide the finite convergence analysis for our new algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, our new IL-S3VM algorithm is the first efficient path following algorithm for a non-convex problem (i.e., S3VM) with local minimum convergence guarantee. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark datasets not only confirm the finite convergence of IL-S3VM, but also show a huge reduction of computational time compared with existing batch and incremental learning algorithms, while retaining the similar generalization performance.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3219819.3220092", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2809245559", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["37925315", "12601634", "1603238", "239378", "10125108", "14283441", "156548", "207981936", "14237474", "11065690", "4908820", "1352566", "1600289", "18128945", "9226809", "60807858", "2200984", "9542688"], "inbound_citations": ["196202208", "198953334", "209460772"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:50779262"}

Interval numbers generally can be used for the representation of real data. In this version, SVM with interval samples is presented and reformulation of SVM performs real sample classification. Here, ISVM could be interchanged with an interval quadratic programming problem which itself can be converted to a pair of the so-called two-level mathematical programs based on norm concepts.

These concepts can be studied using objective and subjective measures. In this study, we created two indices: a composite healthcare accessibility index (CHCA) and a composite healthcare satisfaction index (CHCS). To calculate the CHCA index we used three indicators based on three components of multidimensional healthcare accessibility: availability, acceptability and accessibility. In the indicator based on the component of accessibility, we included an innovative perceived time-decay parameter. The three indicators of the CHCA index were weighted through the application of a principal components analysis. To calculate the CHCS index, we used three indicators: the waiting time after the patient arrives at the healthcare service, the quality of the healthcare, and the healthcare service supply. These three indicators making up the CHCA index were weighted by applying an analytical hierarchy process. Three kinds of regressions were subsequently applied in order to explain the CHCA and CHCS indices: namely the Linear Least Squares, Ordinal Logistic, and Random Forests regressions. In these regressions, we used different independent social and health-related variables. These variables represented the predisposing, enabling, and need factors of people\u00b4s behaviors related to healthcare.

Results showed that there are health-related inequalities in regard to healthcare accessibility and healthcare satisfaction in our study area.

However, how to efficiently represent graph data in a general way is still an open problem. Traditional methods use handcraft graph features in a tabular form but suffer from the defects of domain expertise requirement and information loss. Graph representation learning overcomes these defects by automatically learning the continuous representations from graph structures, but they require abundant training labels, which are often hard to fulfill for graph-level prediction problems. In this work, we demonstrate that, if available, the domain expertise used for designing handcraft graph features can improve the graph-level representation learning when training labels are scarce.

This makes it orders of magnitude faster than conventional maximum likelihood learning for CRFs that require repeated runs of probabilistic inference. At the same time, the models learned by our method still allow for joint inference at test time. We apply LS-CRF to the task of semantic image segmentation, showing that it is highly efficient, even for loopy models where probabilistic inference is problematic.

In this vast amount of data much valuable knowledge is available, yet it is hidden. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a state-of-the-art classification technique that generally provides accurate models, as it is able to capture non-linearities in the data. However, this strength is also its main weakness, as the generated non-linear models are typically regarded as incomprehensible black-box models. By extracting rules that mimic the black box as closely as possible, we can provide some insight into the logics of the SVM model. This explanation capability is of crucial importance in any domain where the model needs to be validated before being implemented, such as in credit scoring (loan default prediction) and medical diagnosis. If the SVM is regarded as the current state-of-the-art, SVM rule extraction can be the state-of-the-art of the (near) future. This chapter provides an overview of recently proposed SVM rule extraction techniques, complemented with the pedagogical Artificial Neural Network (ANN) rule extraction techniques which are also suitable for SVMs. Issues related to this topic are the different rule outputs and corresponding rule expressiveness; the focus on high dimensional data as SVM models typically perform well on such data; and the requirement that the extracted rules are in line with existing domain knowledge. These issues are explained and further illustrated with a credit scoring case, where we extract a Trepan tree and a RIPPER rule set from the generated SVM model. The benefit of decision tables in a rule extraction context is also demonstrated.

NMR-based urine analysis followed by multivariate data analysis (metabonomics) identifies efficiently differences between toxic and non-toxic compounds; but in most cases multiple administrations of the test compound are necessary. We tested the feasibility of detecting proximal tubule kidney toxicity and phospholipidosis with metabonomics techniques after single compound administration as an early safety pharmacology approach. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Rats were treated orally, intravenously, inhalatively or intraperitoneally with different test compounds. Urine was collected at 0-8 h and 8-24 h after compound administration, and (1)H NMR-patterns were recorded from the samples. Variation of post-processing and feature extraction methods led to different views on the data. Support Vector Machines were trained on these different data sets and then aggregated as experts in an Ensemble. Finally, validity was monitored with a cross-validation study using a training, validation, and test data set. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Proximal tubule kidney toxicity could be predicted with reasonable total classification accuracy (85%), specificity (88%) and sensitivity (78%).

However, most patients tend not to rate doctors' performance, therefore, it is imperative to develop a model to make doctor's performance evaluation automatic. When evaluating doctors' performance, we rate it into a score label that is as close as possible to the true one. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: This study aims to perform automatic doctor's performance evaluation from online textual consultations between doctors and patients by way of a novel machine learning method. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We propose a solution that models doctor's performance evaluation as an ordinal regression problem. In doing so, a support vector machine combined with an ordinal partitioning model (SVMOP), along with an innovative predictive function will be developed to capture the hidden preferences of the ordering labels over doctor's performance evaluation. When engineering the basic text features, eight customized features (extracted from over 70,000 medical entries) were added and further boosted by the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Real data sets from one of the largest mobile doctor/patient communication platforms in China are used in our study. Statistically, 64% of data on mHealth platforms lack the evaluation labels from patients. Experimental results reveal that our approach can support an automatic doctor performance evaluation. Compared with other auto-evaluation models, SVMOP improves mean absolute error (MAE) by 0.1, mean square error (MSE) by 0.5, pairwise accuracy (PAcc) by 5%; the suggested customized features improve MAE by 0.1, MSE by 0.2, PAcc by 3%. After boosting, performance is further improved. Based on SVMOP, predictive features like politeness and sentiment words can be mined, which can be further applied to guide the development of mHealth platforms. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The initial modelling of doctor performance evaluation is an ordinal regression problem. Experiments show that the performance of our proposed model with revised prediction function is better than many other machine learning methods on MAE, MSE, as well as PAcc.

However, in a 24-hour intelligent surveillance system, the visible cameras may be noneffective at night. In this situation, thermal cameras are the best supplemental components, which capture images without depending on visible light. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the visible-thermal cross-modality person re-identification (VT Re-ID) problem. In VT Re-ID, there are two knotty problems should be well handled, cross-modality discrepancy and intra-modality variations. To address these two issues, we propose focusing on enhancing the discriminative feature learning (EDFL) with two extremely simple means from two core aspects, (1) skip-connection for mid-level features incorporation to improve the person features with more discriminability and robustness, and (2) dual-modality triplet loss to guide the training procedures by simultaneously considering the cross-modality discrepancy and intra-modality variations. Additionally, the two-stream CNN structure is adopted to learn the multi-modality sharable person features. The experimental results on two datasets show that our proposed EDFL approach distinctly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins, demonstrating the effectiveness of our EDFL to enhance the discriminative feature learning for VT Re-ID.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1907.09659", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2020.01.089", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2963917162,3004021322", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["26348494", "4386388", "2177856", "59249030", "51604787", "59249427", "206594692", "29151743", "1396647", "3920676", "6628106", "195908774", "3458516", "67788589", "6523475", "3351302", "29856799", "206592766", "15019293", "1068496", "10013306", "1023605", "52953066", "4591954", "897596", "128356924", "4796796", "14832335", "19231802", "51607387", "3960646", "13599403"], "inbound_citations": ["212633929", "211553567"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198179608"}

Pathologists manually identify mitotic figures from a few thousand slide images for each patient to determine the grade of the cancer. Mitotic figures are hard to identify as the appearance of the mitotic cells change at different phases of mitosis. So, the manual cancer grading is not only a tedious job but also prone to observer variability.

This paper proposes the analysis of the use of Active Appearance Models (AAMs) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers in the recognition of human facial emotion and emotion intensity levels. AAMs are known as a tool for statistical modeling of object shape/appearance or for precise object feature detection. In our case, we examine their properties as a technique for feature extraction. We analyze the influence of various facial feature data types (shape/texture/combined AAM parameter vectors) and the size of facial images on the final classification accuracy. Then, approaches to proper C-SVM classifiers (RBF kernel) training parameter adjustment are described. Moreover, an alternative way of classification accuracy evaluation using the human visual system as a reference point is discussed. Unlike the usual to the approach evaluation of recognition algorithms (based on comparison of final classification accuracies), the proposed evaluation schema is independent of the testing set parameters, such as number, age and gender of subjects or the intensity of their emotions.

However, different ambient temperatures result in various current\u2013voltage characteristics, meaning that the i.i.d. assumption is violated. To improve the estimation accuracy, a field-support vector regression soft sensor is proposed to estimate the irradiance levels from photovoltaic (PV) electrical characteristics.

Those detected hotspots not only address spatiotemporal variations, but also largely alleviate the sparsity of the GTSM data. With the detected hotspots, CrossMap then jointly embeds all spatial, temporal, and textual units into the same space using two different strategies: one is reconstruction-based and the other is graph-based. Both strategies capture the correlations among the units by encoding their co-occurrence and neighborhood relationships, and learn low-dimensional representations to preserve such correlations.

Moreover, it is necessary to have sound theoretical properties for the multicategory classifiers. In the literature, there exist several different versions of simultaneous multicategory Support Vector Machines (SVMs). However, the computation of the SVM can be difficult for large scale problems, especially for problems with large number of classes. Furthermore, the SVM cannot produce class probability estimation directly. In this article, we propose a novel efficient multicategory composite least squares classifier (CLS classifier), which utilizes a new composite squared loss function.

Objective We established and characterized patient-derived conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs) to assess their biological properties and to apply these to test the efficacies of drugs. Design, setting, and participants CRCs were established from seven patient samples with disease ranging from primary PCa to advanced castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). The CRCs were characterized by genomic, transcriptomic, protein expression, and drug profiling. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis The phenotypic quantification of the CRCs was done based on immunostaining followed by image analysis with Advanced Cell Classifier using Random Forest supervised machine learning. Copy number aberrations (CNAs) were called from whole-exome sequencing and transcriptomics using in-house pipelines. Dose-response measurements were used to generate multiparameter drug sensitivity scores using R-statistical language. Results and limitations We generated six benign CRC cultures which all had an androgen receptor-negative, basal/transit-amplifying phenotype with few CNAs. In three-dimensional cell culture, these cells could re-express the androgen receptor. The CRCs from a CRPC patient (HUB.5) displayed multiple CNAs, many of which were shared with the parental tumor. We carried out high-throughput drug-response studies with 306 emerging and clinical cancer drugs. Using the benign CRCs as controls, we identified the Bcl-2 family inhibitor navitoclax as the most potent cancer-specific drug for the CRCs from a CRPC patient. Other drug efficacies included taxanes, mepacrine, and retinoids. Conclusions Comprehensive cancer pharmacopeia-wide drug testing of CRCs from a CRPC patient highlighted both known and novel drug sensitivities in PCa, including navitoclax, which is currently being tested in clinical trials of CRPC.

This quality scale contains 5 ranks ordered from 1 (the worst quality) to 5 (the best quality). To evaluate the quality of images, a feature vector containing visual attributes describing images content is constructed. Then, a classification process is performed to provide the final quality class of the considered image. Finally, once a quality class is associated to the considered image, a specific SVM regression is performed to score its quality. Obtained results are compared to the one obtained applying classical Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA) algorithms to judge the efficiency of the proposed method.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.image.2012.01.002", "venue": "Signal Process.

In the present article, we employ various state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks for detecting and recognizing faces of cartoon characters along with proposing a novel approach to cartoon face recognition. For face detection, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of the Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Network (MTCNN) architecture and contrasts it with other benchmark methods. For face recognition, we present two feature-based techniques: (i) an Inductive transfer approach combining the feature learning capability of the Inception v3 network and feature recognizing capability of Support Vector Machines (SVM), (ii) a proposed Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN) based recognition framework trained over a fusion of pixel values and 15 manually located facial key points. All the methods are evaluated on the Cartoon Faces in the Wild (IIIT-CFW) database. We show a detailed analysis of the performance of the models using several metrics over a number of input constraints. Experiments show that the MTCNN based model results in a respective gain of 3.97%, 1.19% and 2.78% on the True positive rate, False positive rate and False negative rate over the state-of-the-art detection method while both the recognition models surpass the state-of-the-art in terms of F-score.

Remote sensing metrics were developed to represent baseline forest health conditions and drought stress using time series of MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) and a water index.

Often many real-life applications such as healthcare systems or financial organizations distribute data over many data centers and these data centers may have a different privacy policy. The joint decision over this dataset while not sharing the local information of the data centers is a must and becomes a challenging problem. The State-of-the-art method mainly relies on cryptographic technique to ensure the privacy for data communication between the data centers. This technique alone is not suitable for the large-scale geo-distributed datasets as this is designed for small-scale systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to achieve privacy-preserving SVM algorithm where the training set is distributed and each partition can contain large-scale data. We utilize the traditional SVM model to train the dataset of local data centers and with a few parameters sent by those training models, a centralized machine calculates the final result.

To investigate the efficacy of these models, we present a case study using Coffea arabica L. species in Ethiopia as there was no species distribution modelling that has been done at a local scale especially in the coffee growing areas. We made predictions on 75% subsets and validation on 25% of the 112 presence of the species records that were collected from field observation and 0.5 m spatial resolution of true colour aerial photographs. Twelve biophysical explanatory variables; climatic, remote sensing based and landscape variables were employed in modelling. The results show that MaxEnt with pseudo absence data and SVM with background absence have highest area of understory coffee presence prediction with 12.2% and 23.1% area coverage of indigenous forest, respectively. The result from the model performance test using True Positive Rate (TPR) shows that GLM and SVM with pseudo absence data performed highest (TPR = 0.821).

Dynamic neural networks, as a class of modeling approaches, have been intensively explored in recent decades for solving linear equations. The time-varying nature of this problem and the noisy workspace for many engineering practice require two features of practical design: 1) fast convergence in time and 2) robustness against noises and disturbance. Existing solutions usually decouple the problem into two steps by designing a fast-convergent neural controller and then topped with an additional low-pass filter to reach noise robustness. However, due to the interplay of the mentioned two dynamical parts, the overall system may lose stability if the parameters are not well tuned. In this paper, we establish the first dynamical neural model for simultaneously achieving fast-convergence, particularly finite-time convergence, and noise-robustness, with the capability to reject the unknown noise when it is constant or varies slowly. To do so, a superior design formula activated by noise-tolerant nonlinear functions is proposed to enhance the capability of zeroing neural networks (ZNNs), achieving denoising and finite-time convergence in a unified design. According to this design formula, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) with finite-time convergence and inherently noise-suppression performance [thus termed the finite-time robust RNN (FTRRNN)] is developed and applied to robotic motion tracking illustrated via time-varying linear equation system solving. Furthermore, theoretical analyses on the global stability, the finite-time convergence and the denoising ability of the proposed design formula and the corresponding FTRRNN model are presented in details. The upper bound on the convergence time is also analytically derived. A numerical example is supplied to verify the superior property of the FTRRNN model to the ZNN model according to the results of computing time-varying linear equation system in the presence of additive noises. Finally, an application to robotic motion tracking is presented to show that the presented FTRRNN model can successfully realize the ellipse-path tracking control of a planar two-link manipulator in front of the external disturbances, while the conventional ZNN model fails under the same conditions.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSMC.2018.2870489", "venue": null, "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics", "mag_id": "2895670123", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["73438730", "208280146", "195760676", "86594318"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125101300"}

Motion capture systems, on the other hand, can potentially provide more objective and quantitative assessments. In this pilot study, we perform full-body motion capture of Parkinson's patients with deep brain stimulator off-drugs and with stimulators on and off. Our experimental results indicate that the quantitative measure on spatio-temporal statistics learnt from the motion capture data reveal distinctive differences between mild and severe symptoms. We used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for discriminating mild vs. severe symptoms with an average accuracy of approximately 90%.

An important challenge associated with predictive modeling is that of describing the domain over which model predictions are valid. This is necessary to avoid extrapolating beyond the original data, particularly when designers use predictive models in concert with optimizers or other computational routines that search a model\u2019s input space automatically. The general problem of domain description is complicated by the characteristics of observational data sets, which can contain small numbers of samples, can have nonlinear associations among the variables, can be non-convex, and can occur in largely disjoint clusters. Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques, developed originally in the machine learning community, offer a solution to this problem. This paper is a description of a kernel-based SVM approach that yields a formal mathematical description of the valid input domain of a predictive model. The approach also provides for cluster analysis, which can lead to improved model accuracy through the decomposition of a data set into multiple subsets that designers can model independently. The paper includes a mathematical presentation of kernel-based SVM methods, an explanation of the procedure for applying the approach to predictive modeling problems, and illustrative examples for applying and using the approach in systems design.Copyright \u00a9 2009 by ASME", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/DETC2009-87376", "venue": "Volume 2: 29th Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, Parts A and B", "journal": "Volume 2: 29th Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, Parts A and B", "mag_id": "2053714559", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["62211041"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62207812"}

In practice, the availability of labels is highly imbalanced among different languages, e.g., more English texts are labeled than texts in any other languages, which creates a considerable inequality in the quality of related information services received by users speaking different languages. To tackle this problem, cross-lingual sentiment classification approaches aim to transfer knowledge learned from one language that has abundant labeled examples (i.e., the source language, usually English) to another language with fewer labels (i.e., the target language). The source and the target languages are usually bridged through off-the-shelf machine translation tools. Through such a channel, cross-language sentiment patterns can be successfully learned from English and transferred into the target languages. This approach, however, often fails to capture sentiment knowledge specific to the target language, and thus compromises the accuracy of the downstream classification task. In this paper, we employ emojis, which are widely available in many languages, as a new channel to learn both the cross-language and the language-specific sentiment patterns. We propose a novel representation learning method that uses emoji prediction as an instrument to learn respective sentiment-aware representations for each language. The learned representations are then integrated to facilitate cross-lingual sentiment classification. The proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, which is sustained even when sentiment labels are scarce.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1806.02557", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3308558.3313600", "venue": "WWW '19", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2962947218,2807389917,2950219744", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9933581", "11212020", "8691378", "98975", "15371517", "217774", "25841367", "5161511", "7652137", "1562663", "9971782", "683036", "2493033", "14353019", "207238769", "4469819", "2105170", "20071973", "1915014", "6628106", "114955219", "4889328", "2281811", "6163680", "7861759", "14935137", "493963", "147748556", "5989216", "5136253", "8505251", "3702229", "53746278", "5883531", "2303624"], "inbound_citations": ["202577867", "58015329", "208157604", "214693518", "153314069"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46960139"}

In order to perform sensitivity analysis on fixed data sets, i.e. without the possibility of further sampling, we fit a surrogate model to the data. This paper explores the effects of model error on sensitivity analysis, using Sobol\u2019 indices (SI), a measure of the variance contributed by particular variables (first order indices) and by interactions between multiple variables (total indices), as the primary measure of variable importance. We also examine partial derivative measures of sensitivity. All analysis is based on data generated by various test functions for which the true SI are known. We fit two non-parametric models, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Random Forest, to the test data, and the SI are approximated using R routines. An analytic solution for SI based on the MARS basis functions is derived and compared to the actual and approximated SI. Further, we apply MARS and Random Forest to data sets of increasing size to explore convergence of error as available data increases. Due to efficiency constraints in the surrogate models, constant relative error is quickly reached and maintained despite increasing size of data. We find that variable importance and SI are well approximated, even in cases where there is significant error in the surrogate model.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1137/15S014757", "venue": "SIAM Undergraduate Research Online", "journal": "SIAM Undergraduate Research Online", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2518653598", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["5708790", "67798719", "106754312", "16835752", "202584415", "7024303", "18932383"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46965516"}

Further, whether this identification can be carried out by a single musical note, like humans are able to do, is an interesting research issue that has several potential applications in the music industry. Attempts have been made earlier using the spectral and temporal features of the music acoustic signals. The process of identifying the musical instrument from monophonic audio recording basically involves three steps \u2014 pre-processing of music signal, extracting features from it and then classifying those. In this paper, we present an experiment-based comparative study of different features for classifying few musical instruments. The acoustic features, namely, the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Spectral Centroids (SC), Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) and signal energy are derived from the music acoustic signal using different speech signal processing methods. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used with each feature for the relative comparisons. The classification results using different combinations of training by features from different music instrument and testing with another/same type of music instruments are compared. Our results indicate that the most significant feature for classifying Guitar, Violin and Drum is MFCC as it gives the better accurate results.

These results indicate that distinct regions of the human upper respiratory tract contain characteristic microbial communities that exhibit disordered patterns in cigarette smokers, both in individual components and global structure, which may contribute to the prevalence of respiratory tract complications in this population.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3004851", "pubmed_id": "21188149", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0015216", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2037878492", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["38298314", "30641728", "1746337", "30220531", "31086048", "166473", "9456177", "35786451", "1687737", "20671321", "20892987", "31039145", "10094084", "37747989", "30305274", "17725633", "3826946", "7513396", "1475612", "2722335", "1975660", "32942576", "1373790", "7844343", "893562", "28925599", "18628964", "17231700", "7292074", "13785027", "10705594", "10591107", "21775943", "20840776", "42685416", "41134633", "27687345", "6456751", "27016222", "18595810", "2743932", "16014330", "3788324", "8686235", "23707690", "1766169", "25904377", "14931912"], "inbound_citations": ["214807350", "3175930", "67478606", "59235050", "50789631", "14492517", "4824298", "28449167", "2533941", "462411", "10886002", "24746639", "4686674", "3808737", "9575365", "8196848", "2858098", "18628716", "16747701", "3554487", "862922", "1073842", "25287794", "57965225", "215280637", "199382154", "11691351", "215523287", "5821899", "214912259", "215145904", "215594145", "27681918", "9375674", "7204538", "89982622", "214909391", "83701902", "196814145", "49213146", "3557230", "1123244", "22120100", "91031285", "27697661", "214722084", "214841527", "18576162", "215369329", "53569128", "92326426", "9985345", "52080453", "57013215", "111390567", "13938826", "155104574", "2994555", "24762775", "22952296", "3570857", "19280103", "15261421", "9658481", "89529257", "54937932", "4644317", "16019349", "3912255", "3708068", "133607650", "7513517", "14339948", "1012653", "49339260", "28048655", "3470014", "195784875", "3815852", "212690417", "46759870", "17772246", "10556832", "51942908", "1217386", "3549184", "51723571", "5395906", "4188665", "89833715", "24904375", "4836321", "17052278", "2382767", "3321010", "85778231", "51870167", "66917732", "6209106", "3904129", "2147781", "214977998", "37180263", "19009142", "970863", "53210397", "180259512", "4777758", "52178479", "15798591", "5942908", "18707458", "207911637", "14199542", "26370566", "8595838", "14928469", "24166970", "215337270", "63327495", "13063658", "6118418", "26940457", "1508874", "14954473", "214918874", "3919090", "24434420", "7474665", "86445449", "3640348", "215076388", "215126867"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13120117"}

Despite these advantages above in rule generation, the prediction processes have the weaknesses of class rule distribution imbalance and interruption of incorrect class rules. Further, it is useless to instances satisfying no rules.

However, in fact, the temperature variation of the disconnecting switch is continuous and sequential. In this paper, we propose a model based on Memory Regression Metric Learning (MRML) to predict the temperature of disconnecting switch.

Existing methods that bring generative adversarial networks (GANs) into the sequential setting do not adequately attend to the temporal correlations unique to time-series data. At the same time, supervised models for sequence prediction - which allow finer control over network dynamics - are inherently deterministic. We propose a novel framework for generating realistic time-series data that combines the flexibility of the unsupervised paradigm with the control afforded by supervised training. Through a learned embedding space jointly optimized with both supervised and adversarial objectives, we encourage the network to adhere to the dynamics of the training data during sampling. Empirically, we evaluate the ability of our method to generate realistic samples using a variety of real and synthetic time-series datasets.

To make full use of the effective identification information in the RGB and depth images, we propose a multi-modal deep neural network and a DS (Dempster Shafer) evidence theory based RGB-D object recognition method. First, the RGB and depth images are preprocessed and two convolutional neural networks are trained, respectively. Next, we perform multi-modal feature learning using the proposed quadruplet samples based objective function to fine-tune the network parameters. Then, two probability classification results are obtained using two sigmoid SVMs (Support Vector Machines) with the learned RGB and depth features. Finally, the DS evidence theory based decision fusion method is used for integrating the two classification results. Compared with other RGB-D object recognition methods, our proposed method adopts two fusion strategies: Multi-modal feature learning and DS decision fusion.

Encoder is a connectionist model that learns to convert images like the fixated text images human readers encode into the corresponding letter sequences. The computational theory of classification learning predicts that fixated text-image size makes this learning difficult but that reducing image variability and biasing learning should help. Encoder confirms these predictions. It fails to learn as image size increases but achieves humanlike visual encoding accuracy when image variability is reduced by regularities in fixation positions and letter sequences and when learning is biased to discover mapping functions based on the sequential, componential structure of text.

The approach has been implemented as a plug-in of the ProM process mining framework and has been evaluated using both simulated event data exhibiting controlled concept drifts and real-life event data from a Dutch municipality.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24806651", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2278313", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1988135700", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["6514311", "61799247", "40540750", "1358231", "60398919", "7255159", "18243939", "15025246", "116780483", "8255138", "2606652", "2279539", "14823702", "23207009", "2705293", "5945464", "13177510", "9136731", "15558554", "66157839", "10021850", "833587", "121530032", "137057453", "4108219", "16204194", "18747476", "14004252", "3999466", "15791904", "5874117", "6786471", "16592739", "33666824", "39936281", "62526598", "379259", "122725444", "1854295", "202614848", "989624", "18264540", "10912549", "8412974", "1939341", "13476097", "18581564"], "inbound_citations": ["16815407", "14010201", "49272215", "14987648", "10899407", "18042383", "199550800", "145937896", "512394", "203605567", "53405615", "52161462", "20985158", "4490973", "56486980", "289023", "21669149", "53043658", "69917354", "53012958", "211732238", "210181866", "202699636", "2256774", "13301390", "195848226", "2299288"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14506351"}

The under treatment of pain may impede short-term recovery and have a detrimental long-term effect on health. This study focuses on Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA), which is a delivery system for pain medication. This study proposes and demonstrates how to use machine learning and data mining techniques to predict analgesic requirements and PCA readjustment. The sample in this study included 1099 patients. Every patient was described by 280 attributes, including the class attribute. In addition to commonly studied demographic and physiological factors, this study emphasizes attributes related to PCA. We used decision tree-based learning algorithms to predict analgesic consumption and PCA control readjustment based on the first few hours of PCA medications. We also developed a nearest neighbor-based data cleaning method to alleviate the class-imbalance problem in PCA setting readjustment prediction. The prediction accuracies of total analgesic consumption (continuous dose and PCA dose) and PCA analgesic requirement (PCA dose only) by an ensemble of decision trees were 80.9% and 73.1%, respectively. Decision tree-based learning outperformed Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Rotation Forest, and Na\u00efve Bayesian classifiers in analgesic consumption prediction. The proposed data cleaning method improved the performance of every learning method in this study of PCA setting readjustment prediction. Comparative analysis identified the informative attributes from the data mining models and compared them with the correlates of analgesic requirement reported in previous works. This study presents a real-world application of data mining to anesthesiology. Unlike previous research, this study considers a wider variety of predictive factors, including PCA demands over time.

In this paper, a new aortic valve dynamics detection algorithm based on a Lagrangian Support Vector Machine (LSVM) model is presented. A detection indicator is derived from the systemic vascular flow signal in the circulatory system using a nonlinear mathematical model of the combined cardiovascular-LVAD system and forms the input to the LSVM classifier. The LSVM classifier is trained and tested to classify the aortic valve dynamics into two states: aortic valve opening and closing (i.e. operating normally) and aortic valve permanently closed. Our results show that the proposed algorithm can detect the aortic valve dynamics effectively in terms of classification accuracy and stability.

Retrieval accuracy can be improved by learning distance metric methods that separate categories in a transformed embedding space. Unlike most methods that utilize a single embedding to learn a distance metric, we build on the idea of boosted metric learning, where an embedding is split into a boosted ensemble of embeddings. While in general metric learning is directly applied on fine labels to learn embeddings, we take this one step further and incorporate hierarchical label information into the boosting framework and show how to properly adapt loss functions for this purpose. We show that by introducing several sub-embeddings which focus on specific hierarchical classes, the retrieval accuracy can be improved compared to standard flat label embeddings.

Specifically, we demonstrate that probabilistic fusion rules often disregard the \u201cphysical\u201d meaning of classifier outputs and make assumptions that might not hold in practice. As a result, their performance is seriously affected. To support our argument, we have trained two Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to perform vehicle detection using two types of features: Harr Wavelet and Gabor. To classify an input pattern, the output of the SVM classifier needs to be thresholded first. In this case, each output represents a class. When considering the raw SVM outputs (i.e., without thresholding), however, each output represents a \u201cdistance\u201d between the input pattern and the decision boundary. Unfortunately, some popular probabilistic decision-level fusion rules, such as the Sum and Product rules, disregard the physical meaning of the raw SVM outputs. Moreover, they make assumptions about data independence and distribution models which might not hold in practice. Motivated by these observations, we propose a simple but effective decision-level fusion rule which exploits the physical meaning of the SVM outputs and does not make any assumptions about the data.

However, traditional technologies are difficult to timely detect malware that has been deformed, confused, or modified since they usually detect hosts before being infected by malware. Host detection during malware infection can make up for their deficiency. Moreover, the infected host usually sends a connection request to the command and control (C&C) server using the HTTP protocol, which generates malicious external traffic. Thus, if the host is found to have malicious external traffic, the host may be a host infected by malware. Based on the background, this paper uses HTTP traffic combined with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to detect infected hosts in order to improve detection efficiency and accuracy. The proposed approach uses a template automatic generation algorithm to generate feature templates for HTTP headers and uses XGBoost algorithm to distinguish between malicious traffic and normal traffic.

We evaluated how well a large number of objective polysomnography (PSG) parameters can predict sQUAL in insomnia patients with and without medications. Methods PSG recordings over multiple nights from two clinical drug development programs involving 1158 insomnia patients treated with suvorexant or placebo and 903 insomnia patients treated with gaboxadol or placebo were used post-hoc to analyze univariate and multivariate associations between sQUAL and 98 PSG sleep parameters plus patient\u2019s age and gender. Analyses were performed separately for each of the two clinical trial databases. For univariate associations, within-subject correlations were estimated using mixed effect modeling of bi-variate longitudinal data with one variable being a given PSG variable and the other being sQUAL. To evaluate how accurately sQUAL could be predicted by all PSG variables jointly plus patient\u2019s age and gender, the Random Forest multivariate technique was used. Random Forest was also used to evaluate the accuracy of sQUAL prediction by subjective sleep measures plus age and gender, and to quantitatively describe the relative importance of each variable for predicting sQUAL. Results In the univariate analyses, total sleep time (TST) had the largest correlation with sQUAL compared with all other PSG sleep parameters, and the magnitude of the correlation between each PSG sleep architecture parameter and sQUAL generally increased with the strength of their associations with TST. In the multivariate analyses, the overall accuracy of sQUAL prediction, even with the large number of PSG parameters plus patient\u2019s age and gender, was moderate (area under the ROC curve (AROC) \u223c71.2-71.8%). Ranking of PSG parameters by their contribution to sQUAL indicated that TST was the most important predictor of sQUAL among all PSG variables. Subjective TST and subjective number of awakenings jointly with patient\u2019s age classified sQUAL with higher accuracy (AROC\u223c 78.7-81.7%) than PSG variables plus age and gender. The pattern of findings was consistent across the two clinical trial databases. Conclusion In insomnia patients participating in trials of sleep medications or placebo, PSG variables had a moderate but consistent pattern of association with sQUAL across two separate clinical trial databases. Of the PSG variables evaluated, TST was the best predictor of sQUAL.

The sample data consisted of 2903 patterns extracted from records of the PVAQ station, one of the seismographic network's stations of the Institute of Meteorology of Portugal (IM). Records' spectral variations in time and characteristics were reflected in the input ANN patterns, as a set of values of power spectral density at selected frequencies. To ensure that all patterns of the sample data were within the range of variation of the training set, we used an algorithm to separate the universe of data by hyper-convex polyhedrons, determining in this manner a set of patterns that have a mandatory part of the training set. Additionally, an active learning strategy was conducted, by iteratively incorporating poorly classified cases in the training set. The proposed system best results, in terms of sensitivity and selectivity in the whole data ranged between 98% and 100%. These results compare very favourably with the ones obtained by the existing detection system, 50%, and with other approaches found in the literature.Subsequently, the system was tested in continuous operation for unseen (out of sample) data, and the SVM detector obtained 97.7% and 98.7% of sensitivity and selectivity, respectively. The classifier presented 88.4% and 99.4% of sensitivity and selectivity when applied to data of a different seismic station of IM.Due to the input features used, the average time taken for detection with this approach is in the order of 100s. This is too long to be used in an early-warning system. In order to decrease this time, an alternative set of input features was tested. A similar performance was obtained, with a significant reduction in the average detection time (around 1.3s).

Diagnosis of MDD using rest-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data faces many challenges due to the high dimensionality, small samples, noisy and individual variability. To our best knowledge, no studies aim at classification with effective connectivity and functional connectivity measures between MDD patients and healthy controls. In this study, we performed a data-driving classification analysis using the whole brain connectivity measures which included the functional connectivity from two brain templates and effective connectivity measures created by the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), frontal-parietal network (FPN), and silence network (SN). Effective connectivity measures were extracted using spectral Dynamic Causal Modelling (spDCM) and transformed into a vectorial feature space. Linear Support Vector Machine (linear SVM), nonlinear SVM, k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Logistic Regression (LR) were used as the classifiers to identify the differences between MDD patients and healthy controls. Our results showed that the highest accuracy achieved 91.67% (p < 0.0001) when using 19 effective connections and 89.36% when using 6650 functional connections. The functional connections with high discriminative power were mainly located within or across the whole brain resting-state networks while the discriminative effective connections located in several specific regions, such as posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), dorsal cingulate cortex (dACC) and inferior parietal lobes (IPL). To further compare the discriminative power of functional connections and effective connections, a classification analysis only using the functional connections from those four networks was conducted and the highest accuracy achieved 78.33% (p < 0.0001). Our study demonstrated that the effective connectivity measures might play a more important role than functional connectivity in exploring the alterations between patients and health controls and afford a better mechanistic interpretability.

To solve this problem, many works analyze and interpret images of a specific topic in order to obtain a statistical correlation between the variables that define it. By this way, any set of variables close to the map generated in the previous analysis represents a similar image. Deep learning based methods have allowed the automatic extraction of feature maps which has helped in the design of more robust models photo-realistic image synthesis.

It is empirically proven that the optimum parameter combination for both SVM cost and kernel yield high pattern recognition accuracies in SVMs. Various methods are discussed in the literature to optimize these SVM parameters, namely trial and error method, grid optimization, leave-one-out cross validation, generalization error estimation using gradient descent, and evolutionary algorithms. However, these optimization methods have downfalls: the trial and error method is considered to be imprecise and unreliable (Zhang & He, 2010), the grid parameter search requires complex computation (Friedrichs & Igel, 2005), leave-oneout cross validation is considered to be computationally expensive, and the gradient descent method can fall into a local \u2018minima\u2019 (Zhang & He, 2010). Also, these methods mainly optimize numeric kernels. However, when optimizing string kernel SVMs in string classification, researchers are confronted with two main obstacles. Firstly, there is little or no literature pertaining to string kernel SVM optimization at the moment. Secondly, according to the experiments: Rieck and Laskov (2007), Lodhi, Saunders, Shawe-Taylor, Cristianini, and Watkins (2002), Sharma, Girolami, and Sventek (2007) and S.Sonnenburg (2006), string dataset characteristics influence the optimum parameter combination of string kernel SVMs. The current string kernel SVM optimization methods do not take string dataset characteristics into account. Baring this in mind, the thesis initially attempts to identify a mechanism to extract string dataset characteristics from a string dataset. It then, attempts to derive a string kernel SVM optimization method which uses these extracted string dataset characteristics. The initial objective is achieved by explaining that a sting dataset List of Algorithms xi is presentable in token-frequency space (where each dimension is represented by a token) and then computing string meta-features by the points of this token-frequency space. Now for a machine learning algorithm, a meta model is trained using computed string meta-features for each dataset in a string dataset pool, learning algorithm parameters, and accuracy information. This trained meta model helps to predict string classification accuracy for a new string dataset by computing relevant string meta-features. This principle is employed to optimize string kernel SVMs in the proposed meta learning algorithm (this fulfills the second objective of the thesis) where it only computes the relevant string meta-features to yield optimum parameter combination for the machine learning algorithm on the new string dataset. In the experiments, three string kernel SVMs, edit-distance SVM, bag-of-words SVM and n-gram SVM, were optimized using the proposed algorithm on four string datasets: spam, Reuters-21578, Network Application Detection and e-News Categorization. The experiment results revealed that the algorithm was able to produce parameter combinations which yield good string classification accuracies for string kernel SVMs on most string datasets. It is also revealed that some string kernel SVMs may not be suitable on certain string datasets. As future work, one could research for more string meta-features that help to employ meta learning on string classification more effectively. Also, one could introduce upper and lower bounds to the proposed algorithm, which help the predicted string classification accuracy to be within the range (0,100). Further experiments on more string datasets will help to identify the robustness of the algorithm.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1519184312", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55265890"}

Our self-training approach allows us to augment our data set by labelling 217,888 additional samples. 3D-ConvNets trained with our augmented dataset improve on the results we get when we train only on the unaugmented dataset.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2002.09406", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3006947600", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4597469", "6144047", "18848650", "1033682", "27585435", "206594692", "1915014", "9433631", "3707204", "1923924", "206687484", "206592218", "6628106", "195908774", "15539264", "44086579", "67855883", "52002350", "202701019", "214805544", "3248075", "206592873", "1487550", "13712139", "58005563"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211252536"}

However, manual identification of key brain structures in 3D ultrasound images requires expertise to perform and even then is tedious. Inspired by how sonographers view and interact with volumes during real-time clinical scanning, we propose an efficient automatic method to simultaneously localize multiple brain structures in 3D fetal neurosonography. The proposed View-based Projection Networks (VP-Nets), uses three view-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to simplify 3D localizations by directly predicting 2D projections of the key structures onto three anatomical views. While designed for efficient use of data and GPU memory, the proposed VP-Nets allows for full-resolution 3D prediction. We investigated parameters that influence the performance of VP-Nets, e.g. depth and number of feature channels. Moreover, we demonstrate that the model can pinpoint the structure in 3D space by visualizing the trained VP-Nets, despite only 2D supervision being provided for a single stream during training. For comparison, we implemented two other baseline solutions based on Random Forest and 3D U-Nets. In the reported experiments, VP-Nets consistently outperformed other methods on localization. To test the importance of loss function, two identical models are trained with binary corss-entropy and dice coefficient loss respectively. Our best VP-Net model achieved prediction center deviation: 1.8 \u00b1 1.4 mm, size difference: 1.9 \u00b1 1.5 mm, and 3D Intersection Over Union (IOU): 63.2 \u00b1 14.7% when compared to the ground truth.

As a result, the proposed processing pipeline takes a raw ultrasound brain image as input, and output a skull-stripped image with five detected key brain structures.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5988265", "pubmed_id": "29715691", "doi": "10.1016/j.media.2018.04.004", "venue": null, "journal": "Medical Image Analysis", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2801875418", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["147338733", "203582642", "3883162", "171864", "35416315", "18830026", "19509627", "2779023", "44624025", "33250829", "5766241", "5808102", "686912", "2735895", "12431608", "56507745", "31647065", "3784390", "206429151", "31041262", "215709913", "28633594", "3719281", "40422347", "1450294", "3683490", "21957663", "60945", "359666", "19231996"], "inbound_citations": ["56475982", "210085265", "202540965", "214743032"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13664153"}

Current computational models, however, constitute a significant barrier to realizing this goal. The early identification of trauma survivors at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is plausible given the disorder's salient onset and the abundance of putative biological and clinical risk indicators. This work evaluates the ability of Machine Learning (ML) forecasting approaches to identify and integrate a panel of unique predictive characteristics and determine their accuracy in forecasting non-remitting PTSD from information collected within10 days of a traumatic event. Data on event characteristics, emergency department observations, and early symptoms were collected in 957 trauma survivors, followed for fifteen months. An ML feature selection algorithm identified a set of predictors that rendered all others redundant. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as well as other ML classification algorithms were used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy of i) ML selected features, ii) all available features without selection, and iii) Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) symptoms alone. SVM also compared the prediction of a) PTSD diagnostic status at 15 months to b) posterior probability of membership in an empirically derived non-remitting PTSD symptom trajectory. Results are expressed as mean Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC). The feature selection algorithm identified 16 predictors, present in \ufffd 95% cross-validation trials. The accuracy of predicting non-remitting PTSD from that set (AUC \u00bc .77) did not differ from predicting from all available information (AUC \u00bc .78). Predicting from ASD symptoms was not better then chance (AUC \u00bc .60). The prediction of PTSD status was less accurate than that of membership in a non-remitting trajectory (AUC \u00bc .71). ML methods may fill a critical gap in forecasting PTSD. The ability to identify and integrate unique risk indicators makes this a promising approach for developing algorithms that infer probabilistic risk of chronic posttraumatic stress psychopathology based on complex sources of biological, psychological, and social information. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, based on the investigation on the influence that color spaces have on the representation learning of convolutional neural network, a novel traffic sign recognition approach called DP-KELM is proposed by using a kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) classifier with deep perceptual features. Unlike the previous approaches, the representation learning process in DP-KELM is implemented in the perceptual Lab color space. Based on the learned deep perceptual feature, a kernel-based ELM classifier is trained with high computational efficiency and generalization performance. Through the experiments on the German traffic sign recognition benchmark, the proposed method is demonstrated to have higher precision than most of the state-of-the-art approaches.

However, the online learning of CFs is problematic because of the increasing number of training samples as the tracking process goes on. To solve this issue, most CFs-based methods decouple the learning phase and updating phase of the correlation filters and then use a simple linear interpolation to fuse the newly learned correlation filters with the old ones for fast computing. Nevertheless, the linear interpolation may be an unwise way to update the model. In this letter, we propose a smooth incremental learning framework of CFs. In our method, the increments of the correlation filters are smoothly learned by minimizing an optimization problem in each frame, thus avoiding the ad hoc linear interpolation. The optimization problem can be efficiently solved via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, a rotation estimation strategy is introduced to enable the correlation filters to accurately estimate the rotation angle of the target. Experiments show the superiority of the incremental learning framework and the rotation estimation method.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/LSP.2020.2971387", "venue": "IEEE Signal Processing Letters", "journal": "IEEE Signal Processing Letters", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3005358307", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["11962297", "1660289", "6795574", "11832048", "14017201", "2451356", "8304060", "206687104", "5378407", "15665411", "905234", "206770621", "16695472", "13028371", "5650694", "14958161", "4321186", "123460064", "15287463", "52350875", "14309034", "10520310", "1444092", "7993679", "1188600", "1511942", "32367668", "647942", "4319958", "3989638", "51789432", "780697", "15027101", "8947703"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212634354"}

Existing works explore the semantic correlation between the visual and language domains via encoder-to-decoder learning frameworks based on classifying visual features in the language domain. This approach, however, is criticized for its lacking of naturalness and diversity. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel way to learn a semantic connection between visual information and natural language directly based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that is trained in an adversarial routine. Instead of using the classification based discriminator, our method directly learns to estimate the diversity between a hidden vector embedded from a text encoder and an informative feature that is sampled from a learned distribution of the autoencoders. We show that the sentences learned from this matching contains accurate semantic meaning with high diversity in the image captioning task.

Existing software called the Rapid Image Exploitation Resource (RAPIER) was designed by engineers at Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC PAC) to perform exactly this function. This software automatically searches for anomalies in the ocean and reports the detections as a possible ship object.

The focus of this thesis is to explore various feature extraction and classification methods to accurately distinguish clouds from ship objects. An examination of a texture analysis method, line detection using the Hough transform, and edge detection using wavelets are explored as possible feature extraction methods.

The mainstream approaches learn a Mahalanobis metric or learn a linear transformation. Recent related works propose learning a linear combination of base vectors to approximate the metric. In this way, fewer variables need to be determined, which is efficient when facing high-dimensional data. Nevertheless, such works obtain base vectors using additional data from related domains or randomly generate base vectors. However, obtaining base vectors from related domains requires extra time and additional data, and random vectors introduce randomness into the learning process, which requires sufficient random vectors to ensure the stability of the algorithm. Moreover, the random vectors cannot capture the rich information of the training data, leading to a degradation in performance. Considering these drawbacks, we propose a novel distance metric learning approach by introducing base vectors explicitly learned from training data. Given a specific task, we can make a sparse approximation of its objective function using the top eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a predefined integral operator on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Because the process of generating eigenvectors simply refers to the training data of the considered task, our proposed method does not require additional data and can reflect the intrinsic information of the input features. Furthermore, the explicitly learned eigenvectors do not result in randomness, and we can extend our method to any kernel space without changing the objective function. We only need to learn the coefficients of these eigenvectors, and the only hyperparameter that we need to determine is the number of eigenvectors that we utilize. Additionally, an optimization algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve this problem. Extensive experiments conducted on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3340262", "venue": "TOMM", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2969301371", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["122897287", "122897287", "8600094", "450130", "16378010", "51789432", "2261947", "52180262", "121867325", "174866", "10082278", "122725444", "7811489", "18493040", "14124239", "2324548", "12151340", "52948589", "206769089", "17545470", "425268", "28344474", "14599182", "9022685", "2071866", "206592766", "6488984", "50779159", "1536455", "10174367", "26576235", "47325215", "2940315", "1935370", "42785894", "8960049", "22541202", "480975", "9400774", "1186743"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201810004"}

It causes the excursion of separation margin; (3) Noises and Interaction: the distribution of data becomes hard to be described and the separation margin between classes becomes a \"gray\" zone.

These models are designed based on the assumption that past code change properties are similar to future ones. However, as the system evolves, the expertise of developers and/or the complexity of the system also change. AIM: In this work, we aim to investigate the effect of code change properties on JIT models over time. We also study the impact of using recent data as well as all available data on the performance of JIT models. Further, we analyze the effect of weighted sampling on the performance of fix-inducing properties of JIT models. For this purpose, we used datasets from four open-source projects, namely Eclipse JDT, Mozilla, Eclipse Platform, and PostgreSQL. METHOD: We used five families of change code properties such as size, diffusion, history, experience, and purpose. We used Random Forest to train and test the JIT model and Brier Score (BS) and Area Under Curve (AUC) for performance measurement. We applied the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test on the output to statistically validate whether the performance of JIT models improves using all the available data or the recent data. RESULTS: Our paper suggest that the predictive power of JIT models does not change by time. Furthermore, we observed that the chronology of data in JIT defect prediction models can be discarded by considering all the available data. On the other hand, the importance score of families of code change properties is found to oscillate over time. CONCLUSION: To mitigate the impact of the evolution of code change properties, it is recommended to use weighted sampling approach in which more emphasis is placed upon the changes occurring closer to the current time. Moreover, since properties such as \"Expertise of the Developer\" and \"Size\" evolve with the time, the models obtained from old data may exhibit different characteristics compared to those employing the newer dataset. Hence, practitioners should constantly retrain JIT models to include fresh data.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3345629.3351449", "venue": "PROMISE'19", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2971805364", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201809912"}

Consecutive Ha solar images are used as the input. The image processing techniques, including image transformation, segmentation and morphological operations are used to extract the limb objects and measure the associated properties. The pattern recognition techniques, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), are applied to classify all the objects and generate a list of identified the PEs as the output. ::: In detection of emerging flux regions, an automatic detection method is developed by using multi-scale circular harmonic filters. Kalman filter and SVM. The method takes a sequence of consecutive Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) magnetograms as the input. The multi-scale circular harmonic filters are applied to detect bipolar regions from the solar disk surface and these regions are traced by Kalman filter until their disappearance. Finally, a SVM classifier is applied to distinguish EFRs from the other regions based on statistical properties. ::: In solar flare prediction, it is modeled as a conditional density estimation (CDE) problem. A novel method is proposed to solve the CDE problem using kernel-based nonlinear regression and moment-based density function reconstruction techniques. This method involves two main steps. In the first step, kernel-based nonlinear regression techniques are applied to predict the conditional moments of the target variable, such as flare peak intensity or flare index. In the second step, the condition density function is reconstructed based on the estimated moments. The method is compared with the traditional double-kernel density estimator, and the experimental results show that it yields the comparable performance of the double-kernel density estimator. The most important merit of this new method is that it can handle high dimensional data effectively, while the double-kernel density estimator has confined to the bivariate case due to the difficulty of determining optimal bandwidths. The method can be used to predict the conditional density function of either flare peak intensity or flare index, which shows that our method is of practical significance in automated flare forecasting.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "167846472", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107796515"}

Based on the observation that some certain facial areas, e.g. cheeks, do not typically contain any facial hair whereas the others, e.g. brows, often contain facial hair, a self-trained model is first built using a testing image itself. To overcome the limitation of that facial hairs in brows regions and beard/moustache regions are different in length, density, color, etc., a pre-trained model is also constructed using training data. The pre-trained model is only pursued when the self-trained model produces low confident classification results. In the proposed system, we employ the superpixel together a combination of two classifiers, i.e. Random Ferns (rFerns) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to obtain good classification performance as well as improve time efficiency. A feature vector, consisting of Histogram of Gabor (HoG) and Histogram of Oriented Gradient of Gabor (HOGG) at different directions and frequencies, is generated from both the bounding box of the superpixel and the super pixel foreground. The segmentation result is then refined by our proposed aggregately searching strategy in order to deal with inaccurate landmarking points. Experimental results have demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed system. It is evaluated in images drawn from three entire databases i.e. the Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge (MBGC) still face database, the NIST color Facial Recognition Technology FERET database and a large subset from Pinellas County database.

Traditional glass defect recognition methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suffer from a long training time and low recognition accuracy. By introducing convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) into a CNN, we propose an auto-encoding convolutional neural network, and pre-train the convolution kernel by CAE, thereby reducing the training time caused by randomly initializing the convolution kernel. At the same time, in order to cope with the over-fitting problem caused by a small sample of glass defect dataset, we employ a fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) instead of the Softmax classifier to classify glass defects. Furthermore, we propose a multi-channel auto-encoding convolutional neural network model to deal with misidentification of inclusions and tumor type defects due to small differences in feature space. The model takes a defect image and its enhanced image as input, and averages the output of each channel as the final output, thus achieving accurate recognition of glass defects. Experimental results show that the glass defect recognition method based on auto-encoding convolutional neural network can greatly reduce the training time while maintaining the same classification accuracy rate. The glass defect recognition method based on multi-channel auto-encoding convolutional neural network achieves a recognition rate of 95% for both inclusion and tumor type defects.

Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS) have recently become sufficiently flexible and cost-effective in order to have great potential for use in rear-end collision avoidance systems (CAS). Nevertheless, there are two main issues associated with current vehicle rear-end CAS: achieving relative vehicle positioning and dynamic parameters with sufficiently high accuracy and a reliable method to extract the car-following status from such information. This paper introduces a novel integrated algorithm for rear-end collision detection. Access to high accuracy positioning is enabled by GNSS, electronic compass, and lane information fusion with Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). The judgment of the car-following status is based on the application of the Adaptive Neurofuzzy Inference System (ANFIS).

The idea of our formulation is to reformulate TWSVM as a strongly convex problem by incorporated regularization techniques and then derive an exact 1-norm linear programming formulation for TWSVM to improve robustness and sparsity. The solution of two modified unconstrained minimization problems reduces to solving just two systems of linear equations as opposed to solving two quadratic programming problems in TWSVM and TBSVM, which leads to extremely simple and fast algorithm. One significant advantage of our proposed method is the implementation of structural risk minimization principle. However, only empirical risk is considered in the primal problems of TWSVM due to its complex structure and thus may incur overfitting and suboptimal in some cases. Our approach has the advantage that a pair of matrix equation of order equals to the number of input examples is solved at each iteration of the algorithm. The algorithm converges from any starting point that can be easily implemented in MATLAB without using any optimization packages.

Good quality wine depends on the so many important factors such as chemical, scientific as well as technical factors. However in the previous study the researchers always focus on the subjective study to define the quality of wine. The result based on the subjective study takes much time as well as it is not effective compared to the objective study with the analytical methods. In the last few year's machine learning techniques caught lot of attention in every field. Most of the machines learning techniques are able to produce highly accurate result that compels most of the data scientist to implement it in case of predictive analytics. In the past few works related to wine data has been studied using different classifiers, however so far nobody has compared the performance metrics of the different classifiers with different feature sets to predict the quality of different type of wine by considering several factors.

Illumina MiSeq sequencing data was provided from 12 cities in 7 different countries as part of the 2018 CAMDA \u201cMetaSUB Forensic Challenge\u201d, including also samples from three mystery sets. We used appropriate machine learning techniques on this massive dataset to effectively identify the geographical provenance of \u201cmystery\u201d samples. Additionally, we pursued compositional data analysis to develop accurate inferential techniques for such microbiome data. It is expected that this current data, which is of higher quality and higher sequence depth compared to the CAMDA 2017 MetaSUB challenge data, along with improved analytical techniques would yield many more interesting, robust and useful results that can be beneficial for forensic analysis. A preliminary quality screening of the data revealed a much better dataset in terms of Phred quality score (hereafter Phred score), and larger paired-end MiSeq reads, and a more balanced experimental design, though still not equal number of samples across cities. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) analysis showed interesting clusters of samples and a large amount of the variability in the data was explained by the first three components (~ 70%). The classification analysis proved to be consistent across both the testing mystery sets with a similar percentage of the samples correctly predicted (up to 90%). The analysis of the relative abundance of bacterial \u201cspecies\u201d showed that some \u201cspecies\u201d are specific to some regions and can play important roles for predictions. These results were also corroborated by the variable importance given to the \u201cspecies\u201d during the internal cross validation (CV) run with Random Forest (RF). The unsupervised analysis (PCA and two-way heatmaps) of the log2-cpm normalized data and relative abundance differential analysis seemed to suggest that the bacterial signature of common \u201cspecies\u201d was distinctive across the cities; which was also supported by the variable importance results. The prediction of the city for mystery sets 1 and 3 showed convincing results with high classification accuracy/consistency. The focus of this work on the current MetaSUB data and the analytical tools utilized here can be of great help in forensic, metagenomics, and other sciences to predict city of provenance of metagenomic samples, as well as in other related fields. Additionally, the pairwise analysis of relative abundance showed that the approach provided consistent and comparable \u201cspecies\u201d when compared with the classification importance variables.

This study tests the classification of brain activity, acquired on 16 volunteers using fMRI, during mental imagery, a condition in which the number and duration of mental events were not externally imposed but self-generated. To deal with these issues, two classification techniques were considered (Support Vector Machines, SVM, and Gaussian Processes, GP), as well as different feature extraction methods (General Linear Model, GLM and SVM). These techniques were combined in order to identify the procedures leading to the highest accuracy measures. Our results showed that 12 data sets out of 16 could be significantly modeled by either SVM or GP.

This paper proposes an improved decomposed training and joint decoding algorithm for CRF learning. Instead of training a single CRF model for all tags, it trains a binary sub-CRF independently for each tag. A predicted tag sequence is then produced by a joint decoding algorithm based on the probabilistic output of all sub-CRFs involved.

They are also at the center of most visual contents, potentially providing very large datasets for training models and algorithms. While stereoscopic data has been studied for long, it is only recently that feature-length stereoscopic (\"3D\") movies became widely available. In this thesis, we study how we can exploit the additional information provided by 3D movies for person analysis. We first explore how to extract a notion of depth from stereo movies in the form of disparity maps. We then evaluate how person detection and human pose estimation methods perform on such data. Leveraging the relative ease of the person detection task in 3D movies, we develop a method to automatically harvest examples of persons in 3D movies and train a person detector for standard color movies. We then focus on the task of segmenting multiple people in videos. We first propose a method to segment multiple people in 3D videos by combining cues derived from pose estimates with ones derived from disparity maps. We formulate the segmentation problem as a multi-label Conditional Random Field problem, and our method integrates an occlusion model to produce a layered, multi-instance segmentation. After showing the effectiveness of this approach as well as its limitations, we propose a second model which only relies on tracks of person detections and not on pose estimates. We formulate our problem as a convex optimization one, with the minimization of a quadratic cost under linear equality or inequality constraints. These constraints weakly encode the localization information provided by person detections. This method does not explicitly require pose estimates or disparity maps but can integrate these additional cues. Our method can also be used for segmenting instances of other object classes from videos.

Most approaches to graph classification focus on designing effective kernels to compute similarities for static graphs. However, they become computationally intractable in terms of time and space when a graph is presented in a incremental fashion with continuous updates, i.e., Insertions of nodes and edges. In this paper, we examine the problem of classification in large-scale and incrementally changing graphs. To this end, a framework combining an incremental Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the Weisfeiler-Lehman (W-L) graph kernel has been proposed to study this problem. By retaining the support vectors from each learning step, the classification model is incrementally updated whenever new changes are made to the subject graph.

The spoken OTP is then forwarded simultaneously to both a speaker verification module, which verifies the user's voice, and a speech recognition module, which converts the spoken OTP to text and validates it.

The task of resolving the polarity of a given word instance as positive or negative is addressed as an information retrieval problem. At the pre-processing stage, a vector of context features is built for each word w based on all its occurrences in the positive polarity corpus (consumer reviews with high ratings) and another vector \u2013 on its contexts in the negative polarity corpus (reviews with low ratings). Lexico-syntactic context features are automatically generated from dependency parse graphs of the sentences containing the word. These two vectors are treated as \u201cdocuments\u201d, one with positive and one with negative polarity. To resolve the contextual polarity of a specific instance of the word w in a given sentence, its context feature vector is built in the same way, and is treated as the \u201cquery\u201d. An information retrieval (IR) model is then applied to calculate the similarity of the \u201cquery\u201d to each of the two \u201cdocuments\u201d, with the polarity of the best matching \u201cdocument\u201d attributed to the \u201cquery\u201d. The method uses no prior polarity sentiment lexicons or purposefully annotated training datasets. The only external resource used is a readily available corpus of user-rated reviews. Evaluation on different domains shows more effective performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifiers, on three out of four datasets. PolaritySim , SVM and MNB were also evaluated with an out-of-domain training corpus. The results indicate that PolaritySim is more effective and robust when used with an out-of-domain corpus compared to SVM and MNB.

Consequently, they ignore the context in which the target facial actions occur. We propose a novel Conditional Random Field (CRF) based ordinal model for context-sensitive modeling of the facial action unit intensity, where the W5+ (Who, When, What, Where, Why and How) definition of the context is used. In particular, we focus on three contextual questions: Who (the observed person), How (the changes in facial expressions), and When (the timing of the facial expression intensity). The contextual questions Who and How are modeled by means of the newly introduced covariate effects, while the contextual question When is modeled in terms of temporal correlation between the intensity levels. We also introduce a weighted softmax-margin learning of CRFs from the data with a skewed distribution of the intensity levels, as commonly encountered in spontaneous facial data.

This paper proposes a novel approach to detect and localize video anomalies automatically. For video feature extraction, video volumes are jointly represented by two novel local motion based video descriptors, SL-HOF and ULGP-OF. SL-HOF descriptor captures the spatial distribution information of 3D local regions motion in the spatio-temporal cuboid extracted from video, which can implicitly reflect the structural information of foreground and depict foreground motion more precisely than the normal HOF descriptor. To locate the video foreground more accurately, we propose a new Robust PCA based foreground localization scheme. ULGP-OF descriptor, which seamlessly combines the classic 2D texture descriptor LGP and optical flow, is proposed to describe the motion statistics of local region texture in the areas located by the foreground localization scheme. Both SL-HOF and ULGP-OF are shown to be more discriminative than existing video descriptors in anomaly detection. To model features of normal video events, we introduce the newly-emergent one-class Extreme Learning Machine (OCELM) as the data description algorithm. With a tremendous reduction in training time, OCELM can yield comparable or better performance than existing algorithms like the classic OCSVM, which makes our approach easier for model updating and more applicable to fast learning from the rapidly generated surveillance data. The proposed approach is tested on UCSD ped1, ped2 and UMN datasets, and experimental results show that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art results in both video anomaly detection and localization task.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2016.08.156", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2748846029", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11517463", "751063", "15466712", "15323603", "1811633", "9852942", "2661367", "37334565", "206591190", "61760610", "6070091", "10733290", "11016824", "21541853", "7490062", "5858418", "31413948", "14784541", "9175112", "14648950", "61330117", "3143815", "116858", "15037168", "12450925", "19861033", "8515258", "881524", "43930966", "33492707", "335128", "38135033", "13861810", "14460616", "206591220", "28200231", "5607238", "1739744", "195868589", "5607238", "961425", "31459013", "2139329", "61672596", "14411054", "5445347"], "inbound_citations": ["49658699", "70129841", "47016236", "157067714", "211680211", "133608222", "3428911", "53108208", "54438778", "214594778", "201885458", "53284448", "212645416"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:974999"}

In addition to the primary need to show whether the pubic hair microbiome is individualizing, one aspect that must be addressed before using the microbiome in criminal casework involves the impact of storage on the microbiome of samples recovered for forensic testing. To test the effects of short-term storage, pubic hair samples were collected from volunteers and stored at room temperature (\u223c20\u00b0C), refrigerated (4\u00b0C), and frozen (-20\u00b0C) for 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks along with a baseline sample. Individual microbial profiles (R2=0.69) and gender (R2=0.17) were the greatest sources of variation between samples. Because of this variation, individual and gender could be predicted using Random Forests supervised classification in this sample set with an overall error rate of 2.7%\u00b1 5.8% and 1.7%\u00b15.2%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference attributable to time of sampling or temperature of storage within individuals. Further work on larger sample sets will quantify the temporal consistency of individual profiles and define whether it is plausible to detect transfer between sexual partners.

However, there are few works that have considered both sentiment analysis and classification to determine users' topic of interest. In this study, an approach that combines both sentiment analysis and classification was proposed. The main objective of this work is to design an effective method to provide a summary of users interests from Twitter based on their social textual data on five categories which are sports, travel, fashion, food and religion. Thus we are able to discover the topic in which users are interested. Inspired by the successes of deep learning, our proposed system takes advantages of pre-trained Word2Vec for text pre-processing and to gain vector representations of words which will be the input for suitable Convolutional Neural Network architecture for deep features extraction. Rectified Linear Unit and Dropout functions were applied to improve the accuracy. Support Vector Machine classifier was used to predict the final classification.

The proposed pre-training approach with this architecture learns the feature representations from both labeled and unlabeled data at the CNN layer, covering features that would not be observed in limited labeled data. At the CRF layer, the unlabeled data uses predicted classes of words as latent sequence labels together with labeled sequences. Latent labeled sequences, in principle, has the regularization effect on the labeled sequences, yielding a better generalized model. This allows the network to learn representations that are useful for not only slot tagging using labeled data but also learning dependencies both within and between latent clusters of unseen words.

We extracted the kinematic location, velocity and energy of the skeletal joints at each frame of the activity to form a feature vector. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was applied as a pre-processing step to reduce dimensionality and identify significant features amongst activity classes. SVM and RF are then trained on the PCA feature space to assess classification performance, we undertook an incremental increase in the dataset size. We analyse the classification accuracy, model training and classification time quantitatively at each incremental increase. The experimental results demonstrate that RF outperformed SVM in classification rate for six out of the ten activities. Although SVM has performance advantages in training time, RF would be more suited to real-time activity classification due to its low classification time and high classification accuracy when using eight to ten participants in the training set.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SMC.2013.51", "venue": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics", "journal": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1978492954", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5388357", "61962167", "1250322", "27265878", "206787478", "89141", "77451", "1634674", "25225946", "14694755", "15600562", "6731598", "39661348", "12231161", "2813425", "17329636", "2443126", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["73493620", "57759369", "214798513", "3500201", "37610429", "16540953", "7339504", "25061617", "14239269", "198165000", "11698501", "73550506", "46899596", "52834216"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9911386"}

Specifically, the proposed F-SVM is learned by optimizing simultaneously both the classifier and the Style Normalization Transformation (SNT) for each group of data, even feasible in the high-dimensional kernel space. The SNT transform the original style-discriminative patterns to style-free ones, satisfying the i.i.d. assumption required by the conventional SVM learning and implementation. An efficient optimization algorithm is further developed with the convergence guaranteed theoretically. More importantly, by appropriately exploring the style consistency in each field, the proposed F-SVM model is able to significantly improve the classification accuracy.

Since buildings consume significant amount of energy, research efforts have concentrated to make them more efficient, in particular the Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems that represent more than 40% of the buildings\u2019 energy budget. A key piece of information that facilitates the design of energy efficient HVAC systems, in particular in commercial buildings, is the knowledge of the real-time and predicted occupancy, which would allow an automatic control process to balance the trade-off between energy use and quality of comfort. In practice however, occupancy counting devices are not being wide-spread deployed in the market, so in order to move forward, we believe it is important to estimate occupancy using existing sensors currently deployed in buildings. In this work, we propose to use a combination of sensor data currently available in buildings, such as CO 2 data and airflow, and develop a supervised learning framework that uses existing data to estimate occupancy. We developed two data-driven techniques based on Random Forest (RF) and KNN algorithms to estimate occupancy based on data collected from 4 rooms. Our results show an average RMSE occupancy error that varies from 3.10 to 11.21 for RF (depending on the room) and 2.96 to 8.46 for KNN, with best case results of 1.08 and 0.97 respectively.

Now a day\u2019s search engines became more vital in retrieving information about unknown entities. In the world an entity may be recognized by more than on name (alias). For example many celebrities and experts from various fields may have been referred by not only their original names but also by their aliases on web. Aliases are very important in information retrieval to retrieve complete information about a personal name from the web, as some of the web pages of the person may also be referred by his aliases. In recent years, researchers have been developing algorithms for the automatic information retrieval to meet the demands of retrieving almost all data; the web search engine automatically expands the search query on a person name by tagging his aliases for complete information retrieval thereby improving recall in relation detection task and achieving a significant Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of search engine. For the further substantial improvement on recall and MRR from the previously proposed methods, our proposed method will order the aliases based on their associations with the name using the definition of anchor texts-based co-occurrences between name and aliases in order to help the search engine tag the aliases according to the order of associations.

If, on the one hand, such a scenario offers an enormous control to people, both at private and corporate level, allowing them to filter their needs by adopting a large range of criteria, on the other hand, it has contributed to the growth of fraud cases related to the involved electronic instruments of payment, such as credit cards. The Big Data Information Security for Sustainability is a research branch aimed to face these issues in relation to the potential implications in the field of sustainability, proposing effective solutions to design safe environments in which the people can operate and by exploiting the benefits related to new technologies. The fraud detection systems are a significant example of such solutions, although the techniques adopted by them are typically based on retroactive strategies, which are incapable of preventing fraudulent events. In this perspective, this paper aims to investigate the benefits related to the adoption of proactive fraud detection strategies, instead of the canonical retroactive ones, theorizing those solutions that can lead toward practical effective implementations. We evaluate two previously experimented novel proactive strategies, one based on the Fourier transform, and one based on the Wavelet transform, which are used in order to move the data (i.e., financial transactions) into a new domain, where they are analyzed and an evaluation model is defined. Such strategies allow a fraud detection system to operate by using a proactive approach, since they do not exploit previous fraudulent transactions, overcoming some important problems that reduce the effectiveness of the canonical retroactive state-of-the-art solutions. Potential benefits and limitations of the proposed proactive approach have been evaluated in a real-world credit card fraud detection scenario, by comparing its performance to that of one of the most used and performing retroactive state-of-the-art approaches (i.e. Random Forests).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.future.2018.10.016", "venue": "Future Gener.

According to the current research on landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), the GBDT method is rarely used in LSM. Furthermore, previous studies have rarely considered the imbalance of landslide samples and simply regarded the LSM problem as a binary classification problem. In this paper, we considered LSM as an imbalanced learning problem and obtained a better predictive model using the weighted GBDT method. The innovations of the article mainly include the following two points: introducing the GBDT model into the evaluation of landslide susceptibility; using the weighted GBDT method to deal with the problem of landslide sample imbalance. The logistic regression (LR) model and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model were also used in the study to compare with the weighted GBDT model. Five kinds of data from different data source were used in the study: geology, topography, hydrology, land cover, and triggered factors (rainfall, earthquake, land use, etc.). Twenty nine environmental parameters and 233 landslides were used as input data. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value, and the recall value were used to estimate the quality of the weighted GBDT model, the GBDT model, and the LR model. The results showed that the GBDT model and the weighted GBDT model had a higher AUC value (0.977, 0.976) than the LR model (0.845); the weighted GBDT model had a little higher AUC value (0.977) than the GBDT model (0.976); and the weighted GBDT model had a higher recall value (0.823) than the GBDT model (0.426) and the LR model (0.004).

Our key contributions include: (i) Learning semantic representations of sparse entities within the talent search domain, such as recruiter ids, candidate ids, and skill entity ids, for which we utilize neural network models that take advantage of LinkedIn Economic Graph, and (ii) Deep models for learning recruiter engagement and candidate response in talent search applications. We also explore learning to rank approaches applied to deep models, and show the benefits for the talent search use case.

However, much of these malware are variants of already known malware. Thus, it has become necessary to determine whether a malware belongs to a known family, or exhibits a new behavior hitherto unseen, and requires further analysis. Existing traditional approaches used by antivirus companies are based on signature-based detection and can be thwarted in case of zero-day exploit-based malware. Manual examination of such executables is extremely cumbersome due to the enormous number of such cases. Also, it has become necessary to speed up the detection process and predict before the executable releases its malicious payload. In this work, we addressed the above issues using automated yet efficient malware analysis. We classified the malicious executables into different malware classes in the earliest possible time. In this work, firstly we use static approach and achieve the highest classification accuracy of 97.95% using a Random Forest classifier. Secondly, we use Dynamic approach as it provides useful insights in the case of obfuscated or packed malware where static analysis is not as effective. We achieve the highest classification accuracy of 99.13% using Random Forest classifier. Lastly, we use a combination of both the approaches to overcome the limitations of static and as well as dynamic approaches, i.e., the Hybrid approach. Our experiments achieve the highest classification accuracy of 99.74% for classifying malware into types in the initial 4 seconds of its execution using Random Forest.

To achieve this, a novel TSD algorithm is proposed based on the Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) algorithm to accurately detect all traffic sign candidates in real time. Then, the feature vector of each candidate region is extracted via the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) algorithm. To recognize the traffic sign, the proposed TSR algorithm is designed by combining a Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) classifier with a voting process to improve the traffic sign recognition rate in real-world environments.

The automated reconstruction of Building Information Modeling (BIM) objects from point cloud data is still ongoing research. A key aspect is retrieving the proper observations for each object. After segmenting and classifying the initial point cloud, the labeled segments should be clustered according to their respective objects. However, this procedure is challenging due to noise, occlusions and the associativity between different objects. This is especially important for wall geometry as it forms the basis for further BIM reconstruction. In this work, a method is presented to automatically group wall segments derived from point clouds according to the proper walls of a building. More specifically, a Conditional Random Field is employed that evaluates the context of each observation in order to determine which wall it belongs too. The emphasis is on the clustering of highly associative walls as this topic currently is a gap in the body of knowledge. First a set of classified planar primitives is obtained using algorithms developed in prior work. Next, both local and contextual features are extracted based on the nearest neighbors and a number of seeds that are heuristically determined. The final wall clusters are then computed by decoding the graph and thus the most likely configuration of the observations. The experiments prove that the used method is a promising framework for wall clustering from unstructured point cloud data. Compared to a conventional region growing method, the proposed method significantly reduces the rate of false positives, resulting in better wall clusters. A key advantage of the proposed method is its capability of dealing with complex wall geometry in entire buildings opposed to the presented methods in current literature.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W9-101-2019", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2912080152", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["682119", "53340327", "9649070", "196109091", "63908521", "2948081", "4724154", "6518359", "678978", "18640167", "125215486", "2428566", "31320394", "126124756", "18007363", "7459853", "8829852", "206522602", "29411289", "121998490", "15207715", "5739145", "1187245", "342976", "15326074", "6898871", "121501608", "55759243", "16567107"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86632266"}

Behavioral studies have demonstrated that depressed participants cannot intentionally forget negative memories. However, the neural mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. In this study, participants completed the directed forgetting task in which they were instructed to remember or forget neutral or negative words. Standard univariate analysis based on the General Linear Model showed that the depressed participants have higher activation in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), superior parietal gyrus (SPG), and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) than the healthy individuals. The results indicated that depressed participants recruited more frontal and parietal inhibitory control resources to inhibit the TBF items, but the attempt still failed because of negative bias. We also used the Support Vector Machine to perform multivariate pattern classification based on the brain activation during directed forgetting. The pattern of brain activity in directed forgetting of negative words allowed correct group classification with an overall accuracy of 75% (P=0.012). The brain regions which are critical for this discrimination showed abnormal activation when depressed participants were attempting to forget negative words.

Semi-supervised Learning and Active Learning are two distinct approaches that deal with reduction of labeling costs. Based on their natures, Active and semi-supervised learning can produce better results when they are jointly applied. In this paper we propose a combined Semi-Supervised and Active Learning approach for Sequence Labeling which extremely reduces manual annotation cost in a way that only highly uncertain tokens need to be manually labeled and other sequences and subsequences are labeled automatically. The proposed approach reduces manual annotation cost around 90% compare with a supervised learning and 30% in contrast with a similar fully active learning approach.

The input of SVM and RVM models are mean air temperature (T) ( \u00b0C), average wind speed (WS) (m/sec), sunshine hours (SH)(hrs/day), and mean relative humidity (RH) (%). Equations have been also developed for prediction of E. The developed RVM model gives variance of the predicted E. A comparative study has also been presented between SVM, RVM and ANN models.

The performance of FuRES is compared with a selection of well-known classification algorithms: backpropagation artificial neural networks (ANNs), canonical variates analysis (CVA), classification and regression trees (CART), the K-nearest neighbour method (KNN) and discriminant partial least squares (DPLS). In terms of percent correct classification the DPLS and ANNs were best since all test set objects in both data sets were correctly classified. FuRES was second best with 100% correct classification for the milk data set and 91% correct classification for the olive oil data set, while the KNN method showed 100% and 61% for the two data sets.

Although considerable improvement has been achieved, the quality of synthesized images is far from satisfactory due to two largely unresolved challenges.

Second, the widely adopted CNN operations such as convolution, down-sampling and normalization usually cause spatial resolution loss and thus are unable to fully preserve the original semantic information, leading to semantically inconsistent results (e.g., missing small objects). To tackle the first challenge, we propose to use the edge as an intermediate representation which is further adopted to guide image generation via a proposed attention guided edge transfer module. Edge information is produced by a convolutional generator and introduces detailed structure information. Further, to preserve the semantic information, we design an effective module to selectively highlight class-dependent feature maps according to the original semantic layout.

In particular, the extraction accuracy (i.e., smaller root mean square error value) of temperature information is improved about 4 \u00b0C compared with the conventional SVM when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low as 2.5 dB and 40-ns pump pulse width are adopted in the experiment. In addition to the enhanced accuracy with good robustness, the optimized algorithms have faster processing speed than the curve fitting method, over 20-times improvement.

Because of difficulty to correct a mistake caused by over etching, it is critical that etch should be performed correctly. This paper proposes a new approach for etch endpoint detection of small open area wafers. The traditional endpoint detection technique uses a few manually selected wavelengths, which are adequate for large open areas. As the integrated circuit devices continue to shrink in geometry and increase in device density, detecting the endpoint for small open areas presents a serious challenge to process engineers. In this work, a high-resolution optical emission spectroscopy (OES) sensor is used to provide the necessary sensitivity for detecting subtle endpoint signal. Partial Least Squares (PLS) method is used to analyze the OES data which reduces dimension of the data and increases gap between classes. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed to detect endpoint using the data after PLS. SVM classifies normal etching state and after endpoint state. Two data sets from OES are used in training PLS and SVM. The other data sets are used to test the performance of the model.

Secondly, the Exponentially-Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) control charts are introduced to detect faults in a statistical way to improve the ratios of correctly detected points. Thirdly, when faults are detected, diagnosis follows which is based on a proposed FDD rule table. Six typical chiller component faults are concerned in this paper. This method is validated using the real-time experimental data from the ASHRAE RP-1043. Test results show that the combined use of SVR and EWMA can achieve the best performance.

The accuracy of such models often suffers when the number of available samples is small, a thorny challenge under a given tuning-time constraint. By contrast, we hypothesize that good configurations often share certain hidden structures. Therefore, instead of trying to improve the performance estimation of a given configuration, we focus on capturing the hidden structures of good configurations and utilizing such learned structure to generate potentially better configurations. We propose ACTGAN to achieve this goal. We have implemented and evaluated ACTGAN using 17 workloads with eight different software systems. Experimental results show that ACTGAN outperforms default configurations by 76.22% on average, and six state-of-the-art configuration tuning algorithms by 6.58%-64.56%.

In this paper, a deep convolutional computation model (DCCM) is proposed to learn hierarchical features of big data by using the tensor representation model to extend the CNN from the vector space to the tensor space. To make full use of the local features and topologies contained in the big data, a tensor convolution operation is defined to prevent overfitting and improve the training efficiency.

Finally, experiments on three datasets, i.e., CUAVE, SNAE2, and STL-10 are carried out to verify the performance of the DCCM.

Then, the spectral data of samples was collected by using near-infrared spectrometer, and it was pre-processed through the following methods, including without processing, Multiplicative Scatter Correction(MSC), Orthogonal Signal Correction(OSC), Standard Normal Variate and Standard Normal Variate transformation DeTrending(SNV_DT). Furthermore, this article extracted characteristic wavelengths of the spectral datum from the pre-processed date by Successive Projections Algorithm(SPA), established qualitatively classified calibration methods of adulterated oil through classification method of Support Vector Machine(SVM), optimized model parameters(C, g) by Mesh Search Algorithm and determined the optimal process condition. In extracting characteristic wavelengths of the spectral datum from pretreatment by Backward interval Partial Least Squares(BiPLS) and SPA, quantitatively classified calibration models of adulterated oil through Partial Least Squares(PLS) and Support Vector Machine Regression(SVR) was established respectively. In the end, the author optimized the combination of model parameters(C, g) by Mesh Search Algorithm and determined the optimal parameter model. According to the analysis, the accuracy of prediction set and calibration set for SVC model reached 95% and 100% respectively. Compared with the prediction of the adulteration oil content of rice bran oil which was established by the PLS model, the SVR model is the better one, although both of them could implement the content prediction. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient R is above 0.99 and the Root Mean Square Error (MSE) is below 5.55 x 10(-4).

This study explores the potential of CNN learning from multiple slice (or feature) images to differentiate malignant from benign polyps from a relatively small database with pathological ground truth, including 32 malignant and 31 benign polyps represented by volumetric computed tomographic (CT) images.

From the relatively small database, this study achieved scores of 0.91/0.93 (two-fold/leave-one-out evaluations) AUC (area under curve of the receiver operating characteristics) by using the CNN on the GLCMs, while the RF reached 0.84/0.86 AUC on the Haralick features and the CNN rendered 0.79/0.80 AUC on the multiple-slice CT images. The presented CNN learning from the GLCMs can relieve the challenge associated with relatively small database, improve the classification performance over the CNN on the raw CT images and the RF on the Haralick features, and have the potential to perform the clinical task of differentiating malignant from benign polyps with pathological ground truth.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31899419", "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2019.2963177", "venue": "IEEE transactions on medical imaging", "journal": "IEEE transactions on medical imaging", "mag_id": "2998072408", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209670944"}

With the great help of around forty referees we selected the following ten papers from some 28 submissions, an acceptance rate of 36%. The high number of submissions we received illustrates the vitality and popularity of the field of kernel methods in machine learning. We are pleased to be able to support the fledgling Journal of Machine Learning Research in this way and to provide a rapid but refereed route to publication for the papers presented at the workshop less than a year ago. The papers in the special issue cover a wide range of topics in kernel-based learning machines, but mostly reflect three of the main current research directions: exporting the design principles of standard Support Vector Machines to a variety of other algorithms, producing alternative and more efficient implementations, and deepening the theoretical understanding of kernel methods. The first five papers in the special issue describe extensions of the basic algorithms: Kernel Partial Least Squares Regression in RKHS by Roman Rosipal and Leonard J. Trejo describes the development of kernel partial least squares regression. This technique is similar to kernel PCA or latent semantic kernels, but the projection is chosen by modeling the relationship between input and output variables. The paper compares performance of a number of different projection methods and obtains encouraging results, particularly in terms of the number of dimensions required to obtain a certain level of performance. In Support Vector Clustering, Asa Ben-Hur, David Horn, Hava T. Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik present a novel clustering method using Support Vector Machines. Data points are mapped by means of a Gaussian kernel to a high dimensional feature space, where the minimal enclosing sphere can be calculated. When mapped back to data space, this sphere can separate into several components, each enclosing a separate cluster of points. A simple algorithm for identifying these clusters is discussed and evaluated experimentally. One-Class SVMs for Document Classification by Larry M. Manevitz and Malik Yousef provides extensive experimentation comparing the SVM approach to one-class classification of text documents with more traditional methods such as nearest neighbour, naive Bayes and one more advanced neural network method based on \u2018bottleneck\u2019 compression.

Most classifiers are designed so as to learn from the data itself using a training process, because complete expert knowledge to determine classifier parameters is impracticable. This paper proposes a hybrid methodology based on machine learning paradigm. This paradigm integrates the successful exploration mechanism called self-regulated learning capability of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier. As a recent off-line learning method, ELM is a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (FFNN), proved to be an excellent classifier with large number of hidden layer neurons. In this research, PSO is used to determine the optimum set of parameters for the ELM, thus reducing the number of hidden layer neurons, and it further improves the network generalization performance. The proposed method is experimented on five benchmarked datasets of the UCI Machine Learning Repository for handling medical dataset classification.

In order to realize a continuous pose embedding manifold along with better reconstructions, we propose an unsupervised, manifold learning procedure named Encoder GAN, (or EnGAN). Further we use the pose embeddings generated by EnGAN to model human actions using an RNN auto-encoder architecture, PoseRNN.

With functional MRI (fMRI), the data provide an indirect measurement of brain activity, that can be related to behavioral information. It is now standard to formulate this relation as a machine learning problem where the signal from the entire brain is used to predict a target, typically a behavioral variable. In order to cope with the high dimensionality of the data, the learning method requires a regularization procedure. Among other alternatives, l1 regularization achieves simultaneously a selection of the most predictive features. One limitation of the latter method, also referred to as Lasso in the case of regression, is that the spatial structure of the image is not taken into account, so that the extracted features are often hard to interpret. To obtain more informative and interpretable results, we propose to use the l1 norm of the image radient, a.k.a., the Total Variation (TV), as regularization. TV extracts few predictive regions with piecewise constant weights over the whole brain, and is thus more consistent with traditional brain mapping.

Dark Net Markets (DNMs) are growing platforms in hacker community that provide hackers with highly- specialized tools and products which may not be found in other platforms. While text classification techniques have been used for cyber threat detection in English DNMs, the task is hindered in non-English platforms due to the language barrier and lack of ground-truth data. Current approaches use monolingual models on machine translated data to overcome these challenges. However, the translation errors can deteriorate the classification results. The abundance of data in English DNMs can be leveraged in learning non-English threats without using machine translation. In this study, we show that a deep cross-lingual model that can jointly learn the common language representation from two languages, significantly outperforms a monolingual model learned on machine translated data for identifying cyber threats in non-English DNMs. Unlike most studies, our approach does not require any external data source such as bilingual word embeddings or bilingual lexicons.

Firstly, based on the time domain and frequency domain extraction of vibration signals, the performance damage indicator system of a gearbox is established to select the optimal damage indicators for RUL prediction. Low-pass filtering based on approximate entropy variance (Aev) is introduced in this process because of its stability. Secondly, this paper constructs Dynamic Time Warping Distance (DTWD) as a similarity measurement function, which belongs to the nonlinear dynamic programming algorithm. It performed better than the traditional Euclidean distance. Thirdly, based on DTWD, similarity fusion of multi-parameter and multi-sample methods is proposed here to achieve RUL prediction. Next, the performance evaluation indicator Q is adopted to evaluate the RUL prediction accuracy of different methods. Finally, the proposed method is verified by experiments, and the Multivariable Support Vector Machine (MSVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are introduced for comparative studies. The results show that the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the similarity fusion of multi-parameter and multi-sample methods proposed here is below 14%, which is lower than MSVM\u2019s and PCA\u2019s.

Our proposed classifiers mainly lie in two categories: reconstruction based and boundary based, where three proposed classifiers belong to reconstruction based and three belong to boundary based. We are presenting both types of learning viz., online and offline learning for OCC. Out of six methods, four are offline and remaining two are online methods. Out of four offline methods, two methods perform random feature mapping and two methods perform kernel feature mapping. We present a comprehensive discussion on these methods and their comparison to each other. Kernel feature mapping based approaches have been tested with RBF kernel and online version of one-class classifiers is tested with both types of nodes viz., additive and RBF. It is well known fact that threshold decision is a crucial factor in case of OCC, so, three different threshold deciding criteria have been employed so far and analyze the effectiveness of one threshold deciding criteria over another. Further, these methods are tested on two artificial datasets to check their boundary construction capability and on eight benchmark datasets from different discipline to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. Our proposed classifiers exhibit better performance compared to ten traditional one-class classifiers and ELM based two one-class classifiers.

In order to attain a human-level performance, the next step of research should be to investigate the ability to transfer the learning acquired in one task to a different set of tasks. Concerns on generalization and overfitting in deep reinforcement learning are not usually addressed in current transfer learning research. This issue results in underperforming benchmarks and inaccurate algorithm comparisons due to rudimentary assessments. In this study, we primarily propose regularization techniques in deep reinforcement learning for continuous control through the application of sample elimination and early stopping. First, the importance of the inclusion of training iteration to the hyperparameters in deep transfer learning problems will be emphasized. Because source task performance is not indicative of the generalization capacity of the algorithm, we start by proposing various transfer learning evaluation methods that acknowledge the training iteration as a hyperparameter. In line with this, we introduce an additional step of resorting to earlier snapshots of policy parameters depending on the target task due to overfitting to the source task. Then, in order to generate robust policies,we discard the samples that lead to overfitting via strict clipping. Furthermore, we increase the generalization capacity in widely used transfer learning benchmarks by using entropy bonus, different critic methods and curriculum learning in an adversarial setup. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of these techniques and algorithms on simulated robots in target environments where the morphology of the robot, gravity and tangential friction of the environment are altered from the source environment.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.01331", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2971705906", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["205242740", "54448010", "28695052", "22604015", "1684853", "15313471", "69769059", "4674781", "28202810", "2413610", "3522594", "3158308", "15350923", "13817347", "2930547", "118828957", "6781584", "993157", "5230692", "16046818", "3075448", "54441423", "873046", "7079525", "33343141"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202541564"}

Therefore, there exists a substantial need for health comparisons between populations, including the comparison of individuals, groups of persons, or even populations from different countries, at one point in time and over time. ::: Two fundamentally different approaches exist to assess the health of populations. The first approach relies on indirect measures of health, which are based on mortality and morbidity statistics, and which are therefore only available at the population level. The second approach relies on direct measures of health, which are collected \u2013 based on health surveys \u2013 at the individual level. ::: Based on the needs for comparisons, indirect measures appear to be less appropriate, as they are only available at the population level, but not at the individual or group level. Direct measures, however, are originally obtained at the individual level, and can then be aggregated to any group level, even to the population level. Therefore, direct measures seem to be more appropriate for these comparison purposes. ::: The open question is then how to compare overall health based on data collected within health surveys. At first glance, a single general health question seems to be appealing. However, studies have shown that this kind of question is not appropriate to compare health over time, nor across populations. Qualitative studies found that respondents even consider very different aspects of health when responding to such a question. ::: A more appropriate approach seems to be the use of data on several domains of health, as for example mobility, self-care and pain. Anyway, measuring health based on a set of domains is an extremely frequent approach. It provides more comprehensive information and can therefore be used for a wider range of possible applications. ::: However, three open questions must be addressed when measuring health based on a set of domains. First, a parsimonious set of domains must be selected. Second, health measurement based on this set of domains must be operationalized in a standardized way. Third, this information must be aggregated into a summary measure of health, thereby taking into account that categorical responses to survey questions could be differently interpreted by respondents, and are not necessarily directly comparable. These open questions are addressed in this doctoral thesis. ::: The overall objective of this doctoral thesis is to develop a valid, reliable and sensitive metric of health \u2013 based on data collected on a set of domains \u2013 that permits to monitor the health of populations over time, and which provides the basis for the comparisons of health across different populations. To achieve this aim two psychometric studies were carried out, entitled \u201cTowards a Minimal Generic Set of Domains\u201d and \u201cDevelopment of a metric of health\u201d. ::: In the first study a minimal generic set of domains suitable for measuring health both in the general population and in clinical populations was identified, and contrasted to the domains of the World Health Survey (WHS). ::: The eight domains of the WHS \u2013 mobility, self-care, pain and discomfort, cognition, interpersonal activities, vision, sleep and energy, and affect \u2013 were used as a reference, as this set \u2013 developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 so far constitutes the most advanced proposal of what to measure for international health comparisons. ::: To propose the domains for the minimal generic set, two different regression methodologies \u2013 Random Forest and Group Lasso \u2013 were applied for the sake of robustness to three different data sources, two national general population surveys and one large international clinical study: the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998, the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007/2008, and the ICF Core Set studies. A domain was selected when it was sufficiently explanatory for self-perceived health. ::: Based on the analyses the following set of domains, systematically named based on their respective categories within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), was proposed as a minimal generic set: ::: b130 Energy and drive functions ::: b152 Emotional functions ::: b280 Sensation of pain ::: d230 Carrying out daily routine ::: d450 Walking ::: d455 Moving around ::: d850 Remunerative employment ::: Based on this set, four of the eight domains of the WHS were confirmed both in the general and in clinical populations: mobility, pain and discomfort, sleep and energy, and affect. The other WHS domains not represented in the proposed minimal generic set are vision, which was only confirmed with data of the general population, self-care and interpersonal activities, which were only confirmed with data of the clinical population and cognition, which could not be confirmed at all. ::: The ICF categories of `carrying out daily routine\u00b4 and `remunerative employment\u00b4 also fulfilled the inclusion criteria, though not directly related to any of the eight WHS domains. ::: This minimal generic set can be used as the starting point to address one of the most important challenges in health measurement, namely the comparability of data across studies and countries. It also represents the first step for developing a common metric of health to link information from the general population to information about sub-populations, such as clinical and institutional populations, e.g. persons living in nursing homes. ::: In the second study a sound psychometric measure was developed based on information collected on the domains of the minimal generic set: energy and drive functions, emotional functions, sensation of pain, carrying out daily routine, mobility and remunerative employment. It was demonstrated that this metric can be used to assess the health of populations and also to monitor health over time. ::: To develop this metric of health, data from two successive waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) was used. A specific Item Response Theory (IRT) model, the Partial Credit Model (PCM), was applied on 12 items representing the 6 domains from the minimal generic set. All three IRT model assumptions \u2013 unidimensionality, local independency and monotonicity \u2013 were examined and found to be fulfilled. ::: The developed metric showed sound psychometric properties: high internal consistency reliability, high construct validity and high sensitivity to change. Therefore, it can be considered an appropriate measure of population health. ::: Furthermore, it was demonstrated how the health of populations can be compared based on this metric, for subgroups of populations, and over time. Finally, it was outlined how this metric can be used as the basis for comparing health across different populations, as for example from two different countries. ::: The developed health metric can be seen as the starting point for a wide range of health comparisons, between individuals, groups of persons and populations as a whole, and both at one point in time and over time. It opens up a wide range of possible applications for both health care providers and health policy, and both in clinical settings and in the general population.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1852578719", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:71125610"}

Rotating machines contain bearings which are prone to health degradation with the passage of time. The health degradation of the bearings can result in unexpected machine failure compromising the safety, maintainability, and reliability of the machine, as well as, results in substantial economic losses. So, it is inevitable to develop tools for bearing fault diagnosis. Traditionally, rotating machines fault diagnosis algorithms identify the fault type by using features extracted from signals either in the time domain, frequency domain or time-frequency domain separately. The signals acquired from the bearings under variable working condition and various fault severities are highly nonlinear and nonstationary. The fault diagnosis in such scenarios by considering features from a single domain is ineffective. This paper proposes an efficient bearing fault diagnosis model that uses hybrid feature pool and hierarchical radial basis function (RBF) kernel based one-against-all support vector machines (OOASVM). The proposed model could overcome the nonstationary and nonlinear behavior of the bearing signals, which in turn improves the fault diagnostic performance of the scheme.

It is mainly used in hospital environment; however, with advancements in ambulatory ECG, it is now available outside of hospital environment. Ambulation can lead to contamination of ECG with various noises leading to signal corruption, misdiagnosis, or false alarms. Removal of noise from ECG is possible; however, blindly applying noise removal techniques may reduce the fidelity of the ECG. As such, identification of the noise in the ECG and applying targeted techniques minimize information loss. In this study, a machine learning approach is used to identify the type of noise in ECG. ECG from Physionet's Normal S inus Rhythm Database was contaminated with noise (baseline wandering, electrode motion, and electromyography) from Physionet's MIT-BIH Noise S tress Test Database at different levels and combinations. The chosen machine learning algorithm was Random Forest with 1024 estimators. The Random Forest had a precision and recall of 1.0 when identifying clean ECG. The average precision and recall were 0.47 and 0.63, respectively, for segments with a single type of noise. The average precision and recall were were 0.44 and 0.27, respectively, for segments with multiple types of noise. The drop in precision and recall was due to the misclassification of the ECG with multiple noises as ECG with a single noise; as an example, classification of an ECG with baseline wandering and electromyography as an ECG with baseline wandering. The classifier performed well at identifying any of the noises in segments with multiple types of noises with an average precision and recall of 0.81 and 0.70, respectively.

A misbehaving node may tamper with any information present in the propagated packet. Fake messages may be created by attacker node itself or it may force another node to create fake messages. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to classify multiple misbehaviors in VANET using concrete and behavioral features of each node that sends safety packets. A security framework is designed to differentiate a malicious node from legitimate node. We implement various types of misbehaviors in VANET by tampering information present in the propagated packet. These misbehaviors are classified based upon multifarious features like speed-deviation of node, received signal strength (RSS), number of packets delivered, dropped packets etc. Two types of classification accuracies are measured : Binary and Multi-Class. In Binary classification, all types of misbehaviors are considered to be in a single \u201cmisbehavior\u201d class whereas, Multi-class classification is able to categorize misbehaviors into particular misbehaving classes. Features of packet sending nodes are extracted by performing experiments in NCTUns-5.0 simulator with different simulation scenario (varying the number of legitimate and misbehaving nodes).

Based on the concept of learning under privileged information, we integrate action categories and temporal coordinates into a stacked denoising autoencoder in the training phase, to preserve category and temporal feature, while learning the hidden representation from a skeleton.

Such techniques reduce the labeling effort in learning classification functions by selecting only the most informative samples to be labeled.

Actors in a social network are linked to not only other actors but also items (e.g., video and photo) which in turn can be linked to other items or actors. Given a social network in which only some of the actors are labeled, our goal is to predict the labels of the remaining actors. We introduce a variant of the random walk graph kernel to deal with the heterogeneous nature of the network (i.e., presence of a large number of node and link types). We show that the resulting heterogeneous graph kernel (HGK) can be used to build accurate classifiers for labeling actors in social networks.

This work presents an approach to face recognition based on combination of the curved Gabor filter, entropy and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The curved Gabor filter is used to perform the feature vector extraction of an image. Then, the results from the Gabor response curve are segmented into non-overlapping blocks to reduce interference from local variations in the image. The entropy is used to maintain the most representative image data and to provide a reduction in the feature vector. As classifier we use the SVM. A set of experiments was performed to evaluate this approach based on the characteristics of scenarios encountered in a real environment, using the AR face database.

Nonnavel areas are then removed from the candidate navel regions and only the actual navel areas are robustly detected through filtering using the Haar-like feature and the cascaded AdaBoost algorithm.

There are two advantages by such usage. First, CNNs can extract low-level features, which are very similar to the extracted features in primates\u2019 primary visual cortex (V1). Second, CRFs can set up the relationship between input features and output labels in a direct way. In this paper, we extend the first advantage by using CNNs for low-level feature extraction and a Structured Random Forest (SRF)-based border ownership detector for high-level feature extraction, which are similar to the outputs of primates secondary visual cortex (V2). Compared to the CRF model, an improved Conditional Boltzmann Machine (CBM), which has a multi-channel visible layer, is proposed to model the relationship between predicted labels, local and global contexts of objects with multi-scale and multilevel features. Besides, our proposed CBM model is extended for object parsing by using multivisible branches instead of a single visible layer of CBM, which cannot only segment the whole body but also the parts of the body under. These visible branches use each branch for the segmentation of the whole body or one of the body parts. All branches share the same hidden layers of CBM and train the branches under an iterative way. By exploiting object parsing, the whole body segmentation performance of object is improved. To refine the segmentation output, two kinds of optimization algorithms are proposed. The superpixel-based algorithm can re-label the overlapped regions of multiple kinds of objects. The other curve correction algorithm corrects the edges of segmented object parts by using smooth edges under a curve similarity criterion.

Most of the systems are designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last years.

In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering.

In this paper, we apply Machine Learning (ML) and present a novel approach for affect recognition in Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) by understanding learners' experience through tracking their interactions with a serious game as a learning platform. We utilize a variety of interaction parameters to examine their potential to be used as an indicator of the learner's affective state. Driven by the Theory of Flow model, we investigate the correspondence between the prediction of users' self-reported affective states and the interaction features.

With the development of technology and the introduction of various platforms to communicate with each other such as social media, it soon turned in to a platform to spread racial thoughts within communities. This became a serious issue when certain conversations and actions lead to the outbreak and spread of violence within communities. One such incident that happened in China caused banning of Facebook and certain social media inside the country permanently, while in March 2018, another incident that happened in Sri Lanka made the government ban social media for about one week to stop the spreading of false information and racist thoughts that can make the situation worst. Later, the social media authorities released a statement specifying that the reason why they failed to moderate and stop the spread of hatred and racist comments was due to the unavailability of language translators within their organization. Therefore, the requirement for automatic identification of racist comments on social media has become of utmost importance. However, simple keyword spotting techniques cannot be used to accurately identify the exact intent of a comment. In this paper, we address this issue by building a text analytics model with machine learning that can be used to filter racist comments in Sinhala language. A Two-Class Support Vector Machine was trained with a set of carefully chosen comments from Facebook that were labelled as racist and non-racist based on intent.

However, by testing only 30 values for L and 30 values for C via 10-fold cross-validation, the learning phase must build 9000 different ELM models, each with a different pair {L, C}. Since these models are not independent from one another, the essence of managing and drastically reducing the computational cost of the ELM model selection relies on matrix decompositions that avoid direct matrix inversion and allow producing reusable matrices during the cross-validations. Still, one can find many matrix decompositions and cross-validation versions that result in several combinations. In this paper, we identify these combinations and analyse them theoretically and experimentally to discover which is the fastest. We compare Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD), Cholesky decomposition, and QR decomposition, which produce re-usable matrices (orthogonal, Eigen, singular, and upper triangular). These decompositions can be combined with different cross-validation approaches, and we present a direct and thorough comparison of many k-fold cross-validation versions as well as leave-one-out cross-validation. By analysing the computational cost, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that while the type of matrix decomposition plays one important role, another equally important role is played by the version of cross-validation.

Data imbalance is an inherent problem in activity recognition caused by the irregular time distribution of activities, which are sequential and dependent on previous movements. We use conditional random fields (CRF), a graphical model for structured classification, to take advantage of dependencies between activities in a sequence. However, CRFs do not consider the negative effects of class imbalance during training. We propose a class-wise dynamically weighted CRF (dWCRF) where weights are automatically determined during training by maximizing the expected overall F-score. Our results based on three case studies from a healthcare application using a batteryless body worn sensor, demonstrate that our method, in general, improves overall and minority class F-score when compared to other CRF based classifiers and achieves similar or better overall and class-wise performance when compared to SVM based classifiers under conditions of limited training data.

Improvements in databases technology, computing performance and artificial intelligence have contributed to the development of intelligent data analysis. The primary aim of data mining is to discover patterns in the data that lead to better understanding of the data generating process and to useful predictions. Examples of applications of data mining include detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, character recognition in automated zip code reading, and predicting compound activity in drug discovery. Real-world data sets are often characterized by having large numbers of examples, e.g. billions of credit card transactions and potential 'drug-like' compounds; being highly unbalanced, e.g. most transactions are not fraudulent, most compounds are not active against a given biological target; and, being corrupted by noise. The relationship between predictive variables, e.g. physical descriptors, and the target concept, e.g. compound activity, is often highly non-linear. One recent technique that has been developed to address these issues is the Support Vector Machine. The Support Vector Machine has been developed as robust tool for classification and regression in noisy, complex domains. The two key features of Support Vector Machines are generalization theory, which leads to a principled way to choose a hypothesis; and, kernel functions, which introduce non-linearity in the hypothesis space without explicitly requiring a non-linear algorithm.

In 2017, there were 2,108 highway-rail incidents resulting in 827 injuries and 307 fatalities nationwide. To eliminate collision risks, crossing grade separation and active alarm improvement are commonly used. Moreover, crossing closures are considered to be the most effective safety improvement program. While it may be very difficult, and in some cases impossible to close crossings, there are some incentive programs that facilitate the closure process. One of these programs is a working consolidation model that aims to determine crossing closure suitability. Using details of highway-rail grade crossings in the United States and applying an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) algorithm, this paper proposes a data-driven consolidation model that takes into consideration a number of engineering variables. The results indicated an overall accuracy of 0.991 for the proposed model. In addition, the developed XGboost consolidation model reported the relative importance of the variables input to the model, offering an in-depth understanding of the model\u2019s behavior. Finally, for the practical implementation of the model, a simplified version containing fewer variables was developed. A sensitivity analysis was performed considering the aggregate gain and the different correlation threshold values between variables. This analysis developed a simplified model utilizing 14 variables, with aggregated gain values of 75% and a correlation threshold of 0.9 which would perform similarly to the full model.

{"paper_id": "148884518", "title": "Crossmodal Entropy Transfer", "authors": [{"first": "Bo", "middle": [], "last": "Pederson", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Crossmodal Entropy Transfer Bo Pedersen (bop@cornell.edu) Department of Psychology, Cornell University Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA Empirical models of language acquisition traditionally focus on learning the syntax of \u201cclean\u201d text corpora, without the rich environmental information actually available to children. Under these minimal conditions, this possibility for learning faces a body of work in theoretical computer science more or less rendering it impossible in idealized cases (context dependent grammars) and thus lends support to more nativist theories of language (e.g., Gold 1967). However, the work of Christiansen and Dale (2001) suggests that if some of the contextual information is put back into the equation it might become solvable again. Simulations with simple-recurrent networks indicate that the integration of distributional, phonological and prosodic cues can promote better, faster and more uniform learning. Recent studies by Howel, Jankowicz and Becker (2005) suggest that the inclusion of sensorimotor cues like hard, soft, in-kitchen, man-made, etc. can improve syntax learning in a similar setup, and Pedersen (2006) suggest that the same might be accomplished with image features extracted from a set of real world scenes collected with a head mounted webcam. In this paper we demonstrate a method that can show the existence and strength of such cues beyond the model grammars and model cues mentioned above. If we could mount a video camera on a child\u2019s head and record all the visual and auditory stimuli the child is exposed to during a day we would have an excellent corpus regarding those natural visual cues. Unfortunately such data do not exist \u2013 but we do have access to a corpus of co-occurring visual and auditory stimuli that constitutes a great deal of modern reality, namely television. TV shows and movies can be recorded and subtitles can be extracted or parsed. While we wait for the ultimate language-context corpus to emerge, TV may serve as a test bed for some of these hypotheses. In this study, we made use of a short TV sequence for this purpose. 5000 features were picked by random from a 4 minute cooking video (Martha Stewart\u2019s \u201cRoast Chicken\u201d). Each feature was a 10x10 pixel square picked from a random position in a random frame. A time series was then created from the errors of fitting this feature optimally into each frame of the video, thus giving us 5000 time series. The idea is that some of the features will represent something meaningful, for example the edge of a lemon, so that the error of this feature is low when there is a lemon in the picture and high otherwise. This video was transcribed and the 256 most frequent words encoded into 16x16 doublets so that the transcript is represented by a time series of numbers between 1 and 16 (to reduce the granularity and complexity of the transfer entropy computations). We then have two time series, a text corpus and a video encoding that can be tested for couplings using Transfer Entropy (Schreiber, 2000). We tested a series of alignments between the text and all of the video features, close to their co-occurrence in time, and a t-test performed on the points in the two series before and after the 0 alignment showed a significant difference at the 0.001 level between the before and after points. Note that no assumptions about language or vision have been made. For language, words are represented by numbers only and for vision we have some error rates of some random example based features and still we can see a coupling between the two, even though the nature of the two time series are substantially different. So not only do we have statistical regularities in our visual world and in language as documented by many scholars, but we also have statistical regularities that bind these two modalities together. In the way that these regularities facilitate learning in language and vision, we speculate that couplings like these can facilitate the learning of both and in particular the relation between them, so that when we have just a speaker and no images we have previous couplings than can help us create imagery and when we have images only, words will come to mind. In the future we will process many more videos like this. But although this analysis is based on one video only it demonstrates a technique that can potentially be used to create existence proofs of couplings between modalities for real empirical data and even quantify these couplings.

By combining and parallelizing the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) and Viterbi algorithms, we propose a parallel CRF algorithm called MapReduce CRF (MRCRF) in this paper, which contains two parallel sub-algorithms to handle two time-consuming steps of the CRF model. The MapReduce L-BFGS (MRLB) algorithm leverages the MapReduce framework to enhance the capability of estimating parameters. Furthermore, the MapReduce Viterbi (MRVtb) algorithm infers the most likely state sequence by extending the Viterbi algorithm with another MapReduce job.

From the concept of perturbation due to writing habits and instruments, we propose a recognition method which is able to account for a variety of distortions due to eccentric handwriting. The recognition of handwritten numerals is a challenging task in the field of image processing and pattern recognition. It can be considered as one of the benchmarks in evaluating feature extraction methods and the performance of classifiers. The performance of character recognition system depends heavily on what kind of features are being used. The objective of this paper is to provide efficient and reliable techniques for recognition of handwritten numerals. In this paper we propose Zoning based feature extraction system which calculates the densities of object pixels in each zone. Firstly the whole image is divided into 4 4 zones. Further in order to gain more accuracy these zones are divided into 6 6 zones. The division of zones carried out up to 8 8 zones. Hence 116 features are extracted in all. Nearest neighbour classifier is used for subsequent classification and recognition purpose. For the testing purpose an Award List has been used. Data has been collected from 200 users and extracted individual digits from these forms. These forms are filled out from different users in order to take different samples of handwriting. This Award List has 4-digit Roll no, 4-digit Code no and 3-digit Marks. The outcome of the research will be an automated system for recognition of awards. This automated system will recognize only digits. This procedure can also be done manually, but that is a tedious task and prone to error. This system's complexity lies in the different handwriting styles which vary from human to human. Thus automated system provides better recognition accuracy than manual system. The award list which is used in the automated system is shown below: The rest of the paper is organized into five sections.

Our work is motivated by the observation that the primary visual cortex adopts a sparse coding strategy to represent visual stimulus. We use the popular K-SVD algorithm to construct spatio-temporal dictionaries to sparsely represent local spatio-temporal volumes of natural videos. We empirically demonstrate that the histogram of the sparse representations corresponding to each atom in the dictionary can be well modelled using a Generalised Gaussian Distribution (GGD). We then show that the GGD model parameters are good feature for distortion estimation. This, in turn leads us to the proposed NR-VQA algorithm. The GGD model parameters corresponding to each atom of the dictionary form the feature vector that is used to predict quality using Support Vector Regression (SVR).

Thus, researchers have applied various data-driven approaches to enhance prediction performance including statistical and artificial intelligence techniques. Recently, support vector machines (SVMs) are becoming popular because they use a risk function consisting of the empirical error and a regularized term which is derived from the structural risk minimization principle. In addition, they don't require huge training samples and have little possibility of overfitting. However, in order to use SVM, a user should determine several factors such as the parameters of a kernel function, appropriate feature subset, and proper instance subset by heuristics, which hinders accurate prediction results when using SVM. In this study, we propose a novel approach to enhance the prediction performance of SVM for the prediction of financial distress. Our suggestion is the simultaneous optimization of the feature selection and the instance selection as well as the parameters of a kernel function for SVM by using genetic algorithms (GAs).

This lesion usually consists of a central retraction of the connective tissue and a spiculated pattern radiating from it. This pattern is difficult to detect due the complex superposition of breast tissue. This paper presents a novel AD characterization by representing the linear saliency in mammography Regions of Interest (ROI) as a graph composed of nodes corresponding to locations along the ROI boundary and edges with a weight proportional to the line intensity integrals along the path connecting any pair of nodes. A set of eigenvectors from the adjacency matrix is then used to extract discriminant coefficients that represent those nodes with higher salient lines. A dimensionality reduction is further accomplished by selecting the pair of nodes with major contribution for each of the computed eigenvectors. The set of main salient lines is then assembled as a feature vector that inputs a conventional Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results with two benchmark databases, the mini-MIAS and DDSM databases, demonstrate that the proposed linear saliency domain method (LSD) performs well in terms of accuracy. The approach was evaluated with a set of 246 RoI extracted from the DDSM (123 normal tissues and 123 AD) and a set of 38 ROI from the mini-MIAS collections (19 normal tissues and 19 AD) respectively.

In this paper, we present an approach to model actions as a sequence of histograms (one for each frame) represented using a traditional bag-of-words model. Actions are so described by a string (phrase) of variable size, depending on the clip's length, where each frame's representation is considered as a character. To compare these strings we use Needlemann-Wunsch distance, a metrics defined in the information theory, that deal with strings of different length.

A framework for adaptive signal processing and subsequent discriminant analysis was applied. In addition to the common estimation of Power Spectral Densities, the recently introduced method of Delay Vector Variance is utilized in order to get an estimate if the signal has undergone a modality change or not during the microsleep event under analysis. The fusion of the outcomes of both methods applied to three different types of signals, to the Electroencephalogram, the Electrooculogram and to Eyetracking signals, by modern methods of Computational Intelligence, namely the Support Vector Machine, leads to a high classification accuracies with mean errors down to 9 per cent for all subjects.

First, the information of maize seeds on each wave band is collected using the hyperspectral imaging technology, and then the recognition model is built on VGG-19 network, which is pretrained by large-scale computer vision database (Image-Net). The correct identification rate of model utilizing seed spectral images containing 256 wave bands (862.5\u20131704.2nm) reaches 96.32%, and the correct identification rate of the model utilizing the seed spectral images containing single-band reaches 95.75%.

Our proposed method can recognize chromatic and achromatic images and thus can deal with both color and clear medium. In addition, the proposed method is software-centered and can accept general digital camera images as its input. The counting process includes detecting dish/plate regions, identifying colonies, separating aggregated colonies, and reporting colony counts. In order to differentiate colonies of different species, the proposed counter adopts one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) as the classifier.

Most RS methods are based on minimal decision rules, while SVM converts the linear classifiers into instance based classifiers.

This was accompanied by an extraordinary growth in number and sophistication of cyber threats, going from opportunistic and unstructured to targeted and highly structured. Thus, detecting intrusions in such circumstances requires high levels of accuracy and efficiency, so that heavy losses are prevented. Many intrusion detection models in the literature do not propose real-time solutions to deal with the aforementioned obstacles. This motivates us to propose a lightweight intrusion detection system, for probe and DoS attacks detection. We select the most important set of features using Information Gain (IG), and Correlation-based Feature (CFS) selection filters, applied on a resampled version of KDD\u201999. Furthermore, we employ four machine learning methods, namely C4.5, Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF) and REPTree, as wrappers.

Nowadays, deep neural networks (DNNs) are used in many critical applications such as pilot drones and self-driving cars. So, the DNN's malfunction, due to an attack, may cause irreparable damages. The attack may happen either in training phase (poisoning attacks) or testing phase (evasion attacks) by presenting adversarial examples. These samples are maliciously created to deceive DNNs. This paper deals with evasion attacks and aims to immunize DNNs through adversarial examples generation and training. We propose Noise-GAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a multi-class Discriminator for producing a noise that by adding it to the original image adversarial examples can be obtained. In this paper, various types of evasion attacks are considered and performance of the proposed method is evaluated on different victim models under various defensive strategies. Experimental results are based on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets and the average success rates for different attacks are reported and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The Non-Targeted attack success rates on DNNs after training by adversarial examples, generated by Noise-GAN, were declined from 87.7% to 10.41% using MNIST dataset and from 91.2% to 57.66% using CIFAR-10 dataset.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cose.2019.06.012", "venue": "Comput.

Since MBLP does not abstract over the training data, it is called a lazy learning approach. Rule induction, in contrast, learns rules and does not go back to the actual training data during classification. \u2217 A shorter version of this review will be published in German in the journal Linguistische Berichte. Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 4 The book consists of 7 chapters. Chapter 1 situates memory-based language processing firmly in the domain of empirical approaches to NLP. Empirical approaches became attractive in the early 1990s, replacing knowledge-based approaches to a high degree. Daelemans and van den Bosch argue that in the range of empirical approaches, memory-based learning offers the advantage over statistical approaches that it does not abstract over low-frequency events. Such low-frequency events are necessary in processing natural language problems because they often describe exceptions or subregularities. The chapter also introduces the major concepts of MBLP and provides an intuitive example from linguistics: PP attachment. Chapter 2 locates central concepts of MBLP in neighboring areas of research: In linguistics, the idea of processing by analogy to previous experience is a well-known concept. Psycholinguistics often uses exemplar-based approaches or, more recently, hybrid approaches that combine rules with exceptions. Applications of memory-based principles can be found in explanation-based machine translation (Nagao 1984) and data-oriented parsing (Bod 1998). Chapter 3 gives a simultaneous introduction to memory-based learning and TiMBL, the Tilburg implementation of the method. This strategy of combining theory and practice gives the reader an impression of the importance of selecting optimal parameter settings for different problems. The application of TiMBL is demonstrated on the example of plural formation in German. The chapter ends with the introduction of evaluation methodology and TiMBL\u2019s built-in evaluation functions. Chapter 4 describes the application of TiMBL to two more complex linguistic examples: grapheme to phoneme conversion and morphological analysis. In order to find optimal solutions for these problems, two algorithms that deviate from the standard memory-based learning algorithm are introduced: IGTREE and TRIBL. IGTREE is a decision tree approximation, which bases the comparison of an example to others on a small number of feature comparisons. TRIBL is a hybrid model between the standard memory-based learning algorithm, IB1, and IGTREE. Both modifications reduce memory requirements and processing time during classification, but they may also affect classification accuracy. Unfortunately, the presentation of the first example suffers from unreadable phonetic transcriptions throughout the chapter. Whereas Chapter 4 analyzes linguistic problems, which are easily described in terms of classification, chapter 5 approaches a problem of sequence learning: partial parsing. For this task, phrase and clause boundaries must be found. In order to apply classification methods to sequence learning, the problemmust be redefined as assigning tags to words or word combinations, so-called IOB tagging (Ramshaw and Marcus 1995). This tagging provides information as to whether a word constitutes a boundary or not. One advantage of using MBLP for such problems lies in the fact that different types of information, including long-distance information, can be included without modification of the original algorithm. In Chapter 6, Daelemans and van den Bosch investigate the difference between lazy and eager learning. As noted earlier, TiMBL is a typical example of lazy learning since it does not abstract from the training data. RIPPER (Cohen 1995), the other classifier used in this chapter, is a typical eager learning approach: It is a rule-induction algorithm, which displays the opposite behavior to TiMBL: a complex learning strategy and simple, efficient classification. The results presented in this chapter show that deleting examples from the training data is harmful for classification, supporting the hypothesis that lazy learning has a fitting bias for natural language problems. However, this seems to be a little too straightforward. Here, one would expect a reference to the findings of Daelemans and Hoste (2002), which show that parameter and feature", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": "J06-4007", "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1162/coli.2006.32.4.559", "venue": "Computational Linguistics", "journal": "Computational Linguistics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1972622315,1269074141", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6090713", "6492502", "15356222", "18366233", "725590"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5916908"}

Recently, a deep-learning-based image-to-image translation technique to translate an image from a source domain to a desired domain was presented, and cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) was applied to learn a mapping for speech-to-speech conversion from a speaker to a target speaker. However, this method might not be adequate to remove corrupting noise components for robust ASR because it was designed to convert speech itself. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation method based on generative adversarial nets (GANs) with disentangled representation learning to achieve robustness in ASR systems. In particular, two separated encoders, context and domain encoders, are introduced to learn distinct latent variables.

Classification is performed by Support Vector Machines in which gaussian radial basis functions are used as kernel functions. The system has been validated with 14 users, who were asked to choose one among five common spoken words, previously virtualized and transmitted to stereophonic headphones.

Recently, facial image-based kinship verification has attracted wide attention in computer vision. Some metric learning algorithms have been developed for improving kinship verification. However, most of the existing algorithms ignore fusing multiple feature representations and utilizing kernel techniques. In this paper, we develop a novel weighted graph embedding-based metric learning (WGEML) framework for kinship verification. Inspired by the fact that family members usually show high similarity in facial features like eyes, noses, and mouths, despite their diversity, we jointly learn multiple metrics by constructing an intrinsic graph and two penalty graphs to characterize the intraclass compactness and interclass separability for each feature representation, respectively, so that both the consistency and complementarity among multiple features can be fully exploited. Meanwhile, combination weights are determined through a weighted graph embedding framework. Furthermore, we present a kernelized version of WGEML to tackle nonlinear problems.

Specifically, we introduce a semantic parsing module to assign each pixel with a semantic part label. This module generates a set of parsing maps, where each of them represents the pixel-wise occurrence probability of a certain facial component. We then segment facial regions masked by the parsing maps to achieve local features. We further build the structure correlation of facial part features to boost personalized attribute.

Thus robustness of SLU plays important role in efficient working of human computer interaction system. The SLU consist of semantic decoder and belief tracker. Recent line of research models semantic decoder as a classification task or sequence to sequence learning. The SLU models incorporate learning models for classification. The learning model requires lot of labelled data for training. The process of obtaining labelled data is expensive and time consuming.

Flood spreading project (FSP) is an artificial recharge technique, which is generally suggested for arid and semi-arid areas with two major aims including (1) flood mitigation and (2) artificial recharge of groundwater. This study implemented three state-of-the-art popular models including frequency ratio (FR), k-nearest neighbours (KNN), and random forest (RF) for determining the suitability of land for FSP. At the first step, suitable areas for FSP were identified according to the national guidelines and the literature. The identified areas were then verified by multiple field surveys. To produce FSP land suitability maps, several FSP conditioning factors such as topographical (i.e. slope, plan curvature, and profile curvature), hydrogeological (i.e. transmissivity, aquifer thickness, and electrical conductivity), hydrological (i.e. rainfall, distance from rivers, river density, and permeability), lithology, and land use were considered as input to the models. For the FR modelling, classified layers of the aforementioned variables were used, while their continuous layers were implemented in the KNN and RF algorithms. At the last step, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the ability and accuracy of the applied algorithms. Based on the findings, the area under the curve of ROC for the RF, KNN, and FR models was 97.1, 94.6, and 89.2%, respectively. Furthermore, transmissivity, slope, aquifer thickness, distance from rivers, rainfall, and electrical conductivity were recognized as the most influencing factors in the modelling procedure.

In this paper, we investigate a new point of view in addressing this problem. Instead of focusing only on achieving good quantitative performance on pixel-based metrics such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), we also ensure that the dehazed image itself does not degrade the performance of the high-level vision tasks such as image classification. To this end, we present an unified CNN architecture that includes three parts: a dehazing sub-network (DNet), a classification-driven Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks sub-network (CCGAN) and a classification sub-network (CNet) related to image classification, which has better performance both on visual appeal and image classification.

Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been successfully applied to fault diagnosis tasks for mechanical systems and achieved promising results. However, for diverse working conditions in the industry, deep learning suffers two difficulties: one is that the well-defined (source domain) and new (target domain) datasets are with different feature distributions; another one is the fact that insufficient or no labelled data in target domain significantly reduce the accuracy of fault diagnosis. As a novel idea, deep transfer learning (DTL) is created to perform learning in the target domain by leveraging information from the relevant source domain.

Infant cry analysis is a suitable noninvasive complementary tool to assess the neurologic state of infants particularly important in the case of preterm neonates. This article aims at exploiting differences between full-term and preterm infant cry with robust automatic acoustical analysis and data mining techniques. Study design Twenty-two acoustical parameters are estimated in more than 3000 cry units from cry recordings of 28 full-term and 10 preterm newborns. Methods Feature extraction is performed through the BioVoice dedicated software tool, developed at the Biomedical Engineering Lab, University of Firenze, Italy. Classification and pattern recognition is based on genetic algorithms for the selection of the best attributes. Training is performed comparing four classifiers: Logistic Curve, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest and three different testing options: full training set, 10-fold cross-validation, and 66% split. Results Results show that the best feature set is made up by 10 parameters capable to assess differences between preterm and full-term newborns with about 87% of accuracy. Best results are obtained with the Random Forest method (receiver operating characteristic area, 0.94). Conclusions These 10 cry features might convey important additional information to assist the clinical specialist in the diagnosis and follow-up of possible delays or disorders in the neurologic development due to premature birth in this extremely vulnerable population of patients.

In the transitioning agricultural societies of the world, food security is an essential element of livelihood and economic development with the agricultural sector very often being the major employment factor and income source. Rapid population growth, urbanization, pollution, desertification, soil degradation and climate change pose a variety of threats to a sustainable agricultural development and can be expressed as agricultural vulnerability components. Diverse cropping patterns may help to adapt the agricultural systems to those hazards in terms of increasing the potential yield and resilience to water scarcity. Thus, the quantification of crop diversity using indices like the Simpson Index of Diversity (SID) e.g. through freely available remote sensing data becomes a very important issue. This however requires accurate land use classifications. In this study, the focus is set on the cropping system diversity of garden plots, summer crop fields and orchard plots which are the prevalent agricultural systems in the test area of the Fergana Valley in Uzbekistan. In order to improve the accuracy of land use classification algorithms with low or medium resolution data, a novel processing chain through the hitherto unique fusion of optical and SAR data from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 platforms is proposed. The combination of both sensors is intended to enhance the object\u00b4s textural and spectral signature rather than just to enhance the spatial context through pansharpening. It could be concluded that the Ehlers fusion algorithm gave the most suitable results. Based on the derived image fusion different object-based image classification algorithms such as SVM, Naive Bayesian and Random Forest were evaluated whereby the latter one achieved the highest classification accuracy.

The important feature of SDN is its centralized control plane which manages the entire network. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is the most popular cyber attack which results in exhaustion of the system resources, thus resulting in non-availability of the services to serve legitimate requests. SDN controller is highly vulnerable to DDoS attacks due to its centralized nature. Thus, detection of the DDoS attacks in the controller at the earliest is an important research issue. Many techniques are proposed to detect DDoS attacks. However, very few studies have been carried out in the context of SDN. In this work, we propose DDoS attack detection system for SDN using two levels of security. We first detect signature based attacks using Snort. Further, we use machine learning algorithms to detect anomaly based attacks.

CRFs-based method was proven with higher accuracy from different measures. The tasks of feature-level opinion mining usually include the extraction of product entities from consumer reviews, the identification of opinion words that are associated with the entities, and the determining of these opinions' polarities (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral). In recent years, two major approaches have been proposed to determine opinions at the feature level: model based methods such as the one based on lexicalized Hidden Markov Model (L-HMMs), and statistical methods like the association rule mining based technique. However, little work has compared these algorithms regarding their practical abilities in identifying various types of review elements, such as features, opinions, intensifiers, entity phrases and infrequent entities. On the other hand, little attentions has been paid to applying more discriminative learning models to accomplish these opinion mining tasks. In this paper, we not only experimentally compared these methods based on a real-world review dataset, but also in particular adopted the Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model and evaluated its performance in comparison with related algorithms. Moreover, for CRFs-based mining algorithm, we tested the role of a self-tagging process in two automatic training conditions, and further identified the ideal combination of learning functions to optimize its learning performance.

GL-Net consists of two network structures including a Generator and a Discriminator. In the Generator, we use skip connection to promote the fusion of low-level feature information and high-level feature information, which alleviates the difficulty of restoring detailed feature information during upsampling, and reduces the downsampling factor, effectively alleviating excessive feature information loss. In the loss function, we add the L ::: 1 ::: distance function and the cross-entropy function to prevent the mode collapse when the model is trained, which makes the segmentation result more accurate. We use transfer learning and data augmentation to alleviate the problem of insufficient data and over-fitting of the model during training. Finally, GL-Net was verified on DRISHTI-GS1 dataset.

A preprocessing stages using image processing to prepare the fruit images dataset to reduce their color index is presented. The fruit image features is then extracted. Finally, the fruit classification process is adopted using random forests (RF), which is a recently developed machine learning algorithm.

In this work, security is provided by following process: (i) Initial Authentication process, (ii) Classification of packets, and (iii) Switch migration process. Initial authentication is performed at Access Point (AP) for each user by Secure ID based Authentication (SIA) scheme. The suspected packets are detected in controller and classified at Virtual Network Function (VNF). For packet classification, the optimal packet features are selected using Genetic Algorithm with Correlation (GAC) based feature selection algorithm. We have proposed a Radial Basis Function with Extreme Learning Machine (RBF-ELM) classifier. Then, the malicious packets are dropped at VNF and normal packets are redirected to destination address through controller. To mitigate flow table overloading attack, we have presented an Enhanced Artificial Bee Colony (EABC) algorithm in controller.

Images of the modality with a lower complexity are synthesized first, and the counterparts with a higher complexity are generated later. Our sequential GAN is trained end-to-end in a semi-supervised manner. In supervised training, the joint distribution of bi-modality images are learned from real paired images of the two modalities by explicitly minimizing the reconstruction losses between the real and synthetic images.

Among the components composing an LCD, the backlight module is one of the most important components because it provides a uniform light source for the display. In the current practice of backlight module inspection, a luminance colorimeter is used to examine the luminance emitted from selected areas called check points within the backlight module. Since a backlight module consists of many check points, it takes too much time to inspect one backlight module in the current practice. In this paper, we propose a fast luminance inspector that uses a CCD camera to inspect multiple backlight modules, simultaneously. The inspection speed is improved considerably, and thus, makes the proposed system suitable for use in the production line. The proposed system translates image intensities of all check points into luminance values based on a multiple kernel support vector regression model (MKSVR). The parameters of multiple kernel functions are automatically generated, according to the data distribution characteristics of the training samples. Compared with other studies using a grid search or a heuristic search algorithm to determine optimal kernel parameters, the proposed approach is more flexible and faster. Besides that, as the kernel parameters are adaptive to the training data, the proposed method could make its learning more specific to certain golden training samples. Other methods using learning algorithms such as the neural network and the SVR do not have such flexibility, because in these learning algorithms all training samples are treated equally. The flexible learning property makes the proposed system more appealing for use in the real practical world. Compared with other methods using the neural network model and the SVR model in backlight module inspection, the proposed method is superior in both the accuracy and the training time required.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCPMT.2014.2329503", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2319321155", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["202966913", "62129332", "109517919", "40859066", "207679013", "45430371", "16523365", "122913848", "18637820", "39556701", "96626161", "109285926", "2069711", "15884165", "121571761", "22374208", "28212770", "37891107", "18876222", "12750435", "120679916", "623918", "12813617", "16354989", "7766374", "437835", "93196", "8172552", "1170314", "427797", "1105637", "5996185", "6343174", "7805843", "117643475", "577580", "1446350", "961425", "6256522", "206722908"], "inbound_citations": ["14199494", "56090140"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25984290"}

According to the current literature, this kind of investigation has rarely been conducted. The Hyrcanian forest area (Iran) is selected as the case study. For this purpose, a total of 149 sample plots for the study area were documented through fieldwork. Using the imagery, three datasets were generated including the Sentinel-2A dataset, the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dataset, and the combination of the Sentinel-2A dataset and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dataset (Sentinel-ALOS). Because the accuracy of the AGB estimation is dependent on the method used, in this research, four machine learning techniques were selected and compared, namely Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MPL Neural Nets), and Gaussian Processes (GP). The performance of these AGB models was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE). The results showed that the AGB models derived from the combination of the Sentinel-2A and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data had the highest accuracy, followed by models using the Sentinel-2A dataset and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dataset. Among the four machine learning models, the SVR model (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 38.68, and MAE = 32.28) had the highest prediction accuracy, followed by the GP model (R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 40.11, and MAE = 33.69), the RF model (R2 = 0.62, RMSE = 43.13, and MAE = 35.83), and the MPL Neural Nets model (R2 = 0.44, RMSE = 64.33, and MAE = 53.74). Overall, the Sentinel-2A imagery provides a reasonable result while the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 imagery provides a poor result of the forest AGB estimation. The combination of the Sentinel-2A imagery and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 imagery improved the estimation accuracy of AGB compared to that of the Sentinel-2A imagery only.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs10020172", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2789665835", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["153672860", "23541992", "11976308", "16444970", "97040120", "128399891", "130035094", "3619259", "54605991", "7818165", "55879687", "15502550", "36432526", "15582056", "129357296", "129765031", "29236984", "20425095", "9948325", "1860049", "53328030", "11793502", "130528466", "124961460", "133805707", "126127225", "39571501", "133536071", "124499548", "13861754", "129918778", "29654256", "130259467", "132760869", "123057589", "13297391", "130747334", "62564176", "128619277", "133358670", "18098865", "128694701", "89141", "3626971", "132993057", "27545358", "123476171", "5042366", "49360472", "743542", "15480929", "130129453", "110606368", "205708112", "2976342", "2357415", "7138354", "131577221", "15971997", "17944196", "128366144", "3181326", "129746635", "132584163", "60577818", "133516531", "84768574", "129583586", "120627377", "54002214", "131215211", "132497978", "1430472", "84386878", "140156374", "123118384", "125969108", "15943670", "32002243", "86407976", "13582531", "13901680", "85905064", "42252139", "140657176", "119616439", "177575726", "131145256", "46281349", "33824754", "131312895", "55716593", "588160"], "inbound_citations": ["210843074", "134988575", "52053299", "13663450", "51958473", "52445178", "135416868", "199373998", "59410593", "69416945", "60442743", "60442725", "201195262", "125166372", "134960434", "51965530", "165048117", "91969229", "52935933", "116025387", "208224737", "150383420", "96428376", "60442702", "85496606", "210846054", "109103199", "209333085", "60442998", "174800815", "60442863", "208787997", "209512584", "91664725", "198441691", "210703110"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4042499"}

Early detection and early treatment can reduce breast cancer mortality. Studies have shown that breast cancer microcalcifications is one of the important clinical manifestations of early breast cancer, and sometimes even the only manifestation. When the mammography image shows typical malignant microcalcification, it can be diagnosed as breast cancer without any other signs of malignancy. In the aided diagnosis of microcalcifications, it is a crucial step to automatically find and locate regions of interest containing microcalcifications. However, the existing feature extraction method for microcalcifications only extracts features in the time domain or wavelet domain, and does not completely represent all the information of the region of interest. An extraction method based on the combination of Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) and texture features is proposed in the paper. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: First, the processing operations including denoising, enhancement, and edge detection were performed on mammograms. Sub-image segmentation is then performed. DTCWT features and texture features are extracted for each sub-image.DTCWT features are combined with texture features, and then genetic algorithm is used for feature optimization. The features are classified by the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to achieve rapid detection and automatic extraction of ROI with microcalcifications. The experimental results verify that the feature model proposed in this paper has the highest detection rate for ROI regions. The ROI region extracted by the proposed feature model was used as subsequent experimental data. Three different methods were used to detect the microcalcifications, including Top-hat, wavelet transform, and methods combining Top-Hat and wavelet transform. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The method was applied to 100 mammograms from the mammograms database of women in Northeast China. In the automatic extraction of ROI, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive accuracy and negative accuracy of the proposed model combined with DTCWT were 95.92%, 96.71%, 92.20%, 93.65%, 96.33%, respectively. When the Top-hat algorithm was used for microcalcifications detection, the sensitivity reached 89.6%, and the false positive detection rate was 2.6. When the wavelet transform algorithm was used for microcalcifications detection, the sensitivity was 91.1%, and the false positive detection rate was 3.28. When the combined algorithm was used for microcalcifications detection, the sensitivity was 86.7%, and the false positive detection rate decreased to 1.35. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The proposed model combined with DTCWT features achieves better result in the automatic extraction of ROI. Moreover, in the subsequent detection of microcalcifications based on three methods, the three methods achieved better results in sensitivity and false positive detection rate, respectively.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31985483", "doi": "10.3233/XST-190583", "venue": "Journal of X-ray science and technology", "journal": "Journal of X-ray science and technology", "mag_id": "3001310211", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210922624"}

In this paper we use ground truth data sets that we have recently constructed to explore different model structures and parameter learning techniques. To estimate parameters in Markov random fields (MRFs) via maximum likelihood one usually needs to perform approximate probabilistic inference. Conditional random fields (CRFs) are discriminative versions of traditional MRFs. We explore a number of novel CRF model structures including a CRF for stereo matching with an explicit occlusion model. CRFs require expensive inference steps for each iteration of optimization and inference is particularly slow when there are many discrete states. We explore belief propagation, variational message passing and graph cuts as inference methods during learning and compare with learning via pseudolikelihood. To accelerate approximate inference we have developed a new method called sparse variational message passing which can reduce inference time by an order of magnitude with negligible loss in quality. Learning using sparse variational message passing improves upon previous approaches using graph cuts and allows efficient learning over large data sets when energy functions violate the constraints imposed by graph cuts.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11263-010-0385-z", "venue": "International Journal of Computer Vision", "journal": "International Journal of Computer Vision", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2127856808", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["124964830", "24729372", "62275524", "632396", "3177797", "1178212", "2430892", "118365442", "982", "37755514", "13081525", "6518359", "122598442", "8443372", "2073260", "8616813", "2457778", "8197484", "53303132", "38521838", "237546", "118162411", "207251944", "277918", "14259804", "16462148", "7382248", "13154466", "207745496", "9766024", "2517062", "124906728", "7495827", "10401733", "12943282", "6038991", "1210309", "62132164", "10387823", "5590613", "1978101", "118671129", "492441", "10007532", "61365805", "8238399", "17663928", "12000409", "5416971", "7950005", "19427081", "121439686", "8272677", "38469023", "6848315"], "inbound_citations": ["123739", "30732208", "4606944"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18355221"}

ILP has produced intelligible solutions for a wide variety of domains where it has been applied. The ILP lack of efficiency is, however, a major impediment for its scalability to applications requiring large amounts of data. In this paper we address important issues that must be solved to make ILP scalable to applications of knowledge extraction in large amounts of data. The issues include: efficiency and storage requirements. We propose and evaluate a set of techniques, globally called lazy evaluation of examples, to improve the efficiency of ILP systems. Lazy evaluation is essentially a way to avoid or postpone the evaluation of the generated hypotheses (coverage tests).

In this paper, a novel cloud detection method is proposed for multispectral remote sensing images from Landsat 8. Firstly, the color composite image of Bands 6, 3 and 2 is divided into superpixel sub-regions through Simple Linear Iterative Cluster (SLIC) method. Then, a two-step superpixel classification strategy is used to predict each superpixel as cloud or non-cloud. Thirdly, a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is used to refine the cloud detection result, and accurate cloud borders are obtained. In the two-step superpixel classification strategy, the bright and thick cloud superpixels, as well as the obvious non-cloud superpixels, are firstly separated from potential cloud superpixels through a threshold function, which greatly speeds up the detection. The designed double-branch PCA Network (PCANet) architecture can extract the high-level information of cloud, then combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, the potential superpixels are correctly classified. Visual and quantitative comparison experiments are conducted on the Landsat 8 Cloud Cover Assessment (L8 CCA) dataset; the results indicate that our proposed method can accurately detect clouds under different conditions, which is more effective and robust than the compared state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs10060877", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2806480185", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62539091", "122693950", "206909951", "125400934", "129688931", "129445776", "10596078", "25175439", "128745249", "129846678", "16963527", "22924507", "38597548", "32135351", "62634806", "129012954", "42431268", "38165448", "17756906", "129909424", "49620297", "140613899", "21889416", "21270287", "6885058", "140709539", "1491049", "14103006", "2665874", "27203403", "29205928", "31455842", "31382596", "207763512", "14124313", "206594692", "241913", "3336980", "206911713", "9311682", "1806278", "5574079", "206725404", "19749805", "206769720", "1302462", "10171607", "4663816", "3429309"], "inbound_citations": ["146019293", "134699452", "202775475", "210911483", "210701574", "209048350", "207852636", "204913635", "211123410", "211009307", "208028647", "132532614"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51957333"}

Recognizing the current context of a user or device, that is, the situation in which some action happens, often requires dealing with data from different sensors, and thus different domains. The Growing Neural Gas algorithm is a classification algorithm especially designed for un-supervised learning of unknown input distributions; a variation, the Lifelong Growing Neural Gas (LLGNG), is well suited for arbitrary long periods of learning, as its internal parameters are self-adaptive. These features are ideal for automatically classifying sensor data to recognize user or device context. However, as most classification algorithms, in its standard form it is only suitable for numerical input data. Many sensors which are available on current information appliances are nominal or ordinal in type, making their use difficult. Additionally, the automatically created clusters are usually too fine-grained to distinguish user-context on an application level.

Largely owing to this reputation, they have found broad application in driver assistance and highly automated driving systems. However, radar sensors have considerably lower precision than cameras. Low sensor precision causes ambiguity in the human interpretation of the measurement data and makes the data labeling process difficult and expensive. On the other hand, without a large amount of high-quality labeled training data, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ensure that the supervised machine learning models can predict, classify, or otherwise analyze the phenomenon of interest with the required accuracy. This paper presents a method for fusing the radar sensor measurements with the camera images. A proposed fully-unsupervised machine learning algorithm converts the radar sensor data to artificial, camera-like, environmental images. Through such data fusion, the algorithm produces more consistent, accurate, and useful information than that provided solely by the radar or the camera.

In particular, whether the hidden pattern can be truly mined from minority class is still a largely unanswered question after all it contains limited instances.

The second stage makes use of the generative adversarial networks to simultaneously generate instances according to the learnt class distributions and mine the discriminative structure among classes to train the final classifier.

{"paper_id": "61576180", "title": "Recent advances in multi-task QSAR modeling for drug design", "authors": [{"first": "Amit", "middle": ["Kumar"], "last": "Halder", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Mohammad", "middle": [], "last": "Goodarzi", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Computer-aided drug design may provide a massive scope to reduce the overall duration as well as the expenditure associated with drug discovery. Although the concept of Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) is almost fifty years old, it is still considered as a very useful method for finding novel therapeutic agents. In the last decade, the field of QSAR has witnessed great advances in terms of techniques, ideas and approaches. 3 Multi-task QSAR is one such approach that has a huge opportunity to contribute in the discovery of novel therapeutic agents. Classical QSAR techniques focus on the classical idea that one drug is aimed to act on one target. However, due to the highly complex and multi-factorial nature of some diseases like cancer, microbial infections, neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, the classical idea of drug development frequently produces less satisfying effects. The effect of the inhibition of one specific target is compensated by different back-up or fail-safe mechanisms. Polypharmacology focuses on the concept of simultaneous inhibition of multiple targets by single therapeutic agents. Contrary to single target drugs that bind with a specific target with high affinity, multi-target agents are low affinity binders. Therefore, management of therapy is easier for the multi-target agents. Multi-task QSAR techniques are able to incorporate the ideas of polypharmacology. While conventional QSAR techniques are based on the datasets of compounds with a single target and same or similar assay conditions, multi-task QSAR can consider data on multiple targets and various assay conditions at a time. In addition, multi-task QSAR techniques are also useful to address the problems of fewer datapoints. QSAR is a statistical technique and a higher amount of data-points generates more reliable models. However, for several diseases the availability of a data is less and developed models on the available data may not be able to provide detailed insight into structural requirements of the molecules for higher potency. As multi-task QSAR models may be developed on the data collected from different assay conditions, more information may be retrieved for the explanation of structural patterns. Therefore, multi-task QSAR has emerged as one of the most essential tools in the last few years and various groups of researchers participated in the development of multi-task QSAR models. Though conventional 2D QSAR techniques have found several alternatives such as 3D QSAR, pharmacophore mapping as well as molecular docking, 2D-QSAR is unique in handling problems of multi-task modeling. Multi-task QSAR has been utilized for the developing models for anti-cancer, anti-bacterial 17 and neuroprotective agents. In addition, reports on multi-target modeling on kinase and ubiquitineproteosome pathways are also found. Furthermore, multi-task agents are also useful for understanding structural patterns required for toxicities of nanoparticles, environmental pollutants etc. Although development of multi-task QSAR model is quite similar to conventional modeling as far as descriptor calculation and model generation are concerned, the construction and management of a dataset is quite different. In most of the cases, classification models are generated with the data by suitable machine learning tools such as Linear Discriminant Analyses (LDA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) etc. Generally, a specific cut-off value for each system is fixed by the user to classify the data into \u2018sensitive, and \u2018non-sensitive\u2019. Sometimes special statistical treatments, like averaging the descriptor values for specific system and calculation of moving average, are required for handling the complicated data. Some attempts were taken to develop regression based multi-target models.

Automatic MCE perfusion quantification is challenging and requires accurate segmentation of the myocardium from noisy and time-varying images. Random forests (RF) have been successfully applied to many medical image segmentation tasks. However, the pixel-wise RF classifier ignores contextual relationships between label outputs of individual pixels. RF which only utilizes local appearance features is also susceptible to data suffering from large intensity variations. In this paper, we demonstrate how to overcome the above limitations of classic RF by presenting a fully automatic segmentation pipeline for myocardial segmentation in full-cycle 2-D MCE data. Specifically, a statistical shape model is used to provide shape prior information that guide the RF segmentation in two ways. First, a novel shape model (SM) feature is incorporated into the RF framework to generate a more accurate RF probability map. Second, the shape model is fitted to the RF probability map to refine and constrain the final segmentation to plausible myocardial shapes. We further improve the performance by introducing a bounding box detection algorithm as a preprocessing step in the segmentation pipeline. Our approach on 2-D image is further extended to 2-D+t sequences which ensures temporal consistency in the final sequence segmentations.

In contrast to humans, where IAVs infect the respiratory tract and cause significant morbidity and mortality, IAVs infect the gastrointestinal tract of waterfowl and cause little or no pathology and are spread by fecal-oral transmission. For this reason, we examined whether IAV infection is associated with differences in the cloacal microbiome of mallards ( Anas platyrhyncos ), an important host of IAVs in North America and Eurasia. We characterized bacterial community composition by sequencing the V4 region of 16S rRNA genes. IAV-positive mallards had lower species diversity, richness, and evenness than IAV-negative mallards. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) cooccurrence patterns were also distinct depending on infection status. Network analysis showed that IAV-positive mallards had fewer significant cooccurring OTUs and exhibited fewer coassociation patterns among those OTUs than IAV-negative mallards. These results suggest that healthy mallards have a more robust and complex cloacal microbiome. By combining analytical approaches, we identified 41 bacterial OTUs, primarily representatives of Streptococcus spp., Veillonella dispar , and Rothia mucilaginosa , contributing to the observed differences. This study found that IAV-infected wild mallards exhibited strong differences in microbiome composition relative to noninfected mallards and identified a concise set of putative biomarker OTUs. Using Random Forest, a supervised machine learning method, we verified that these 41 bacterial OTUs are highly predictive of infection status. IMPORTANCE Seasonal influenza causes 3 to 5 million severe illnesses and 250,000 to 500,000 human deaths each year. While pandemic influenza viruses emerge only periodically, they can be devastating\u2014for example, the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus killed more than 20 million people. IAVs infect the respiratory tract and cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans. In contrast, IAVs infect the gastrointestinal tract of waterfowl, producing little pathology. Recent studies indicated that viruses can alter the microbiome at the respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosa, but there are no reports of how the microbiota of the natural host of influenza is affected by infection. Here we find that the mallard microbiome is altered during IAV infection. Our results suggest that detailed examination of humans and animals infected with IAVs may reveal individualized microbiome profiles that correspond to health and disease. Moreover, future studies should explore whether the altered microbiome facilitates maintenance and transmission of IAVs in waterfowl populations.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5347185", "pubmed_id": "28293681", "doi": "10.1128/mSystems.00188-16", "venue": "mSystems", "journal": "mSystems", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2593868894", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13791797", "34477007", "471267", "3771458", "15738647", "25947571", "15660228", "6551830", "5003644", "35210964", "205490916", "7612401", "134429", "206559843", "1064301", "5903758", "7147190", "15267415", "11631215", "82778412", "334423", "14123651", "125998259", "10659969", "15239295", "2345474", "8850582", "11001567", "19143230", "19002832", "8869969", "86445449", "24023421", "30486995", "27073710", "215634966", "17730724", "205277541", "32942576", "5068928", "20821393", "11906282", "32444754", "215605114", "8416531", "15996046", "16050699", "38435173", "25432360", "15895420", "39380967", "14153869", "5141626", "1482017", "18191380"], "inbound_citations": ["201116909", "53721162", "202742184", "215445555", "214941484", "104296466", "102354979", "215489389", "37173142", "51874619", "212567245", "90387594"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14321093"}

Firefly luciferase is commonly used as a reporter to monitor the effect of chemical compounds on the activity of a specific target or pathway in HTS. However, the false positive rate of luciferase-based HTS is relatively high because many artifacts or promiscuous compounds that have direct interaction with the luciferase reporter enzyme are usually identified as active compounds (hits). Therefore, it is necessary to develop a rapid screening method to identify these compounds that can inhibit the luciferase activity directly. In this study, a virtual screening (VS) classification model called MIEC-GBDT (MIEC: Molecular Interaction Energy Components; GBDT: Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) was developed to distinguish luciferase inhibitors from non-inhibitors. The MIECs calculated by Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) free energy decomposition were used to energetically characterize the binding pattern of each small molecule at the active site of luciferase, and then the GBDT algorithm was employed to construct the classifiers based on MIECs. The predictions to the test set show that the optimized MIEC-GBDT model outperformed molecular docking and MM/GBSA rescoring. The best MIEC-GBDT model based on the MIECs with the energy terms of \u0394Gele, \u0394GvdW, \u0394GGB, and \u0394GSA achieves the prediction accuracies of 87.2% and 90.3% for the inhibitors and non-inhibitors in the test sets, respectively. Moreover, the energetic analysis of the vital residues suggests that the energetic contributions of the vital residues to the binding of inhibitors are quite different from those to the binding of non-inhibitors.

However, about 25% of extubated infants will fail and require re-intubation which is also associated with a 5-fold increase in mortality and a longer stay in the intensive care unit. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to determine the optimal time for extubation that will minimize the duration of MV and maximize the chances of success.

However, the highly dynamic topology and distributed nature of vehicular networks exposes the vehicular traffic to higher security risks. To address these challenges, in this paper, \"Sec-IoV\", a multi-stage model for anomaly detection is specifically proposed for securing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in IoV setups. The proposed anomaly detection model comprises of multiple stages: (a) relevant feature set selection, (b) optimization of Support Vector Machine (SVM) parameters, and (c) classification of vehicular traffic into benign and anomalous. The first two stages are expressed using the multi-objective optimization problems, which are iteratively computed using the hybridization of a meta-heuristic approach \"Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Optimization\" with a Cauchy based mutation operator. This coupling is referred to as \"C-ABC\". It improves the local search capability of the optimizer with faster convergence. The last stage of data classification is then performed by employing SVM with a refined set of parameters.

In these datasets, some urban areas appear oriented about the radar line of sight (LOS) while some areas appear non-oriented. In this study, roll invariant polarimetric SAR decomposition parameters were used to classify these urban areas. Random Forest (RF), which is an ensemble decision tree learning technique, was used in this study. RF performs parameter subset selection as a part of its classification procedure. In this study, parameter subsets were obtained and analyzed to infer scattering mechanisms useful for urban area classification. The Cloude\u2013Pottier \u03b1 , the Touzi dominant scattering amplitude \u03b1 s 1 and the anisotropy A were among the top six important parameters selected for both the datasets. However, it was observed that these parameters were ranked differently for the two datasets. The urban area classification using RF was compared with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) for both the datasets. RF outperforms SVM by 4% and MLC by 12% in Dataset 1. It also outperforms SVM and MLC by 3.5% and 11% respectively in Dataset 2.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2015.08.007", "venue": "Int.

One solution to domain adaptation is to learn domain invariant feature representations while the learned representations should also be discriminative in prediction. To learn such representations, domain adaptation frameworks usually include a domain invariant representation learning approach to measure and reduce the domain discrepancy, as well as a discriminator for classification. Inspired by Wasserstein GAN, in this paper we propose a novel approach to learn domain invariant feature representations, namely Wasserstein Distance Guided Representation Learning (WDGRL). WDGRL utilizes a neural network, denoted by the domain critic, to estimate empirical Wasserstein distance between the source and target samples and optimizes the feature extractor network to minimize the estimated Wasserstein distance in an adversarial manner. The theoretical advantages of Wasserstein distance for domain adaptation lie in its gradient property and promising generalization bound. Empirical studies on common sentiment and image classification adaptation datasets demonstrate that our proposed WDGRL outperforms the state-of-the-art domain invariant representation learning approaches.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1707.01217", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "AAAI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2770645414,2953099328,2963777311", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18126905", "63308791", "10686834", "2269542", "6600989", "6161478", "4974063", "357078", "18137952", "12453047", "15019934"], "inbound_citations": ["196177586", "204915918", "211677492", "203605666", "204837873", "212718086", "204961274", "208211648", "201318519", "202688761", "169038473", "212413564", "13751762", "202565457", "212644576", "202539306", "203605183", "213318154", "212726143", "204837517", "198967790", "86730738", "150369467", "207756774", "53225469", "182952306", "59553627", "204824001", "198898096", "198897530", "202233151", "52816759", "214713436", "209515913", "128359076", "199005021", "4331539", "207852351", "210473228", "199512013", "52289556", "52008853", "52178689", "210932550", "211146545", "201655443", "210165090", "59316632", "207847753", "201641696", "207847706", "212747855", "197545053", "214714362", "208031414", "198161426", "53291502", "211106358", "211010607", "203658285", "211210171", "59413771", "53226609", "199442206", "174800461", "209459335", "210839653", "91184071", "57189500", "3654323", "196194576", "67876975", "204873141", "102353896", "214714416", "53208140", "208291120", "58588119", "197935501", "198131641", "209320378"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3861990"}

Microarrays can help us diagnose different types of cancers, understand biological processes, assess host responses to drugs and pathogens, find markers for specific diseases, and much more. Microarray experiments generate large amounts of data. Thus, effective data processing and analysis are critical for making reliable inferences from the data. ::: The first part of dissertation addresses the problem of finding an optimal set of genes (biomarkers) to classify a set of samples as diseased or normal. Three statistical gene selection methods (GS, GS-NR, and GS-PCA) were developed to identify a set of genes that best differentiate between samples. A comparative study on different classification tools was performed and the best combinations of gene selection and classifiers for multi-class cancer classification were identified. For most of the benchmarking cancer data sets, the gene selection method proposed in this dissertation, GS, outperformed other gene selection methods. The classifiers based on Random Forests, neural network ensembles, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) showed consistently god performance. A striking commonality among these classifiers is that they all use a committee-based approach, suggesting that ensemble classification methods are superior. ::: The same biological problem may be studied at different research labs and/or performed using different lab protocols or samples. In such situations, it is important to combine results from these efforts. The second part of the dissertation addresses the problem of pooling the results from different independent experiments to obtain improved results. Four statistical pooling techniques (Fisher inverse chi-square method, Logit method. Stouffer's Z transform method, and Liptak-Stouffer weighted Z-method) were investigated in this dissertation. These pooling techniques were applied to the problem of identifying cell cycle-regulated genes in two different yeast species. As a result, improved sets of cell cycle-regulated genes were identified. The last part of dissertation explores the effectiveness of wavelet data transforms for the task of clustering.

Regardless of the inclusion of dynamic items, all risk measures rarely exceed .75 in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (Hanley & McNeil, 1982). This may reflect the emphasis of multiple regression equations on main effects of a few key variables tapping long-term anti-social potential. Connectionist models, not used in criminal justice, represent a promising alternative means of combining predictors given their ability to model interactions automatically. To promote learning from other fields a systematic review of the literature on the application of connectionist models to operational data is presented. Lessons were then taken forward in the development of a connectionist model suitable for the present data which comprised fields from the Offender Assessment System (OASys) (Home Office, 2002) relating to 4,048 offenders subject to probation supervision. Included in the items for modelling was the Offender Group Reconviction Scale (OGRS) (Copas & Marshall, 1998; Taylor, 1999). Combining static and dynamic items using conventional statistical methods showed a maximum cross-validated AUC of .82. Using the connectionist model however a substantial increase in accuracy was observed, AUC=.98, and this largely maintained when variations in time to recidivism were controlled. Variation to model parameters suggested that performance linked to the resources in the middle layer, responsible for modelling rare patterns and interactions between items. Model pruning confirmed that while the connectionist model exploited a wide range of variables in its classification decisions, the linear model was affected mainly by OGRS and a limited number of other variables. Results are discussed in terms of the theoretical and practical benefits of developing the use of connectionist models for better incorporating individuals\u2019 dynamic risk and protective factors in recidivism assessments, and reducing the costs associated with false classifications.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1543447843", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:142688695"}

While existing transfer learning research has primarily focused on vector-based data, in which the instances are assumed to be independent and identically distributed, how to effectively transfer knowledge across different information networks has not been well studied, mainly because networks may have their distinct node features and link relationships between nodes. In this paper, we propose a new transfer learning algorithm that attempts to transfer common latent structure features across the source and target networks. The proposed algorithm discovers these latent features by constructing label propagation matrices in the source and target networks, and mapping them into a shared latent feature space. The latent features capture common structure patterns shared by two networks, and serve as domain-independent features to be transferred between networks. Together with domain-dependent node features, we thereafter propose an iterative classification algorithm that leverages label correlations to predict node labels in the target network. Experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can successfully achieve knowledge transfer between networks to help improve the accuracy of classifying nodes in the target network.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": "1403.2484", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2013.116", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2030252673", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62016134", "740063", "8153773", "17429744", "5984940", "2983039", "179152", "430887", "281573", "7467441", "1052837", "124234335", "116930672", "508435", "2095855", "165018"], "inbound_citations": ["600954", "50770814", "202539306", "202542835", "20032964", "208158334", "9741552", "18843561", "211146545", "12689693"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8322951"}

Although current convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches perform well when detecting normal objects, they are barely suitable for detecting small ones. Two practical problems stand in their way. First, current CNN-based approaches are not specifically designed for the minuscule size of small targets (~15 or ~10 pixels in extent). Second, no well-established data sets include labeled small targets and establishing one from scratch is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address these two issues, we propose an approach that combines Sig-NMS-based Faster R-CNN with transfer learning. Sig-NMS replaces traditional non-maximum suppression (NMS) in the stage of region proposal network and decreases the possibility of missing small targets. Transfer learning can effectively label remote sensing images by automatically annotating both object classes and object locations. We conduct an experiment on three data sets of VHR optical remote sensing images, RSOD, LEVIR, and NWPU VHR-10, to validate our approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively detect small targets in the VHR optical remote sensing images of about $10\\times 10$ pixels and automatically label small targets as well.

One of the main problems of AD is the loss of language skills. This paper presents a computational framework for classifying AD patients compared to healthy control subjects using information from spontaneous speech signals. Spontaneous speech data are obtained from 30 AD patients and 30 healthy controls. Because of the nonlinear and dynamic nature of speech signals, higher order spectral features (specifically bispectrum) were used for analysis. Four classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Na\u00efve Bayes and Decision tree) were used to classify subjects into three different levels of AD and healthy group based on their performance in terms of the HOS-based features. Ten-fold cross-validation method was used to test the reliability of the classifier results. The results showed that the proposed method had a good potential in AD diagnosis.

For instance, identifying structurally equivalent nodes can provide insight into the structure of complex networks. Learning latent representations that capture such structural role information about nodes has recently gained a lot of attention.

In this paper, we propose SEGK, a powerful framework for computing structural node representations. SEGK learns node representations by generating (or approximating) and decomposing a kernel matrix that incorporates structural similarity between nodes. To compute the similarity between two nodes, the proposed framework builds on well-established concepts from graph mining. Specifically, it compares the neighborhood subgraphs of increasing size of two nodes using graph kernels. SEGK is very flexible, and besides unlabeled graphs, it can also handle node-labeled and node-attributed graphs.

Here, we demonstrate a quantum machine learning algorithm on a four-qubit NMR test bench to solve an optical character recognition problem, also known as the handwriting recognition. The quantum machine learns standard character fonts and then recognize handwritten characters from a set with two candidates. To our best knowledge, this is the first artificial intelligence realized on a quantum processor. Due to the widespreading importance of artificial intelligence and its tremendous consuming of computational resources, quantum speedup would be extremely attractive against the challenges from the Big Data.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25910101", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.140504", "venue": "Physical review letters", "journal": "Physical review letters", "mag_id": "1529944915", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202889170", "55027565", "871514", "211572985", "53662569", "59944009", "166228520", "53455833", "3289847", "86592544", "201070845", "189953788", "119233323", "64536201", "119205332", "202565838", "202893689", "213175689", "51680990", "214693057", "215241119", "182953159", "189898199", "55032913", "209531729"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26617018"}

By providing rich spectral information from its hyperspectral images (HSI), this technology offers reliable recognition and classification of the objects in the Earth. The present conventional technologies consider only the s spectral and spatial features of the captured images, however, hyperspectral remote sensing technology operates with the high dimensions of hyperspectral images that ultimately results in termination of information retrieval. This redundancy is often more higher is in spatial-spectral domain thus requiring large number of training data for accurate modeling of the classifier. Hence in this technology, to get an accurate classification rate, the complementary properties of the different features of the images are taken into account and joined. Moreover, a multiple feature selection algorithm is proposed in this work to choose the essential features thus avoiding the problem of feature domain selection problem thus overcoming the problem of the dimensionality reduction. The exact objective of this work is to propose a novel dimensionality and multiple feature selection algorithms called FA-KLD-LFDA. In this method, dimensionality reduction is effectively carried out in a raw spectral-spatial feature domain using Firefly Algorithm (FA) with Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) for multiple feature selection and Local-Fisher\u2019s Discriminant Analysis (LFDA) for feature projection. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier follows these analysis with specific constraints. The experimental data along with the classification results implies that this novel method works exceptionally well than that of the conventionally followed dimensionality reduction and classification algorithms.

Usually, the weights for the interactions is learnt as a low rank weight matrix, which is formulated as an inner product of two low rank matrices. This low rank can help improve the generalization ability of Factorization Machines. However, to choose the rank properly, it usually needs to run the algorithm for many times using different ranks, which clearly is inefficient for some large-scale datasets. To alleviate this issue, we propose an Adaptive Boosting framework of Factorization Machines (AdaFM), which can adaptively search for proper ranks for different datasets without re-training.

However, several previous studies have indicated that the performance of active learning is easily disrupted by an imbalanced data distribution. Some existing imbalanced active learning approaches also suffer from either low performance or high time consumption. To address these problems, this paper describes an efficient solution based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) classification model, called active online-weighted ELM (AOW-ELM). The main contributions of this paper include: 1) the reasons why active learning can be disrupted by an imbalanced instance distribution and its influencing factors are discussed in detail; 2) the hierarchical clustering technique is adopted to select initially labeled instances in order to avoid the missed cluster effect and cold start phenomenon as much as possible; 3) the weighted ELM (WELM) is selected as the base classifier to guarantee the impartiality of instance selection in the procedure of active learning, and an efficient online updated mode of WELM is deduced in theory; and 4) an early stopping criterion that is similar to but more flexible than the margin exhaustion criterion is presented. The experimental results on 32 binary-class data sets with different imbalance ratios demonstrate that the proposed AOW-ELM algorithm is more effective and efficient than several state-of-the-art active learning algorithms that are specifically designed for the class imbalance scenario.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30137013", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2855446", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2921833330", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["324600", "5933028", "14278367", "18458666", "811269", "6994953", "5739694", "36967060", "2222590", "14293159", "915058", "11610993", "5846986", "9098359", "3205854", "10743717", "31528330", "29600623", "25325475", "8295935", "114844", "8841327", "5449715", "17234861", "1635495", "206988199", "42035698", "14418026", "28920310", "16818283", "116858", "15037168", "26893209", "7028394", "39321012", "12733161", "19903714", "206742563", "2175426", "60266817", "14976896", "27810521", "1519316", "209099422", "8390020", "1288507", "7553535", "7649812"], "inbound_citations": ["212644784", "126842097", "212681734", "133606075", "163164247", "210696420", "199085215", "211298716", "210692092", "215721905", "208217349", "157061483"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52069492"}

The EMS is designed to work with less sophisticated local BTS controller. The prediction (load predictor, PV power generator predictor and blackout duration predictor) modules and the optimization modules are envisioned to be hosted in a server. The optimization module provides optimal battery control policies that are robust against the temporal uncertainty imposed by unknown blackout duration while minimizing the expected DEG fuel cost. The blackout duration predictor is facilitated by combining Linear Logistic Regression classifier and blackout duration frequency distribution. The load predictor utilizes Support Vector Regression for creating predictive models. The optimizer performs a local search over candidate solution space to seek the optimal control policy.

A complex genetic background is likely the basis for AA predisposition; various genetic factors, including HLA, KIR and SNPs in immune response genes, were studied in AA. However, such an empiric approach, despite the rational target selection, is inefficient. SNP array (SNP-A) genotyping technology allows for investigation of complex genetic traits and is a suitable hypothesis-generating technology. We stipulated that application of SNP-A in AA will allow for identification of SNPs in pathogenic loci. We applied the Illumina 12K non-synonymous SNP-A to study 77 AA and ethnically matched controls (ctr; N=60; +170 historical ctr). The power of this technique is demonstrated by our ability to obtain >2.6 million genotypes with a fidelity (against PCR) of 98%. The training set included 64 AA patients and 56 controls. Initially, Exemplar automated analysis was used; due the Bonferroni correction this study underpowered. However, our strategy included ranking SNPs based on their P value, low frequencies of pathogenic genotypes in ctr, and high case/ctr ratio narrowing the selection of potentially informative SNPs to be tested in a validation set. We also applied Random Forests, a nonparametric tree method, whereby all SNP were used multivariately to predict disease association; this method does not relay on Bonferroni correction and more closely reflects complex polygenic traits. Results pointed towards many SNPs recognized by both approaches and a number of SNP was chosen for further analysis. E.g., rs8022805 (GA) in telomerase-associated protein-1 (TEP1) was found in 19% of AA patients but only in 2.7% of controls (N=220, p<.0001). TAP1 is a part of telomerase complex, and various mutations in telomerase machinery were linked to hereditary AA. Similarly, a CG SNP (rs1134648) in chemokine SCYE1 inducible by apoptosis was found in 8% of AA cases vs. 0.003% of ctrs. Given the high frequency of thromboembolic events in patients with PNH clones, an interesting association was that of factor 5 rs6019 SNP for which CG and GG frequencies were 23% and 2% in AA vs. 8% and 0% in ctr, respectively (p=.0009). When we analyzed the AA sub-cohorts based on presence of a PNH clone, we found that rs1079109 and rs753856 in HSP70 gene were significant. HSP70 is up-regulated and inhibits apoptosis in cells stress conditions. The genotype A/G of rs1079109 showed an increased frequency in patients with PNH (46%) and AA/PNH patients (33%) in comparison to both AA (without PNH clone) and normal ctr (6% and 7% respectively p=.001). Similar results were found for the genotype C/G of rs753856 (PNH 46%, AA/PNH 37%, AA 6%, NC 6% p<.0001;N=265). The role of HSP was investigated in AA and several autoimmune diseases. There is evidence that genetic polymorphisms in the HSP70 gene cluster are associated with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity and that upregulation of HSP is a marker of immune-mediated AA responsive to CsA. In conclusion our SNP approach allows for identification of immunogenetic polymorphisms possibly involved in the immune pathophysiology of AA and illustrates application of SNP-A to study AA.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Blood", "mag_id": "2510213373", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:89112950"}
